SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The first concern of government in world affairs
Is to ensure peace and security. To this end, Canada
continues to support the principles of the United
Nations Charter. Our foreign policy is based on the

realities and dangers of the existing situation. One
of these is the Communist menace. Until the United
Nations are able to provide an adequate guarantee
of peace and security, peace-loving nations will
also be obliged to seek security by combining their
strength. The North Atlantic nations, including
Canada, are negotiating a security pact.
The
treaty when concluded will be laid before you for
approval. The North Atlantic Treaty will supplement the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee signed by
the western European nations at Brussels last year.
Such regional arrangements are provided for in
the United Nations Charter.
Despite unsettled conditions and the disruptive
activities of international Communism, the nations
of western Europe are making progress toward
recovery. Aid from North America is contributing
substantially to the restoration of economic activity,
thereby increasing their ability to resist Internal and
external aggression.
At home we have been blessed with good crops.
Industrial expansion Is taking place at an unprecedented rate. There have been few differences between employers and employees leading to stoppages
in work. Inflationary pressures are less pronounced.
Employment is at higher levels than ever before.
In striking contrast with Communist countries, the
free economy of our country Is demonstrating its
ability to provide for all a high standard of living,
social justice and individual freedom. It is the view
of my ministers that a steady advance toward the
goal of social justice for all is an effective safeguard
against the influence of subversive doctrines.
The people of Newfoundland, by a majority vote
In a referendum, expressed their desire to enter
confederation. The precise ternis of union were
subsequently negotiated with an authorized delegation from Newfoundland. You will be asked without
delay to approve the agreement, signed on December 11, and to make provision for the entry of Newfoundland as a province of Canada on March 31. I
am confident the union will be of mutual advantage
to Newfoundland and Canada.
Amendments to the Supreme Court Act to make
the Supreme Court of Canada the court of last
resort for Canada will be submitted for your
consideration.
You will be asked to approve, subject to the
approval of the United States authorities, the agreement concluded in 1941 for the development of
navigation and power in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin.
You will be asked to make the further legislative
provision necessary to implement the agreements for
the sale of agricultural products to the United
Kingdom.
With a view to assisting in the restoration of world
trade, so vital to general security and our own
prosperity, Canada participated in formulating the
chartcr for the International Trade Organization
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which will be submitted for your approval. Within
the next few months Canada will engage in further
negotiations with thirteen other countries to
broaden the scope of the tariff concessions which we
obtained at Geneva in 1947. The government will
continue to press vigorously for the lowering of
tariff and other barriers and, as q'uickly as possible,
the expansion of trade on a multilateral basis.

ments here under circumstances of this kind,
but on this occasion I do so out of my very
great respect for the late Mrs. King. Not all
wives of senators come to Ottawa frequently;
some visit it only once in a while; but our
association with Mrs. King was almost as
close as with the Speaker himself. We have
known our Speaker for many years as an
eminent son of Canada; and because of our
close relationship with him and his wife, it
came as a terrible shock to all of us to learn
on Thursday morning that the call had come
to Mrs. King.
As one who knew her, I respect her
memory very highly, and I hope that my
words today will be some solace to His Honour
when he returns to this house, faced by the
great problem of bereavement and the thought
that the woman whom he trusted and who
counselled him through the years will not be
here to encourage and support him. May
our sympathy help him to bear his burden.

Beaubien.
THE LATE MRS. J. H. KING
TRIBUTES TO HER MEMORY

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson:

Honourable

Senators, when we last met, His Excellency
was opening Parliament,

and the gracious

wife of His Honour the Speaker was in her
usual place on the floor of this chamber.
Shortly afterward, as was her custom, she
received hundreds of guests at the Speaker's
reception, greeting each with a cheery smile,
a kindly word and a sincere and genuine
welcome.
In the intervening period she has passed
from our midst, we have paid our last respects
to her memory, and even as we are gathered
here a transcontinental train is swiftly bearing her remains westward. Soon she will find
her last resting place in the province where
for over forty years she and His Honour the

Speaker lived happily together, sharing each
other's fortunes and misfortunes, and where
she radiated cheerfulness and shed brightness
on all with whom she came in contact.
In due course His Honour the Speaker will
return to continue to preside over our deliberations with his customary grace and dignity.
On his sad journey westward his heart will
be heavy and his loneliness difficult to endure;
but when he returns it may afford him some
small measure of comfort to realize that in
his great sorrow he has the sincere sympathy
of his colleagues in this chamber, and that
they have considered it a privilege and an

honour to have known and to have been associated with Mrs. King and himself.

Economy Committee and as a leading member of the party with which he was associated, he was an outstanding figure. He served
his time and generation well, and he will be
sorely missed in this chamber, which he
adorned and in which he was for so long a
familiar figure.
The Honourable Senator John Alexander
Macdonald, P.C., Cardigan, died on November 15, 1948. He was born at Tracadie,
Prince Edward Island, on April 12, 1874, the
son of John C. and Elizabeth Mary Macdonald, and his early education was completed
at the public schools there. On September
18. 1905, he married Marie J. MacDonald, the
daughter of Joseph MacDonald, of Cardigan,
Prince Edward Island. They had eight
children.
The late senator, prominent in public life
for the past forty years, was equally well
known in business. He was president of the
mercantile and exporting firm of J. A. Macdonald and Company, Limited, of Cardigan;
president of Associated Shippers Incorporated of Charlottetown, and a director of
Island Foods Incorporated. He was elected
to the provincial legislature in the election of
1908, and re-elected to that house in 1911 and
1923. From 1911 to 1916 he was a minister
without portfolio in the Mathieson government, and in 1923 he assumed the portfolio
of Public Works and Highways in the first
Stewart government. In 1925 be resigned
from the provincial government to contest
the federal seat of Kings County, and was
elected to the House of Commons in October
of that year. The following year he became
minister without portfolio in the Meighen
government. He was re-elected to the House
of Commons in 1926 and 1930, and on July 30,
1935, he was summoned to the Senate.
While interested in all matters of public
policy, Senator Macdonald was first and foremost a representative of the agricultural
interests in his native province of Prince
Edward Island. Agriculture has always been
its major industry, and in Senator Macdonald the farmers of the "Garden of the Gulf"
had a faithful friend and champion.
The Honourable John Anthony McDonald,
Shediac, died on December 12, 1948. He was
born on December 24, 1875, the son of
Edward McDonald and Jane Simpson. After
attending the schools at Shediac, the late
senator went to St. Joseph's College at Memramcook, New Brunswick. He continued his
keen interest in educational affairs, and from
1909 to 1911 served on the executive committee of the St. Francis Xavier Alumni
Association, and in 1911 was elected to the
Board of Governors of St. Francis Xavier
University as alumni representative, and
served in that capacity until 1917. In his
business life he was a manufacturer. On

June 20, 1901 he married Alice Todd
Aylward, the daughter of John Aylward.
Six children were born to them, four sons and
two daughters.
Senator McDonald was appointed to the
Senate on February 17, 1921, and served for
a period of twenty-eight years. He was a
faithful attendant at all sittings of the house
and of the committees of which he was a
member.
He was extremely proud of his Scottish
ancestry. Indeed, the last time I spoke to
him, which was shortly before the close of
the last session, he showed me with great
pride an invitation he had received to attend
the Gaelic Mod in St. Ann's, Cape Breton, as
the representative of the McDonalds of New
Brunswick. In due course he attended the
gathering, where he was one of the speakers.
It was perfectly fitting, perhaps, that his last
official appearance should be in connection
with a celebration which was very close to
his heart.
Honourable Donald Sutherland, Oxford,
died on January 1, 1949. He was born on
April 8, 1863, in Zorra Township, Oxford
County, Ontario, the son of Robert Sutherland and Elizabeth Hutchinson. On April 22,
1896 he married Minnie Pearl Hossack of
Zorra Township. They had seven children.
The late senator served as a member of the
township council of North Oxford in 1896,
and following the general election of May 28,
1902, be represented the riding of South
Oxford in the dntario Legislature. In the
general election of January 25, 1905 he was
re-elected as a member of the Ontario Legislature, and on March 10, 1909 he was
appointed Director of Colonization and Immigration for Ontario by the Whitney government. In 1911 he resigned from that position
to successfully contest the South Oxford seat
in the House of Commons. During the special
war session of 1914 the late senator moved
the Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne. H1e was re-elected to the House of
Commons at the general elections of 1917,
1921 and 1925. On July 19, 1926 he was made
a member of the Privy Council and minister
without portfolio in the Meighen government, and on July 20, 1935 was summoned to
the Senate.
Senator Sutherland's health in recent years
did not permit him to take the prominent
part in the Senate's activities that his long
experience warranted, and many of the junior
members of this house were deprived of the
opportunity to enjoy the friendship of a
thorough gentleman.
The Honourable Senator Charles Phillipe
Beaubien, Montarville, died January 17, 1949.
He was born in Montreal on May 10, 1870, the
son of Louis Beaubien, a distinguished public

FEBRUARY 1, 1949
figure who served, first as Speaker of the
Quebec Legislative Assembly, and later, as
Minister of Agriculture.
Following his education at St. Mary's
College, Senator Beaubien attended the Unicalled Laval
versity of Montreal-then
University-where he studied law. He was
admitted to the Bar of Quebec in 1894. In
1899 he married Margaret Power of San Diego,
California. Three children were born to them.
Through his acute business sagacity and
eminently successful law practice, Senator
Beaubien became a director of many large
Canadian firms. At one time he was a
director of the Dominion Steel and Coal
Company, the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal
Company, the Banque Canadienne Nationale,
the Canadian Car and Foundry Company,
Limited, the Insurance Company of Canada,
the British American Oil Company and the
Credit Foncier Franco-Canadienne. At the
same time he carried on an extensive law
practice and found time to gain prominence
in public life.
Our late colleague was summoned to this
house on December 3, 1915. In 1927 he was
chairman of the convention which elected the
Right Honourable R. B. Bennett leader of the
Conservative Party. His associations and
interests required him to travel extensively
in this country and throughout the world. He
was president of the Canadian section of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1922, 1933, and
1934, and was a delegate to its conferences,
in Switzerland in 1919, and later at Vienna,
Washington, Paris, Berlin and Bucharest. He
successfully negotiated treaties for Canada
with the French Government. In 1931 he was
Canadian delegate to the League of Nations
at Geneva, and represented Canada at the
Pan-American Postal Conference at Mexico.
In 1934 he was made a Commander of the
Legion of Honour.
During recent years Senator Beaubien was
not able to attend the sittings of this house
regularly, so the senior members would know
him best. When I was appointed to the
Senate in 1943 he was still favouring his
fellow members with his eloquence and charm
of manner. Honourable senators who knew
him best will appreciate that his passing
marks the loss to this chamber of a cultured
gentleman.
The Honourable Brewer Waugh Robinson,
Summerside, died January 20, 1949. He was
born at Summerside, Prince Edward Island,
January 9, 1891, the son of George W. Robinson and Lucy Waugh. He received his education at Summerside High School and Commercial College, and on September 24, 1919,
married Ethel R. Mills, the daughter of W.
A. Mills of Halifax. They had no children.
The late Senator Robinson was a prominent
silver fox rancher, a director of the Prince

Edward Island Fur Pool Limited, and president of Robinson's Mill and Bakery Limited.
During the first Great War he served overseas
for four years, and later became president of
the Provincial Command of the Canadian
Legion. In 1942 he again went overseas, this
time with the Canadian Legion War Services.
In 1936 he was elected to the Prince Edward
Island Legislature, and during that year and
the following one served as Mayor of Summerside. He was summoned to the Senate on
April 9, 1945.
The late senator was particularly interested
in the problems of ex-service men. His comparative youth marked him as one who might
be expected to contribute years of useful
service to the nation and to the community
in which he lived. But such was not to be,
for after less than four years membership of
this house he is no longer with us. His colleagues in this chamber extend sincere
sympathy to those who mourn his untimely
passing.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
seldom is a member of this house called upon
to pay tribute to the memory of so many of
our members as have passed away in the
short period since the end of the last session.
Actually, since October 20 last the call has
come to no less than seven of them.
Because I knew these gentlemen so intimately it is difficult for me to speak of them.
When one has been here for many years one
gets to know his fellow-members and what
they are like, and it is very depressing to lose
them, especially when they have been as
close as or closer than a brother. The honourable leader of the government has well
and carefully outlined the lives of those who
have gone, and I shall not enlarge upon what
he said; but perhaps I may philosophize for
a few moments. I hope that when I am no
longer in this house, and somebody undertakes to speak about me, he will be able to
say of me, as I think I can say without
exception of the seven former members
whom we now have in memory, that "though
that fellow made lots of mistakes, they were
all mistakes of the head, not of the heart."
To me the late Senator Donnelly was
always "Senator Donnelly". To any question
about agriculture, especially ranching and
cattle-raising, he could always be depended
upon for an informative answer. He also was
extremely well-informed about lumbering,
and had contributed notably to the development of both these branches of economic life
in the province of Ontario. He was a great
Canadian, and made a great contribution to
the work of this house. His standard of
morality was high, and his love of Canada
was an inspiration to men who, like myself,
followed him in later years to this chamber.

SENATE
His was the great honour of being Number
One on the roll of the Senate. For his wife
and family I bespeak the sympathy of this
house, knowing as I do that the husband
and father made a real contribution to the
greatness of Canada.
I find it harder to speak today about Senator White than of any other of our departed
colleagues. There was in Gerald White a
quality which I cannot define, but which I
have always wished I possessed. I liked him;
I did not know why. I thought that perhaps
I was the only one who felt something like
love for him, but I have discovered that
others had the same feeling. His was a personality which made people not only love him
but trust him. I venture to assert that there
is not a member of this house who sat with
him on committees but knows that when
Gerald took a stand, he took it because he
thought it was the right stand in the interests
of Canada.
To his wife and daughter I express on
behalf of all our sincere sympathy. For me,
his place will not readily be filled. His record
as a member of the House of Commons was
outstanding, as was his record on the field of
battle in the first World War; his contribution
to the mining development of this country
was exceptional; but I believe his greatest
service was rendered in the Senate of
Canada. The Senate is a better chamber
because of his presence in it.
Senator Macdonald of Prince Edward Island
was known to us on this side as "Cardigan
Jack". There were so many senators of the
same name that it was natural to look for
some way of distinguishing them so the late
Senator from Prince Edward Island became
known to us as "Cardigan Jack". He served
with distinction in the Legislature of Prince
Edward Island and in the House of Commons.
He was a member without portfolio of the
Bennett government, and afterwards for many
years be was a very useful and helpful member of the various Senate committees on which
he served. In the last year or two, the physical frailty which so frequently accompanies
advancing years affected a little the regularity
of his attendance. But we must remember
such men as they were for their years of
service in our chamber. May I express to his
wife and family the sympathy of this house.
His boys had a distinguished record in the
second World War, and, as an associate of the
late Senator Macdonald, I want them to
know how much I admired and appreciated
him and the service he rendered to Canada
here and elsewhere.
I did not know Senator John Anthony
McDonald until I came to this house, nor did
I know him intimately until I became leader
of the opposition. Next to his admiration of
Scottish characteristics and traditions I would

emphasize his interest in labour. He believed, whether rightly or not, that he was in
a unique position to render service to Canada
by helping labour. In what degree he succeeded I am not in a position to say, but I
know that he never came to me unless it was
to advocate a position which he thought we
as senators should adopt with regard to
labour problems. Members of his family,
also, had a very distinguished war record:
his patriotism and loyalty survived in his
children.
Donald Sutherland, from Oxford, was the
first member of the Conservative party since
confederation to be elected to either the
Legislature of Ontario or to the House of
Commons. His qualities must have appealed
to the Scottish people of his community. I
can well understand why. During the last
few years ill health prevented him from
taking a very active part in the work of this
house, but those who knew him shared the
love and respect felt for him by his former
constituents. At least two members of his
family had very distinguished records in the
last war; and those of us who have met them
know what splendid people they are. To
Mrs. Sutherland, whom many of us knew
personally, and to the boys and girls of the
family, I would pass on our wish that they
may live long to cherish the memory of their
distinguished father.
Senator Beaubien was a French gentleman
in the best sense of the term. One might
picture him as having been lifted out of the
pages of the history of France of a hundred
years ago, the son of a French gentleman,
educated in the schools of that country. He
had high ideals, and his hopes and ambitions
for the development of our country reflected
those ideals. We who were here some years
ago, before the arrival of my honourable
friend who is now the leader of the government, renember with pleasure the war that
was carried on by Senator Dandurand, who
sat opposite, and Senator Beaubien, who sat
on this side. It was a charming and fascinating performance. Never once was there any
hitting below the belt, but any little gibe that
either could get in was quite permissible and
appropriate; for although, I believe, they
were closely related by marriage, the fact
was never evident on the floor of this house.
It was a delightful experience to watch these
two gladiators in debate. Most of the time
they spoke English, but at times they would
lapse into French most effectively.
I knew Charlie Beaubien as a sound businessman. He was a director of one of the
largest loan companies in Canada-it lent
more money in Manitoba than all other loan
companies together-and he helped to direct
its policies. Senator Beaubien will be sorely
missed by all of us. Although ill health pre-

FEBRUARY 1, 1949

vented him from taking an active part in
our deliberations during the past four years,
those of us who were associated with him in
this chamber in former years knew him as a
charming gentleman and a great Canadian.
I hardly got to know Senator Robinson, but
I should like to pay tribute to his memory in
a few words. I noticed that when he attended
our committee meetings he always adopted
the attitude, "Oh, well, these people may have
made a mistake, but let us give them another
chance". I regarded him as a young man
who, because of his military experience, might
have made a splendid contribution to this
house. But we have no control over our
futures. We shall certainly miss him, and I
wish to say to his wife and many friends that
he had already found a niche in the life of
the Senate.
Honourable senators, it is rather difficult
to criticize the Senate of Canada, as is sometimes done, when it is realized that every
word spoken this afternoon about our late
colleagues is true. I feel that their contribution to Canada will long remain in the memory of our people.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
it is my pious duty to concur in the eloquent
tributes paid by the honourable leader of the
government and the honourable leader of the
opposition, to the memory of our honourable
colleagues who have been removed from our
midst by the Grim Reaper in the short period
which has elapsed since prorogation.
I had, indeed, for each and every one of
them, a profound respect, and I prize highly
the privilege of having served with them in
this honourable chamber. I shall not repeat
what has already been so aptly said; we all
agree that our lamented colleagues served
our country faithfully and well, and deserve
the confidence and gratitude of their fellow
men. It is therefore fitting and proper that
their respected names and a statement of
their curriculum vitae and of their services
be registered in the official record of this
house. This has been eminently done by the
honourable leaders who have already spoken.
I desire, however, to make special reference
to the late honourable senator from Montarville, because of our long acquaintance,
association and friendship. Honourable Senator Beaubien belonged to one of our most
distinguished French-Canadian families, one
which might well serve as an example
because of its long tradition of integrity,
industry and devotion to public service. His
father had been Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly and, later, Minister of Agriculture
of Quebec. His mother was the daughter of
Sir James Stuart, who at that time was Chief
Justice of Quebec. His grandmother, Lady

Stuart, was the daughter of Philippe Aubert
de Gaspé, Seigneur of St. Jean Port Joli, one
of the outstanding seigniorial families of the
French regime.
Senator Beaubien distinguished himself at
the Bar of his native province, in businesswhere he became the director of several of our
most important industries-and during his
long career in the Senate. He has frequently
had occasion to discharge very important
public duties. I recall that in 1923, when I
was serving in the House of Commons, a
Liberal government chose him as leader of
a delegation of Canadian parliamentarians
and businessmen who accompanied the
exhibition train which was sent to France.
As chairman of the Canadian group of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, he represented
Canada at Geneva in 1919, at Vienna in 1922,
at Washington in 1925, at Paris in 1927, and
at Berlin in 1928. He was also entrusted
with special missions to France in 1919, 1920
and 1922. In 1921 the Canadian government
selected him to negotiate a reciprocal trade
agreement with France, and he succeeded in
bringing this very difficult undertaking to
fruition. He was also a Canadian delegate
to the League of Nations in 1931. In all these
missions he demonstrated his eloquence,
ability and tact to the other distinguished
statesmen of the world whom he had occasion
to meet. During a recent trip to Britain,
France and other countries of Europe, I met
several statesmen who spoke of Senator
Beaubien with admiration and kindliness.
Senator Beaubien also played an important
part in the councils of his party, and at the
National Convention held in Winnipeg in
1927 he was elected joint chairman. In 1934
he was joint chairman of the National Committee of the Jacques Cartier Centenary in
commemoration of the discovery of Canada,
a position in which he discharged his duties
and functions with great brilliance at Gaspé,
Quebec and Montreal. He was, for many
years, chairman of le Comité France-Amerique, an office in which he succeeded the late
Senator Dandurand, one of the founders of
the organization in Paris and Montreal.
In the metropolis of Canada, Montreal,
where the late Senator Beaubien resided and
carried on his professional practice, he was
universally respected and loved. His noble
character, his gentlemanliness, his faithfulness to his friends, his willingness to serve in
all enterprises of benevolence and community
welfare, endeared him to the hearts of all
those who came in contact with him.
I tender to the honourable leader of the
opposition and his associates our profound
sympathy for the loss that they and their
party have suffered in the death of so many

SENATE
of their colleagues. It is a loss that we on
this side share with them, for I am sure all
honourable members feel that this house is
much the poorer by reason of it.
I wish also to join in the expression of
sympathy to the families of our departed colleagues, and I trust that His Honour the
Speaker and the Clerk of the House will convey our condolences to them.
The departure in such a short time of so
many of our number reminds me of this saying of the French philosopher Jouffroy:
When we leave this world, what does it matter
to others and to ourselves whether honour, happiness or sorrow have fallen to our lot? All these
things exist only at the moment when they are felt;
the trace of the wind through the leaves is not more
fugitive. We take away with us from this life only
the perfection acquired by our souls; we leave in
this world only the good we have accomplished.

Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
in all the years that I have been in the Senate
this is the first time that I have risen to speak
on an occasion such as this, for in the past I
have always felt that the leaders on both
sides and those who were most closely associated with our late colleagues could say all
that was necessary. But today, in addition
to associating myself with the tributes that
have been paid, I feel that as the sole remaining Conservative senator for the province of
Ontario I should pay my own special tribute
to those of our departed colleagues who also
belonged to my province.
When I first became actively interested in
political life the late Senator Sutherland was
one of the ablest and most active men in our
party. An experienced parliamentarian and
a fluent speaker, he was in great demand on
the public platform, especially in rural constituencies. The honourable leader on this
side referred to the fact that in earlier days
the late senator was the only person who
could carry the County of Oxford for the
Conservative party, and I might say that if
you had known Donald Sutherland in those
days you would have easily understood why
that was so. I had the privilege of being in
his home many times and of making trips
through his constituency, and especially in
that section of western Ontario where he was
well known, so I have personal knowledge
of the very high esteem in which he was held
by people of all political affiliations.
Both the late senators Donnelly and White
had been members of this house for many
years when I came here, in 1935. Both gave
me a very warm welcome, and as the years
passed a deep and lasting friendship
developed. Senator Donnelly, as we all know,
was an able and effective speaker, and
although in late years his speeches were
usually short and always extemporaneous,

they were nevertheless well worth listening
to. I think that was because he possessed
unusually good common sense and good judgment. 1 know that as a newcomer to this
house I many times asked his advice, and I
was always glad when I followed it.
Of Senator White I can only say, with my
leader, that he was beloved by us allbeloved for his kindly nature, his never failing good humour, his keen sense of humour
and his faithfulness to duty. In this house we
have many faithful members, but I do not
think there is one more conscientious than
Gerald White always was in the discharge of
his duties. In his attendance here he rarely
missed a day, and when he did it was for
some absolutely unavoidable reason. In fact,
he rarely missed an hour. He was here for
prayers and he stayed until adjournment,
practically every day of the session, and in
that I think he possibly set an example to
all of us. In common with those who sit with
me here I can only say, very truly, that the
Senate will be a poorer place because of his
passing.
I wish to join those who have preceded me
in extending my deepest sympathy to the
immediate families of all our late colleagues.
Hon. J. E. Sinclair: Honourable members of
the Senate, I wish to associate myself with
the two leaders and the other members who
have spoken in extending sympathy to the
families of our colleagues who have passed
away since we last met here. I wish particularly to say a few words with reference to
two of those colleagues.
I knew the late Senator Macdonald for
many years. He was well known in the public
life of his native province and he had a long
public career. He was first elected to the
legislature of his province in 1908, and was
re-elected in 1911, at which time he was
taken into the government as a minister without portfolio. In 1923 he was again re-elected,
and was appointed Minister of Public Works
and Highways. He left that office in 1925
when he was elected to the House of Commons for Kings County, a seat that he
retained until 1935. From 1930 to 1935 he was
minister without portfolio. He was summoned
to the Senate in 1935 and continued as a
member of this chamber until his death in
November last.
In private life the late senator was a successful businessman, carrying on operations as
a general merchant and shipper and exporter
of farm produce. He always took a keen interest in community welfare.
I wish to join the leaders in this house and
other senators in extending to his widow and
seven children, who are left to mourn his
passing, our sincere sympathy in their
bereavement.

FEBRUARY 1. 1949
The late Senator Robinson was for only a
few short years a member of this chamber. I
knew him well before he came here; he was a
man of many parts. During World War I he
served in the ranks of the Canadian Expeditionary Force; he volunteered for service in
the second World War, and went overseas.
He was subsequently transferred to the Legion
Services in London, where he remained until
near the close of the war, when he was summoned to the Senate.
He took an active interest in the affairs of
the Canadian Legion of the British Empire
Service League, and usually attended its
annual meetings.
In private life Senator Robinson was a successful businessman and silver fox rancher.
In public life he was elected mayor of Summerside, his home town, in 1936, and in 1939
he went to the Prince Edward Island Legislature. He held his seat for the life of that
legislature, and as he was serving overseas
at the time the next election was held he did
not stand for re-election. He was summoned
to the Senate in 1945, and was highly respected
by al those with whom he came in contact.
I join the leaders in this house and other
Senators in extending to his widow and near
relatives our most sincere sympathy.
Hon. J. P. McIntyre: Honourable Senators,
I should like to associate myself with the
speakers who have preceded me in paying
tribute to our departed colleagues, particularly those from my own province.
Senator John A. Macdonald, better known
in Prince Edward Island as "Cardigan John",
was the third senator bearing the name John
A. Macdonald-the spelling only being different-to pass from this chamber since 1945. It
may well have been that these three gentlemen were named after the great statesman Sir
John A. Macdonald, Prime Minister of
Canada after Confederation, for all three of
them shared his political faith.
Senator Macdonald was in public life for
over forty years. He was first elected to the
Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island
in 1908, and was re-elected in 1911 and 1923.
He served as Minister of Public Works and
Highways in that province from 1923 to 1925,
when he resigned his portfolio to become a
candidate for election to the House of Commons. In that year he was elected to the
federal house, and was re-elected in 1926 and
1930. He was a minister without portfolio in
the Bennett Government from 1930 until 1935,
when he was appointed to the Senate.
I had known the late senator for many
years; we were born within a few miles of
each other. He was truly a Christian gentleman. We occupied the office of Minister of
Public Works and Highways in our native
province, under different governments, and

eventually came together in this chamber.
The late senator was an outstanding person,
honest and upright in every respect. I could
cite many incidents to illustrate his honour,
noble character and high ideals. For instance,
during the first World War he built a number of ships which later were sunk at sea,
leaving him in debt for almost $100,000. He
never gave up, but through ability and hard
work he paid back every dollar. I believe I
express the sentiments of all members of this
chamber when I extend sincere sympathy to
the bereaved wife and family.
Less than two weeks ago our province was
called upon to mourn the passing of another
member of this chamber, Senator Brewer
Robinson, an outstanding figure politically
and otherwise.
During the first Great War Senator Robinson joined the Second Battery of the Canadian
Heavy Artillery in his home town of Summerside, and went overseas in 1915. He was
with his outfit in France until the end of the
war. On his return to his native province he
engaged in the bakery business and in fox
ranching, and was most successful in both
ventures. Shortly after the outbreak of the
second World War Senator Robinson went
overseas with the Canadian Legion War Services, and was deputy head of that organization in London when he was notified of his
appointment to this chamber.
My association with Senator Robinson was
most cordial and pleasant, and I looked upon
him as a personal friend. He was twice mayor
of his native town, Summerside; and during
his regime most of the paved streets were
laid and many other civic improvements were
made. No braver or stouter heart ever beat
within a human breast than that of the late
Senator Robinson.
I wish at this time to extend my sincere
sympathy to his widow.
Hon. J. M. Dessureauli: Honourable Senators, I should like to join with other honourable senators in paying tribute to the memories of the members of this chamber who
have passed away since the last session.
While I had great admiration for them all,
coming as I do from the province of Quebec,
I desire especially to extend my sympathy to
the family of the late Senator Charles P.
Beaubien. His passing has removed from the
scene of his activities a man who worked
faithfully and well, not only for the benefit
of his province but for the whole of Canada.
Highly regarded, of charming personality,
trusted and well liked, Senator Beaubien was
honoured by being appointed to many important positions in both the economic and political spheres of our country. He had a long
business and political career. Though not
sharing his political faith, I always had great

SENATE
admiration for him. For many years I was
closely associated with him as a director of
Banque Canadienne Nationale, and always
found him to be a perfect gentleman, of sound
judgment and trustworthy. I was happy to
count him as one of my personal friends, and
therefore wish to join in extending to his
family my most sincere sympathy.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable Senators,
of all our colleagues who have recently
departed from this life, it was with the late
Charles P. Beaubien that I was most closely
associated. I first became acquainted with
him when I was still quite young. He was
then one of the most prominent members of
the Conservative party in my province, and
it will readily be appreciated that he represented the best traditions of French-Canadian
Conservatism.
The late senator was a successful lawyer,
an eloquent speaker, and will long be remembered for his excellent addresses in both
English and French. He did great honour to
Canada both at home and abroad. It was
my privilege frequently to work under him
as chairman of various charitable and patriotic organizations. Whenever one appealed
to the kind heart of the Honourable Charles
Beaubien one was always sure to receive a
favourable response. I listened again and

again to his admirable speeches. I became
associated with him in the fields of education
as well as of business. As remarked by our
leaders on both sides of the house and other
honourable gentlemen who have spoken,
Senator Beaubien was indeed un parfait
gentilhomme-a perfect gentleman of the old
school. He was one of the most distinguished
French-speaking
of our
representatives
aristocracy.
But in addition to his distinction of manner, and his literary merits, he possessed
above all his qualities a deep sense, a religious
sense so to speak, of duty. I believe that
devotion was the best characteristic of our
late colleague. For many months, to my personal knowledge, he attended all his corporation meetings, although he was very ill, quite
pale, and evidently suffering very much. The
last time I saw him, his concern was still to
be of service to others.
With a kindly smile he inquired about their
health, their needs, and so on. He gave us
indeed an admirable example of self-sacrifice,
and for this he shall never be forgotten by
his many friends of all classes, of all races,
of all religious denominations, and of all
political creeds. To his family I express my
most sincere sympathy.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

COMMITTEE 0F SELECTION
CONSIDERATION 0F REPORT

Hon. Wbshar1 McL. Roberison presented
and moved consideration of the report of the
Committee of Selection, nominating members
to the several SLanding Committees for the
present session.
(See Appendix at end of today's report.)
He said: I shall not read the namnes of the
members selected to serve, but for the benefit
of those senators who are not familiar with
the procedure of the bouse, 1 would say
that it is customary for the Committee of
Selection to go over the list of senators and
to make whatever changes are necessary.
Some vacancies are left on the committees
for new senators whose special knowledge
and ability qualifies them to serve. If honourable senators will make their wishes
known in this respect, changes wifl be made
where it is reasonably within our power to
make them. It would greatly simplify matters if by unanimous consent honourabie
senators would accept the report as prepared, in order that it may make the necessary motions with respect to the appointment
of the committees, and for further procedure.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I might informi the house
that no senator has been struck off a committee of which. he was a member last year.
The only change in the personnel of existing
committees is that some honourable senators have been nominated to other committees.

Hon. Mr. Rol:er:son: Horiourable senators,
with leave, 1 desire to move:
That the senators mentionad in the report of the

Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, may I ask a question, for information only? I understand that the specific purpose and terms of reference of the Committee
on Internai Economy have been established
and that at the present time we are asking
that, if necessary, certain powers be given
when required.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Precisely.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
hardly like what bas happened in the way of

committee that made the report; there is not
one chance in a thousand that I would wish
to make any change; but I do not like the
suggestion: "Open your mouth and shut your

place these namnes on the record before we

reason why these committees should be

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson:

I may say that with

the exception of one committee there is really
no urgency. I have followed the practice of
the last two years, and the rule that no member be removed from the Committee of Seleclion who served on it the preceding year has
been observed. We have added some new
members and have left vacancies for others.
This in itself is not an argument for haste,
the chief reason for which is that after the
committee personnel has been selected it is
customary to nominate the various chairmen
and, if the nominations are concurred in, to
set up the committees. The only committee as
to which there is a little urgency-how much,
I will leave it to a member of that committee
to say-is the Divorce committee, which has
to organize and set dates for its hearings in
advance so that sufficient notice may be given
to witnesses and others who will be appearing before it. The honourable gentleman
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who has
been chairman of the committee for some
years, is in a better position to give information about it than I am.
As to the point made by His Honour the
Speaker that the motion has already been
carried, I may say that I am quite willing to
have the motion considered simply as a
notice, and to proceed with it after it has
been printed in our records. Of course I
should not want to do this if, thereby, the
Divorce Committee would be handicapped.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
think it is very important that the Divorce
Committee should have its organization meeting tomorrow. There is a great deal of work
to be done, and we want to get it started as
soon as possible.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: In my opinion this discussion is entirely out of order.
The honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) moved the consideration
of the report, and the motion was adopted.
He then moved another motion, and it is that
motion which is now before the house.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I had intended to ask
the house to adjourn tomorrow until next
week, but I am afraid that if we were to
adjourn before the Divorce committee held
its organization meeting the committee would
be placed under a handicap.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Order. I
insist that the discussion on the motion for
consideration of the report is out of order.
That motion was carried. If the honourable
leader wishes, he can withdraw his motion,
but there can be no further discussion of it.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, I rose not on a question of order but
simply to express concurrence in the views

expressed by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). However, if I am going to be met with any suggestion of the iron fist, I will speak on the
question of order, even if I have to fight for
it alone. I say that this procedure is not
proper, and in that regard I agree with the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity.
I quite understand the position in relation to
the Divorce committeeThe Hon.

ihe Acting Speaker: Order!

Righ± Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I am speaking
to a question of privilege, sir, on which I am
quite in order.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I still insist
that there cannot be any further discussion
on the motion for consideration of the report
of the cornmittee of selection.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Then, Mr.
Speaker, IThe Hon. the Acting Speaker: I rule that
we cannot have any further discussion on
that motion. There is another motion before
the house.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Mr. Speaker, I
rise to a question of privilege, to which any
member can speak at any time. It is a privilege affecting the rights of honourable members of this house, and regardless of any point
of order I am entitled to speak to a question
of privilege.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I insist that
the right honourable gentleman is out of
order in atte:npting to discuss the motion that
bas been adopted. If be is not satisfied with
that ruling be may appeal to the house.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Well, sir, seeing
thatThe Hon. the Acting Speaker: Order! I have
ruled that you cannot discuss that motion
any further.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Mr. Speaker, I
can rise to a question of privilege in this
house, and I insist on my right to do so.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Will the right
honourable gentleman please state his question of privilege?
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: My question
of privilege is that I had no notice of this
list of members of committees, and that the
motion was carried without consideration by
honourable members of this house. I say
that is something which affects the privilege
of every single member of the Senate, in
that we are entitled to know what business
is to come up for our consideration before
we are asked to dispose of it. I think that
in all fairness the motion should be with-

FEBRUARY 2, 1949
drawn until tomorrow at least, in order that
we may have time to look it over, and I do
not think this delay would seriously handicap
the Divorce Committee.
I do not think that committee would be held
up for long. Before the motion is passed I
should like to move, if it meets with the
wishes of the house, that the motion with
respect to committee personnel be now
rescinded and be dealt with tomorrow.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: If it is the
wish of the house to rescind the motion and
delete it from the record, that is quite all right,
but as it stands the matter cannot be discussed
further.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With the permission
of the house, may I say a few words?
As leader of the government in this house,
responsibility for this procedure is largely
mine. In making my motion I explained what
had happened previously and asked for
unanimous consent. The objections put forward have impressed me, and I should like to
say that if ever again I have the opportunity
of presenting such a report, I will take the
precaution to see that proper notice is given.
In this instance a delay would make some
difference to the functioning of the committees.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I withdraw my objection.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I also withdraw
my objection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not wish to cause
any trouble, but I believe the objections are
salutary, and that the present procedure
should not form a precedent.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to pass the
motion?
The motion was agreed to.

WRECK OF THE "MARIE BRENDA"
GALLANT ACTION OF NOVA

SCOTIA SEAMEN

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Before the Orders of the
Day are called, I ask for the privilege of
bringing to the attention of the house the
heroic action of two Nova Scotia seamen.
The account appearing in the Ottawa Journal
of this morning reads as follows:
Captain Saves Seven from Doomed Vessel
Antigonish, N.S., Feb. I.-(CP)-While the thundering sea battered his t.ny dragger to splinters,
Capt. Land Lace swam ashore through the breakers
today with a line that enabled his seven crew members to reach shore safely.
The Lunenburg, N.S. dragger Marie Brenda, 29
tons, dragged her anchors last night and piled
aground on a ledge off Isaac's Harbor lighthouse,
about 15 miles north of this northern Nova Scotia
town.
A blinding snowstorm struck Nova Scotia last
night. The dragger anchored off Isaac's Harbor for
shelter. But driven by the gale and breaking sea,
she dragged her anchors and ran ashore on a ledge
near the lighthouse.
Battering seas ground the wooden hull against the
jagged rocks, punching holes in the bottom.
The captain and crew clung to the wreck throughout the night. Huge seas broke over the tiny craft
and the men lashed themselves to the masts.
Early today seaman Joseph Fry attempted unsuccessfully to swim ashore with a line. Helpless in
the rough water, he was pulled back on board.

SENATE
Then the 22-year-old Capt. Lace tied the line to
his waist and dived overboard. After a terrific
struggle he reached shore.
He fastened the line to a tree. Meanwhile, the
Marie Brenda was breaking up fast under the
merciless pounding.
One at a time, the men caught the line and
passed along it through the sea to safety. It took
.two hours for the remaining six men to reach shore.
Brought to hospital here suffering from frostbitten feet were Gordon Acker, the cook, and Fry.
Capt. Lace, Bo's'n Samuel Corkum, Engineer Leo
Mersey and Seamen William Savory, Morton Nowe
and Gordon Lace, the skipper's brother, still were
at the lighthouse tonight.
Acker was near exhaustion when he reached shore.
At the lighthouse the men found refuge from the
sea. First aid was given by Mrs. Harry Giffin, a
nurse from Isaac's Harbor.

A dispatch from Isaac's Harbor Lighthouse
reads as follows:
"Not much to it," was Capt. Land Lace's comment tonight on his rescue of seven crew members
from the shipwrecked dragger, Marie Brenda.
In a few, quiet words, he told The Canadian
Press how he plunged into the boiling surf off this
pin-point of land on Nova Scotia's north shore to
carry a line to land. In turn, each of his seven
seamen passed down the line and through the sea
to safety.
"I didn't have any time to feel anything," said
"I just dived in and
the 22-year-old skipper.
swam."
Except for the two men in hospital with frostbite and the captain, the rest of the crew will
return to their south shore port of Lunenburg tomorrow, ha said. Capt. Lace would stay for a day
or two to see how his two other men made out.
Tonight six of the crew sat in the lighthouse and
"just thawed out".

Honourable senators, any of us who know
the hazards of the eastern Nova Scotia coast
in the winter realize that these men were in
grave peril; and I am sure that we who come
from Nova Scotia feel proud of the successful
and heroic action of these two seamen, and
the successful achievement of the captain, who
is usually known in Lunenburg as "Buddy"
Lace. Captain Lace is the youngest skipper
in the fishing fleet, being only twenty-two
years old, and bears a high reputation. His
father and mother and their family are good
neighbours of both Senator Duff and myself in
Lunenburg, and naturally we feel admiration
and gratitude to these young seamen for having saved the lives of seven of our Nova
Scotia fishermen. I am sure Captain Lace's
father and mother, besides feeling a legitimate pride, are very grateful, because a
younger brother is amongst those who were
saved. In every fisherman's cottage along the
coast there will be rejoicing because sorrow
and bereavement have been prevented from
entering the homes of so many of our families.
The Marie Brenda is seventy tons gross
tonnage. The newspaper report gives the
tonnage as twenty-nine, but that figure is net,
and has reference to carrying capacity. These
boats have considerable power equipment and
are operating on the deep sea. This young

captain has done exceptionally well in his
vocation, and now he has achieved a great
service to his fellow men, worthy of the highest traditions of the sea. Nova Scotia and, I
am sure, the whole country is proud of him.
Some hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the fifth session of
the Twentieth Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Thomas Farquhar moved:
That the following Address be presented to Ris
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:To His Excellency Field Marshal The Right Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, Knight of the
Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand
Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,
Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order
of Saint Michael and Saint George, Companion of
the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, upon
whom bas been conferred the Decoration of the
Military Cross, one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp
General, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief
in and over Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious speech which Your Excellency has
addressed to both bouses of parliament.

He said:
Honourable senators, before proceeding
with my remarks incidental to the motion
before us, I wish to associate myself with
the honourable leader of the government in
this house and other honourable senators in
expressing deep sympathy to the Honourable
the Speaker of the Senate in the sad bereavement he has recently sustained.
I should like to thank the honourable
leader of the government here for the honour
he has accorded to myself and to the constituency of Algoma East in asking me to
move the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne delivered by His Excellency
the Governor General, Viscount Alexander,
the esteemed representative of our beloved
King.
To the Governor General we tender our
thanks for his gracious speech. We are not
unmindful of the honour accorded to Canada
by his felicitous discharge of the duties of
his high office.
Through him, we extend to our beloved
King and the Royal Family, our most loyal
obedience and esteem. We are most conscious
and proud of the unalterable love and respect
which they command from the Canadian
people, whose prayers are for the complete
return to health of His Gracious Maiesty.

FEBRUARY 2, 1949
As a nation we have been saddened by the
news of his affliction, as we have rejoiced
at the most happy event of the birth of a
royal grandson and future heir to the throne,
and the health and well-being of Princess
Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh.
Since the last session of this parliament
our esteemed Prime Minister, Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, has retired from
the position he has filled for so long a period
with unparalleled distinction and ability.
During his long term of office Canada has
reached a high place among the nations of
the world, a proud place which we shall continue to hold under the leadership of our
new Prime Minister, Right Honourable Louis
St. Laurent, whose ability and entire fitness
for his position are well known to the members of this honourable house.
On behalf of myself and my newlyappointed colleagues, I should like to thank
the honourable leader of the government
here, and the other honourable members of
both sides of this house, for the sincere welcome which bas been extended to us on
taking our seats in this chamber. I am not
entirely a stranger here. I have many pleasant recollections of association with many
of you in the House of Commons, where for
many years I had the honour of representing
the constituency of Algoma East, whose
people are now represented by the Honourable L. B. Pearson, Minister of External
Affairs.
The riding of Algoma East, including
Manitoulin Island, is largely rural, and its
people engage in the diverse interests usually
connected with such a district. They are most
progressive and .employ the most modern
methods in mixed farming, lumbering, pulp
and paper production, mining and fishing.
Perhaps to the rest of Canadà and many parts
of the United States our district is best known
for its tourist attractions, and the fisherman
and sightseer are catered to with efficiency.
Much of our farm land is well adapted for
the raising of beef cattle, and in the marketing of this product we have the distinction of
holding the largest annual one-day sale of
beef cattle in Canada. This is carried out by
a well-organized farmers' co-operative society.
Similarly, many tons of high-grade turkeys
are marketed each fall and are in great
demand for their high quality.
As I said before, Algoma East bas been
represented since the by-election of last
October by the Honourable Lester B. Pearson. When he was invited by the Liberal
executive to contest the riding, the Conservative party, recognizing the outstanding abilities which so well fitted him for his diplomatic post, decided not to oppose him. He

therefore received their full support, and the
result was an overwhelming victory over his
C.C.F. and Social Credit opponents. Immediately following his election Mr. Pearson left
for Paris to join the Canadian delegation to,
the third session of the General Assembly of
the United Nations. Upon his arrival he took
over the responsibilities of leader of the delegation from the Honourable Mr. Chevrier,
who was required by his duties as Minister
of Transport to return to Canada.
Mr. Pearson was already well known in
United Nations circles, having played a promment role in various international organizations such as UNRRA. He was a member of
the Canadian delegation at San Francisco
when the Charter was drafted, and he subsequently represented Canada at a number
of United Nations meetings. He also played
a leading part in the discussions of many
important international questions, and when
he entered the government he had already
built for himself, as a Canadian civil servant,
an enviable reputation in international affairs.
This reputation was based on his personal
qualities of judgment and sincerity. To the
people of many countries he represented the
typical Canadian: friendly and informal, but
practical and workmanlike. He therefore had
many friends from other countries to welcome him when he took his place in Paris
in his new role as Secretary of State for
External Affairs for Canada. Mr. Pearson
played a leading part in the proceedings of
the Assembly when decisions were made on a
number of political questions, such as Berlin,
Palestine, Greece and Korea.
Since returning to this country Mr. Pearson
bas been able to give a full account of what
took place. I think his report on the United
Nations is characteristically Canadian. It is
sober and realistic. It does not minirnize the
difficulties and limitations of that organization, but at the same time it makes clear the
fact that our membership in the United
Nations serves basic Canadian interests.
Valuable as were Mr. Pearson's special
duties as a civil servant, I am sure that we
all realize that in his new position as Minister of External Affairs his ability will have
wider scope and be of greater value to
Canada. Mr. Pearson already has made a
host of friends in Algoma East, and they are
duly appreciative of the honour of being
represented by him. He bas already made it
clear that their interests will not be neglected
because of the pressure of his broader activities.
I now wish to speak briefly about the tariff
concessions obtained at Geneva in 1947,
which were referred to in the Speech from
the Throne. Although Canada bas a comparatively small population, it is today the

SENATE
third largest trading nation in the world.
For that reason no country in the world
should be more interested than this one in
freeing the channels of trade. On a per
capita basis our trade is three times that of
the United States and twice that of the
United Kingdom. Through the Geneva agreement the world has made its greatest advance
towards freer trade. As a result of that
agreement twenty different countries are now
benefiting by the removal of restrictions on
world trade; but in Canada, the United
States, and many other countries, certain
statutory restrictions prevent the implementing of the Geneva agreement to its fullest
extent. I am very glad to see that the Speech
from the Throne mentions the further freeing
of trade, and I hope that legislation will be
passed this session to enable Canada to do
her full part in implementing this agreement.
As I have said, twenty countries are now
benefiting by it, and three additional countries which have recently signed it will
shortly be participating in its benefits.
The different countries of the world have
been resorting to many devices to shut out
foreign goods.
First: In addition to import duties, it has
been a common practice to impose so-called
excise taxes on imported goods-taxes which
are not imposed on domestic goods. These
taxes, although they are often called excise
taxes, are really additions to the tariff. Under
the Geneva agreement no country may tax
imports from any other contracting party
more heavily than its own domestic products
of the same kind. Under this clause we get
rid of a most objectionable tariff feature.
Second: It has been a common practice in
the past to impose heavy dumping duties on
imported goods. Under the agreement dumping duties on imports are not to be levied
unless the imports in question threaten
material injury to an established domestic
industry. In any event, dumping duties must
not exceed the difference between the export
price and the domestic fair market price.
This, too, is a step in the right direction.
Third: A practice has grown up of subsidizing certain industries in a country. Under
the agreement, subsidies must not be paid to
assist a domestic industry and thus give its
products an advantage over imported competing goods.
Fourth: In the past government officials
have been authorized to place fictitious values
on goods being imported, and in this way
swell the tariff receipts. This practice is
prohibited by the agreement, and properly
so.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Farquhar: Fifth: Another indirect
practice that has prevailed has been the
imposition of excessive charges for clearing
imports. The agreement does away with this
practice, and the only charges that can be
imposed for clearing imports are the actual
costs of the services.
Sixth: In the past some countries have
found it to their advantage to restrict or prohibit imports. This agreement provides that
if they restrict or prohibit imports in future
they must not discriminate in favour of or
against any country which is a party to the
agreement.
Seventh: In rare cases subsidies may be
paid on the export of goods, but such subsidies must be very limited.
The agreement affects some 45,000 tariff
items, covering three fourths of Canada's
trade. It is permissible to lower the tariff on
any of these items, but not to raise it at any
time.
It will be seen that we are getting rid of a
number of vicious practices that have prevailed among the countries which are parties
to the agreement. In terms of 1939 trade, 90
per cent of our exports to the United States
will benefit. Almost all restrictions against
Canadian goods entering the United States
have been substantially reduced. Large tariff
reductions will apply to those products entering the United States which compete with
products of the same kind. The agreement
will be a great boost to Canadian farmers and
businessmen. It is to be hoped that the
necessary legislation will be enacted at an
early date.
In the Speech from the Throne the following paragraph occurs:
A bill will be introduced to broaden the scope of
the Family Allowances Act, as a further instalment
of the policy of the government to provide a national standard of social security and human welfare
designed to assure the greatest possible measure of
social justice for all Canadians.

The government has not yet announced the
details of its plans for the improvement of
the family allowances measure, which has
been described as the outstanding single piece
of social legislation enacted in our time. In
Canada 3,830,000 children in 1,707,000 families
are now receiving $270 million a year. This
expenditure is making a tremendous contribution towards equalizing opportunity for
Canada's children.
The government, in emphasizing its intention of assuring the greatest possible measure
of social justice in this country, is building
on the solid foundations laid by Liberal administrations over the past twenty-two years.
The Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King
will be remembered as one of the great men
in Canadian history, but no part of his

FEBRUARY 2, 1949
record merits as much praise as the contribution made by Liberal governments under his
leadership towards widening the dominion oi
social justice in Canada. The first great measure was the Old Age Pensions Act of 1927,
which now brings $70 million of federal
moneys each year to the assistance of 260,000
aged and blind Canadians. The next great
Liberal measure was unemployment insurance, which now has a national reserve of
$514 million as a bulwark against temporary
unemployment and gives protection to more
than half of Canada's working force.
The third great measure, family allowances,
followed in 1944. This was widely acclaimed,
because it was the first such piece of legislation for child welfare in the western hemisphere. This was followed by the veterans'
charter, under which more than $1,500 million
has been expended on re-establishment
credits, on university and vocational training,
rehabilitation, pensions, medical treatment
and settlement on the land.
The latest great measure for social security
was the national health program announced
last May by Mr. Mackenzie King, which
brings $30 million or more each year to the
support of provincial health programs. Very
substantial annual grants are made available
for public health and the training of health
workers; for crippled children and the fight
against tuberculosis, venereal disease, mental
illness and cancer.
The measures mentioned do not exhaust
the list of Liberal achievements. The simple
fact is that every major federal measure for
social security has been passed by a Liberal
administration, and all have been sponsored
by the former Prime Minister. The spirit of
Mackenzie King still lives on in his successor
and his associates, and Mr. King's great social
objectives are still the goals of the Liberal
party.
The Right Honourable Louis St.
Laurent, speaking to the nation by radio on
December 16, said:

to ensure the health of the whole population; social
insurance against privation resulting from unemployment, from disability, from ill health and from
old age.
The program will include a steady extension of
insurance on a contributory basis to protect all
citizens from a temporary loss of income and to provide for their old age; health insurance covering
medical, dental, surgical and hospital health services
on a contributory basis; more equal care and opportunity for all children through family allowances;
and pensions for the blind.

I have referred to the subjects mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne which to me
appear most important, but these do not by
any means exhaust the future program, which
refers to many other questions of grave
importance to the progress and welfare of
our nation.
In closing, may I say that while we in this
honourable house review with pride the
achievements of the Liberal government, we
also look forward to taking part in the future
in extending those policies which will make
for the prosperity and well-being of the Canadian nation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Joseph Willie Comeau: Honourable

FEBRUARY 2. 1949
After three years they were put to work on
Prospect highway, close to Halifax. As a
man of ambition who had been in captivity
for three years, my great-grandfather wanted
to get bis liberty if he possibly could. While
he was working on the highway he saw a
small boat off the shore, so he. and bis three
coinpanions took the boat and went out to
sea. hoping to meet some American vessel
which would take them to the United States.
As you know, France and the United States
were on good terms at the time. But after
eight or nine days, having covered about
fifty miles, and being without provisions or
water, they had to land at Port Hebert, in
Shelburne, the county of my honourable
friend the leader of the government. It happened that the first bouse to which they went
for provisions was occupied by the head of
the local militia, so they were at once apprehended again and put in jail in Sheiburne.
But I must add, to the credit of the people of
Sheiburne, that after these men had been in
jail for five or six weeks the local people
began to visit themn and brought them ahl
kinds of good things. They even circulated
a petîtion, which was sent to the government
at Halifax, to release these men from prison
s0 they could make their homes in Sheiburne.
But before the petition could reach the
Governor, an order was despatched to Shelburne with a cutter to take these men back
to Halifax. They were taken aboard ship
that evening, but it happened to be a windy
night and the vessel could not set sail. Weil,
my grandfather had taken the precaution to
carry two bottles of rum with him aboard the
cutter, and later when the guards were
patrolling the deck he invited them below
for a drink. After they had f allen to sleep
he j umped to the wharf and made bis way
across Nova Scotia, landing among the
French people at East Pubnico. There he was
hired to teach school for the enormous salary
of eight dollars a month. In my parish at
Church Point there lived a priest from Paris,
Father Sigogne. He was the only padre for
miles around. Well, in the following spring
my grandfather walked the seventy-five miles
to my parîsh and took the oath of ailegiance
before Father Sigogne, who for the convenience of the people also acted as a justice of
the peace. While in my parish my grandfather was again hired to teach school, but
this time at ten dollars a month. He was
only teaching a short time, however, when he
bought a small schooner and started to trade
between St. John and the French ports along
St. Mary Bay. He then turned to, shipbuilding, and built seventeen large schooners. In
1843 Nova Scotia was divided into five districts*. Then another change was made, dividing the province into counties. Digby county
29091-4

was one of them, and three members were
appointed to represent it: one for the French
municipality of Clare, one for the municipality of Digby and one for the county at
large. The same Francois Bourneuf ran for
the County of Digby at large, and a brother
of my grandfather ran for the municipality
of Clare. They were both elected and went
to Halifax, where with Joseph Howe they
fought for responsible government, which
was obtained during that period.
Sanie Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Comneau: 1 have flot tried to show
that my ancestors were men of distinction,
but, because we in Nova Scotia were the first
to, obtain responsible government, 1 wanted
to outline part of our history.
1 do not dlaim that the French were the
only great people produced ini Nova Scotia,
and I shall name some of the prominent men
of that province: the Honourable Joseph
Howe, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir John Thompson, the Honourable W. S. Fielding, the
Honourable Robert Borden and the Honourable George Murray. And there are many
others 1 could mention.
Honourable senators, I should like to join
with the preceding speaker-perhaps I should
have done so when I began-in offering
to His Honour the Speaker my sympathy in
his bereavement.
In conclusion I wish to, let my friends know,
wherever they may be in Nova Scotia, that I
arn ready to serve them in the Senate of
Canada just as I did for forty-two years ii
the Nova Scotia Legisiature. Thank you.
Sanie Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I do
not intend to speak this afternoon; but I
should like to congratulate the mover (Hon..
Mr. Farquhar) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Comeau) of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. I was a little prejudiced in
f avour of the seconder. I have known him
about two days longer than the mover, and
I might say that he improves on acquaintance.
I intend to speak tomorrow, when I shal
refer to certain matters they have mentioned.
I do not intend to follow the line taken by
either the mover or the seconder, for I have
not the honour of coming from a constituency
that has a long history, although Manitoba
was settled by Lord Selkirk a good many
years ago.
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

THE SENATE

ADDRESS IN REPLY

Thursday, February 3, 1949
The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Acting
Speaker (Hon. A. B. Copp) in the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
PRIVILEGE

Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie:

Honourable

senators, I rise to a very important question
of privilege affecting the printing of parliament. According to our Minutes of Proceedings, the report of the Committee of
Selection presented yesterday was read. I
think that all honourable senators who were
present yesterday know that it was not.
Further, the statement was made in debate
that yesterday's procedure was the same as
that followed in 1947 and 1948. I have taken
the liberty of checking Hansard of 1947 and
the Journals of the Senate of 1948, and I find
that in each year the report was properly
presented to the house. I mention this purely
by way of correction.
CULLERS BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill G, an

Act to repeal the Cullers Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Wishart McL. Roberîson: Honourable
senators, a few days ago I had the privilege
of introducing five bills which now appear on
the order paper for second reading. The
honourable members who have been asked
to explain these bills are prepared to do so
today. However, when these items are called
I intend to ask that they stand, so that we
may proceed this afternoon with the debate
on the Address in Reply to the Speech from
the Throne. When we adjourn today I
intend to ask that the house stand adjourned
until Tuesday evening next. At that time
we can proceed with this legislation, and perhaps continue the debate on the Address. The
members of this house possess considerable
talent and experience, and I am sure it would
be to our own benefit and that of the country
at large if as many honourable members as
possible were to express their viewpoints in
this debate.

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Farquhar
for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I said a word or two yesterday by way of
compliment to the mover and seconder of the
address, so I need not refer to them again.
I join with honourable senators who have
voiced a feeling of concern, which all Canadians share, at His Majesty's illness, and hope
for his speedy recovery. It was some relief
from the bad news to learn as we did with
delight, that a Prince Royal was born to the
heir presumptive, the Princess Elizabeth, and
that he had been named "Charlie". To people
of Scottish descent that name must be very
pleasing indeed.
I shall not discuss the Speech from the
Throne item by item, as has sometimes been
done, because nearly all of it will be the
subject of legislation, and in my judgment it
is better to wait until the various bills are
available and we know what the legislation
actually contains.
The year 1948 was an important one for
Canada, especially in the matter of the
leadership of our two great parties. The
former Prime Minister, Right Honourable W.
L. Mackenzie King, resigned, and a great
Liberal convention was held in Ottawa at
which his successor was elected. I personally
was pleased that the Liberals met in convention for this purpose. It is not very often
that conventions are held by the Liberal party.
They say that these meetings are unnecessary,
that when they get a leader they keep him
for a very long time. Well, I am not so sure
that this will be the fortune of the present
Apart from that consideration, I
leader.
suggest that a national convention is an
excellent way of hearing from the "grass
roots" people all over the country. I had
the pleasure while at my summer home of
listening to a good part of the broadcasting
of the Liberal convention, and when, according to the reporter, a gentleman in the back
of the hall asked "What about tax reduction?"
I said to myself "How familiar that sounds
to anyone who is in a position of leadership."
I am glad that the Right Honourable Mr.
St. Laurent has been selected to lead the
Liberal party. If that party should be returned
to power at the coming election, which I
expect will be held on June 27, 1949Hon. Mr. Howard: Oh, it is fixed!

FEBRUARY 3, 1949
Hon. Mr. Haig: -it will have an able
leader. It is good for Canada that a man
of his calibre has been chosen as the head
of a great national party.
During July of last year the Honourable
Mr. Bracken resigned the leadership of the
Progressive Conservative party. A representative convention met at Ottawa on the
last day of September and the two first days
of October and elected the Honourable George
Drew, formerly Premier of Ontario, to be
the party leader. There is no doubt that the
policies of the Progressive Conservative party
will be so presented that the people of this
country will understand what the issues are.
In my province we recently had the pleasure
of a visit by Mr. Drew and his wife. While
I do not want to bring women into this
discussionHon. Mr. Euler: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: -although there are in this
house two distinguished members of the sex
-Mr. Drew, in the parlance of the street,
will have to "go some" if he is going to be
as popular in Canada as his wife appears
to be.
The choice of Mr. Drew as leader of our
party gives representation to the newer element, the younger men. Mr. Drew was one
of the generation that fought in the first
world war. He represents also one of the
two greatest provinces of Canada, and is
necessarily interested, therefore, in the development of Canada as a whole, for no
province other than Quebec has anywhere
near the stake in Canadian prosperity that
Ontario has. Ontario has provided the leader
of the Progressive Conservative party, and
Quebec has furnished the Liberal party with
its leader. So whichever of these two men is
elected-for it is unlikely that the C.C.F. or
the Social Credit party will materially affect
the result-the government of the country
will be controlled by a man and a party who
are determined to give the best administration possible.
An interesting example of the relation of
cause and effect occurred at the Progressive
Conservative convention. The program which
had been adopted contained not only general
principles, but a reference to items of what
may be called administrative policy, such as
the building of a highway across Canada.
When Mr. Drew rose to accept the leadership
it is doubtful whether he intended to single
out this particular item, because it was only
one of the planks in the party platform, but
it apparently suited his purpose by way of
illustration.
Within a very few days a
clamour arose right across Canada for action
in this matter. The federal minister from
Alberta, Hon. Mr. MacKinnon, suggested that

a conference be called to deal with the subject. Canada, beyond question, needs a transCanadian highway, for its own people, quite
apart from tourist traffic.
I am doubtful whether the highway will
ever be properly built unless the work is
carried on under the supervision of engineers
appointed jointly by the dominion and the
provinces, and there is a reasonable contribution by the dominion, although the road will
be under the control of the provinces. Only
in this way will it be possible to cover great
sections of territory where little immediate
local use can be anticipated. I have particularly in mind certain mountain districts of
British Columbia, wide stretches of Ontario,
and considerable parts of the Maritime
provinces. I am pleased that the Minister of
Mines and Resources has called a meeting to
deal with this subject, and I am sure that, no
matter which party is in power, the Canadian
government will push forward the enterprise
more energetically in the future than it has
done hitherto.
My honourable friend the chairman of the
Committee on Tourist Traffic (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) will remind me, no doubt, that
this road is urgently needed for the development of our tourist traffic. The main difficulty
is the enormous cost. The province of Manitoba is building a highway from the United
States boundary to Winnipeg, and although.
the distance is only about sixty-five miles, it
is costing millions of dollars and will involvea great deal of work. The chief purpose, of
course, is to enable tourists from the United
States to travel into our country along the
kind of road to which they are accustomed.
These people are tourist-minded, but they
will visit us only if we provide suitable
facilities to enable them to come here.
I notice that abolition of appeals to the
Privy Council is foreshadowed in the Speech
from the Throne. Without dealing at any
length with that topic, I would say this. I do
not think appeals to the Privy Council should
be abolished when they affect differences of
opinion between the provinces and the
dominion. Once in a while there is a clash
of jurisdiction between a province and the
dominion, and in such cases I think it would
be better that the appeal be sent to the Privy
Council. I shall not deal further with this
matter until the legislation is before us.
I am sorry that my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) is not here,
because I want to discuss rent control. There
is 76 per cent less occupancy of houses today'
than there was in 1938. This is due to rent
control, and nothing else. Let me give you
an example of why rent control cannot succeed. My wife and I occupy a house which
consists of six bedrooms, two bathrooms, and
various other facilities. We cannot rent part

SENATE

of the house, because, if we let people come
under our roof we do not know that we can
ever get them out again.
.Hon. Mr. Duff: That is the trouble.
lion. Mr. Haig: Hundreds of Canadians are
in the same position. I also own a smaller
house that we should like to move into
because it is better suited to our needs. It
is true that when our six children were with
us we required all the space we had, but we
do not need so much accommodation now,
I cannot get into this smaller house, even
though the present tenant pays only the same
rent as he paid in 1938.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why do the provinces
not take this over?
Hon. Mr. Haig: If I were in the Manitoba
Legislature, I would certainly advocate that
they take it over. It is my judgment that the
provinces do not want the trouble or the
annoyance.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would my honourable
friend make clearer what he means by 76
per cent less occupancy?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Less occupancy per house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Less overcrowding.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When children move out
of a house their parents cannot sell it because
they cannot get suitable accommodation.
This means that two or three people continue
to live in a house that will accomodate as
many as seven or eight.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There has been doubling up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, there has not been
doubling up. Here is the situation. If my
money is invested in housing, the government does not permit me any increase in
revenue from my property; but if my money
is invested in stocks or bonds or such things,
I am allowed a profit if it is forthcoming. I
cannot make a profit from renting my house,
and my tenant has to pay only half what he
should pay. That is one reason why our
housing problem is so acute.
I may be a prophet of gloom, but I venture
to say that five years from now the houses
which the government are building will cause
a scandal in this country. It would shake
you to see the way they are building them
in rhy town-and the situation is the same
all over Canada. Let us examine the housing
situation in France, which is one of the worst
in Europe today. In France rent controls
were imposed right after the last war, and
they are still in effect. Austria also tried
rent controls, and the government of that

country had to build block after block of
apartment buildings in an attempt to accommodate their people. Our present housing
administrator is adopting all sorts of schemes
in order to beat the law. Do not misunderstand me; I mean exactly what I say. Here
is one scheme: If I own an apartment block,
as soon as a suite of rooms becomes vacant,
it is freed from the controls. Here is another
scheme: If two years ago, I gave a lease on
a house, that house comes out from under the
controls as soon as the lease expires. I am
not sure of my dates, but I do not think that
any house built after January 1, 1947, is
under rent control. The administrator is
trying to sneak out. I use that term advisedly.
It would be far better to say that the provinces have the right to legislate in the matter
of rent controls. In my judgment it comes
under the heading of property and civil
rights. I think only one province has made
inquiries; the others have not come forward
and said that they wanted the job.
Hon. Mr. Farris: They all refused it last
week.
Hon. Mr. Haig: One made inquiries, three
or four said nothing, and the rest are waiting.
Hon. Mr. Howard: To use your term, the
provinces sneaked out of the job.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They never got into it,
because they were too foxy for that. I cannot understand why the Minister of Finance,
who bas the reputation of being an able
administrator, ever got into rent controls, or
why, having got into it, he has not got out.
After the end of the war the controls should
have been taken off, and the provinces been
left to re-impose them if they saw fit.
I now wish to refer to electrical power.
I am one of those who believe that we should
have a Dominion-Provincial Commission to
investigate and make a full report on all our
potential power resources. We in Manitoba
never thought for one moment that our province would ever be short of power, but the
experts now predict that if the increase in the
use of electricity during the next five years
continues at the sarne rate as in the past five
years-even if all our present power sites are
developed-by 1952 we shall be looking elsewhere for electricity.
An Hon. Senalor: If we can get it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are quite right. The
situation in Ontario is not good, and in British
Columbia it is very acute. The Lord did not
send rain, but lots of snow and ice, and there
is no water in the dams or power sites. The
power question has been a troublesome one
for many years in Quebec and the Maritime
provinces. I understand that investigations

FEBRUARY 3, 1949

are now being made into the feasibility of
harnessing the tidal waters of the Bay of
Fundy. Ontario and Quebec both have a
great deal of natural power, and the development of the St. Lawrence River as a power
site is a possibility. There are objections to
the development of the river as a ship canal
or seaway. I can understand such objections,
especially from the Maritime Provinces,
because they have the seaports of Saint John
and Halifax. There may be objections also
from Quebec City and Montreal, as the
development of the seaway would permit
ships to go straight through to Port Arthur
and Fort William or Windsor and Toronto
and so on. But why anybody should object
to the development of power on the St.
Lawrence river I cannot understand. The
great state of New York is agreeable to it,
and I think that if the United States Senate
does not pass the waterways bill this year
the Canadian government should assist
Ontario and Quebec in the development of
power.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The United States President is not agreeable.
Hon. Mr. Haîg: That may be, but he is only
one person, and congress has overridden him
quite often in the past few years. The
trouble is that our government have not done
anything to force the issue. They would like
to have the seaway opened up first, and that
is understandable; but I do not think it can
be done, because I believe the resistance of
the Atlantic states to it will be too strong.
Therefore I say our government should do
everything they can to bring about power
development on the St. Lawrence.
We all know what a convenience electricity
is in city homes. But what about rural homes
and farms? We are extending the use of
electrical power in the rural parts of Manitoba, and farmer after farmer has said to
me: "Haig, you have no idea what a boon
electrical power is to us. It makes it possible
for us to have practically all the conveniences
that you have in the city." Honourable
senators, I think that the government of
Canada should not only do everything they
can to have power developed on the St. Lawrence, but should examine the electrical
power situation from one end of the country
to the other. On the Nelson river in Manitoba,
one of the world's large power sites, we have
8 million horsepower. We are absolutely sure
of a constant supply of water there, because
in addition to drainage from our own province and the Rocky Mountains we get drainage from the great watershed of Minnesota.
The difficulty is that the Nelson river is 400
miles away from the city of Winnipeg.

Now I wish to say something about foreign
exchange. About two years ago I was doubtful as to what should be done in this matter,
but I confess to the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that a
speech of his started me thinking, and the
more I thought the more I was convinced
that world trade will never revive until there
is stability in exchange.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not see how it is possible for me as a Canadian to sell wheat to
somebody in Europe so long as the money
that I am paid for it turns out to be worth
only about half as much as I thought it was
worth. The theories of Bank of Canada
officials and other experts may sound fine,
but I do not believe they will work. No
country needs world trade as badly as
Canada does, but we cannot develop world
trade until we establish a firm system of
exchange. I noticed in this morning's papers
that the government have warned exporters
not to send goods to the Argentine, and have
told them that if they do make shipments
they will run the risk of not getting any
money for them.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think it was the Governor of the Bank of Canada who said that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but the government
are taking the responsibility for it. That is
an illustration of the kind of thing I am talking about. In November my honourable
friend from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) and I,
with two members from the House of Commons, had the pleasure of being delegates
from Canada to the Parliamentary Conference at Bermuda. I shall make further
reference to this later. We discussed defence,
economics, the future of parliamentary government and so on, but one topic that we
always came back to was the need for some
basis of exchange for trade between countries, though we never could agree what that
basis should be. As I said before, I do not
think any other country needs world trade
as badly as Canada does. It is the very lifeblood of the part of Canada that I know best
-Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta-for
I should think that 90 per cent of our income
out there is derived from foreign trade in
wheat, cattle and other farm products, and
in fish and timber. It is true that our exports
of timber are not as large as those of British
Columbia or the Maritimes, but they are
considerable. For all our exports we depend
upon getting paid with something that we can
use to buy other goods. The government have
been congratulating themselves that in the
month of September last we sold to the
United States so many million dollars worth

SENATE
of goods more than in September of the previous year. Well, that is easily explained by
the lifting of the embargo on cattle. There is
no question that the moment the embargo
was lifted our receipts of American exchange
increased greatly.
The government have guaranteed flax
growers $4 a bushel, and there is a huge
amount at present stored in western Canada
-I am not sure, but I think it is 12 million
bushels. It cannot be sold anywhere. It cannot be sold in Europe, for instance, because
under the United States regulations it is
declared to be a surplus product in European
countries. The government are also guaranteeing a price for potatoes down in New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; and a
price for apples-but perhaps I had better
not mention that.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Is there not still a
demand for flax for boiled oil?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is, but the flax
already in storage is sufficient to meet the
demand. This flax will be disposed of in
time, perhaps some years from now. In the
meantime our farmers are not going to grow
flax, unless the government give them
another guarantee, and I do not think the
government will be foolish enough to do that.
These problems and many others facing us
today could be solved if we had a better
system of exchange. The sooner exchange
becomes a commodity that can be freely sold
in the world, the better it will be for Canada.
What surprises me is that a Liberal government would defend such controls as we have
in Canada. When the Foreign Exchange Control bill first came before us, I advocated that
the control be limited to a certain number of
years. I see that we are to have another bill
before us this session. Well, if I were a
C.C.F. supporter I would ask for nothing
better than the present Foreign Exchange
Control bill in perpetuity, for if that party
got into office it would need nothing more
than that measure to enable it to stay in
office and run this country. That is a bad
situation. I am against the control, and I
intend to oppose the bill to the best of my
ability when it comes before us this year.
I was going to say something about the
income tax, but I see that Liberal members
of another place are talking about that. It
seems to me strange that they should do so.
I thought that last year the Minister of
Finance would make a really serious amendment to the income tax law. By their own
admission the government have collected this
year at least $600 million more than they
need to carry on the business of the country. That was a straight tax on the people,
and it helped to create inflation and increase
the cost of living. After all, the men and

women who work for wages and salaries
are not so much concerned about the amount
of their incomes as shown on their employers'
books, as the amount of money that he or
she receives after the tax is paid. What is
important to them is not how much they
make, but how much they take home. For
instance, when the bookkeeper in my office
prepares the cheques for the payroll, she
first has to deduct the income tax.
ion. Mr. Kinley: The employees cannot
spend that amount, so it does not add to the
inflationary trend.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. There is the difficulty.
T-e members of my staff say to me: "Mr.
Haig, you used to pay me $80 a month. Since
then my salary has been increased to $100
a month, but I still receive only $80. I want
$125 a month so that I will have $100 net".
That probemn is common to every business.
My office acts for certain unions, and those
people make no bones about the reason for
their demands. They say that back in 1938
they received a net take-home pay of $100
a month, and that now, regardless of what we
say about taxes, unemployment insurance and
all the other things, they have to have that
amount in their pockets. The fact that certain members of my staff who once received
$100 a month now demand $125, means that
I have to charge more for my services-and
that is exactly what I do, and so does everybody else.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Are there no controls on
your charges?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In theory there are, but not
in practice.
I believe that the first thing that must be
done is to increase the income tax exemptions
for both single and married people. In addition
to that, a general cut of income tax across
the board would benefit everybody. People
in every occupation who receive a certain
amount of money want to invest a portion of
it in the enterprises of this country. There is
no country in the world that is in greater need
of enterprise-capital than Canada. We have
great natural resources and unlimited possibilities; Canadians are energetic people, and
if they can invest their earnings in industries
at home the difficulties resulting from borrowing abroad for this purpose will be
avoided. I think our income tax rates are
out of proportion to what a young country
like Canada can afford.
I come now to the main subject of my
remarks. About three years ago I stood up
in this house and said that I thought the
British wheat agreement was the rottenest
deal I had ever heard of. If I could use
stronger language about that agreement today
I would, but without being unparliamentary

FEBRUABY 3, 1949
that is as far as I can go. I asked for and
received certain information from the head of
the Manitoba Wheat Board and the president
of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, and I have
also gathered data from other sources. I am
reluctant to take the time of the house to read
from an article which I have before me, but
it is essential to illustrate my point. I refer
to the report of the Searle Grain Company
Limited, dated October 20, 1948. It says:
"The Western Producer", which is the house organ
of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, in a recent issue
publishes an editorial entitled "Supply and Demand." The editorial quotes a farmer, who points
out that "wheat was about $3.30 per bushel on
January 15, 1948, and thirty days later it was about
Then this farmer correspondent goes on to
$2.40."
ask: "Was there a greater supply of wheat on
February 15 than there was on January 15, and if so,
where did the wheat come from? I am certain we
farmers did not produce a new crop in the meantime."
"The Western Producer" informs this correspondent that this severe drop in price was not warranted by the factors of supply and demand, but is
a flagrant example of how price is made by hordes
of uninformed gamblers and manipulators.

Now here is the answer and I challenge
anyone to dispute it.
Surely "The Western Producer" could have given
this correspondent the correct explanation as to
why the price of wheat fell so drastically between
January 15 and February 15, for the explanation
bas over and over again been widely published in
Europe, in the United States and in Canada. It is
simply that during the latter part of January the
news suddenly burst over the world that much
greater supplies of wheat would soon be available;
that the Argentine and Australia were harvesting
larger crops than expected; that Europe was expected to harvest some 450 million bushels more
than in the previous year; that Burma had an exceptionally large rice crop; and that the American
winter wheat crop, on a large acreage, was coming
through in good shape. All of which meant that
the, supply of wheat in the world would certainly
be far greater than in the previous year.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Who made that statement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have already said that I
was reading from the report of the Searle
Grain Company, written by Mr. Strange.
To back up this statement, the Canadian
Wheat Board cut prices to the foreign trade
so that the manipulators could not manipulate
the price of their wheat. They were not on
a margin and they could not be sold out, yet
they had to bring the price down.
I could quote from many articles along this
line, but I wish only to refer to some information from Mr. McIvor. He informs me
that in 1946-47 the Western provinces produced 393 million bushels, and delivered to
the elevators 335 million bushels; that the
production for 1947-48-that is the crop
before last-was 315 million bushels, of
which 243 million bushels were marketed. I
presume some producers, like my honourable

friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Horner), still have
considerable grain in their granaries. In
1948-49 the Western provinces produced 363
million bushels, and delivered 300 million
bushels to the elevators. Of the 1946-47 crop,
169 million bushels were shipped to Great
Britain at $1.55 a bushel. Mr. Melvor tells
me that some of the wheat was shipped as
flour, and that to make up for the bran and
shorts taken out they had to ship an extra
nine million bushels. I presume he is correct
in that explanation. Exports to other countries amounted to 77-8 million bushels, and
75 million bushels went to the domestic
market. I intend to deal only with the
1946-47 crop, and see where it takes us.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What did the producers get for the 77 million bushels sold to
other countries?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will deal with that point.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Have you got the
figures there?
Hon. Mr. Haig: From the 1946 crop, the
Canadian government sold to Great Britain
169 million bushels at $1.55; 75 million
bushels were sold to the Canadian people at
the same price, but the consumer paid only
78 cents, the difference being made up out
of public funds, and the remaining 77-8 million bushels were sold on the world market at
what is called the "weighed price." The
price on the public market was at that time
$3.00 or $3.25 a bushel, but the fairer way
is to take the price throughout the year,
which was $2.44& a bushel.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That was the average?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That was the average price
on the 77-8 million bushels-$2.44k per
bushel. But on the 169 million bushels 89
cents per bushel, or roughly $160 million,
was lost to the farmers of Western Canada.
It is true that Great Britain got the benefit
of the reduced price, but Britain at the same
time was buying Argentine wheat at $2.72
per bushel. On the sale of some 75 million
bushels of Canadian wheat we took a loss of
99 cents a bushel, or about $74 million. For
the balance the Board got the world price;
and all the money that the pools have today
is their extra receipts from that 78 million
bushels which were sold to the world at large,
plus what was left-which was very littlefrom the 1945-46 crop. The same general
conditions applied the following year.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Do you contend that
the British government would have bought
our wheat if they had not got it at that price?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The world would have
bought it. There is no question about that.

Why should the farmer out in the country

point; I arn just asking how your figures are
arrived at.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I arn tellîng you.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask another
question, because I arn very much interested.
The honourable senator dlaims that the
farmers have lost $500 million on wheat. Is
he basing his opinion on the assumption that
there is no rnoney in the hands of the Wheat
Board today to be distributed to the farmers?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Having figured the amount
which the Wheat Board sold on the world
market, and the price they received, I say
that the total money in their hands is $78
million. That is ail there is. In the first
year they paid $1 .35 a bushel and they got
$1.55; the difference of 20 cents per bushel is
in their hands too, but it is the farmers'
money. I have allowed for every cent that
the farmer will now get or has ever got.
The only item of which 1 amn ignorant is
what was left over in 1945, and I have no
way of getting that information.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
will admit that we do not know what the
farmer is going to get when the final winding
up of the contract takes place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That has ahl been taken into
account.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It would reduce his
loss.
Han. Mr. Haig: I have considered all that.
On the 77-8 million bushels they sold to the
world, the government granted the f armer
only $1.35; but I took into account the value
of that wheat-$2.44 in 1946 and $2.88 in
1947. 1 have covered ahl that. I know there
is money in the pool to that extent. I know,
as the commissioner says that they sold s0
many millions of bushels, but the whole thîng
bouls down to this: The people ask me "Wasn't
it a good thing to sell wheat to Britain for
$1.55?" and I answer "Yes, certainly." But
if the farmers 0f Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta sehi their wheat to the British people,
why should the rest of us boast and say:
"Didn't we do well by Great Britain?". We
would be entitled to take the credit if we

paid back to the farmers of Western Canada
-and we know who they are, because the
government has a record of every one of
them-the losses they suffered. First, for the
75 million bushels sold to the people of
Canada we should certainly pay what the
wheat was worth, and second, we should pay
the difference between $1.55 and $2.44 in 1946
and $1.55 and $2.88 in 1947.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask the honourable senator another question?

enough. I want to apologize to the house for
taking up so much time. With the exception

not fully appreciate the difficulties encountered by the lumbermen of British Columbia.
But I do know something about wheat, and

was a reception at Government House. Mr.
Burton, the member for Humbolt in another
place, asked me when the reception was to
be held, and I said it was Tuesday at six.
On that day we arrived at Government House,
perhaps five minutes early, and to our surprise
found that no other delegates were there. A
page-boy happened to come along and I told
him who we were, so he notified an aide de
camp. When the aide came it was five minutes
after six, and I remarked to him that we
appeared to be a little early, although our
invitation was for six o'clock. He said, "Yes,
the reception is at six o'clock, but it is not
until Friday evening."
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Where had you been
just before?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Anyway, we were at the
reception on Friday, and among the persons
whom I had the pleasure of meeting there
were some of the officers of the British cruiser
Achilles, which played such a wonderful part
in the battle of the River Plate, when the
German battle ship Admiral Graf Spee was
chased into harbour. I feel that gatherings
such as the Parliamentary Conference do
much to foster friendship between nations,
and certainly between representatives of
various nations. I know that I personally
benefitted by my attendance at the Bermuda
conference, and I am sure that the honourable
senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) and
our fellow delegates from the House of Commons would say the same for themselves.
There are some stories that I could tell about
my honourable friend from Essex, but I
promise to keep them a secret so long as he
does not tell stories on me. Seriously, we had
a profitable as well as a most pleasant time
and were proud to be able to do what we
could there on behalf of Canada.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I was in London at the time of the
news that the illness of His Majesty made it
necessary to postpone the projected tour of
the King and Queen to Australia and New
Zealand; and I was in Glasgow when the
birth of a son and heir to the Duke and
Duchess of Edinburgh was announced. On
each occasion I sensed the deep interest and
concern of the people of the United Kingdom
in the welfare of the Royal family. This
interest and concern is shared by the people
throughout the commonwealth, in whose
hearts the Royal Family holds an intimate
place, and I am sure we all concur in the
sentiments so well expressed along this line
by the honourable leader opposite.
I had intended to follow my honourable
friend today in this debate, but if I carried
out this plan I might not be able to do justice
to some of the points that he has made; there-

fore, after dealing with one or two matters,
I may ask permission of the house to adjourn
the debate until next week.
I am sure we all listened with the greatest
pleasure to the speech of the mover (Hon. Mr.
Farquhar) and that of the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Comeau) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I heartily concur
in their references to Mr. Mackenzie King,
who for so long has occupied the position of
leader of the Liberal party and Prime Minister. I heartily concur also in the remarks
of the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) with
respect to the new leaders of the Liberal and
Conservative parties in Canada. Whatever
difference of opinion there may be as to their
respective policies, I am sure we all agree
that Canada is very fortunate in having men
of such high calibre occupying these promment positions in our public life.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The arguments of the
mover of the Address (Hon. Mr. Farquhar)
were exceedingly well marshalled and clearly
stated. As a free trader I had much pleasure
in listening to his plea for lower tariffs and
freer trade. But I know he will understand
me when I say that my heart was especially
touched by the speech of the seconder, the
honourable gentleman from Digby-Clare
(Hon. Mr. Comeau), whose constituency is
so close to my own. He has had a long experience in public life and he represents one
of the minorities in Nova Scotia. As I listened to him it struck me that his presence
here was further proof of the wisdom inherent in our system of parliamentary representation, of which system we have a good
example in the Senate. For instance, there is
no statute providing that any particular sections or any particular groups in Nova
Scotia shall have senatorial representation,
yet there is what amounts almost to an
unwritten law that all the various sections
and groups shall be represented, and in the
result we have a very happy arrangement.
When I was in Europe last year I realized
how true it is that racial questions are at the
base of a great deal of the bitterness and
dissension troubling that continent and indeed
much of the world, and I was more than ever
impressed by the successful way in which we
have handled our problem here. Canada has
by commo'i sense and fair dealing on the
part of different groups that have been in
power at various times, set an example to
the world. The Senate was created for the
protection of minorities, and is a living
example of fair dealing. But there has rarely
been a time since confederation when this
house has had to exercise its power in that

SENATE
respect. Because of the innate good judgment of the people of Canada, few minority
problems have arisen.
I come fron the province of Nova Scotia, as
does my honourable friend from Digby-Clare
(Hon. Mr. Comeau), and I agree that the relations between the majority and the minority
there are of the happiest. I frequently visit
the province of Quebec, and in Montreal
where I have many friends, I have never
heard of one person of English descent being
discriminated against by the French majority. This too, is a living example of the
good judgment and the common sense of the
Canadian people in dealing with racial
problems.
I am happy to welcome my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Comeau) as a colleague from
the province of Nova Scotia. I am a very
much more recent arrival on the political
scene than he is, with his forty-two years'
experience. My experience is about half
that. He has had a most creditable career.
He, the honourable senator from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) and I were
elected members of the legislature of our
province in 1928.
I have one or two matters to which I should
like to refer this afternoon, and then, with
deference to my honourable friend the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), it is my intention
to adjourn the debate until Tuesday evening
next, when I shall deal more fully with some
of his arguments.
In passing, I wish to point out that my
friend is a little out in his chronology of
events. He took considerable pride in saying
that the subject of the trans-Canada highway
was mentioned at the recent Conservative
convention in Ottawa and that the Liberal
party acted accordingly. I would point out
to him that two months before the Conservatives met there was a very well-attended
convention of the Liberal party in Ottawa
and that the Conservative group paid us a
compliment by copying in almost every
detail, improving where it was possible, our
convention scheme. I have no doubt that my
friend's party read carefully the report of our
convention proceedings, and then advocated
the completion of the trans-Canada highway.
I attach no great importance to the point, but
one must remember that there is no difficulty
in spending money as long as our finances
make the spending possible.
The honourable leader opposite expressed
himself most emphatically on what he believes
to be an injustice to the wheat growers of
the West because they were not allowed to
sell their product at the highest market price.
I am not prepared to answer fully my friend's
arguments this afternoon, but it appears to

me that the conditions he referred to do not
apply only to wheat growing. For instance,
the Dominion Steel and Coal Company of
the province of Nova Scotia felt that the
government had done them a great injustice
in not permitting them to sell on the best
markets at home and abroad. The company
contended that they should be compensated
by the Dominion Government for the difference between the price for which they sold
their product and the price which they at one
time could have sold it. I do not know that
their claim would have involved the astronomical figures conjured up by my honourable
friend as applying to wheat, but the principle
is the same. I am quite sure that my friend
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill)
would feel that the same argument could be
made on behalf of the lumbering industry.
The price of lumber both on the local and
export markets has been constantly controlled.
In fact, I scarcely know of a single article
of commerce in this country that has not
been affected by government regulation for
the purpose of keeping down the price to
the consumer. Should the party of my
honourable friend opposite come into power,
and should they attempt to settle the proposed
claims of the Western farmers, they would
find a great many other people making claims
for losses sustained by reason of the fact
that they could not take advantage of the
best markets. It should also be pointed out
that on the basis of need, the farmers in
western Canada, in fact all the Canadian
people, are better off today than when wheat
was selling at $3 and $4 a bushel. Never in
the history of our country has business been
on a sounder basis than it is now.
My honourable friend has been consistent
in his opposition to rental controls. I am not
sure that he speaks for his party in that
respect, but I have no doubt that if the
claims of the wheat farmers were met, every
landlord in the country would claim from
the government the difference between the
rent be was permitted to charge and that
which, under the circumstances, he could
have obtained. Such claims would be just as
legitimate as those of the wheat farmers. My
honourable friend from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis) shakes ber head, but I say that
without controls the whole price structure
would move up thirty or forty per cent. It
must be remembered that we are all consumers and are all interested in what is best
for the economy of Canada.
I do not think the argument advanced by
the leader opposite on behalf of the western
farmer is very sound. It may appeal to the
people in his section of the country, but I
would remind him of what happened during
and after the first World War-the farmers
received top-notch prices for wheat during the

he cannot do anything with them, his business collapses. One can make many sorts of
arguments to prove a particular point. But
they do not affect my basic contention. I do
not suggest that our record was perfect, or
that if we had to go to war again-which
God forbid-we would not improve on the
general program which followed the beginning of the last war. But I say to the honourable senator from Peterborough that no
future government, be it Liberal, Conservative, or any other, will again enter upon a
major war without controls over prices. Any
government which permitted vicious elements
in this country to fleece the people lef t and
right would not last a moment: public
opinion would drive it out of office. As to
accusations of unfairness, it is impossible,
human nature being as it is, that everything
shall be absolutely right. I have always felt
that something must be wrong in a system
which drags a boy from his home and throws
him into the vortex of war and leaves somebody else at liberty to make any amount of
money he can.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Nobody is advocating
that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I repeat, no system is
perfect; the question is what degree of weight
should be attached to such a contention as
that raised by my honourable friend.
I do not intend to deal with all the questions involved in this discussion: some I feel,
should be left to be dealt with by my many
talented colleagues around me. But I wish to
give some attention to one matter to which
my honourable friend has referred, and
which has received considerable notice in
the press, and that is the severe criticism
of the government because it has a surplus.
It would be over-stating the facts to say that
I belong to another age, and am old fashioned,
but I find it difficult to become horrified at
a government for being possessed of a surplus. I lived in the county of Shelburne,
which formed part of the constituency of
the Honourable Mr. Fielding, and, perhaps
for that reason I was trained to think that
surpluses and the careful administration of
finances were things to be proud of and a
good omen for the future of the country. So
it is difficult for me to understand why there
is so much surprise that a Liberal government has had these surpluses, or why it is
so viciously attacked on that ground. I have
given a good deal of thought to the subject,
and it is my belief that the attitude of my
honourable friends opposite arises from the
fact that they do not know what surpluses
are. If I should happen to be wrong, I should
like to be corrected by the statistically-minded
leader of the opposition, who juggled so many

figures today that he had me dizzy, and who
is such a financial expert that I will give him
the opportunity of checking me up. In going
carefully through the records, I have discovered that although Canadian confederation has lasted for over eighty years, and
although, particularly during the last century,
my honourable friends governed the country
a good part of the time, there were only two
years in which a Conservative government
had a surplus.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: That explains it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The first occasion was
earlier than anyone in this house can remember. Apparently in 1871 there was a surplus
of $30,000. The second time was in 1913,
earlier than either of the lady members of
this house can recall. I am not sure that the
Conservatives were to blame for the surplus
in that year. True, they were in power, but
the surplus related to the year that ended
in March, 1913, and I think the Fielding
tradition still carried on. It took them more
than a year to get clear of the surplus. From
that day to this there is no record of a Conservative government in Canada having a
surplus. I shall stand corrected if the statistically-minded leader of the opposition states
otherwise.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should like to ask my
honourable friend a question. If what he says
is true, why did the people of DigbyAnnapolis-Kings vote the way they did? What
was the reason they changed their vote? My
honourable friend has been discussing surpluses, and that was one of the issues.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There were a good
many issues to be considered. One of the
strangest things I have found in my entire
political career is the fact that a good many
of our hard-headed leading businessmen have
chosen to follow the Conservative party. They
are represented in the other place by sound
businessmen who feel that it is wise in their
own affairs to spend less than they take in.
They declare that that policy is part and parcel of good business, and I agree with them.
In their individual businesses these men are
scrupulous about this doctrine, but when it
comes to government finances they throw it
out the winlow. They rather seem to delight
in deicits, and they hold up their hands in
holy horror at the prospect of a surplus.
My honourable friends opposite would like
to see the income tax reduced. I find no
fault with that, but I can tell them that the
prospects of reducing income tax are much
better if there is a surplus instead of a
deficit. You can try to fool the public by
saying, "Oh, we will cut the income tax
whether or not the finances of the country

FEERUARY 3, 1949
warrant it". But this just does flot; work in
this day and age. We Liberals were never
supposed to have the business judgment of
the Conservatives, but we have always
believed that sound government finance is
the basis of ail prosperity, and that only when
your house is in order can you recommend to
parhiament that they reduce taxes. I think
it is a curious hangover that causes my Conservative friends to adopt an attitude towards
goverriment finances which. is different from
the one they adopt in their own private businesses. It is not that they do not know
better. My honourable friends opposite have
keen minds, but they are stili thinking of
days gone by, when the Conservative party
thought that the public wouhd hîsten to almost
anything. That does not hold true today. The
government can only reduce the taxes with
public approval, and governmeflt finances
must first indicate that a reduction is justified. If you want proof of this look to the
United States. When Mr. Truman automaticahhy became the President of the United
States he was sneered at by the masterminds of the American business world as
being quite incapable of grasping the great
problems of public finance. Honourable senators wilh recaîl what happened a year or two
ago when he recommended to Congress that
no reduction be made in the income tax. The
Repubhican party, which represented the
business interests of that country, held that
there must be a reduction in taxation. Mr.
Truman's answer was that although the country was in a prosperous condition it was going
to be faced with heavy expenditures, and that
because of the demands that would be made
on the treasury in the future it was undesirable to reduce taxes. As honourable senators
know, the mai ority of the members of Congress at that time were of a different pohitical
faith fromn that of the head of the goverfiment-a situation that couhd not exist under
our system-and they vetoed his measure on
one. or perhaps two, occasions. Then when he
mrade a third atternpt to prevent a reduction
in taxation, the Republicans and certain
Democrats united to override him, to show
what they thought the country wanted, no
matter what the financial consequences might
be. Let me tell my honourable friends that
they shouhd not underestimate the peophe's
knowledge of public affairs. No government
should. I behieve that public opinion will support you in a reduction of taxation if finances
justif y it. But if you adopt an indiff erent attitude, as thse Republicans did in thse United
States, you run the risk that the public wil
know as mucis as or more than you do about
finances, and will treat you accordinghy.

Hon. Mr. Horner: President Truman secured the farm vote because he did flot; give
away their wheat. They receive double the
price our farmers get.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: At any rate in order
to balance the budget, President Truman has
now asked for increased taxes.
I have taken the greatest pride in the present government's record of financial administration both before and since 1 became a
member of it. During the war we elected to
pay for hall the cost of it as we went along.
That was hard to do, but the Minister of
Finance predicted that we would enjoy the
benefits of this policy later. We are, indeed,
reaping the benefits today, and shall continue
to do so for some time. We must not forget
that we have to pay for our wars. Those who
believe otherwise are not realistic thinkers.
Because of the business-like handling of our
finances by the Liberal government during
the war, we are now in a position to boast
that, despite the income tax reductions made
in the United States, our taxes today are
lower than those in that country and infinitely
lower than those in Great Britain, two
countries where the situation is most comparable with ours.
I quote the following from the budget
speech made by the Minister of Finance on
May 18 hast year:

statement that three out of every four Canadians

So that there may be no misunderstanding
I quote frorn the saine speech the assumptions on which the comparisons between the
Canadian and United States taxes were made:

2. Ail taxpayers assumed to take full advantage of
the provisions for splitting incomes between husband
and wife.
3. New York State income tax included in calculati.n.

As hornourable memrbers know, in the United
States there is also a state income tax.
I place these facts on record to emphasize
the happy position that the people of Canada

SENATE

are in today as a result of careful administration during the war. Our house has been
kept in order, and for two successive years
we have had surpluses on a large scale, which
could be used-I put it in this way, for of
course I am not in a position to make any
definite statement on the matter-which could
be used, with the approval of the sound
business people of this country, for reduction
purposes without injuring the country's financial condition. I say that is a most commendable position, and my honourable
friends are wrong in choosing to be so indifferent to it. Let me remind them that at the
corresponding period after the last war, when
they were administering the affairs of the
country, there was no surplus.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: And no high income taxes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There were no surpluses at that time; make no mistake about
that. I repeat that we are today in a sound
and happy position. Despite very heavy
increases in expenses of one kind and another
there is a surplus, and our tax on incomes up
to the $2,500 bracket is lower than that in
any comparable country. In case any of us
in the higher income brackets are inclined to
feel sorry for ourselves, let me point out that
there is no capital gains tax in this country
such as there is in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: But there is a luxury tax
and an 8 per cent sales tax.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: There are other taxes
in the United States also, but at the moment
I am discussing income taxes, which my
honourable friends are so concerned about.
It is difficult to understand the indifference
of my honourable friends to our surpluses;
the only way I can account for it is that my
honourable friends have had so little experience with surpluses that they do not understand what they are.
Honourable senators, I have already taken
more time than I intended to take this afternoon. There are a number of points brought
up by my honourable friend that I have
not dealt with, but I am surrounded by a
great deal of talent on this side and I do not
want to discuss every question that is raised.
I hope to have an opportunity later to say
something of my experiences overseas as a
delegate to the United Nations Assembly.
Therefore I shall not detain the house longer
at this time, nor shall I ask permission to
inflict myself further upon the house when
the debate is resumed.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators, I
move adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill B, an Act to amend the
Cheese and Cheese Factory Improvement Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable
senator from King's to explain this bill.
Hon. J. A. McDonald: Honourable senators, this bill, if passed, will amend section
8 of chapter 13 of the act of 1939. Honourable members who were here when that
measure was passed will be pleased to know
that it has accomplished its purpose, namely
to encourage the improvement of the quality
of Canadian Cheddar cheese. It was a matter
of great importance to improve the quality of
this important export product of our great
dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Does my honourable
friend not think he would be more correct if
he added the word "former" when referring
to the great dairy industry of Canada?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It is still a great dairy
industry.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It is the great "oleo" industry now.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: As I think honourable
members know, the producers did a great job
during the war years in not only enhancing
the quality but materially increasing the
quantity of cheese which we supplied to Great
Britain. In the last two years the quantity
exported amounted to about 50 million
pounds, and the price was 30 cents per polmd

f.o.b. factory. At this point I would like to
say a word of compliment to Mr. John F.
Singleton, former Dairy Commissioner and
chairman of the Dairy Products Board, recently retired, who did outstanding work,
especially during the war years, and to his
successor in office, Mr. W. C. Cameron.
This bill would make two amendments in
section 8 of the act. The first would add the
words "for distribution amongst producers
in accordance with regulations". This is for
purposes of clarification. The second amendment proposed by the bill is a new subsection
of the nature of a penalty clause. As first
enacted, the act provided no penalty. It was
later found that a penalty clause was necessary to ensure the receipt by the producers
of the bonus or premium payable to them by
the government. Such a clause was prescribeà under the authority of the War Measures Act, but that measure, enforced during
tthe war years, is no longer operative. That
is why this provision is to be added to section
8 of the Act. I do flot know that anything
more need be said by wvay of explanation,
but if detailed information is required which
cannot be given tonight. the bill might be
referrefi to the Committee on Natural
Resources.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Would the honourable
senator say wlŽether 'producers" is defined
in the Act?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No, "producer" is not
defined.
Ho.n. Mr. Leger: Does the word as used in
the section mean the person who produces
the milk or the cream for the cheese, or the
manufacturer of the cheese?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: "Producer" here means
the person who produces the milk for the
cheese factory. He is paid a bonus of one
cent per pound on cheese made from his milk
\vhich grades 93. and two cents per pound
bonus on cheese made from his milk xvhich
grades 94.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Is that provided for in
the Act?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Leger: It occurs to me that the
xývord "producers' should include the manufacturer as well as the person who delivers
the milk. A factory produces cheese.
Hon. Mr. McDonald:
If the section is
amended as set out here, it will read:

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Will the honourable
senator please explain how these points are
de'ermined? How is the grading done?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The dairy produce
graders grade the cheese in the factories and
award points according to texture, moisture
content, flavour, and other qualities of that
nature. The points are added up.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What do you mean by

NATIONAL TRADE MARK BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act respecting the
application of a National Trade Mark to
commodities and respecting the true description of commodities.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) to explain this bill.
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
this legislation will amend certain provisions
of the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Act, 1935. Its purpose is to continue
the use of a national trade mark, to establish
commodity standards, and to provide for the
accurate labelling of commodities. The present law has never been satisfactory, and
questions have been raised from time to time
about the constitutionality of its provisions.
Under the present law there is provision for
the establishment of a commission to administer the Act, but that commission has never
functioned. In an attempt to make the Act
effective, certain powers were transferred to
the Director of Standards of the Department
of Trade and Commerce, while other powers
were transferred to the minister.
The government feels that this bill in its
present form, which has been carefully considered, is intra vires of this parliament. It
will establish the words "Canada Standard"
or the initials "C.S." as a national trade mark.
Under the existing law the minister has
power to regulate the manner in which this
trade mark may be used, and the Governor
in Council has authority over all national
trade marks. It is now felt that all regulations should be within the jurisdiction of the
Governor in Council. The use of the trade
mark is not restricted to commodities which
already have met recognized standards
approved by the department, but it is proposed to limit it to commodities meeting
standards or specifications established under
this Act or other statutory authority. Under
the present law, once permission is granted
to use the trade mark, there is no provision
for cancellation for infringements of the
regulations. The proposed legislation authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations for such cancellation, and contains
adequate provisions for proper enforcement.
It may be of interest to honourable members to know something about the development of legislation of this kind. The British
North America Act vested in the Dominion
Parliament certain powers with respect to
standards of weights and measures, and from
time to time there have been requests from
industry for standards relating to goods that
are sold on domestic and foreign markets. The

purpose of the present bill is to set up facilities which will be available to persons who
wish to take advantage of a national trade
mark. Use of the trade mark will not be
compulsory, but any goods on which it
appears must comply with the standards that
will be laid down in regulations.
As honourable senators will realize, the use
of standards of measurement has been very
extensive in this country. For instance,
provision has been made for the inspection of
gas meters, electrical meters, elevator scales,
and so on. Similarly it is proposed to keep a
close check on the manufacture of goods bearing the national trade mark, in order to see
that they comply with the requirements as to
standards. In this way the public can be
assured that an article which bears the words
"Canada Standard" is what it purports to be.
Hon. Mr. Farris: How is that check to be
carried out?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That has not yet been
determined, but regulations will be made by
the Governor in Council. This whole question
is being carefully studied by the Department
of Trade and Commerce in conjunction with
the National Research Council. It is expected
that a manufacturer who wishes to use the
national trade mark on commodities which
he is offering to the public will be required
to submit his goods to the National Research
Council for investigation and opinion, and
that the council will then advise the minister
whether representations made regarding the
goods are true. Once permission has been
given to a manufacturer or distributor to use
the words "Canada Standard" upon his goods,
he will be under obligation to see that those
goods are in accordance with the required
standards.
The bill itself is a short one, but perhaps
there are one or two comments that I should
make about it. It provides for three things:
first, for the use of a national trade mark,
"Canada Standard"; second, for the establishment of standards of commodities to which
such trade mark may be applied; and third,
for the accurate labelling of goods.
I have already said that there have been
some requests from industry for standards
relating to certain goods. It may interest
honourable senators to know that the only
specific request of that kind dealt with so
far came from the furriers. Coats made of
dyed rabbit, for instance, were being offered
for sale as "Hudson seal", and there was a
request that the manufacturers of these garments be required to label and advertise their
goods as such, so that the public would not
be deceived. As a result, standards were
agreed upon, and since then advertisements
of "Hudson seal" coats have contained, in
brackets, the words "dyed rabbit".

SENATE

Under the existing law the Minister of
Trade and Commerce has the power to regulate the manner of using the national trade
mark, but no power to prescribe the terms
and conditions of its use. The Governor in
Council has that power under the present
law, but has no authority over the national
trade mark itself. Thus there has been a
divided authority, which did not work out
well. This bill empowers the Governor in
Council to make regulations prescribing commodity standards.
At present the right to use the national
trade mark is not restricted to commodities
for which standards or specifications have
been prescribed, but this bill provides that
the use of the mark shall be limited to commodities which comply with the regulations
as to standards, the purpose being to give the
mark some clear significance and value.
Also, under the present law, once the right
to use the trade mark had been granted and
the manner of applying it had been prescribed, there was no provision for cancelling
that right, even though it had been abused.
The bill remedies this situation by providing
that in the event of failure to comply with
the regulations the right to use the mark may
be cancelled.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I should like to ask my
honourable friend if the bill would apply to
oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I asked that question
when I was being informed about the bill,
and I was told that it was not intended that
the measure should apply to oleomargarine.
I suppose, however, that under the law
regulations could be passed to make sure that
oleomargarine was properly labelled, so that
the public would not be deceived.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Only if the national
trade mark "Canada Standard" were used on
the oleomargarine. Is that not so?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: There is provision in
the bill for labelling, to ensure that true
statements are made with respect to ingredients, weight, quality and so forth.
Hon. Mr. Farris: And colour?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: There is nothing about
colour. For the purpose of preventing public
deception-this may apply to oleomargarine
as well-the Governor in Council has had
authority to prescribe the wording appearing
on the commodity or the package to describe
the material content. This power is considered inadequate, and the bill would amplify
it by enabling the Governor in Council to
provide that commodities and containers shall
be marked in such a way as to indicate not
only the material content but the quality,
size, quantity and properties of the com-

modity. To date the labelling regulations,
so far as the department is concerned, have
been confined to the fur garments to which I
have referred. But there bas been considerable demand from manufacturers for the
adoption of regulations requiring an accurate
representation of articles offered for sale.
I do not think I need take more time to
discuss the details of the bill. Although the
subject is not new, it is an important piece of
legislation. Its purpose is to make workable
the provisions of the law now in force, and
to make sure that those provisions are not
ultra vires.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would my friend permit
a question? Is it intended that the provisions
of the bill should apply only to cases where
the national trade mark, "Canada Standard"
is being used? For instance, section 5 would
appear to be broader in scope than section 4,
which is limited by regulations relating to the
national trade mark. Is it intended that
section 5 be so limited?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The bill, as I understand it, falls into two parts. The first bas to
do with the national trade mark, for which
regulations will be passed providing the
conditions under which it may be used. The
second part relates to further regulations
which will be passed to provide for proper
labelling of goods, in order to prevent deception of the public. There are several pieces
of legislation now in existence, such as the
Food and Drug Act, under which the federal
parliament has passed regulations requiring
a standard of labelling and description of
contents.
The bill requires careful study and consideration.
Therefore, when it receives
second reading, I intend to move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Canadian Trade Relations.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable friend whether this requirement as to
the use of the national trade mark is to be
mandatory in character? For example, would
a sawmill operator manufacturing and selling
lumber for domestic and export trade be
required by this legislation to attach the
Canada Standard mark to his product?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. I thought I had
made it clear that the use of the national
trade mark was purely optional, but that
once a manufacturer had decided to use it
he must then comply with the regulations.
I also said that the proposed legislation seems
to go further with respect to certain other
conditions; but they do not relate to the use
of the trade mark. There are also provisions
in the bill which will require careful study
to avoid conflict with provincial rights or
interference with present trade practice.

FEBRUARY 8, 1949
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I notice that in section
3 of the bill the word "Canada" is substituted
for the words "Dominion of Canada." Is
there any significance to be attached to that
change?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I do not think so.
"Canada" is shorter, and is thought to be a
better trade name.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck:
Honourable
senators, I quite agree with the suggestion of
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbel), that this bill should be carefully investigated in committee. It appears
to me to be a most useful piece of legislation,
and one may well compliment those who have
developed it thus far. It may bring about
high standards which will maintain and
increase the status of Canadian goods in foreign markets. There is, however, a very
grave danger connected with this kind of
legislation. It seems to place the Dominion
of Canada alongside the vendor of commodities, and to make the government and the
nation responsible for the quality of his goods.
When the standard is abused in those circumstances the matter is more serious to Canada
and ber reputation abroad than where a
private seller stands alone behind his goods.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have been consistently
opposed to the government entering into
business deals, making monopolies of certain
trades, and selling on the one hand and buying on the other for distribution among the
people. One reason for my opposition is that
when disagreements arise, as they so often
do between parties to commercial transactions, the matter then attains a national
importance. It is no longer a quarrel between
a buyer and a seller, which can be decided in
the courts; it becomes an international question, with both sides taking their revenge,
not by going to court, but rather by blackguarding one another from Dan to Beersheba. That is the difficulty we encounter
when we make the government the dealer.
I agree that this measure is different from
some others, but it savours of placing the
Dominion of Canada in the position of
guarantor of the goods of some private producer or trading company. I would warn
those who undertake the administration of
this Act that they must be vigilant, lest
damage be done to Canada. I believe that
a great deal of checking up will be necessary
to prevent some of the difficulties to which
I refer.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I have not studied this proposed legislation, but my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has

raised a question which makes me realize
that there are certain provisions in the bill
which require serious consideration. Having
listened to what the honourable member has
just said, it appears to me that there are two
distinct matters which require recognition
before we decide whether what we are doing
is right or wrong.
I refer first to paragraph (b), subsection (1),
of section 4, which I read along with paragraph (b) of section 5.
Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section
4 is as follows:
(b) prescribing the terns and conditions on which
the national trade mark may be applied to commodities or packages or containers thereof;

That means that, once a national trade mark
has been prescribed, it has the endorsement
of the Dominion government and can be
advertised as such.
Then look at section 5:
The Governor in Council may make regulations...
(b) prescribing the implied warranties that marking or labelling in accordance with a regulation
made under this section shall represent;

The converse of that is that, once those warranties have been prescribed, and the vendor
or manufacturer has conformed thereto, he
is entitled also to broadcast to the world that
he has conformed to the requirements of the
law under the dominion government regulations. That may be highly advantageous and
desirable, but in assuming these regulatory
functions the Government of Canada is taking
on a grave responsibility, and I think that in

committee we must check very carefully to
ascertain the extent to which the department
has realized the magnitude of the task it has
undertaken.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And we should inquire
as to the machinery it has for its purpose.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, how far it has the
machinery, and is prepared to take the responsibility of permitting vendors of commodities to give purchasers the guarantee
that the Dominion Government is behind the
products which they produce.
Another question which is raised by this
bill, and one which-again speaking rather
"off the bat"-would raise doubt, I believe,
in the mind of any lawyer, arises under paragraph (a) of section 5:
The Governor in Council may make regulations...
(a) prescribing the form and manner in which
any commodity designated by him or any package
or container thereof shall be marked or labelled,
or described in advertising, in order to indicate the
naterial content, quality, size, quantity or properties
of such commodity, or to indicate whether or not
the commodity conforms to a prescribed standard
or prescribed specification

The question to my mind is, what section
of the British North America Act confers
this authority? Is it section 91, dealing with

SENATE

trade and commerce, or section 92, relating
to property and civil rights? On this point the
honourable member from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), who has recently been a party to a
case in the Supreme Court in connection with
oleomargarine, can speak with more authority than any other member of this house. I
can recognize that considerations of health
may be involved, and that even colouring
matter might be within the federal jurisdiction if it affected the nutrition or health of
consumers of the commodity. But how far is
it permissible for the federal authority to
designate, by virtue of section 5, paragraph
(b), the label to be used on a commodity which
is manufactured or sold in a province and
does not go outside that province? If the section dealt expressly with interprovincial or
international trade, one could understand that
there would be some right in the Governor in
Council to deal with the matter. While I have
not the least intention, upon the brief consideration I have been able to give it, to say
whether this section is ultra vires, I do assert
that it raises questions which should be given
most serious consideration by the appropriate
committee of the Senate, and, I believe, by
every lawyer in this house who is interested
in and feels some qualification to consider
these matters. I do not know of any bill in
a long time that has raised questions .of
greater and more vital import, and I suggest
that this bill be remitted to the Banking and
Commerce Committee.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be

NATIONAL

RAILWAYS

AUDITORS

BILL

SECOND READING
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill E, an Act respecting
the appointment of auditors for National
Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, section 13 of
the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act,
1933, chapter 33, 1933, as enacted by section
3 of chapter 25, 1936, provides as follows:
"(1) A continuous audit of the accounts of National Railways shall be made by independent auditors appointed annually by a joint resolution of the

Senate and House of Commons and annually report-

ing to Parliament in respect of their audit. Their
annual report shall call attention to any matters

which in their opinion require consideration

or

remedial action. They shall be paid by the National
Company such amounts as the Governor in Council
shall from time to time approve."

The reason the present Bill is as follows:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13
of the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific
Act", is that the provision that the auditors
be appointed annually by joint resolution of
the Senate and House of Commons has been
found to be too complicated and cumbersome
for practical purposes. In consequence, the
simpler method of appointment by act of
parliament has been adopted.
This is an annual bill and is in the same
form as in previous years. It provides for
the appointment of George A. Touche

and

Conpany as independent auditors.
Although bills similar to the present one
have been before the Senate for several
years, and most honourable senators are
familiar with their terms and purposes, it
may be well, for the benefit of those who are
less well informed, that I repeat what I have
said on previous occasions with reference to
the appointment of these auditors and the
scope of their work.
The auditors' report to parliament for 1947
outlined briefly the general scope of the
audit of the national system as follows:
(a) Examination of major expenditure authorities
in conjunction with the recorded resolutions of the
directors, which in turn are related to corporate
by-laws, orders-in-council and acts of parliament;
(b) Audit tests in the offices of regions, separately
operated properties and system headquarters, limited
to a cross-section of the major expenditures so
authorized;
(c) Examination into the adequacy of the internal
audit control in general as exercised by the accounting staff of the system. In this connection we work
in collaboration with the executive accounting officers
at headquarters having as a common objective
the securing of maximum internal protection to the
system in the control of cash receipts and expenditurcs, securities held, material stores, accounts receivable, etc., and through the carrying of fidelity
bond insurance with outside underwriters, and
(d) Audit and certification of the consolidated income account and consolidated balance sheet for
presentation to parliament, which body is thus
placed in possession of facts upon which conclusions
can be reached as to the stewardship of the duly
appointed administrators of the system.

In respect of Trans-Canada Air Lines and
Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships,
Limited, the scope of the audit is similar to
that of the national system and may be outlined briefly as follows:
(a) Examination of major expenditure authorities,
embracing mainly the recorded resolutions of the
directors, corporate by-laws, acts of parliament and
orders in council;
(b) Audit tests covering a cross-section of the
major expenditures so authorized;
(c) Examination into the adequacy of the internal
audit control in general by the accounting staffs of
the companies covering cash receipts and expenditurcs, securities held, material stores, accounts receivable, etc., and
(d) Audit and certification of the balance sheets,
income and profit and loss accounts for presentation
to parliament.

FEBRUARY 8. 1949
Prior to 1938, the fee paid George A. Touche
and Company for audit of the above mentioned accounts was $50,000 per year. Commencmng i the year 1938, the fee was
increased to $5 1,800 by reason of the inclusion of the Trans-Canada Air Lmnes and the
Canadian National Railways Securities Trust.
In 1946 the fee was increased to $55,000 per
year, principally due to the increased work
imposed upon the auditors as a resuit of the
substantial growth of the Trans-Canada Air
Lines. The fee is fixed by the Governer in
Council.
In addition to this fee the auditors are
compensated for disbursements in certain
cases, such as those made for travelling for
audit purposes and at hotels on such occasions, at ail audit points, except the city of
Montreal, and also for special disbursements
made in the preparation cf extra copies of
reports, in both English and French, to Parliament as required by the government.
These expenditures average about $4,500 per
annum. The fee and disbursements are paid
by the Canadian National Railway Company
and Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships, Limnited, in such amounts and at such
times as approved by the directors of the
railway company and steamship company.
Since the inception cf the Canadian
National Railway System in 1923 George A.
Touche and Company have been the auditors,
with the exception of the year 1935 when
Clarkson, Gordon, Dilworth, Guilfoyle and
Nash of the city of Toronto were the
appointed auditors. Prier te the formation
cf the Canadian National Railway system in
1923 George A. Touche and Company were
the auditors of the Canadian Northern Railway Company.
The Canadian National Railway system
comprises a large nuxnber cf subsidiary cernpanies and operates railways and other
facilities in Canada and the United States.
For this reason it is necessary te have
accounting firms te do the auditing with connections in the United States. Also, owing te
the diversified operatiens of the Canadian
National Railways, it is censidered necessary
te have experienced auditors. The flrm of
George A. Touche and Company have the
connections in Canada and abroad, and by
reason cf their long asseciation with Canadian National Railways' acceunts, have the
experience, and it is considered geod business for the railway te have a continuous
audit made by the same firm.
Hen. Mr. Roebuck: It is preposed te use
the same auditors as were used last year?
Hen. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hen. Mr. Moraud: Is it a Canadian or an
English firm?
2901-5

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I believe it is a Canadian firm.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it is an English flrm.
Its headquarters are in London under Mr.
Touche. There are partners located in Mentreai, Toronto and Winnipeg.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was
read the second time.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS INTREPLY
The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 3, the consideration cf His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening
cf the session, and the motion cf Hon. Mr.
Farquhar for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Henourable senators,
may I first of ail cengratulate the mever and
seconder cf the Address upon their elequence
and the subi ect-matter cf their speeches. I
should also like te extend my humble welcome
te the newly appointed senators. Although
they have certain respensibilities to carry eut,
like their predecessors, they wrnl find in this
chamber a spirit of good wiil and good felewship which I am sure they wiil appreciate.
Seme Hon. Senaters: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grshaw: Honourable senators,
I wish te take advantage of the latitud~e
extended te speakers in this debate te refer
briefly te three subjects, none cf which, perhaps, is closely related te the subi ect-matter
of the Address.
May I say that those engaged in the livestock industry are grateful te the Canadian
governent fer the action it took in their
behalf during the past year? Ranching is
now carried on in a much more scientifIc
manner than in the days cf the open ranges,
but the stock-raising industry us still subi ect
te periods o! depression and disaster. Storms
may destroy whole herds o! cattie, food may
be in short supply, and prices may vary
widely. But 1948 will long be remembered
as the year when the embargo against our
cattie entering the 'United States was
remeved, and when the prices fer fat cattie
reached and exceeded the twenty-cent mark.
When it became known that the embargo
had been removed, cattle cars came into
Alberta from Chicago, St. Paul, and from as
far south as Les Angeles. Buyers appeared
at the feed lots and the ranches in great
numbers. The Americans were anxious to
get our fat cattie, our stockers and feeders.
When ut was learned that cars might be in
short supply and that seme of the cattle might
not reach the market, the oid method cf trailing them across the prairies was adopted.
At one place close te where I live some 800

SENATE

cattle were gathered and started on the long
overland trip to the United States. As they
slowly progressed, at six to eight miles a day,
other cattle were purchased and added to the
herd. They were corralled for veterinary
inspection, and then the cowboys drove them
south to the American shipping points. It was
a revival of the old trailing method which
was in vogue before the open ranges were
criss-crossed with fences and railway tracks.
More than 240,000 cattle have been shipped
into the United States, and they would supply
about one and a half per cent of that
country's consumption of beef.
The lifting of the embargo brought a real
supply of American dollars into Canada.
Furthermore, statistics show that there was
no decline in the use of meat by Canadians.
On the contrary, more meat than ever was
consumed in this country. The increased
revenue received by the industry was a great
help also to the income tax department. Most
important of all, it gave the people engaged
in the ranching industry an opportunity to
pay their debts, to meet their costs of producticon, to undertake certain improvements, and
to get back on the trail which they were
travelling before the embargo was imposed.
It is fondly hoped that this natural market
will never again be closed, and that ranchers,
who are noted for their hospitality and
neighbourliness, will not in future be handicapped by artificial trade barriers.
1 also wish to say something about the
development of oil production in Alberta.
That province at the present time is having
the greatest oil boom in its history, and great
,credit is due to the private oil companies
which have invested so much of their risk
capital in the search for oil on the western
prairies. In 1948 the expenditures on oil
development were about $50 million, or an
average of roughly $1 million a week; it is
expected that this year they will run to about
$100 million, or about $2 million a week.
Credit is also due to the technical men who
went into the remote and relatively inaccessible districts. Travelling by canoe, packtrain or airplane, in groups of three or four,
they spent months in the lonely wilderness,
making observations and charting the way for
other specialists, who predicted to the best
of their ability where oil might be found.
Eventually there was a lot of drilling, and
in spite of many discouragements this has
paid off. In 1948 the number of wells drilled
in Alberta was 366, of which 210 proved to be
oil producers, 23 were gas wells and 133 were
dry holes.
The daily output of crude oil has been about
35,000 barrels, and the average during one
week in the middle of November was 39,572
barrels. Oil men hope and expect that by

1950 the wells will be producing 65,000 barrels
a day. The oil production has been of great
benefit not only to Alberta but to the whole
country. Rentals and royalties have brought
millions of dollars to the provincial treasury,
and four to five thousand persons are employed directly in the oil industry. As the
Canadian consumption of oil is about 250,000
barrels daily, we have had to depend upon
imports for about 86 per cent of our requireEvery barrel of oil produced in
ments.
Alberta saves from $3 to $5 of our American
exchange.
There is one other matter to which I wish
to refer at this time, and that is divorce.
Ever since confederation parliament has had
to deal with a number of applications for
divorce, and it seems that at almost every
session some honourable members have
spoken of the undesirability of the procedure.
In a book written by Gemmill it is stated
that not only is there no jurisdiction in Quebec to deal with divorce but that a preconfederation law, which was continued by
the British North America Act and will continue till parliament chooses to repeal it-as it
has power to do under section 91 of that actdeclares that marriage is dissolved only by
the death of one of the spouses. As nothing
has been done by the various parliaments
down through all the years to repeal that
law, it seems likely that divorce applications
will continue to come to parliament for a
long time yet.
Partly ow'ing to the war, the number of
divorce cases has increased; but altogether
aside from that cause it seems that divorce
is greatly on the increase. It has occurred to
me that it might be possible to appoint a
King's Proctor or some such official whose
duty it would be to inquire into every divorce
application right on the ground and try to
reconcile the parties, and where that is not
possible, to send a report to the body hearing
the application. If it is not practicable to
employ such an officer, perhaps a system
could be developed whereby some reliable
official, such as magistrate or police chief,
would endeavour to bring about reconciliation in certain cases and forward a report in
every case where attempts at reconciliation
were unsuccessful.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is my honourable friend
referring only to cases coming from Quebec
or to cases from the whole of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I should think it would
be well if some such system could be worked
out for the whole of Canada, for divorce is
on the increase in every province.
The following statement by the Chairman
of our Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)-who, by the way, deserves great credit

the reasons I have mentioned, and at the
request of the 1948 Ottawa conference of the

the government is asking for the repeal of
these sections.
Hon. Mr. Leger: If the federal parliament
has no jurisdiction to appoint game wardens,
has it jurisdiction to declare that so and so
shall be a game warden? It seems to me it
goes without saying that, if the dominion
authorities cannot appoint, they cannot, in
conformity with the Act, declare that somebody shall be a game warden.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Then why debate the
point?
Hon. Mr. Leger: I do not know why the
bill is before us. The Dominion Government
is without jurisdiction in the matter.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Section 6 of the Act
makes provision for the officers who shall
enforce it. AU we are asking parliament to
do today is to repeal the sections which have
reference to dominion game officers, who
were never appointed.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Yes, but paragraph (c) of
section 2 of the bill states:
"Game officer" means a person declared by this
Act to be ex officio a game officer.

According to the explanatory note:

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second read-

The proposed amendment makes it clear that

ing of Bill F, an Act to amend the Game
Export Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable member from Northumberland to explain this bill.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
the purpose of this bill is simply to revise and
clarify existing legislation. When the Game
Export Act of 1941 was drafted, it contained
a section providing for the appointment of
dominion game officers to enforce the Act.
Parliament deleted that section, and it now
becomes necessary to pass legislation repealing other sections which refer to those game

I repeat that I cannot see how, if there is
no authority to appoint game officers, there
can be any right to declare that so and so
shall be a game officer.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The reference is to
dominion game officers.
Hon. Mr. Leger: To declare that so and so
is a game warden ex officio is equivalent to
appointing him.
Hon. Mr. Howden: The mounted police are
game officers ex officio.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Those are my views.

officers, who were never appointed.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

SECOND READING

Section 2, paragraph (c) of the bill refers
to dominion game officers. Section 5 of the
Act also refers to those officers, and describes
their powers. The present subsection (1) of
section 5 of the Act, which prescribes the
form of oath to be taken by game officers,
and subsection (2) of the same section, which
refers to the powers of game officers, are both
unnecessary and confusing. The enforcement
of the Act is in the hands of the provincial

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
He said: The point raised by the honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
is beyond the scope of my knowledge. since

FEBRUARY 9, 1949
I am not versed in the law, and I think the
bill might well be referred to a standing committee at which officials of the department
concerned could attend to clear up any points
of difficulty. I do not believe the matter is
one of urgency: in any event, the Committee
on Natural Resources will meet tomorrow
morning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I point out that the
Committee on Natural Resources bas nothing
to do with the legal question raised by my
honourable friend? While I have no objection
to the bill being referred to that committee,
I believe it could be more appropriately
remitted to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, which is the legal committee.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: I may point out that
the meetings of the standing committees of
the Senate are open to all honourable senators. I am calling a meeting of the Committee on Natural Resources tomorrow morning
at 10.30, and those senators who are not members of the committee but who are interested
in this bill may attend. I think, too, that
honourable senators will find many members
of the legal fraternity at the meeting.
The motion was agreed to.
CULLERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill G, an Act to repeal the Cullers
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Grandville to
explain this bill.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
this legislation is not of a serious nature. Its
object is to repeal an Act which bas not been
in operation for the past thirty years. The
Cullers Act was passed by the parliament of
United Canada in 1842, to provide for the
measurement and inspection of lumber for
export. The Act was limited in its scope,
applying only to Quebec and Ontario, and
further, it applied only to waney pine and
square lumber to be exported. The measurements were made in Montreal and Quebec,
and in some parts of Ontario.
Since 1867 both Ontario and Quebec, the
two provinces mainly concerned with the
Cullers Act, have passed legislation of their
own for the measurement and inspection of
all kinds of timber cut on Crown lands, which
still includes the bulk of the cut in these
provinces. This meant a double inspection
and measurement. As a matter of fact, from
1894 to 1920 the amount of lumber measured
under the Cullers Act in Quebec and Montrçal was so small that the department closed

its offices in 1921. At the present time in
Quebec and Ontario, lumber, whether or not
it is for export, is measured and inspected by
cullers appointed under the respective Acts
of the two provinces. This method has proved
satisfactory, and there is no complaint whatsoever as to the,measurement and inspection
of lumber. Exporters who fail to have their
lumber inspected by federal cullers are subject to fines and penalties; yet there are no
cullers to make the inspection. I suggest to
honourable senators that the only course to
take with respect to an Act that has not been
operative for the last thirty years is to
repeal it.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Can the honourable gentleman inform me whether there are still any
annuitants under the act?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In 1921 every officer
and man employed on this work was placed
on an appropriate annuity by the Department
of Trade and Commerce, and I understand
that in the meantime all but one of these persons have died.
Hon. Mr. Leger: If we repeal the Act will
that man's annuity cease?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: My information from
the Department of Trade and Commerce is
that there is no annuity that will cease on
account of the repeal of this Act. The man
referred to was retired under the Superannuation Act, not under the Cullers Act, and
so would not be affected at all by repeal of
the Cullers Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Farquhar
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators, in
rising to participate in this debate, I should
like first to join the speakers who have
preceded me in paying tribute to the mover
(Hon. Mr. Farquhar) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Comeau) of the address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. It was my privilege
to be for three years a member of the Joint
Committee on the Indian Act, of which the
mover of the Address was also a member. I
found him there to be an able and hardworking parliamentarian, and I know he will
be a valuable acquisition to this house. Unfortunately it was not possible for me to be
present wben the seconder of the address was

SENATE
speaking, but on reading Hansard I realized
that I had thereby suffered a distinct loss,
for I am sure the speech was a most interesting and unusual one.
I should like to speak for a short time on
one paragraph in the Speech from the Throne,
but before doing that I wish to refer to two
or three statements that were made by the
honourable leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) on Thursday last. The first
is in reference to the wheat agreement with
Britain. That subject was fully and ably
covered by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg, the leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Haig), and I do not purpose to go over any
of the ground which was covered at that time.
However, just in passing, I should like to
remind the leader of the government that
when he chides so severely those of us who
belong to the Progressive Conservative party
for our stand on this wheat agreement he
should not overlook the fact that many
members of his own party share our opinion.
I have a distinct recollection of listening to
a very fine speech that was made here last
session by an able and experienced parliamentarian who knows the conditions and
problems of western Canada as well as any
and better than most of us. I refer to the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), who took exactly the same stand as
was taken by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg.
I should like to briefly repeat that stand, so
that it will be clear in our minds. All of us,
ni matter whether we liked the terms of the
agreement or not, were in favour of Britain
receiving the wheat at $1.55 a bushel. However, some of us thought that the $300 million loss that was sustained should have been
borne by the taxpayers of Canada and not
by a few wheat growers in the West. That
is the only point upon which there was any
difference of opinion. In answer to that
point the leader of the government said that
the wheat growers of Canada were in exactly
the same position as the Dominion Steel and
Coal Company, the lumber industry and other
industries which had to submit to a certain
degree of price control during the war. To
that statement I must take exception.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: In the first place, there is
no greater gamble on earth today than growing wheat in western Canada. But it is a
gamble that must be taken by men who have
the courage to do it, because the world must
be fed. Those of us who are familiar with
the West, and particularly with the greatest
wheat growing province, Saskatchewan-I
know something about this, for I lived on a
wheat farm in Saskatchewan for many years
-ace
aware that very few districts out

there have not at some period in their history
suffered destruction of their crops by hail,
drought, rust or grasshoppers, sometimes for
one year, sometimes for two years and sometimes for as long as six years in succession,
until farmers who formerly had been in a
very prosperous condition were forced to go
on relief.
The honourable leader of the government
said in his speech last Thursday that the
western farmer is more prosperous today
than he ever was before. That may be true
in some districts, but I would call the attention of the house to a press dispatch from
Regina, dated February 4, which says this:
Prairie farm assistance headquarters today announced 51,878 praiire farmers will draw $12,792,951
in assistance benefits for 1948.
The Saskatchewan share-by far the largest-is
$11,112,671, with 44,660 of the province's 120,000 fariers receiving "grocery and clothing" money to tide
thenm over until the next crop.

That means that more than one-third of the
farmers of Saskatchewan will be receiving
assistance from the prairie farm assistance
fund. I simply leave this thought to the good
judgment of honourable senators: Did you
ever see in any paper a similar item in connection with the Dominion Steel and Coal
Company?
In discussing the points made by the leader
on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) with regard ta
the government's financial surplus, the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) used
these words:
They-

That is the members of the Progressive
Conservative party.
-rather seem to delight in deficits, and they hold
up their hands in holi horror at the prospect of a
surplus.

My honourable friend is not usually so
extreme in his language, or so prone to
exaggerate. Perhaps he was carried away on
the tide of his own eloquence and just did
not realize what was the subject under discussion. Certainly, I know of no one in our
party who has ever been opposed to the
government having a surplus. We do, however, strenuously oppose the size of the surplus and the methods by which it was
obtained. That is an entirely different matter. We are agreed that, if possible, it is
sound financing to have a comfortable surThat
plus of revenue over expenditures.
applies to both government and private
financing. I submit that today the Minister
of Finance finds himself in possession of an
uncomfortable surplus. I think my honourable friends will find great difficulty in
justifying to the taxpayers the taking by
way of taxation of more than $1,200 million

FEBRUARY 9, 1949
in excess of the amount needed to carry on
the business of the country.
It is all very well for supporters of the
government to get up and point with pride
to the tremendous surplus. But I submit,
honourable senators, that if there is to be
any pointing with pride, it should be in the
direction of the Canadian taxpayers, who
have made the necessary sacrifice to bring
about this surplus. Certainly it is not due
to any sacrifice on the part of the government. Last year when the Minister of Finance was trying to find an excuse for having
taken $700 million in taxes more than was
required, he said, "But the government needs
that for a rainy day." But what about the
individual taxpayer in this country? Has he
no right to have enough of his earnings left
to provide for a rainy day in his household,
or for emergencies that may arise? I submit that the people in the low-income
brackets in Canada today, through being
squeezed between the high cost of living and
the excessive income tax, have not enough
left to meet emergencies as they arise.
In the Speech from the Throne the unprecedented step was taken of telling what was
coming in the budget: a tax reduction was
forecast. But from what I hear, the taxpayer simply regards that as a death-bed
repentance that was made only because of
the pressure of public opinion.
Concerning the question of expenditures, if
at the end of the war the government had
given any indication of practising the same
economy in its national housekeeping as it
expected us as individuals to do in our
private housekeeping, there would have been
fewer complaints. I know that all governments, when asked to reduce expenditures,
have given the age-old excuse: "The greater
part of the expenditure is uncontrollable, and
so cannot be reduced." The Dominion Bureau
of Statisties bas, unfortunately for the government, rather swept away that excuse.
Only yesterday I received a report from the
Bureau which reads as follows:
During the first eight months of the current fiscal
year, the total ordinary expenditure of the government increased from 847 million dollars to 928-8
million dollars.
In analyzing this, we find that the so-called uncontrollable expenditures were able to reduce themselves from 375-6 millions to 316-2 millions-a saving
of 15.5 per cent, while the expenditures over which
the government has control jumped from 471-4
millions to 612-6 millions or an increase of 30 per
cent.

of the taxes which are now falling so heavily on the lower-income groups, renewed
demands for wage increases might have been
avoided.
There never was a truer statement made
than the one made by the honourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) a few days
ago, when he said that men and women who
work for wages and salaries are not so
much concerned about how much they make
as they are about what is in their pay envelopes when they take them home on Friday or
Saturday night. The more the government
takes, the less the worker has to take home,
and the more likely he is to ask for increased
wages so that he may have more in his pay
envelope. This condition is again reflected in
higher prices for manufactured commodities.
I believe that by withholding so much more
money from the people than was necessary,
the government is directly responsible for the
continuance of the vicious circle.
With the indulgence of the house I should
like to refer briefly to one paragraph in the
Speech from the Throne. It bas to do with
what has come to be known as the "cultural
omnibus resolution". As honourable senators
may not have the Speech before them, I shall
read the paragraph:
It is the view of my ministers that there should
be an examination of the activities of agencies of
the federal government relating to radio, films, television, the encouragement of arts and sciences, research, the preservation of our national records, a
national library, museums, exhibitions, relations in
these fields with international organizations, and
activities generally which are designed to enrich our
national life, and to increase our own consciousness
of our national heritage and knowledge of Canada
abroad.

Well, it hardly seems enough for one commission! Perhaps, if anyone thinks of some-

thing else, it may be added. It sounds to me
less like proposed legislation than the confession in the Prayer Book: "We have left
undone those things which we ought to have
done." No wonder the Ottawa Journal in
commenting on the proposal very aptly said:
Next in permanence to a senatorial appointment
will be membership in this Royal Commission It
ought to be made up of young men in no hurry.

Let me at once say that I am entirely in
accord with the objective set out in this
recommendation; every part of it is important
to our national life, and I am in favour of it;
but I am entirely opposed to the method by
which it is to be attained. I agree that
matters of national importance which are
controversial and very difficult of solution,I do not profess to be an economist; I am
for example the freight rates question-are
just one of the ordinary taxpayers; but it is
by a royal commy opinion that if since the close of the war fit subjects for investigation
the government had undertaken a strict mission; but to put into the hands of a royal
economy in controllable expenditures and a commission al the matters contained in the
corresponding policy of progressive reduction list I have read savours too much of an

SENATE
evasion of government responsibility. Because our country is so scattered and contains
few great centres of population, the matter
of television might well be remitted to a commission; but to clutter up its proceedings
with a multitude of other references is likely,
in my opinion, to very largely destroy its
effectiveness.
This proposed commission is to investigate
the activities of agencies of the government
relating to radio and films. Well, I suppose
that is one way, although it may be a very
expensive one, of shutting off discussion of
these things in the house. Then we are to
have an investigation of research,-"research," the broadest word in our language.
It can include anything and everything. Has
anyone the faintest idea what is meant, or
how far it will extend? Also, "the preservation of our national records, a national
library". For years the press and the people
of this country have been urging the government to establish a national library. About
two sessions ago, I believe, the matter was
discussed in this house, and at that time it
was stated, and the statement has not been
challenged-I have checked the truth of it
by reference to the librarian-that Canada
and Siam were the only two countries in the
world without a national library, or its equivalent in the form of state libraries which
supply the people with material. It is too
bad that since that discussion little Siam
decided to establish a national library, so
that today, in this respect, we find ourselves
alone in the world. And now we are told that
we have to set up a royal commission to
decide whether we ought to have a national
library or not. Can it be possible that Canada
is so far behind all other countries in initiative that we find ourselves placed in this
position.
I could go on, but I do not wish to bore
you or take up the time of the house.
Some Hon. Senators: Go on.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I could go on to speak of
the activities designed "to enrich our national
life, and to increase our own consciousness of
our national heritage"-presumably by contact with organizations abroad. What lovely
vistas are opened up of extensive travel to
find out how we may enrich ourselves culturally, because of course we shall have to go
abroad to see what other nations are doing
in a cultural way. Possibilities of that kind
are almost unlimited. I ask honourable senators: Has anyone the faintest idea how long
this commission would have to sit to fulfil

these functions, or what the cost to the
country would be?
I hope that when I have finished, nobody
will rise to read me a lecture, such as was
read in another place, on the theme that
"man shall not live by bread alone", and on
the necessity of enriching and encouraging
the cultural and educational life of this country; because, as I said at the beginning, with
all these objectives I am in complete accord,
and would support anything within reason
which would achieve them. But I do not
consider that this proposal is within reason.
Honourable senators, what is parliament
for? For what do we, or the members of the
other place, receive our indemnities from the
people of this country? Is it not that to the
best of our ability we shall grapple with and
solve the problems of this country as they
arise from day to day? To me, this proposal
is nothing but an evasion of a responsibility
which ministers and members of parliament
should assume. I except, as I have said, one
or two outstanding and far-reaching questions. But some of the matters to be referred
to this commission are, I believe, purely the
responsibility of the ministers and of parliament, and should be dealt with as such.
If the government does not feel equal to
the task, perhaps a Senate committee could
be set up to deal with them. The membership of this chamber includes persons outstanding in their particular lines of activity,
men of experience, of vision and of love of
country. We have in this house honourable
senators who are second to none in the legal
profession of this country. Is there any reason why the Senate should not use some of
its spare time in helping to solve these problems-with the exception, as I have said, of
two or three more difficult, far-reaching, and
perhaps more controversial questions, which
could be left to a royal commission? I submit to you, honourable senators, that if we
took a stand in conformity with this principle, we would help to justify the existence
of parliament, we would be carrying out some
of the duties for which parliament was constituted, and we would save the already
overburdened taxpayers of this country from
having more and more burdens heaped upon
their shoulders.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

go by. I know that labour is turning its
thoughts in this direction at the present time,
and the collective bargaining during this coming year will centre more around welfare
schemes and pension plans than around proposals for advances in wages. I have some
personal information in connection with
exceedingly
important and far-reaching
movements for social security in line with our
general proposal to make life in old age and
under disability less drastic than it has been
in former generations.
Just incidental to what I propose to say
about the bill, I should like to call attention of
honourable senators to the fact that we are
budgeting for the expenditure of a very large
proportion of our national income on security
services. In 1948 our expenditures on such
services were as follows:
Unemployment insurance... $ 12,500,000
Family allowances .........
260,000,000
Veterans' benefits ......... .363,000,000
Old age pensions ........... .48,000,000
$ 683,500,000
That is, last year we spent more than $683
million for taking care of people in their old
age, of families with children, of veterans, and
of people who were unemployed.
The Pension Fund Societies Act, which it
is now proposed to amend, is a very old
statute. It was first enacted by 50-51 Victoria, chapter 21, and was assented to on the

23rd of June, 1887. It has stood unamended,
so far as I know, during the intervening sixtyone years; certainly it has not been amended
since it was put into the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, where it appears as chapter
155. The Act provides a simple and inexpen-ive procedure whereby any two or more of

the superior officers "of any corporation
legally transacting business in Canada, under
any Act of the Parliament of Canada" may
establish a pension fund society which shall be
designated as the pension fund society of the
particular corporation in question.
Honourable senators will observe that the
legislation is for corporations brought into
being by the Dominion of Canada rather than
for foreign corporations or companies incorporated under the laws of the provinces.
The procedure, as I have said, is very
simple. It requires only that the officers file
with the Secretary of State, and in the office
of Registrar of Deeds of the locality in which
the chief place of business shall be located,
a declaration of their intention to form such
a society.

The filing shall be followed by a

notice of incorporation appearing in four
weekly issues of the Canada Gazette. That is
all that is necessary to bring into being a body
corporate with very important functions. The
original incorporators are the provisional
directors, whose duty it is to call a meeting
of the society when the directors, who shail
be at least five in number, are elected. All
those who contribute to the funds of the
society, including the parent corporation,
shall have the right to vote, subject to the
by-laws passed by the directors and approved
by the shareholders.
Such a pension fund society has the power,
by voluntary contributions or otherwise, to
form a fund, and to hold, invest and administer it for the following purposes: First to
"provide for the support and payment of
pensions to such officers and employees . . .
incapacitated by age or infirmity"-honouraLle senators will observe how broad the
provision is, leaving details to be covered by
the by-laws-and, second, upon the death of
such officers or employees, to "pay annuities
or gratuities to their widows and rninor
children or other surviving relatives in such
manner as by the by-laws of the society
may be specified." We have, therefore. provision for a welfare fund and a gratuity or
pension fund.
The society has power to pass by-laws
defining the rights of all the interested parties,
including the beneficiaries, and concerning
the formation, management and distribution
of the fund. These by-laws are filed with
the Secretary of State. The parent corporation, by a vote of either its directors or its
shareholders, is given power to make contributions to the fund out of the moneys of the
corporation. The interest of any member in
the funds of the society are no' transferable;
and I take it that they are not attachable.
When required by the Governor in Council
to do so, the directors of the fund must file
with the Secretary of State a return showing
their assets, receipts and expenditures.
In view of the simplicity and apparent

inexpensiveness of this procedure, and the
accompanying benefits, it is remarkable that
the machinery bas been so little used over the
long period in which it has stood on the
statute books of Canada. One would have
expected that it would have been made use
of on many occasions. But that is not the
case. As a matter of fact, since 1887 only
thirteen companies have filed declarations of
intention under the Act. The action taken
by these concerns is creditable and, therefore,

I arn particularly surprîsed that so littie
advantage has been taken of this legisiation in
view of the fact that pension funds, when
approved by the department, enjoy certain
benefits and exemptions under the Income
Tax Act. Most corporations and individuals
spend a good deal of time studying methods
of exempting their funds from the exactions
of income tax iaw. Section il (1) (g) of the
Income Tax Act exempts from. tax:
Amnounts contributed by the taxpayer to or under
an approved superannuation £und or plan not exceeding in the aggregate $900 in the year.

Paragraphs (f) and (o) of subsection 1, of
section 57, exempt the taxable income of the
foilowing organizations:
(f) a labour organization or society or a benevolent or fraternal benefit society or order.
(o) a trust or corporation established or incorporated solely in connection with, or for the administration of, an approved superannuation fund
or plan.

A good many plans have been and are
being submitted to the income tax authorities
for approval. By no means ail of themn are
approved, because one of the requirements is
that they be sound from an actuariai point
of view, and another, that they qualify as real,
genuine superannuation or pension funds. But
if a society incorporated under this legisiation satisfies the materiai requirements of the
income tax officiais, it is in line to obtain
exemption in respect of its payments, and
many other benefits as well. It may be that,
notwithstanding the maturity-shail I say the
old age maturity-of this legisiation, corporations in Canada are only now awakening to
the use -which may be made of it.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Are the benefits of the
Act limited to a company incorporated by the
Parliament 0f Canada, or do they extend to
companies incorporated by letters patent?
Han. Mr. Roebucc: The Act applies to companies incorporated under any Act of the
Dominion Parliament, which means incorporated under the Companies Act or by speciai
Act of the Dominion Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It does not cover provincialiy incorporated companies?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it does not apply to
provincial corporations at ail.
Hon.

Mr. MacLennan: I understand that

the Canadian National Railways have a pension fund. I understand also that upon the
death of the pensioner the pension ceases.
Under this legîsiation would the wîdows and
children of a pensioner receive any benefit
from the pension fund?
Hon.

Mr.

Roebuck:

That

would

depend

entireiy upon the bylaws of the society.
Under this legisiation the society is empowered to establish a fund for the payment of
pensions to widows of the members of the
socîety. The society rnay have other purposes, such as the payment to its members
of sick benefits or annuities, which might
expire with the death 0f the annuitant. Ail
that depends upon the society itseif. The
power to extend the benefits does exist, if
the society wîshes to exercise it.
I was saying that perhaps only now are
Canadian corporations wakîng up to the
potentialities of this legisiation. However
that may be, the present amendment is
brought about by the desire of a very large
company in Canada, having some 8,000 employees, to form a pension fund society which
will apply to ail its employees. The difficulty
is that the enterprise is carried on by a
parent company and six subsidiary companies, ail engaged in carrying on what is
one business. I do not think the identity of
the corporation is any secret; it is the
Imperiai Tobacco Company. This company
has found that under the existing legisiation
it would have to incorporate no iess than
seven societies, and the directors could not
be the same for ail because the personnel
would not be the same. Unless a man were
an employee of ail of the companies, he
would have to be the employee of each one
in turn. In any event, as the iaw stands,
the company's pension operations wouid
involve the keeping of seven different sets
of books, seven different sets 0f byiaws,
seven different annual meetings and so on.
Such a division is not desirable. On the othei

SENATE
hand, it is desirable that one society, with one
board of directors, one plan, and one fund
shall function for the entire body of 8,000
employees. So the company has asked for
the amendment which we are considering
today. If the bill should pass-and I am
fairly sure that it will, for I know of no reason why it should not-the Imperial Tobacco
Company will probably be the first of several
companies, many, I hope, having subsidiaries
-many, I hope-to use this legislation to
cover its entire force, whether that force be
employed directly by the main company or
by its subsidiaries.
I hope the bill will pass, because in my
judgment it is highly in the public interest.
The more people who are cared for by private
plans of this kind, the fewer the demands
that will be made upon public old-age pension funds and municipal relief funds, and
so on all down the line; and the greater, too,
will be the security, the comfort and the
self-respect of our citizens of advanced age
in Canada-something highly to be desired.
One must not overlook the fact that, according to the statisticians, the age of Canadians
is increasing. We are becoming an older
nation because our people are living longer
and there are fewer deaths in infancy. I
speak for all, I think, in expressing the hope
that this trend will continue.
The amendment itself is before you; it is
very simple. A pension fund society established under the Act may admit the officers
and the employees of subsidiary corporations
and entitle them to the same benefits and
rights as are provided under the Act for the
officers and employees of the parent corporation. The subsidiary corporation, by vote of
the directors only, or by vote of the shareholders, is empowered-as is the parent
corporation under the original Act-to make
contributions from its funds to the funds of
the society. The last section of the bill contains a definition of the subsidiary company:
In this act, "subsidiary corporation" means a corporation legally transacting business in Canada,
under any act of the Parliament of Canada, the
majority of the shares of which that have under
all circumstances full voting rights is owned
or controlled directly or indirectly by or for the
parent corporation.

Both the parent corporation and the subsidiary corporations must be doing business in
Canada and be incorporated under federal
law. If these two conditions are satisfied, the
officers of the main corporation may, by way
of resolution, bring in the officials and
employees of the subsidiary corporations and
give them the same rights, privileges and
duties as its own employees enjoy.
Honourable senators, in my judgment this
is excellent time-tested legislation which, as

far as I know, has never been abused. It is
in keeping with the modern trend of facilitating plans and enterprises of this kind. It
is certainly in line with Liberal policy and I
think it is not out of line with Conservative
policy.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do not cover too much
territory.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill H, an Act respecting the Globe
Printing Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill provides for the amendment of the Act of
incorporation of the Globe Printing Company,
authorizing it to increase the annual value of
real estate which it may hold from $30,000 to
$100,000.
It may interest honourable senators to
know something about the organization
which publishes the Globe and Mail. The
Globe Printing Company was incorporated
by an Act of the Legislative Council and
Assembly of Canada, assented to on August
15, 1866. Under the Act of incorporation the
annual value of the real estate to be held at
any time was restricted to $5,000. In 1892 an
amending Act increased the annual value to
$30,000.
The Act of incorporation of 1866 specifically provided that the corporation was constituted for the purpose of purchasing and
acquiring, from George Brown, the printing
establishment and business owned and carried on by him in the city of Toronto. It
gave the company power "to carry on the
said business of printing, publishing, stereotyping, engraving, wood-cutting, lithographing, and bookbinding, and to deal in and
vend all articles of merchandise connected
therewith." The capital stock of the corporation was to be divided into 600 shares of
$500 each. In 1911 the capital stock of the
company was increased to $1,000,000, divided
into 10,000 shares of the par value of $100
each. No change was made at that time as
to the value of the land that the company
could hold. In May, 1938, a bill introduced
in the Senate of Canada, and eventually
passed by both houses of parliament,
increased the capital stock from $1,000,000 to
$6,000,000.
In 1936 the Globe Printing Company
acquired the Mail Printing Company by purchasing its shares. At that time the Mail
Printing Company owned a parcel of land
at the corner of King and York Streets in

FEBRUARY 10, 1949
Toronto, and it is upon this site that the
present Globe and Mail building is situated.
The Globe Company advanced to the Mail
Company the moneys necessary to construct
the new building, and it has been leased by
the Mail Company to the Globe Company
since.
The purpose of this bill is to give the Globe
Printing Company authority to hold land

having

an

annual

value

of

$100,000.

This will give the company the power to
acquire the title and ownership of the building it now occupies. If the bill is passed and
authority is granted to the company to
increase its real estate holding, it is proposed
to transfer the property in question to the
Globe Printing Company. The Mail Printing
Company still carries on business but, so far
as I know, does not hold any other land.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Did you say the Mail
Printing Company?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes, that is the printing business. The publishing business is all
handled by the Globe Printing Company,
and, as you know, the publication is distributed under the name of the Globe and Mail.
I do not think I can say anything further
in explaining this legislation. The bill is a
simple one, having just one paragraph. If
I may take the time, I should like to read
it. It may be that honourable senators may
see fit to pass the bill without referring it to
committee.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Why is it necessary to
limit the value of the real estate which the
company may own? Has it been getting any
special privileges from the government?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: There is no special
privilege or condition.
The present Act
restricts the annual value of the real estate
which may be held by the corporation to
$30,000.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Nearly every company that is incorporated nowadays is given
ancillary powers to enable it to hold sufficient
lands for its requirements, and no restriction
is placed on the value. But at the time the
Globe Printing Company was incorporated it
was probably the practice to impose a restriction. At any rate, originally the company's
real estate holdings were not permitted to
exceed an annual value of $5,000. This was
later increased to $30,000, and the present bill
would raise the limitation to $100,000.
Hon. Mr. Léger: Why not strike out the
limitation altogether? I cannot see the purpose of it.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I do not suppose the
company would object very much to a declaration that it could hold real estate without
restriction as to value, but I should think it
would be proper to continue the practice that
has been followed in this case by simply
increasing the amount mentioned in the
proviso. The bill is a short one, and I will
read it:
The proviso to section one of chapter one hundred
and twenty-three of the statutes of 1866 of the late
Province of Canada, as amended by section one of
chapter seventy-five of the statutes of 1892, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
Provided always that the real estate held by the
said corporation at any time shall not exceed, in
annual value, the sum of one hundred thousand
dollars.

Hon. Mr. Léger: I could understand the
placing of a restriction of that kind on companies receiving some special privilege fron
parliament, such as exemption from taxation, but why should the restriction beimposed on a purely commercial company,
any more than on a private individual?
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I notice in the explanatory note
appended to the bill that the increase in the
annual value of real estate which may be

to the real value of those properties. In the
circumstances I should like to know how
this bill relates to the necessity of carrying
on the business of the corporation. That is a
point which I think should be made clear
to us.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is not the value of
the company's properties that the bill refers
to, but their annual rental value. I asked
specifically whether the amount was large
enough to cover the properties, and I was
assured that it was. The explanation given
to me was that the amendment is sought for
the specific purpose of enabling the Globe
Printing Company to acquire the title to and
ownership of the building it occupies, from
the Mail Printing Company. At present the
Mail Printing Company owns the building,
which bas been financed by a loan from the
Globe Printing Company.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What objection is there to
wiping out this limitation altogether and
allowing the company to hold as much real
estate as it may wish?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I do not suppose there
would be any objection to that, but I think it
would be far better to follow the practice
that has been adopted in the past, particularly since the petitioner has asked that that
be done. If honourable members wish to
discuss the bill in committee, I am quite
willing that it should be referred to the ComPrivate Bills,

alIthough I had hoped that my explanation
here would be sufficient. The amendment
'strikes me as a very simple one. A similar
amendment bas been made on previous occasions, and there is nothing sinister about it.
I do not think anyone can give a fuller
explanation than I have given this afternoon.

Mr. Campbell) lias satisfied me at least-and
I am considered a very stupid fellow in money
matters-that what the bill seeks to do is to
empower the company to hold real estate of
greater value than it is permitted to hold
under the present Act. The only sinister purpose that I can imagine for doing this would
be to avoid income tax, though I do not know
how that could be done. My honourable
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) may
remember the old adage: "While the light
holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may
return." Perhaps the Globe and Mail can be
said to have returned, and bas decided in the
past ten or twelve years to change its view
on life.
I am quite willing to let the bill go to
committee, but it seems to me that we should
try to get some bills through the house
promptly and over to the other place. We
should show the other house that we can
pass legislation without holding it up for
three or four weeks. I recall that a few
years ago a bill to amend the divorce laws
was introduced in this house, and a senator,
now gone to his reward, refused to move its
adoption for a month, with the result that
it reached the other place when parliament
vas about to prorogue, and the bill was not
considered there.
Had the honourable
gentleman taken the action be was urged to
take, the proposed legislation would have
reached the other house in plenty of time, and
probably would have been passed.
It makes no difference to me personally
whether this bill goes to committee or not.
I only read the Globe antd Mail once in a
while, but I would say it is a very good publication; in fact, it is one of the best newspapers in Canada; it ranks with the Montreal
Star, the Winnipeg Free Press-

SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill J, an Act respecting Chartered
Trust and Executor Company.
He said: Honourable senators, after an
explanation of this bill I shall move that it
be referred to the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.
This is a simple amendment to change
the name of the company by dropping "and
Executor", so that the company's title will
be "Chartered Trust Company" instead of
"Chartered Trust and Executor Company".
The sole purpose is to enable the company to
operate under the shorter name. The amendment does not in any way change the powers
or rights of the company.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Does its new name conflict with any other name?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I understand that it
does not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: After reading over this bill
I am doubtful whether the words of the
amendment would cover a situation where
the company under its existing name had
been named an executor.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I think it does. The
bill effects no change in the company's
powers; there are many precedents for a
change of this kind; and it will be noticed
that section 1 provides that:
Such change in name shall notin any way impair,
alter or affect the rights or liabilities of the company, nor in any wise affect any suit or proceedings
now pending, or judgment existing, either by, or
in favour of, or against the company, which, notwithstanding such change in the name of the company, may be prosecuted, continued, completed and
enforced as if this Act had not been passed.

The fact is that it continues to be the same
company.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend does
not get my point. Suppose that by my will
I have appointed Chartered Trust and
Executor Company the executor of my estate:
if this bill is passed have I appointed the
company or not?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I am not so sure.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is the same legal
entity.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It would be well to make
sure, because the question came up in connection with the United Church of Canada
Act, and the question of whether or not it
affected the Presbyterian Church in Canada
went to the courts.

Ac'.

He said: Honourable senators, the honourable member from Cariboo has kindly consented to explain this bill.
Hon. J. G. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
in rising to support the second reading of this
bill, which is designed to amend the Industrial
Development Act, I realize that it is a type
of legislation which could provoke a great
deal of discussion. I feel, however, that the
major part of such a discussion would be in
the form of questions and answers, followed

by whatever suggestions might be justified
by the information elicited. The honourable
the acting leader of the government (Hon,
Mr. Copp) has informed me that when the
bill has received second reading he will move
that it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Eanking and Commerce. For that reason
it is not my intention to explain the bill at
length tonight or to make any urgent appeal
for its passage.
While there may appear to be a conflict
between the bill and the preamble of the
Act which was assented to in August 1944
in reality there is none. The objective of the
Act was to assist business enterprises of a
certain nature which could not secure from
ordinary sources the capital necessary for the

commencement

of operations.

This bill is

designed to help smaller industries and has
particular reference to them.
The proposed legislation seeks to amend
section 15 of the Industrial Development
Bank Act by deleting the words "fifteen million dollars" and substituting therefor the
words "twenty-five million dollars." Section
15 of the Act now provides that the aggregate
amount of the loans or liabilities of the bank,
as respects individual loans of more than
$200,000, must not exceed $15 million. This
bill proposes to increase this aggregate to
$25 million.
The increase in the capital cost of construction constitutes almost the entire reason for
requesting this amendment.
But in addition there is the fact that of the $30 million
currently authorized by the bank, $13 million
represent applications for loans, each of
which is in excess of $200,000, and $17 million represent requests of less than $200,000
each. By reason of payments, the figure of
$13 million was reduced to $11 million; but
it has recently gone back to approximately
$12 million. I would point out that as the
bank is authorized to grant at any time $100
million by way of assistance to industrial
operations, under this bill $75 million would
remain to be applied completely to the smaller
enterprises whose applications for credit are
found to be justified and who are seeking
less than $200,000 each.
To bring the record up to date I may say,
speaking merely in round figures, that up to
September 30, 1948, after approximately four
years of operation, 1,640 applications had
been made to the Industrial Development
Bank for assistance. Of these applications,
586 were granted, 519 were rejected as not
justifiable, and approximately 500 were withdrawn, mainly because the applicants found
that they could secure assistance elsewhere.
In respect of the 586 applications which were
approve, advances were made to the extent

FEBRUARY 14, 1949
of $39 million, an amount which has been
reduced by repayments to approximately
$30 million.
There may be those who will question
whether such a bank as the Industrial
Development Bank, which is a subsidiary of
the Bank of Canada, is needed. I believe that
a study of the business of the bank in the
last four years provides the right answer.
Let me point out in this regard that it was
not the purpose of parliament to make this
bank a competitor of other banks or of any
sort of financial institution which is prepared
to give credit to industrial projects, particularly new ones. However, so many applications have been received, and so many millions of dollars advanced, that it has been
found necessary to increase from $15 million
to $25 million the aggregate of loans, liabilities and expenditures in respect of individual
amounts larger than $200,000. These facts in
themselves are a sufficient answer to any
doubt as to the advisability of having started
a bank of this nature and put it in a position
adequately to carry on its functions.
I will not detain you longer. I would
simply add that it gives me great pleasure to
say these few words in favour of this bill,
which is designed to amend the Industrial
Development Bank Act in such a manner as
to permit the bank to lend an aggregate of
$25 million in loans of over $200,000 each,
instead of being restricted to $15 million, as
it is now. As a member of the Senate I
appreciate the statement of the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and the
honourable senator who is acting for him this
evening (Hon. Mr. Copp) that when the bill
has received second reading a motion will be
made to refer it for further study to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I am not at all sure that this bill should be
passed. What we are doing is, in effect,
pledging the people of Canada to lend new
businesses about $100 million. Anybody starting in business who wishes to borrow money
and who is a good risk can go with reasonable confidence to the chartered banks. I
should think that the chartered banks would
be among the foremost to welcome legislation of this kind. I am neither a director
nor a shareholder of any bank, nor am I in
the confidence of one; but were I the president, a director or a shareholder of such a
bank I would hold up both hands for this
bill. Human nature being what it is-and it
is always the same-when a man or woman
who wants to borrow money for capital
investment cannot get it for lack of assets to
justify the loan, how convenient it will be for
a bank official to be able to say, "Just cross

the street to the government bank, and they
will give you all you want."
Hon. Mr. Copp: Are you sure of that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, that is human nature.
Hon. Mr. Copp: But will they lend all the
money anybody wants?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, they have done pretty
well along that Une. Remember, we have
been passing through the most prosperous
times this continent has known for many
years: at any rate we have been disposing of
our goods to people who are willing to buy
them to any amount so long as we lend them
the money, although as soon as we stop lending the jig will be up. High income taxes in
this country are drying up the pool of private
funds available for investment, and will
reduce it more and more in the future. Heavy
taxation of corporations has made it very
difficult for them to expand. An accumulated
reserve of a hundred thousand dollars, a half
million dollars, or any other amount was
really income, but the minute it was distributed it became taxable in the hands of
the shareholders.
The government recently amended the law
to limit the taxation on distributed reserves,
and thereby admitted that the existent heavy
taxation was drying up investment funds.
Today, although frantic attempts are made
to obtain money for new industries, individual
investors will not respond. They put their
money into well-established dividend-paying
industries whose assets represent many times
the money needed, but other enterprises cannot get new capital. Look at the trend of
the stock market in the last six months. Consolidated Smelters has fallen from 128 a
month ago to 105 or 106 today; Hudson Bay
Mining, which sold at 58 a few weeks back, is
now quoted at 47, and so on all down the
list. What largely accounts for this decline
is our heavy taxation, which has prevented
or discouraged the influx of new money into
capital investment, and thus has created the
condition which is sought to be met in this
legislation.
It is also to be remarked that in spite of
the long experience of our chartered banks,
and their practice of engaging men of high
ability, who understand the principles of
investments and loans, they invariably suffer
tremendous losses in times of depression. I
know of one bank that lost millions of dollars
in the province of my honourable friend from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) through the
failure of investments which, when they were
made, were belleved to be sound. The Industrial Development Bank will find itself taking
over what I may call the "left-overs"ý-advancing money to beginners in business. Of
course, one always hopes they will succeed,

SENATE

but they will not; they never have done.
Only one boy in a hundred who have gone
to school in any village, town or city in Canada has ever succeeded in business, the rest
have fallen by the wayside. Those who have
fallen by the wayside are the ones who come
under this regulation. And who is running
the business? Untrained men are in charge
of it. It is the Bank of Canada and its
directors. Anybody can run the Bank of
Canada. A junior in a chartered bank could
handle that job. All the bank does-I have
always suspected that it was one man-is to
decide what the trend is. During the last
year the Industrial Development Bank lent
$39 million and it now has only $30 million
out. Why does it need authorization to lend
more money? I predict that within the next
five years we will hear honourable members
of this bouse explaining-and I expect to live
long enough to hear them-just what happened and why we lost money. For six or
seven years the Manitoba government, claiming that the farmers were the backbone of
the country, lent them money. I was one of
those who stood up in the legislature and
challenged what was proposed. I said it
was all a mistake, and we lost everything
because the cost of collection was greater
than the amount collected. There was no
profit at all, and the government was forced
out of the business.
We have a farm-loan system in Canada, and
the only reason the country has had no
trouble yet is that the lending started when
money values were low. That is, loans of $10
an acre were made on lands valued at, say,
$20 an acre. Today those lands are worth
$30 or $35 an acre. But wait until values start
to go down, as they always do eventually. The
Americans, who are authorities on ups and
downs of real estate, will tell you that every
eighteen years real estate climbs in value and
then descends. That is the cycle. This bas been
true in my fifty years' experience in Manitoba. If you are wise, a bit lucky and buy at
the low point, and then sell at the high point,
you make a lot of money. But the money to
be lent under this bill will be lent at a high
point, caused by the billions we have loaned
to the world. The United States have done
the same thing and are commencing to howl
already. They say that the minute any commodity is surplus, they will not buy it. What
will we do with our wheat, flax, potatoes,
honey, eggs and all those commodities? We
will not be able to sell them, and the beginner who borrowed money will be bankrupt,
and the government will lose its dollars.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? By what remote
connection can he trace the price of eggs,
honey, and so forth, to the Industrial Development Bank?

Hon. Mr. Haig: Because the industrialists
sell their goods to the people who produce
potatoes and eggs and honey, and to nobody
else. I put it to my honourable friend from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner): Is it not so
that you pay twice as much for farm implements now as you paid thirty or thirty-five
years ago.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I pay three times as much
now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was not going that far,
but I remember my father buying a MasseyHarris machine for $153 which costs about
$400 today.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It is a better machine
now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not a bit better.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is not nearly as good
now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall not argue whether
it is better or worse. Those are the facts.
When farmers cannot sell their commodities,
industry must cut down its production. That
has happened before, all over the world. The
minute the buyers, who are usually the producers, stop purchasing, industry fails. This
legislation is to build and hold up enterprise,
but we do not need it at all. If our chartered
banks will not lend the money, then it is
our duty to legislate to compel them to
do so, if it is safe; but I have never heard of
anybody who wanted to invest his money for
very long in the kind of institution that this
bill is to help.
Honourable senators, I am quite willing
that the bill go to committee, because there
is no sense in dividing the house; but I am
definitely opposed to the government getting
involved in private industry and private
business-and that is what it is doing here. I
believe in private enterprise in all its
branches, and in regulating industry so that
it will benefit everybody. Under this measure
the government is taking the place of the
banks which should lend the money. Every
time this is done more of the country's assets
are written off. Manitoba is a perfect illustration of this, and I venture to say that every
province which has entered into the moneylending business will tell the same story in
tirne.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, it
is not often that I agree with the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), but
I recall that I was a member of the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the other place
when it discussed the original bill which my
honourable friends hope to amend. If I
remember correctly, the bill was designed to
help small industries. It provided for the

FEBRUARY 14, 1949
lending of money in cases in which an institution that would not expect to make a loss
would not be justified in making an advance.
I do not like this legislation, because it brings
uneconomic institutions into competition with
sound industry. When it is considered that
the government is the biggest partner in
industry-it takes at least 35 per cent of the
profit in taxes-it seems to me that it is not
in the interest of business or government to
bring uneconomic forces into industry at the
present time. I still feel that the Industrial
Development Bank might help a deserving
person who was short of capital and who
wanted to tide over a difficulty. However,
as I understand it, the proposed bill authorizes
an increase up to $200,000 in individual loans.
Now, will anybody tell me that a loan of
$200,000 to one person is not big business?
If any man in this country is entitled to such
a loan it seems to me that he should be in a
position to stand on his own feet.
Honourable senators, I think that this
amendment is being introduced into this
house primarily because it has not gone
through committee in the other house. I
think we should give it careful consideration.
I am told that in Nova Scotia industries that
got substantial loans from the Industrial
Development Bank have been shut down.
Their last condition is worse than their first.
This legislation creates unemployment and
defeats the very object for which it was
intended. I supported the original bill when
it went through the other house, because I
felt that conditions were such that some
provision of this nature should be made for
smaller industries. It seems to me that to
amend the Act now to make it applicable to
big business would tend to destroy the very
thing for which the Act was passed, and
would not be good for financial and industrial stability or the progress of the country.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, the purpose of this legislation is to help
little industries. I recal an incident which
illustrates that. One day after the war there
came into my office a representative of a
small industry near Quebec. As a result of
the war his company was in bad shape and
had applied to a bank for a loan of $50,000;
and although the company's building was
valued at more than $100,000 the bank had
refused the loan. I believe, although I am
not sure, the reason for the bank's refusal
was that this little concern was competing
with a big organization, and that some of
the bank's directors were closely connected
with that organization. The small industry
was helped by the Industrial Development
Bank and is now doing a good business, and

prosperity has come back to the little town
where the company is located.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: This bill would authorize
loans up to $200,000.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This amendment is to
help big industry.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: No, it is not.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I think it is only fair to recall the conditions under which the Industrial Development Bank Act was passed. It is a misrepresentation to suggest that the purpose of the
Act is to support big industry. The Act in its
very essence and from the time of its origin
was intended for the support of small industries commandeered into action during the
war, and which produced large supplies of
very necessary war materials. They had
capital expenditures advanced to them, and
under the regulations of the War Contracts
Depreciation Board were enabled to write off
through depreciation and out of profits the
cost of their plant expansions in three years
or more. I know of several such industries.
When the war ended they were left with
expanded plants and no capital at all on
which to operate. This legislation was introduced for the purpose of supporting justifiable
industries in that class that had done their
part in this country during the war, and there
was never any suggestion at all that it was to
be used for supporting big industries. Under
the Bank Act the chartered banks are not
permitted to make loans on terms suitable to
these small industries, and it was that point
of view which prevailed upon the Banking
and Commerce Committee when this Act was
approved.
Whether or not the bank should be permitted to increase its accumulated loans from $15
million to $25 million is a question that can
be decided after the bill is considered by the
Banking and Commerce Committee. But to
say that this legislation should be done away
with because it is serving the interests of big
business is surely partisan interpretation of
the worst kind, and I resent it, for I was one
of the members of the Banking and Commerce Committee who supported the original
measure when it was brought in for the very
legitimate purpose of helping worthy industries that were unable to get help from the
chartered banks.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If they have a legitimate

basis for a loan, why can they not get help
from the chartered banks?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My honourable friend
is a good business man, and he ought to
know that the chartered banks are restricted
to making current commercial loans. The

SENATE

loans desired by smail industries such as I
have been referring Io are of the intermrediate type, which extend over a longer
period.
Hon. Mr. Horner: To my mind this is
another piece of socialism. Even our socialistie government out in Saskatchewan is
closing plants that it started, but the government here is stili practising socialism. That
is what this is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My honourable friend's
interpretation of socialism is different from
mine, if that is what he thinks about this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what the public
1,hinks too.

Hon. Mr. Horner: It is giving away people's
money.

The Hon. the Speaker: H-onourable sena-

tors, the motion is for the second reading of
Bill K. an Act to amend the Industrial
Development Act. Is it your pieasure te pass

NEWFOUNDLAND-CANADA

UNION BILL

SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. Copp (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
moved the second reading of Bill 11, an Act

to approve the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I regret
exceedingly, as we all do, the absence of our
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who was prepared to present this bill and explain it on
the motion for second reading. But little
needs to be said about the bill by me, for we
all know what it contains and what is its
object. I am going to try to present as nearly
as I can the statement that our leader had
intended to make in explanation of the bill.
On the llth of December last an outstanding historical event took place in this very
chamber, when the proposed terms of the
union of Newfoundland with Canada were
signed. It is my honour to ask the Senate
to make these terms of union part of the
constitution of Canada, and to complete the
original geographical conception of this
nation.
These terms of union do not ask us to make
any novel change in our ideas of Canada's
nationhood. They are a concrete embodiment
of what has long been a part of our historical
hopes for Canada. Ever since we began to
study Canadian history we have hopefully
thought of Canada as ultimately including
Newfoundland.
This inheritance of hope has been passed
on to us by the Fathers of Confederation.
Two members from Newfoundland attended
the Quebec Conference in 1864. Although
they helped to frame the resolution upon
which the British North America Act was
based, they did not go to Westminster to
consider its drafting. They were, nevertheless, in the thoughts of the people who were
there, and provision was made for the entry
of Newfoundland in the same terms as those
that provided for Prince Edward Island. In
1869 those people on the Island of Newfoundland who were interested in union with
Canada, caused an election to be held on
that question. The pro-union forces were
decisively defeated. Again in 1895, with

Newfoundland in serious financial straits,
negotiations were resumed between the two
respective governments. However, no agreement could be reached by the negotiating
parties, and no recommendations were made
to either side.
Newfoundland's history flowed with ours
again in 1914, when she became involved in
the first Great War. The island made heroic
sacrifices from her limited resources. The war
saw at least a temporary end to her pressing
financial problems. She was able to carry
on without crisis until the full force of the
depression struck in the 1930's. Newfoundland, like ourselves, depends largely on
external trade for her livelihood, and she is
extremely susceptible to any changes in
world markets.
The government of Newfoundland requested the government of the United Kingdom
to make an investigation of the island's problems. A commission was appointed on this
recommendation. This commission advised
that the government of the United Kingdom
should assume the financial obligations of
Newfoundland, and that the constitution of
the island be suspended and that a commission
government be set up in its place. A further
recommendation of the commission was that
when the financial difficulties were overcome
the constitution should be restored.
The second Great War again found Newfoundland fighting alongside Canada. She
made great contributions, to the fighting
forces of both this nation and those of Great
Britain. Although Newfoundland's position
improved greatly before and during the war,
the technicalities of restoring her constitution
had to be forgone in the. face of the great
struggle. At the end of the war the commission government was possessed of a surplus of $70 million.
A national convention of Newfoundland
was called in 1946 for the purpose of determining the wishes of the people of the island
respecting the form of government to be
adopted. Delegates from this forty-five man
convention were sent to interview the Government of the United Kingdom. A similar
delegation was appointed to approach Canada
as to terms that might be obtained from her
in the event of an overture for union. This
delegation arrived in Ottawa early in June
of 1947. It was headed by Mr. F. G. Bradley,
K.C., and the other delegates were Mr. T. G.
W. Ashborne, Rev. Lester L. Burry, Mr. G. F.
Higgins, K.C., Mr. Charles H. Ballam, Mr.
P. W. Crummey, and Mr. J. R. Smallwood.
The discussions which followed resulted in
a statement of terms being prepared by the
Canadian Government and forwarded to the

SENATE
Governor of Newfoundland by the then Prime
Minister, Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie
King, and these terms were considered by the
convention on the assumption that they were
the terms which the Government of Canada
would recommend to its parliament, if the
people of Newfoundland decided that they
wished to become a partner in our confederation.
There was a motion placed before the Newfoundland National Convention that the question of joining Canada should be placed on the
proposed referendum ballot. The motion was
defeated by a vote of 29 to 16, the delegates
deciding that the referendum should be only
on the questions of responsible government or
the continuation of commission government.
Following this, petitions were circulated about
the island asking that, in addition, the question of joining the Canadian confederation be
placed on the ballot. The Government of the
United Kingdom still had the responsibility
for the affairs of the island, and it decided
that the question of joining Canada should
be included as one of the three questions to
be submitted to the electorate of Newfoundland.
The first referendum was held on June 3,
1948. There was no over-all majority for any
of the questions on the ballot. The registered
electorate numbered 176,297; of these, 155,777
voted. Responsible
government received
69,400 votes, or 44-55 per cent of the total:
union with Canada received 64,066 votes, or
41-13 per cent; commission government
received 22,311 votes, or 14-32 per cent.
As a result of this stalemate, a second referendum was held, and the question of commission
government-it
having
previously
received the lowest number of votes-was
dropped from the ballot. In the second referendum the total votes cast numbered 149,657;
of these 71,334 were for responsible government and 78,323 for confederation. Thus confederation received a majority of 6,989 votes,
or 4-68 per cent of the total. Further, confederation received a majority in 18 out of
the 25 electoral districts from which members
had formerly been elected to the Legislature
of Newfoundland.
After the second referendum, Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, the then Prime
Minister, stated that he and his government
would welcome authorized delegates of Newfoundland to discuss terms of union with
Canada. He stated that the basis for the discussions would be his letter and supporting
documents which had been sent to the Governor of Newfoundland on October 29, 1947,
and to which I have already referred.
The Right Honourable Mr. King also stated,
at the same time, that the result of the

referendum was clear and left no doubt that
the people of Newfoundland were in favour
of confederation.
On October 6, 1948, discussions were opened
here on the final terms of union. A delegation was appointed by the Newfoundland
Government. It was headed by Honourable
A. J. Walsh, K.C., now Sir A. J. Walsh, and
the other members were Mr. F. G. Bradley,
K.C., and Mr. J. R. Smallwood-both of
whom had been members of the first delegation in 1947-Mr. Chesley A. Crosbie, Mr.
Philip Gruchy, Mr. J. B. McEvoy, K.C.,
and Mr. Gordon A. Winter. The negotiations
were concluded in this chamber on December
11 last; and it is fitting that the formal signing
of the agreement should have taken place in
this house, which stands as the guardian of
the provinces. At the time of signing, the
Prime Minister, Right Honourable Louis S.
St. Laurent, paid fitting tribute to the efforts
of his predecessor, the Right Honourable
W. L. Mackenzie King, to bring about this
union, for it was he who had most of the
responsibility in starting the Canadian negotiations.
It is the hope of those who have been
actively engaged in these proceedings that
they will be facilitated in order to allow
Newfoundland's entry into confederation on
March 31 next. The agreement requires, first,
that it be ratified by the Canadian parliament
and the Newfoundland government; only then
can it be confirmed by the Parliament of the
United Kingdom, for it is impossible for that
body to pass a statute affecting Canada unless
it is requested to do so by both houses of the
Canadian parliament. The result of all this
legislation and discussion will be an Address
of this House to His Majesty, which, together
with a similar address passed in the other
place, will request His Maiesty to place the
appropriate legislation before the Parliament
of the United Kingdom.
The terms of union provide that the legislation respecting Newfoundland shall remain in
effect until it is repealed or modified by the
appropriate body under the division of powers
in the British North America Act. It is proposed that the existing laws of Canada shall
not all apply to Newfoundland as soon as she
enters confederation, but will be applied
gradually by proclamation of the Governor
General.
It was originally provided by section 146 of
the British North America Act that upon joint
addresses from both Houses of Parliament of
Canada, and from the Legislature of Newfoundland, Newfoundland could be admitted
into corfederation on an order by-as it was
then-Her Majesty the Queen. However, Newfoundland's subsequent loss of responsible
government bas made this impossible.
Further, no longer does His Majesty, on the

FEBRUARY 15. 1949
advice of his mninisters responsible to the
Parliament of the United Kingdom, exercise
the royal prerogative over Canada. Neither
can we do this ourselves, as the United Kingdom is still responsible for Newfoundland
under the present commission government.
The proposed procedure, which I have outlined here, follows generally that adopted
when the western territories of Canada were
admitted as provinces of the dominion. We
have adopted that procedure in this case because it leaves no doubt that what has been
done is beyond successful contestation before
the courts.
In making this motion, honourable senators,
I feel that we are on the verge of a bistoric
event which we trust will be advantageous
both to the new province in our confederation
and to Canada itself.
Borne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
this is an historic occasion and one which was
looked forward to even prior to 1867. When
we corne to discuss the resolution, differences
of opinion may arise; but in the meantime I
arn going to support the second reading of
this bill, as I hope every member of this bouse
will do.
Since 1864 oui constant ambition as
Canadians bas been, irrespective of the difficulties that Newfoundlanders may bave seen
in it, that Newfoundland sbouid become part
of Canada. I may say quite candidly tbat if
I were a Newfoundlander I would find it
difficuit to be very enthusiastic about this
legisiation. I recaîl from bistory that a year
after Nova Scotia and New Brunswick entered
Confederation, their respective governments,
wbo were responsible for what had bappened,
I
were decisively defeated at tbe poils.
remember well tbat just a year or two ago
the honourable leader of this bouse (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) said tbat on July 1 many Nova
Scotians hung out the flag of Nova Scotia
instead of the Union Jack. I can understand
the feelings of Newfoundlanders. They feel
they are now a sovereign people, and fear that
when tbey join Canada they will become
merely a province. 1 tbink they are wrong
in that view. Wbffen they join Canada tbey
will become an even more sovereign peopletbey will become part of our people.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hlear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We shail welcome them
wîth ail oui hearts. When I look at tbe map
and think of present world conditions, I feel
tbat I should like to see Newfoundland a part
of Canada. When we were yd'ung men, prior
to 1910 or 1912, it neyer occurred to us-it
neyer did to me, at least-that there would
ever be any world trouble involving war.

Then came the war of 1914-18. Altbough at
tbat time a few submarines came close to oui
shores the war did not seem very near to us.
Had Newfoundland been a neutral country or
belonged to a nation not involved in tbe war,
it rnight have proved a great handicap to
Canada's war effort in Europe. But because
of the development of the airpiane, the waî
of 1939-45 brought home to us cleaîly that
Newfoundland is a vital part of our defence.
In this respect alone Newfoundland becomes
an important adjunct to Canada.
Tbe only criticism. 1 bave ever had to make
of Great Britain is that wben she negotiated
the boundaries between Quebec and tbe
United States, she permitted the arbitrators

Canada. I have always feit hostile about that.
Then, wben I go to the Pacific coast and
travel by boat froni Vancouver to Skagway,
after passing Prince Rupert I run into a strip
of American land along our coast. That was
another matter of arbitration that went
wrong. Those two things have confirmed me
in the feeling that Newfoundland sbould be
a part of Canada. I do flot want Newfoundland to be Canadian terîitory: just because
it is reported that iron and other naturai
resources are to be found there. Some of us
may be interested in those natural resources,
but most Canadians really feel that Newfoundland is part of Canada; that bier people
tbink and believe as we do, and cherish the
sanie love of freedoni and religion that we do.
Canadians feel that geogîaphically Newfoundland should be part of this country.
Some Canadians may shake their beads
and argue that we are paying a large suni of
money for something, and shaîl neyer get it
back. I do not know, because I bave not the
facts. Then, too, many people from Newfoundland may argue that when their natural
resources are developed tbeir island wil
become one of the greatest storebouses of
natural wealth in Canada. This may be true,
but I really do not think it enters into the
picture. Be that as it may, it is only a small
matter when you consider the 111e of a nation.

FEBRUARY 15, 1949
It has been discussed
Hon. Mr. Euler:
several times.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I refer to oleomargarine.
It has been said, apparently on behalf of the
Progressive Conservative party, that the provision respecting oleomargarine should not
have been in the agreement. It is section 46,
and it provides that while oleomargarine may
lawfully continue to be manufactured in the
new province of Newfoundland, it shall not
be sold in any other province contrary to the
law of Canada. It has been objected that
owing to a decision by the Supreme Court of
Canada this provision should not be in the
bill now, and that its being there will establish a precedent. I admit, honourable senators, that as a result of the Supreme Court's
decision the necessity for this provision is
not so clear as it was before the decision was
given; but I do object to the suggestion that
the progress of the negotiations between the
two countries should be checked by a modification of this agreement on that ground.
And particularly do I object to the suggestion
that this provision in the bill will create a
precedent. It is now almost thirteen years
since I came into the Senate, and I get very
tired of hearing it said-not merely by my
honourable friends opposite but by departmental officials to whom one has to go on
behalf of one's constituents, as well as pretty
nearly every minister that one has to consult
about questions where there seems to be
injustice-"Oh, yes, you have made out a
good case, and we admit the injustice; but
we cannot possibly do anything about it,
because that might create a precedent." I did
hope, honourable senators, that if the party
of my honourable friends opposite came into
office-I never considered the danger very
imminent-they would change their viewpoint with regard to the risk of precedents;
but apparently that viewpoint is going to
stay with us, no matter which party is in
power.
Seriously, honourable senators, looking at
this section on its merits, I cannot see in it
any risk of a precedent. At the time it was
inserted it seemed that failure to insert it
would be a real obstacle to confederation
with Newfoundland. Precedents govern only
when similar cases arise, and I cannot see
how a provision based upon special circumstances relating exclusively to a country about
to become a new province could have any
effect on -the general law of Canada that
there shall be a free exchange of trade
between the provinces.
Here is another matter which perhaps technically is a detail that could be considered in
committee, but that nevertheless refers to the
general principle of the bill. In the remarks

of the honourable leader of the opposition I
detected a suggestion that when the resolution is moved in this house a legal question
might arise. I take it that he has in mind the
constitutional question of whether or not the
provinces should be consulted before the
request is made to the British parliament to
amend the British North America Act. May
I suggest to my honourable friend that it
seems to me that if that question has any
justification or importance, the time to consider it is right now, when we are dealing
with the agreement itself. I say that if in
the last analysis this matter is shown to be
one about which the provinces are entitled to
be consulted, they should have been brought
into the conference at the very beginning.
When I speak of "the provinces" I mean the
provinces as distinct from the dominion, for
of course both this house and the other house
are composed of representatives of all the
provinces, and those provinces are all being
considered in both houses at the present time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The suggestion is made
that the provinces should be consulted separately as individual units. Well, if there is any
logic in that suggestion-and I do not believe
there is-they should have been called in on
the negotiation of the agreement. If the
provinces should have been consulted as a
matter of constitutional right, and if objection
by any of the provinces would block legislation by the Imperial Parliament, then it
seems to me that they should have been considered and brought into the conference from
the very commencement. Of course no one
seriously suggests that this should have been
done.
This criticism is part of a wider campaign
that is being carried on in certain provinces
concerning the constitutional rights of the
provinces. I have heard it suggested that if
the Dominion Parliament asserts the right to
ask the Imperial Parliament to amend the
British North America Act in connection with
matters that are purely national in character,
a precedent is thereby created and that there
is no guarantee that parliament may not go
further and ask for amendments to the constitution that affect the rights of individual
provinces and minorities. I say, sir, that
without any question that is a mischievous
doctrine to preach in the Dominion of Canada.
It is mischievous for at least two reasons.
First, when in the history of the dominion
has any government seriously suggested that
parliament, or the representatives of each and
every province in Canada, would seek to
interfere with the rights in language, religion
or any other matters pertaining to the minoriHas it ever been suggested by a
ties?
responsible party or a group in parliament

SENATE
that the Parliament of Canada would ever ask
the Imperial government to pass legislation
amending the British North America Act in
such a way as to interfere with the rights of
minorities? There can be no greater guarantee of the preservation of those rights than
the individual honour and integrity of the
people of Canada, of every race and religion.
In addition, should this unthinkable procedure be adopted at any time, I know of no
precedent by which we could expect the
Imperial Parliament-so long as any responsibility is imposed in that body-to heed a
majority voice in this country asking for
amendments that would affect, not matters of
national concern, but only provincial and
minority questions. Honourable senators, it
is unfortunate that any suggestion of that
kind has ever been made in Canada. The
best answer to it is the unity of Canada, the
spirit of the Canadian people, and the attitude of the Imperial Parliament, all of which
show that such a thing has never been
thought of and would never be tolerated.
Question has been raised about the tax
agreement provisions between Canada and
Newfoundland.
Apparently there are two
provisions concerning income tax and other
matters-first, that Newfoundland may accept
an offer from the dominion on the same terms
as those on which the other provinces have
accepted; and second, that when the special
offer has been made to Newfoundland it may
enter into a contract for a period of, I think,
eight years. If Newfoundland chooses to
enter into that contract it will be binding for
that term, regardless of any deal made with
any other province. The question has been
asked: Why discriminate against Newfound]and? Honourable senators, there is no discrimination against Newfoundland. There
are provisions today whereby the provinces
have agreements with the dominion for three
years, and if a change is made with any one
province the others are entitled to the same
consideration. Newfoundland also is entitled
to that same consideration. She will have the
opportunity of accepting on the same basis
as the other provinces. In addition, another
proposition has been made to Newfoundland.
If she wishes, she may make a special bargain for a longer period of time, but by
adopting this alternative she must expect to
be bound by it. It therefore follows, not that
Newfoundland is discriminated against, but
rather has secured for herself a special offer,
if she wishes to accept it.
Comments have been made in Canada
about the procedure by which that country
has been authorized to enter into this agreement, and we are not unmindful of remarks
made about it in Newfoundland. But that
matter does not immediately concern us in
Canada, except to this extent. My honour-

able friend from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
Copp) has referred to the province of Nova
Scotia. and we all know that that province
was rather hustled into confederation against
her own wishes. But it has not turned out
to be such a bad arrangement. The Liberals
no doubt seriously criticized Sir Charles
Tupper for what has been said to be his highhanded method of bringing Nova Scotia into
confederation. I think that all Canadians
will now agree that if Nova Scotia could not
have been brought in any other way, it was
a good thing that that method was taken. I
am sure that all of Canada is today very
glad and proud that Nova Scotia is part of
the Canadian confederation.
I believe, however, that we would be most
reluctant at this time to feel that any highhanded measures were taken by this country,
or by any group in Newfoundland or the
British Government, to force that ancient
colony, the oldest of all the North American
colonies, into confederation. By a free and
uncontrolled vote of all the electors of that
British community, a substantial majority
have declared their wish to join with Canada,
and I think that we can feel entirely free to
accept them on that basis.
My honourable friend mentioned something about the new senators that are to come
to this house, and indicated that they would
be six in number. Speaking as one from
British Columbia, I may say that we are very
glad to learn that there are to be six senators
from Newfoundland. We have not the least
criticism of that proposal, but there will come
a time in the affairs of this country when
British Columbia will have something to say
about her small Senate representation in comparison with her population, and the representation of other provinces, entirely apart
from Newfoundland.
Those, honourable senators. are the only
observations I wish to make of a special
nature. I do feel that every senator who
speaks should take advantage of this occasion
to comment on the great and historic significance of the use of parliament in bringing
about this confederation. It is eighty-five
years since, in 1864, the representatives of
the British Colonies on the North American
continent met in the city of Quebec at the
Quebec Conference. As my honourable
friend from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp)
has reminded us, Newfoundland was represented at that conference. It was as a direct
outcome of that meeting that the British
North America Act was passed three years
later. At that time only four provinces,
namely Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec
and Ontario joined Confederation; but

Perhaps flot the least of the reasons why
we seek ta welcome our friends from Newfoundland is that we know we are adding ta
aur population the right kind of citizens.
Saine Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Newfoundland is the aidest British colony on the North American
continent. It is a country of sound traditions.
As was so eloquently said in anather place,
its people are men of independent spirit; and
they have experienced samething that is good
f or the souls of men-a hard struggle for
existence.
Hon. Mr. Duif: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Farris: Thrift and industry are
the basis of success for any people. In some
quarters amangst us today there is a tendency ta seek gavernment assistance ta the
degree that people rely on the government
when they ought ta rely an themselves.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
set no limitation ta the extent ta which saciety
should go in giving assistance ta those who
are handicapped, but I think we must al
agree that the greatest asset o! the strong and
vigorous men o! a country is their spirit o!
independence, their determination ta work
and be thrifty, and ta succeed by their own
efforts instead o! being pap-fed by the state
or by any group in it.
We are consciaus o! the fact that t.he men
and women who are joining us at this time
are people of aur own kind. They have a
great spirit o! freedom, and they are prepared ta, fight for freedom, as they have done
in the past, when necessary.
But may I say-this may be presumptuaus,
though I think it is also fitting-that the union
is flot a one-sided or jug-handled affair.
While we know that the union will resuit in
great benefits ta Canada, we wauld not want
it ta be brought about unless it had in it a
reciprocity o! benefits ta bath countries.
When Newfoundland becomes the tenth province of Canada it wiJI be joining a country
that in the main has been built up by two
great races-the English and the French.
When I say "the English" I mean ta include
o! course the Scotch and the Irish, for these
three groups are the outstanding racial groups
amang English-speaking peoples. And when
1 say "the French" I mean the French Canadians as I have seen them-and 1 have
rningled with them and learned ta like and
respect them. I think they have produced
a greater race than was ever praduced in the
Mother Country of France. And, honourable
senators, it is my belief that out o! the coin-

bination o! these two great races and o! other
races that are caming ta this country there
will in trne emerge a race that will be greater
than any o! its camponent parts, a race that
will be known solely as Canadian, without
any other label whatsoever.
Newfoundland is con! ederating with a
country that has the same general ideals as
her own, the saine regard for British institutions, for the Mother a! Parliaments, and the
same layalty ta the King. As citizens o! this
country Newfoundlanders will live under two
great systems a! law that have pramated
justice and f air play in Canada-the Common
Law of England and the civil law as enjoyed
in the Province of Quebec. They are joinîng
a land of liberty, of civil and religiaus !reedom, and they will become part of a country
having two great languages, whose guarantee
a! continuance, as I have previously said of
other constitutional. features, is based on the
surest ground that it is passible ta have,
namely, rnutual respect and a common sense
of public honour and responsibility.
I have made some reference ta this union
as if it were a marriage, but I would point
out that the analogy is not quite apt. In the
first place, the marriage ceremony, as I have
heard it, cantains a vaw that each party will
forsake all others. In this confederation there
is no element of that kind. Neither party is
called upon ta forsake anything for which,
it has stood. Neither country will have ta
gîve up any of its rights, ideals or traditions.
AUl the men and women in the greater
dominion will continue ta bear aliegiance
ta His Majesty the King as they did before,
and His Majesty will continue ta be ta them
that same high symbol of liberty, freedom
and justice that he has been in the past. Also
in the marriage ceremony, as honaurable
senators will recail, one of the parties says
"With ail my worldly goods I thee endow.1
Well, no party ta this agreement is called
upon ta take any such action as that. This
is a federal union, and I do nat know of any
terma that better illustrates what that is than
the words themselves. A federal union means
that for national purpases ail the provinces
in the union are assaciated together as one
nation. It is many years ago since Abraham
Lincoln said that a nation cannot exist hall
free and half slave. In my opinion it is
equally true that no nation can exist half
sovereign and ha]! divided into independent
states challenging the sovereignty of the
nation as such. There is in this federal union,
as was recognized by the Fathers a! Confederation, the fullest ground and the fullest
scope for independence of thought, independence of civil rights and independence o!

religion and language, yet aIl are merged in
the great common purpose o! the nation,
which is Canada.
Honourable senators, Up till now it has
flot been my privilege to take any active part
in these proceedings for confederation. But
looking back over the years and recallîng
the work of! the Fathers of Confederation,
the rnen who laid the foundation o! the
Canada that exists today, and thinking o!
the developments that have taken place since
then and o! the eff orts that have resulted in
bringing this agreement to its present clirnax,
we can ail be proud to have had any small
share in the general scherne, and each of us
can say, as Virgil the poet said many years
ago, "0f ail these things I mysel! amn a part."
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, in
my brief observations I have no intention o!
atternpting to ernulate the eloquence of those
speakers who have preceded me, and perhaps
more particularly that of the honourable
senator !rom Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris).
Since we have heard fromn those members
who corne fromn the extreme parts of Canada,
and from the city of Winnipeg, it seems to
me not inappropriate that a humble senator
from the great province of Ontario should
join in welcorning to the federation of Canada
the tenth province, Newfoundland.
It seems to me particularly appropriate
that Newfoundland, because o! its geographic
location, should becorne part of Canada.
econornically, and perhaps
Industrially,
ethnically-although personally I cannot
dlaimi anything on that score-the Newfoundlanders are similar to the Canadian people.
As Newfoundland is rîght at the front door
of this country, I believe it entirely fitting
that it should become a part of this great
federation. It would be unfortunate, as has
been hinted, if in the course of tirne and
through force of circumstances Newfoundland should becorne the possession of some
other country, friendly and ail as that country might be.
With regard to the financial arrangements
that have been entered into, I have nothing
to say. I believe they would require a good
deal of time and study before one could
express an intelligent opinion as to their
merits. Probably in the agreernent New!oundland has been treated not ungenerously.
As a matter o! !act, I think that the people
o! Canada would not be particularly concerned if New!oundland did, perhaps, secure
some financial advantage.
My chief purpose in rising today is to reply
to some remarks made in the other place.
At this point, honourable senators, inay I

say that I see no reason why we should not
refer to the other place by its proper narnethe House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Right!
Hon. Mr. Euler: During my years as a
member of the House of Commons, and certainly during the regime of the immediate
past Prime Minister, rumours have been
passed and statements made from. time to
time, in the press and elsewhere, to the effect
that senators when appointed by the Prime
Minîster, were asked to subscribe to a pledge
or in some way to obligate themselves to
support legisiation that would corne from. the
government, especially in the matter of
reformning the Senate. That subi ect was
again brought Up in the House of Commons
only last week. I wish to quote from page
359 of the House of Commons Hansard, where
the honourable Mr. Rowe said:
However, the predecessor of the Prime Minister
stated on one occasion. when asking about reforming the Senate. that no one was appolnted to the
Senate by his government except those who were
committed to submit to any reforms the present
party might design. Therefore 1 should like to ask
the Prime Minister-

That is the present Prime Mînister.
-whether in the appointment of these new senators
from Newfoundland hie would inflict that obligation
upon them which, I understand, has been inflicted
upon every senator appointed by his government.

I think it is time that insinuation was publicly repudiated and denied. I say most
ernphatically that no such request, express or
implied, directly or indirectly, was made to
me upon my appointment to this body by the
Prime Minister.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I wish to say to rny honourable friends that I arn free to do exactly as
I think right and in the interests of this
country, without reference to the government
or anyone else. By that staternent I arn
making a sort of declaration o! independence,
but with ail due respect to the government
whose policies we support. I think the Senate
of Canada will neyer accomplish its true mission of service if its members do not exercise
a high degree of independence. I have spoken
for myself.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: That applies to ail.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It certainly applies to
me.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have spoken to perhaps
haif a dozen senators who sit in close
proximity to me, -and their experience with
regard to freedomn fromn obligation is the samie
as rny own. I for one would like the country to know that when the members of the

FEBRtJARY 15, 1949
Senate enter this chamber they have complete iberty to act in the best interests of
Canada.
Borne Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: When a member of the
Commons says that the former Prime Miniister stated that there was an obligation placed
on senators, 1 think he must be mistaken.
I arn putting my observations mildly. I do
flot believe that the former Prime Minister
ever asked any prospective senator to subscribe ta such a pledge. It would be most
improper for him ta do so, and I cannot
imagine that any self-respecting man would
lower himself to the point of undertaking
such an obligation or of giving such a pledge
as a condition ta his appointment ta the
Senate. Honourable senators, I feit that the
time had corne when there should be somne
public refutation of this charge made in the
House of Commons.
In conclusion, I wish ta say that I hope,
after the experience of a few years, that
even those Newfoundlanders who at the
moment may for various reasans be apposed
ta confederation, wiil corne ta realize, along
with ail the people of Canada, that the contact that is now being arranged will work out
ta the benefit of ail Canadians.
Borne Han. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Han. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
wish ta corroborate emphaticaily the testimony given by aur colleague from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) ta the effect that no pledge
was ever impased upan any senator upon his
appointment ta this house. 1 entered the
senate as a free man; atherwise I would have
refused ta accept the appaintment; and I
wauld flot continue ta sit unless I were perfectly free and untramrneiled. This must be
clearly understood by ail.
We have listened ta eloquent addresses by
aur coileagues from four provinces. We heard
first from New Brunswick, through aur acting
leader (Han. Mr. Copp); secondly, we heard
frarn Manitoba, thraugh the honaurable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig); thirdly, we listened
with great mnterest ta the iiluminating and
eloquent address of aur distinguished calleague from Vancouver (Han. Mr. Farris) who
adrnirably represented aur province on the
Pacific caast. Finally, a few minutes aga, the
voice of Ontario was heard through aur colleague who has just spoken. Now I think it
is befitting that you ailow me a few minutes
i order that the voice of the good old province
a! Quebec may also resound within the wafls
o! this house in welcaming ta aur great
Canadian family these brave and valiant
Newfoundlanders.
I wish ta support the motion before us for
the secondl reading of Bill 1l, "An Act 'ta
29091-7

approve the Terrns of Union o! Newfoundland
with Canada", and ta quate words so aptly
used in another place by the Right Hon. Louis
St. Laurent. They are as foilows:
This session. ... has the historic task of considering the addition to Canada of the last segment in
the original plan of the Fathers of Confedieration.

Thus is fulfilled, honourable senators, the
vision o! one great fecleration or federal
union extending from. sea ta sea "A mari
us que ad mare". Thus is that prophetie
vision finally realized.
Let me remind yau, as has already been
done by aur honourable coileague fromn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that the
British North America Act of 1867 provided,
in section 146, for the admission, among other
provinces, of Newfaundland. It states:
It shaUl be lawful for the Queen. by and with
the Advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy
Council, on Addresses f romn the Houses of the Parliament of Canada,..

and fram the Legislature of the Colany of
Newfoundland, ta admit that calony into the
union which we naw cammanly cail Confederation. The end of that section contains the
failowing words:
And the provisions of any order in couneil i
that behalf shaUl have effeet as if they had been
enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland.

I think it necessary ta cail attention ta that
last sentence because it provides expressly
for the procedure which is ta be foilowed in
the case of the admission of, amang other
provinces, Newfoundland.
As you ail knaw, the British North America
Act of 1867 was based upon resolutians which
had been adopted at the Quebec Conference
0f 1864.
At that conference there were
present delegates from the then existing provinces of Canada, now Ontario and Quebec, as
well as from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland.
At this canference, where by the way, my
own native province was represented by
Sir E. P. Taché, Sir Georges Etienne Cartier,
Mr. Chapais, father of aur late and highlyesteemed coileague, and Mr. Langevin, resalutians were adopted containing provisions for
the eventual admission of Newfoundland. It
is true at the canference subsequently held
in London, the so-called Westminster Conference, when discussions were held as ta the
draft of the bill which finally became the
British North America Act, no representatians were received from Newfoundland.
But Newfoundland through its delegates at
the Conference of Quebec had alreadyý vated
in favour of provisions for its eventual admission into the federal union, so it was logical,

SENATE
and I would say unavoidable, for the United
Kingdom Parliament to insert in section 146
the provision which I have just summarized.
In order to appreciate the situation as it
now is, may I for a few minutes refer again
to the events which hitherto prevented the
entry into our great Canadian family of that
colony by the sea. In 1869 the electors of
Newfoundland decided against entry into our
confederation; but in 1895, as was recalled a
few minutes ago by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris),
after the financial collapse of the island,
negotiations with Ottawa were carried on,
but without success; they failed merely
because of what I would call the unhappy
bargaining which took place.
I pass now to the depression of 1930, which
had tragic consequences for Newfoundland
and resulted in the suspension of its constitution in 1934. Under commission government, and due mainly, I believe, to conditions
arising from the war and in the post-war
period, the finances of the island have
steadily improved. At the end of 1945 the
United Kingdom decided that a national convention should be elected by the people of the
island. This convention was entrusted with
the task of investigating and then making
recommendations to His Majesty's Government concerning the alternative forms of
government for the future administration of
the ancient colony. It was stated that the
choice of constitution would definitely be submitted to the people at a national referendum.
This by the way was a clear affirmation of
the democratic principle of self-determination in favour of the population of Newfoundland.
In 1947, as you remember, after its election
the national convention resolved to send a
delegation to Ottawa to ascertain what fair
and equitable terms might exist for federal
union. The delegates arrived in our national
capital in June 1947 and completed their
sessions with the committee of the Canadian
cabinet on September 29. One month later,
on October 29, 1947, Prime Minister King
wrote to the Governor of Newfoundland, enclosing a statement relating to the terms of
union which the Canadian Government considered to be fair and equitable for both
countries, and which it was willing to recommend to our parliament. A condition, which
was absolutely essential, provided that:
-the people of Newfoundland indicate clearly and
beyond any possibility of misunderstanding their
will that Newfoundland should become a province
of Canada.

This quotation is taken from the report of the
Department of External Affairs, Conference
Series 1948, No. 2, page 58. Honourable
senators, this historic letter, written by the

senior statesman of the Commonwealth, is
another formal statement of our democratic
ideals. We Canadians clearly adopted the
attitude that our friends from Newfoundland
were to be given full opportunity to make
their own choice, freely and voluntarily. We
are not responsible for the subsequent events
which took place in St. John's, and London,
England. It would not be proper for me to
condemn or approve the decision of the
national convention in refusing, by a vote of
29 to 16, to include in the questions to be
submitted at the referendum the alternative
of union with Canada. Neither do I intend to
comment upon the fact that the United Kingdom government decided to the contrary. As
recalled this afternoon, a poll was held in
Newfoundland on June 3, 1948, and 69,400
electors favoured a return to responsible
self-government; while 64,006 wanted to join
our Canadian federation of autonomous provinces. Only 22,311 voted for the continuation
of the so-called commission government for
an additional five years. This latter solution
was definitely discarded, and as there was no
clear majority in favour of either of the
other two forms of government, a second
poll was held on July 22 of last year. Almost
85 per cent of the total eligible electors cast
their votes, but the majority in favour of
federal union was only about 7,000. The
score was 78,323 in favour and 71,334 against.
Hon. Mr. David: The honourable senator
has said that 71,000 were against the union
with Canada. I think he has made a slight
error. 71,000 were in favour of the other
proposition referred to in the referendum.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I accept the correction.
I only meant, from a practical point of view,
having a choice between the two alternatives.
Hon. Mr. David: It did not mean that they
rejected union with Canada; they just
expressed their desire to continue responsible
government.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: My honourable friend will
have an opportunity to give a fuller explanation later. My understanding is that the Newfoundlanders were first given the opportunity
of joining Canada or of continuing as a selfgoverning colony. At all events, after that
verdict, our former prime minister, as one
of the last acts in his long and glorious tenure
of office, invited the duly authorized representatives of Newfoundland to come here in
order to negotiate the final terms of the
agreement. The Newfoundland delegation of
seven members arrived in Ottawa on October
5, and on December 11, six of them signed
the agreement which is now submitted for
our approval. Our present Prime Minister

FEBRUARY 15, 1949
and the acting Under Secretary of State for
External Affairs were the Canadian signatories.
In ail these proceedings the Canadian
government acted constitutionally, observing
f aithfuily ail the fundarnental principles of
dernocracy. They lived Up to the tradition
of our dernocratic way of 111e. The terrnis of
union are fair and equitable for both countries. It was satisfying to me to see that the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and the leaders of the opposition groups in
the other house were unanirnous in approving the admission of Newfoundland into
Canada.
I arn convinced that the addition of this
tenth province to our beloved land will be
to the mutual advantage of our new fellowCanadians and ourselves. As a Quebecer and
a French-speaking Canadian, 1 say with true
emotion that it is a great privilege to take
part in this epoch-rnaking debate which, as
the honourable leader opposite has said, wil
long be referred to by those who corne after
us. They will say that the last stone of our
great federal and interprovincial building
was laid where the ternis we are now discussing were finally agreed to. Thus, honourable senators, we continue and complete i
a manner worthy of our illustrious predecessors, the task undertaken by Macdonald,
Cartier and other Fathers of Confederation.
Without the enlightened and efficient cooperation of those statesmen who represented
Quebec and Ontario, and whose names are
always pronounced with great respect, confederation would neyer have been achieved.
Putting aside ail our differences of political
opinion we are proud to associate with those
names two other great narnes of the past,
Tupper and Tiiley, as weil as the naines of
two great present-day representatives of our
provinces of Ontario and Quebec, narnely, Mr.
King and Mr. St. Laurent. Rising above
political. divergencies and the various and
conflicting policies which sometirnes separate
our two great parties-our old parties, as
they are called by some newer schools of
thought-I arn proud to record the achievernents of the Conservative party as weil as
of my own party, the Liberal party. I arn
proud also to record the achievernents of all
our great leaders, men who have guided
and are guiding opposite sides i this house
and another place but who have always
been anxious to contribute to the welf are of
our beloved country, and to hier developrnent
and expansion.
History wil register i golden letters the
date of the admission of Newfoundland as the
tenth of our sister provinces. We are iformed
that there stiil is dissatisfaction among those
i Newfoundland who were opposed to the
29091-71

union. We also know that i the provice
of Quebec the agreemnent now before us has
been denounced as imposig upon our taxý
payers an excessive additional burden without their consent havig been previously.
obtained. Also a dlaim was advanced on
behaif of Quebec to a part of Labrador; and it
has been stated in Quebec that Newfoundland
would be a liability to Canada. There have
been various other objections. But, honourable senators, I arn sure that with time the
people of Newfoundland and of Canada as a
whole, and in particular those of Quebec, wiil
forget ail such complaints and aileged grievances. First of ail, they wrnl reaize that for
the security, not only of Canada but of al
North Arnerica, the union of Newfoundland
with Canada is essential. to the efficiency and
the practical workig out of the North Atlantic Pact. It is not necessary for me to insist
upon the strategic importance of the Old
Colony; its adequate defence is absolutely
vital to the protection of Canada as weil as
of the United States. The last war fully
dernonstrated the truth of that assertion. For
all purposes of shipping as well as of aviation,
in peace and i war, Newfoundland holds an
international key position which cannot be
over-estimated. It is tirne to repeat the
ancient and farniliar rnaxim: united we stand,
divided we f ail.
Critics of the proposed union seem ta,
believe that we are taking in Newfoundland as it was in 1934. They systematically
ignore and undervalue ifs present assets. First
of ail, Newfoundlanders are known ail over
the world for their unexcelled qualities of
courage, industry and perseverance and their
loyalty to God, their king and their country.
I salute respectfully, with love and affection,
the 330,000. people who wiil remain forever
good and true sons of their autonornous province of Newfoundland, but who will become
also excellent Canadians, our f ellow countryrnen. They will bring to us territory which,
including Labrador, has an area of more than
150,000 square miles. The country's mai
resources at present are fish, paper products
and minerals.
When we speak of Newfoundland we of
course think immediately of codfish, because
from the begining of its four and a hall
centuries of recorded history the cod fishery
has been the mai idustry of the island.
About f orty years ago I spent a couple of
summers sailig on the banks of the Old
Colony, fishing: and visiting its coasts along
the Straits of Beile Isle, and 1 shaîl always
remember those happy days with delight and
pleasant emotion. Then I was able to come
personally into contact with the hardy fishermen and their families. I observed the
tragic conditions under which they lived at,

SENATE
Querpont and at other northern posts when
the fisheries were poor. For their endurance,
patience and generous spirit of hospitality 1
have ever since have had the most sincere
admiration. It was my privîlege also during
the last war to visit the great airport at
ýGander, which is indeed one of the most
-important airports in the whole world.
But let us be practical and get at the facts.
A few figures will be more convincing and
eloquent than any words of mine. In 1947-48,
the last year for wbich figures are available,
Newfoundland's total trade reached $185,522,848, the bigbest figure ever attained. Exports
of domestic goods amounted to $77,838,593.
Revenue from the sale of fish and by-products
was $29,517,514. The production of sait codfish was about one million quintais, and some
12,400,000 pounds of frozen cod fillets were
shipped. Medicinal cod liver oil sold at
approximately $3 a gallon. The total exports
of herring were valued at $2,170,604, and the
exports of lobster amnounted to $856,273.
Seaiing and whaling operations were also
carried on successfuliy.
In the saine fiscal year domestic markets
absorbed the entire production of about 800
sawmilis, whose production for 1948 was
expected to reach a total of 62 million board
feet. The great pulp and paper milîs at
Grand Falls and Corner Brook increased their
shipments of newsprint.
We now pass on to minerais. In the ten
montbs ending October 31, 1948, 1,217,032
tons of ore were mined at the Bell Island
mines, and the Buchans mine shipped ore to
a value of $7,761,249. 1 wish to add that for
the exploitation of minerai resources, the
gigantic water power of Labrador offers
sound hope for an unprecedented era of prosperity for the new province.
I amn pleased to notice that more attention
has recently been paid to agriculture in Newfoundiand. To particularize, in the development of the settiement formerly known as the
lJpper Humber, and renamed the Cormack,
considerabie progress bas been made under
the civil re-establishment program of the comn-mission government.
Finally, I may point out that the government revenues for the fiscal year ending
~March 31, 1948, amounted to $40,556,541, and
there was a deficit for that period of $463,243.
1 believe that in the long run this deficit will
be more than offset by the almost unliînited
resources of Newfoundland, in the form of
mrinerais and water power, and above ail, by
the sterling qualities of the Newfoundianders.
In passing, 1 may say that the figures I have
quoted are taken from an excellent chapter
devoted to Newfoundland in the report of the

Royal Bank of Canada dated January 13,
1949, on pages 34 and 35 of which further
interesting information may be found.
By way of conclusion, may I quote from the
very eloquent remarks made by the leader of
the opposition in the other house, when he
referred to the glorious record of the Royal
Newfoundland Regiment? He paid a just
tribute to a feat of arms which was almost
incredible, and at the saine time both sublime
and terrible. I read from page 292 of the
House of Commons Hansard of February 7:
On July 1, 1916, [the regiment] fought at
...
Beaumont Hamel in the tremendous battle of the
Somme. On tlhat occasion the Royal Newfoundland
Regiment was engaged inl one of the really Homeric
batties of history. It took part in one cf the mnost
desperate and tragic attacks of the whole war.
Seven hundred and forty officers and men went over
the top that morning to attack that key position in
the enemy defences, and they suffered 684 casualties.
Of this action, Sir Douglas Haig said in his dispatches: 'The heroism and devotion to duty they
displayed on the first of .Tuly has neyer been surTheir own corps commander said in his
passed."
dispatches: "The assault only failed because dead
men could advance no further."

Finally, may I be allowed to quote just a
couple of sentences from an address delivered
by that great Canadian, Mr. King, who at the
time was the first citizen of Canada, when he
welcomed the delegates from Newfoundland
on July 25, 1947? He said:
In welcoming you we welcome neighbours and
kinfolk. Who, with us owe a common allegiance to
the crown and whose countries are members of the
British commonwealth. History and geography has
given us much in common. We enjoy with you the
heritage of British freedom and the even older heriWe have shared
tage of Christian civilization.
together the perils and sacrifices of two worid wars.
Side by side, we face the uncertainties of the postwar world.

0f course we will be much stronger if we
stand together and are faithful to our great
destiny.
Somne Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
Iarn sure we have ail listened with great
interest to the splendid

speeches that have

been made so far in this debate. I should
like first to refer to the remarks of my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), and to say that I think bis comments
with regard to the independence of members
of the Senate are timely and good. There is
apt to be some loose talk about this chamber,
but it usually cornes from uninformed sources
and does not affect us very much.
I was much interested in the brilliant
speech made by the honourable senator from
Vaneouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), especially the
extracts which he read from Hansard about
senators of other days. I think they were
ail senators from the Maritimes. During îny

FEBRUARY 15. 1949
friend's rernarks he said something about the
Honourable Henry A. Kaullbach, who was
from Lunenburg. I just remember him i n
my boyhood days.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: 1 do not entirely agree
with what my friend from. Vancouver said
in relation to the marniage ceremony and the
union of Canada and Newfoundland.
It
occurs to me that that portion of the ceremony about forsaking ail others refers only
to those things that are sacred, and that in
honour and loyalty we are expected to preserve. I do not say that in any critical sense,
but 1 want to justify what I may say later,
and I do not wish ta do it under the shadow
of what the honourable senator had said.
Speaking further about the marriage contract, my friend said that he did flot think
the promise made by one party to the marniage, 11with ail my wordly goods I thee
endow", applied to the union wîth Newfoundland. In my opinion it does apply. Al
the people of Canada hold in common the
resources of this great dominion, and each
province must share in the dowry. I believe
that this sacred obligation applies to the
nation in the sanie way as it would apply to
a family.
While we are discussing the second reading
of this bill, entitled An Act to approve the
Ternis of Union of Newfoundland with Canada, we must f eel that we are rapidly bringing
to a conclusion in a most successful manner
something that has been in the making for a
long tume. Other honourable senators have
dealt largely with the historical background.
As we know, the recent negotiations with the
authorities of Newfoundland continued for
over a year, and during that period the
people of Newfoundland, through a plebiscite,
expressed individuaily and coilectively their
desire to join the Canadian confederation.
By the passing of this bill the seal of approval
of the Dominion of Canada is placed upon the
terms of the agreement. Then, after Royal
Assent, which we expect wrnl take place
within a week, we can feel that an historic
achievenient redounds to the credit of the
Parliament of Canada now in session.
Honourable senators will excuse me if I
take the privilege of reminding thern that in
addressing the Senate on March 27, 1946, 1
spoke, in part, as follows, as reported in
Hansard, pages 57 and 58:
Hon. Mr. Kinley: 1 have corne to the conclusion,

fishing business. and that we should be invitlng
trouble by bringing her into, Confederation. I do
flot thlnk there should be much fear of that. because
her fishing vessels have equal pnivileges with
our own. True, the fishermen of Newfoundland
bave a little advantage in that they have no income
and corporation taxes to pay. But I do think thç
very fact that they are producers of the sanie kind
of goods as we produce, and competitors with us in
world markets, should encourage us to work together as one great country.
Hon. Mr. Duff: They are our best custorners for
manufactured goods.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I will corne to that. The sanie
sentiment as now becoming prevalent in Newfoundland: the pecple there feel they should be part of
the Canadian nation. The union would entail sorne
cosi to Canada, but let us flot forget that Newfoundland includes also a considerable part of Labrador.
Newfoundland, now a market for rnuch of the goods
of central Canada, would. I arn sure, becorne a
better mnarket as an integral part of a wealthy and
virile country that now lends financial aid to the
Mother Country.
We in the Maritimes would have a stronger influence in the Parliarnent of Canada because we
would have another dominion added to the provinces
of Confederation. Frorn the national standpolnt we
cannot afford to do wlthout this frontier dominion.
The resijit of the union would be a stronger Canada,
and Newfoundland would be raised to the social
and econcrnic standards we enjoy s0 abundantly in
ibis country.
Hionourable senators, frorn my earliest
mrnories our part of the country was closely
associated with the colony 0f Newfoundland.
During many years, we sold theni vessels,
aur deep-sea fishermen used their ports for

shelter, bait and other supplies, and men
froni Newfoundland came regulanly to Lunenburg to help man the flshing fleet which
sailed out of that port. They arnived in everincreasing numbers until, in sorne years,
upwards of a thousand men came in the
springtime to join the Lunenburg fleet, and
went home in the f ail to spend the winter
with their families. Newfoundland was a
base of operations for the Lunenburg fishing
fleet and, in fact, ail the fishing fleets of Nova
Scotia. That was particularly true in the
days of sail, when distance meant s0 much.
During those years there grew up between
the people o! Newfoundland and the people
of the south coast o! Nova Scotia, especiaily
of Lunenburg, a warm comradeship. They
learned to know each other; and that coniradeship, I know, had a great deal to do with
the vote in favour of confederation. The
comradeship o! the sea is liberal and it is
inclusive. We came to regard the warmhearted fishenmen of Newfoundland as aur
very own; and with respect ta Our own fishermen who went to NeWfoundland, I recail that
honourable senators, that in the national intereat when I was a boy the only way we had to
and also In the interest of our fisherles we should
try to induce the dominion of Newioundland to corne get news 0f their safety was through letters
and messages which. came from the ports of
into Confederation.
Newfoundland. In the early days my grandHon. Mr.,Duf:. Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: ,In the Maritimes there is a father went on many voyages ta Labrador;
feeling that Newfounidland is a competitor in the my father went ta. the.Grand Banks and in the

SENATE
winter he usually called at the Bay of Islands
for a load of frozen herring. I learned a lot
about Newfoundland in my youth. I was
particularly interested in the way they named
their ports, such as "Harbour Grace",
"Heart's Content", "Heart's Delight": it
seemed to be that their hard life upon the
sea and their appreciation of their homes
and families were indicated by the colourful
names they gave the settlements in which
they lived.
We have also had much other trade with
Newfoundland. Several factories in my district do a large and increasing business with
the island. The Atlantic marine engines made
by the Lunenburg Foundry Company, and
the Acadia engines, made by the Acadia Gas
Company of Bridgewater, in my county, have
a big market in Newfoundland. Newfoundlanders bring their ships to Lunenburg for
refits and repairs; men who came to fish remained as citizens, and more and more are
coming. The honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), as we know, is a
native of Carbonear, in the island of Newfoundland, where his father before him was
an influential man.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I am told that the majority
for confederation was large in the southern
part of the island, where the ports are located
from which Newfoundlanders came to Lunenburg to fish. So we feel that they must have
a good opinion of us, and that their appreciation of our associations was expressed in their
votes.
There has been eloquent reference to the
contribution made in the fight for liberty in
two world wars by the people of Newfoundland, through their armed services and their
association with Canadians during those
periods. Our countries, working as one, have
thus been cemented with ties that are strong
and everlasting.
Newfoundland, as a country, has had good
times and difficult ones-so difficult that
it was obliged to place its affairs in the
hands of a commission government. To us,
looking on from the outside, it seemed to be
doing a very good job, and today Newfoundland is quite prosperous. Thus, the
difficulties having been surmounted, one
could see in recent years that something was
going to happen and that there would be a
change. It was with this in mind that I spoke
as I did in the Senate three years ago.
The Newfoundlanders, like most seafaring
people, are religious. All denominations are
represented, and in St. John's and in the
butports there are beautiful churches. The
churches of Newfoundland are closely connected with Canada: their ministers come to
our churches and ours go to serve with them.

This year the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church in Canada will meet in
St. John's, Newfoundland. I am reminded
also, that their ministers are largely educated
in the universities of the Maritime Provinces.
This is true also of the members of other professions, which means that the educated
youth of the country have a Canadian experience that will go a long way towards making
confederation a success.
It seems to me that the Canadian banking
system has done some missionary work in
Newfoundland. The Canadian banking system
stands high, not only at home, but in other
countries. This is a test of their efficiency.
They have long been doing service in Newfoundland and our currency has been in use
there.
These long associations have caused a
ripening of our friendship, bringing about a
marriage, which is the finest fruit of their
labour. Marriage to be successful must be
of the heart as well as of the mind; and I
think we can truly say that this marriage
with Newfoundland is a love match, brought
about by long association and high mutual
regard and affection. There were alluring
alternatives, perhaps, for greater immediate
gain. There was also the appeal of independence and standing alone. It is a great
compliment to this country that they so
readily.chose to become a part of the Canadian
nation. I am sure they come to us with our
best wishes, and we can say with Bobby
BurnsHere's a hand my trusty fiere,
And gie's a hand o' thine.
The economic advantages of the agreement are not the real issue. Newfoundland
is our good customer now, and the potential
natural resources of Labrador are already in
the picture of future industrial development.
The big objective is completion and rounding out the Canadian nation, because from
a national standpoint Newfoundland and
Canada should be one and the same country.
It would be insecure to leave the matter
unsettled, and world events have made the
present time opportune. Many of us feel
there was a degree of merit in the contention put forward by Newfoundland citizens who demanded as a first requisite that
responsible government should be restored.
However, in 1933, Newfoundland agreed to
setting up a Newfoundland Royal Commission, and the King's Warrant sets out the
objective of the commission. The second
recommendation found in the report of that
commission is as follows:
It would be understood that, as soon as the
island's difficulties are overcome and the country is
again self-supporting, responsible government, on
request from the people of Newfoundland, would be
restored.

FEBRUARY 15, 1949
Well, the plebiscite looks like a fulfilment
of that pledge; the people voted against the
return of responsible government. As a
result, Canada's course was clear and definite.
The inclusion of Newfoundland as a province
in the federation of Canada should bring
strength to the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It will be a larger area
and will add to the representation in the parliament of Canada. This will be an added
strength to the Maritime voice in the
country's affairs. We have always had a
great influence:
Three Prime MinistersTupper, Thompson and Borden, all came from
Nova Scotia. The three maritime provinces
also produced from time to time cabinet ministers of outstanding ability. We still like
to think our troubles come from confederation, but I sometimes wonder what right we
have to complain. In thinking of pre-confederation days we talk about the "Golden
Era", so well described in the Sirois Report.
Those were the days of "wooden ships and
iron men." Nova Scotian vessels were then
the fastest means of transportation on the
sea. They were built to carry our fish and
products to other countries, and they brought
rich cargoes in return. These vessels were
manned by Nova Scotians. It was a perfect
economy, the country became rich, and the
Nova Scotians became great traders. But
iron ships and steam interfered with this
economy, and Nova Scotia ran into difficult
times.
Then came Sir John A. Macdonald and confederation, which was violently opposed in
Nova Scotia. But the Honourable Joseph
Howe led the province into confederation on
receiving what was known as "better terms."
Nevertheless, confederation was not well
accepted, and to this day there are people
who are prone to blame our troubles on confederation, when they were really caused
largely by the march of time. Newfoundlanders, like Nova Scotians, are great traders.
They can look with pride on their great
trading firms and exporters in St. John's and
other places. We in Lunenburg know that
much of our progress is due to the fine firms
that work in conjunction with the fishermen.
The coasting trade of Canada is always a
matter of importance. In the Canada Shipping Act "coasting trade" is defined as
follows:
Carrying by water passengers and goods from o'ne
place in Canada to another.
Newfoundland will therefore be brought
into the orbit of our coasting trade. With the
passage of the Statute of Westminster there
was passed concurrently the Merchant Ship-

ping agreement. For years our Ministers
of Marine tried to get control of our coastal
trade. The Statute of Westminster was our
emancipation. The Motherland was a good
trader, and she got the Merchant Shipping
agreement.
In the coastal trade I think we should protect our nationals. The United States protect theirs, and it is my thought that with the
building of the St. Lawrence waterways, a
reciprocity agreement with the United States
on coastal shipping would be a necessity and
very beneficial to the Maritime Provinces.
This is a matter for the future. The fisheries
are of prime importance to the Maritimes, and
under Section 22 little change will be made in
the rules and regulations for a period of five
years. In the discussions in the other place,
at page 434 of Hansard, I read as follows:
Mr. St. Laurent: As I understand it, there is in
Newfoundland a system for the conservation of bait
under cold storage conditions, which is more effective than anything we have in the Maritime provinces. The question arose, and I think it is covered
in the statement of the questions answered.
Mr. Coldwell: I heard the minister yesterday but
I did not quite get the explanation I am now
seeking.
Mr. St. Laurent: In the statement of questions
raised by the Newfoundland delegation, one of the
questions was whether or not in taking over the bait
service it would be used exclusively for the Newfoundland fishermen, or would be made available to
the fishermen of the maritimes. The answer to that
question is given on page 9 of the questions raised
by the Newfoundland delegation and reads as
follows:
The Canadian government will seek legislation or
take such other steps as may be necessary to provide
that the Newfoundland bait service will be taken
over and operated without fundamental change by
the Department of Fisheries. If, after the date of
the union, changes are made for the benefit of Canada as a whole, the question of payment will be
discussed between federal and provincial authorities.

And here I quote from a statement by the
Minister of Fisheries:
There is in Newfoundland a bait-freezing service
which I think is a better one than we have in
Canada. We shall have to do something to improve
ours so that it will be equal to Newfoundland's.
Honourable senators, the situation is such
that Nova Scotia fishermen, largely those

from Lunenburg, get bait in Newfoundland
for their fishing on the Grand Banks. I hope
this practice will be free and unimpaired.
On the other hand, Newfoundland fishermen
will need bait in winter-time on the Nova
Scotia coast. I understand that even now
there is no difficulty in that regard.
I am sure we were all interested in the
discussion that occurred

in

another

place

between Mr. Drew, the leader of the opposition, and the Prime Minister, on oleomargarine. It is quite a passage on constitutional
law. For more than forty years I have
listened to legal arguments and assisted in

SENATE
the making of laws in one formn or another,
but I think this one stands out. The attack
was timely and good, but the reply of the
Prime Minister showed that he was a brilliant and capable parliamentarian. 1 commend this part of Hansard to the attention of
the provincial premiers.
The "marriage ceremony" will soon be
completed. After the bill is passed Canada
and Newfoundland will be on the road of
progress together-in a disturbed and fearful

world, it is true. We will share each other's
burdens and continue our part as a stroflg
and free nation. May we always stand for
justice with dignîty, and peace with beneficence.

FEEDING OF ROCK SALT TO CATTLE
SUGGESTED INVESTIGATION

Hon. R. B. Horner rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That he will call to the attention of the Senate
the fact that rock sait is being fed to cattle causing
injury to the animals, and will recommend that the
government investigate the practice and devise
means to prevent it.

He said: Honourable senators, my object
in placing this notice on the Order Paper
is ta recommend action for the benefit of
stockmen throughout Canada. A number of
practical ranchers to whom I have explained
my objection to the feeding of rock salt to
cattle agree that it seems a very sensible one.
Conditions in warmer countries are somewhat
different from those prevailing here, but even
there, in my opinion, some animals never
receive sufficient salt. The mouth of the
horse it not like that of the cow. The horse
has two firm sets of front teeth, whereas the
cow has only one; and the only way the cow
can get salt off a block is with its tongue. A
cow's tongue is rough, like a file, and if
through licking block salt it becomes smooth,
it is impossible for the animal to graze properly. Yet I often see blocks of salt tossed
into the snow for the use of cows-a practice
which is in fact cruelty of a very pronounced
kind. The use of rock salt is one of the
reasons why, in spite of improvement in
breeding and in feeding, cattle today are not
being developed to the size or condition of
fifty years ago. As a boy I never saw, or do
not remember ever seeing block salt: we
used to get coarse salt in large sacks.
Anyone who has supplied salt to cattle
knows that their tastes like those of human
beings vary; but some cattle will eat almost.

SENATE
any quantity they can get, and a good many
never get enough. Where a block of salt is
thrown into a pasture the animal that requires
a large amount must spend hours every day
to get what he needs, when he should be
either resting or grazing. I seriously believe
that the government, if only for humanitarian reasons, should either prohibit the manufacture of rock salt or encourage the manufacture of coarse salt.
In Saskatchewan a certain type of fly was
causing the loss of a large number of cattle,
and in conversation with a veterinary surgeon
I was told that he had ordered, in addition to
a smudge, the distribution of a sack of loose
salt among the affected animals in the corral.
There were about fifty head of cattle. They
ate the whole sack of coarse salt and this
saved their lives. I am glad to have had the
opportunity of advertising this fact, and I
seriously think that the government should
take some action in the matter.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF MERCHANT
SEAMEN
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
should like to read a statement which appears
in today's Ottawa Journal. It says:
Nearly four years after the end of the war, the
government has quietly announced it will pay for
the retraining of merchant seamen with war service
for shoreside jobs.
Wartime sailors who can dig up their discharge
papers may now apply for vocational training that
other veterans have enjoyed since V-J Day.
But for thousands of one-time sailors the move
bas come years too late, and for hundreds of others
the benefits fall far short of the mark.

I should like to ask the acting leader of
the government if he will make a statement
about this matter.
Hon. Mr. Copp: I shall be very glad to look
into this and endeavour to secure an answer
to my honourable friend's inquiry.
NEWFOUNDLAND-CANADA
SECOND

UNION BILL

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Copp for the second reading of Bill 11, an
Act to approve the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
this bill which admits Newfoundland into full
partnership with all the other provinces of
Canada will, in all probability, prove one of
the most historic pieces of legislation ever
passed by this honourable body. It is now
many decades since the last bill admitting

provinces into confederation was passed by
parliament. None of our present members
was here at the time, and it is unlikely that
many will be here when a similar bill is again
presented, unless the good people of the West
Indies decide to negotiate a union with us.
When full effect is finally given to this legislation we will have accomplished the fulfilment
of the great union visioned by the early
Fathers of Confederation. Their dream was,
as we all know, that all of British North
America, stretching from Cape Spear to Victoria, should form one vast nation. The entry
of Newfoundland is the final realization of
that great dream, and by it I believe Canada
becomes the largest country of the world after
Soviet Russia. We are fortunate and privileged to be here in this parliament to play an
important part in giving reality to that dream.
Ever since the confederation of 1867, and
even before, there has been talk from time
to time of Newfoundland coming in with us,
but it is only in the last two years or so that
the confederation movement became an overpowering force-so much so that last summer
the people of that great island voted, by a
good majority to join our confederation. I
know of no fairer system of voting than a
plebiscite, for it decides public questions by
an over-all majority. This is the true democratic way, as the people speak.
I have called Newfoundland a great island,
and it is a truly great land, as I know, for
I have travelled over many parts of it. One
has only to look at the map of North America
to realize what an important geographically
strategic position Newfoundland and Labrador hold on our Atlantic seaboard. This great
territory is an outstanding citadel of the
western hemisphere. In addition to this, Newfoundland is rich in real wealth-waterpower,
lumber, metals, fish, and so forth. I consider
it the greatest fishing island in the world. I
know of my own knowledge the great possibilities which lie in the Newfoundland
fisheries, and I am not going too far when I
say they can be increased and extended to
be worth far more than they are today.
But it is not only the fisheries of Newfoundland that are valuable. At Corner
Brook there is the largest newsprint mill in
the world, manufacturing 1,000 tons of paper
and 200 tons of pulp per day. The paper mill
at Grand Falls is also a large and modern
one. The timber reserves of Newfoundland,
together with those of Labrador, make the
construction of one or two more mills a
practical possibility.
At Bell Island, in Conception Bay, there is
a very remarkable deposit of red hematite
iron ore. This deposit amounts to an estimated 5,000 million tons, and it is said that

FEBRUARY 16. 1949
it will take another 500 years to exhaust it.
It is ore fromn this mine which, as honourable
senators know, feeds the steel mills at Cape
Breton. At Buchans, in the interior of the
country, there is in operation one of the
richest lead, copper, silver, zinc and gold
mines of the world.
But it is Labrador, with its 110,000 square
miles of area, that is bound to be the Klondike of the Atlantic coast. There is good
reason to believe that Labrador's iron ore
reserves run into billions of tons. I do not;
think it is too much to say that Labrador is
the last great undeveloped reserve of minerai
wealth in North America. I am prepared to
believe that Newfoundland's entry may cost
our federal governiment a f ew million dollars
net the first few years, but we realize that
those millions are only "1chicken feed" by
comparison when we think of the great fact
that our Confederation is made so much
richer and stronger by the addition of
Newfoundland.
But by far the greatest asset Newfoundland
possesses is her fine people. The noble record
of the sons5 of this island in the two world
wars is a magnificent page in empire history.
They fought and bravely died for King,
country and freedom. The people of Newf oundland are a proud people, and they have
a right to be. They are also courageous, and
generous almost to a fault. No stranger
within their gates need ever be in want. Many
people from Europe have corne and taken
residence with us-and we welcome them.
We know of the background o! some, but not
much of that o! others. But we are well
informed o! the background of the great
people of New!oundland. They are people
similar to ourselves-hard working and
industrious, honest of heart and purpose.
They have the same ideals as we; they
sincerely believe in the same institutions, and
they have the same blood in their veins.
There are no "isms" in this great island.
"Communism" is lilce a foreign word.
Nowhere in North America will you find
people who are more industrious, more ingenuous or stouter hearted. In the early days
o! its colonization Newfoundland was no place
for weaklings.
It took men of grit and
stamina to survive under the hard and rugged
conditions which obtained in the first three
hundred years of the island's history, and that
is why today the people of Newfoundland have
such sterling qualities. It took real men and
women to carve homes for themselves out of
the wilderness along the thousands of miles
o! coastline i those far off days, and ail that
was fine in character and personality was
brought out by the long struggle for survival.
In coming into partnership with the rest of
Canada, Newfoundland, as mentioned before,
29091-81

brings a great deal o! real wealth, but what
we must realize most, is that a great people,
330,000 in number, are joining hands with us
to help make a greater and more glorious
Canada. This is a partnership o! equal termis
and privileges. There are many things that
Canada can and will do for Newfoundland
which. the latter, I feel, is fully entitled to
under the partnership: namely, undertakings
and projects such as greater transportation
facilities and more intense development of
the island's many natural resources, for as
Newfoundland will have ail the rights and
privileges of a province, it will be entitled ta
an equal economic standing with that of the
other provinces.
The debt o! the island is very low. One of
the consequences of this is that Newfoundland has not undertaken public works on
such a scale as we in Canada have doue. On
the other hand, we have a larger per capita
debt here, and a great deal of public development work to show for it. However, uow that
the per capita debt will be equalized, it is
seif-evident that under the partnership the
people of Newfouudland are entitled to have
their federal public works systemi brought up
on a par with the other provinces in our
confederation.
Any aid extended to the
island by way of increased transportation
facilities aud development of natural resources will prove to be an excellent investment, as far greater wealth will flow in and
out of Newfoundlaud's fine ports, and tis
will react to the great benefit o! Canada as a
whole.
The people of Canada, I feel, are happy
indeed over this partnership and desire to
gîve the people o! Newfoundland a royal
welcome.
The j oining of hands by two
great peoples is a big eveut in history at any
time, and the passing o! this bull is bound to
mark one o! the greatest events of Canadian
history. In peace or war-and we hope the
latter is far, far away-we are going to find
the people o! Newfoundland great and true
partuers of the con! ederation of which we
are all so proud. They will live up to their
responsibilities, and we must spare no effort,
and even beud backward, to live up to ours.
Now we can raise our sights. The old saying
that Canada extended from Sydney to Victoria
will soon be hopelessly out of date, for shortly
after the passing o! tis bill we shall be able
to say that Canada extends from Cape Spear
to Victoria.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
I amn prornpted to speak in this debate largely
because yesterday greetings were extended
to Newfoundland from represeutatives o! al
or nearly all the senior provinces of the
dominion. I arn a representative of.what sa
f ar has been knowu as one of the newer

SENATE

provinces, a status that will disappear when
this measure is passed and Newfoundland is
admitted as the tenth province. Speaking
on behalf of Alberta, I want to join with those
senators who have welcomed Newfoundland
into confederation. I have no direct acquaintance with the island, never having set foot
upon its soil. I have seen it from a steamship, and that is as close as I have come to
it. I have read something of its history and
I know something about its resources, but
probably my most intimate acquaintance is
with the Newfoundlanders who have come
to Canada and been worthy citizens of this
dominion. They have participated in the
development of western Canada; they have
held prominent positions in the professions, in
business and in finance, and wherever we have
found them they have been good citizens and
sturdy representatives of the Newfoundland
stock from which they sprang.
Mention was made yesterday by the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) of a Newfoundlander who is a notable
clergyman in the city of Winnipeg. My
thought is that probably the most outstanding
Newfoundlander in Canada is Professor
Edward J. Pratt, of Victoria College, University of Toronto. If we had a poet laureateship
in this country, he would undoubtedly hold
the position, for he is a great poet whose
works have brought distinction to Canada
the world over. While talking with a Newfoundlander in Toronto the other evening I
said, "I suppose Professor Pratt is the only
university professor from Newfoundland in
Toronto?" My friend replied, There are two
or three more on the staff of the University
of Toronto, and I suppose there are others
scattered throughout the dominion.
I know that there are several outstanding
clergymen who were born in Newfoundland
and who have ministered in all the provinces.
One distinguished native Newfoundlander is
the Reverend Peter Bryce, one of the early
moderators of the United Church of Canada.
I believe that his wife also came from the
island. I also know one Newfoundlander who
is outstanding in the medical profession in
Montreal.
We are now bringing into confederation the
birthplace of these people. If Newfoundland's
contribution to Canada after confederation is
proportionate to her contribution to date, the
relationship will be of even greater value in
the future than it has been in the past.
As I have said, I have read the history of
Newfoundland; I have also acquainted myself
to some extent with the resources of the
island. It has been said that its resources are
not as great as some claim they are. I do not
agree with that viewpoint. After union with
Canada it is entirely possible that because of

the scientific knowledge obtained through the
Natural Resources Council, and from other
sources, there will be a development in Newfoundland surpassing all that has taken place
in the past.
A few days ago, in an article contributed to
the Toronto Star by Watson Griffin, a student
of history and geography, I read a statement
made by Sir William Van Horne, who had
much to do with the advancement of western
Canada in the early days of settlement. He
was not only head of a great railway but was
also interested in scientific agriculture to the
extent that he operated what I would call a
demonstration farm near the city of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Selkirk.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Concerning a visit
which he made to Newfoundland with Sir
William Van Horne in 1899, Watson Griffin
has this to say:
As we went on our way through the island, Sir
William Van Horne examined land which many
visitors have pronounced worthless. He said to me:
"In some parts of the western provinces there were
lands that looked just like this land. Many people
thought the land worthless, but I made experiments
and those lands have since prctluced great quantities
of fine wheat. This land is all right."

Up to the present time the soil on the island
probably has not measured up to the hope and
vision of Sir William; however, I feel that
with our scientific knowledge, and our experimental stations located at various places in
the country, it is entirely possible that it may
be developed along the lines foreseen by him.
It is not my intention to speak at length
in this debate, and I am not going to discuss
the terms of the agreement with Newfoundland, about which much has

already been

said. But I have one thought in mind which
may or may not be acceptable to all the

members of this body. Recently we have
heard much discussion about minority representation in the Senate. It occurs to me that
we might be making a step in the right
direction if, when Newfoundland comes into
confederation, we recognize the minority

in

that country who are opposed to union.

If

their country comes into the dominion they
will be part of the confederation, yet they

have disagreed with the proposed annexation. I believe that by bringing into this body
some representatives of that minority group
we would be bringing into this upper chamber the viewpoint -of an important element in
the new province. This would probably be
a departure from the practice followed in the
past, but I think it would be well to make
such a departure in this instance when we
bring into confederation the oldest colony of
the British Empire. I think it is particularly
important because of the sharp division of
opinion in that island, and it would be of

FEBRUARY 16, 1949
advantage to all to have in the Parliament of
Canada men who hold a view contrary to
those who supported the movement for
confederation.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Much was said by my
honourable friend the senior senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris) about the vision
of the early Newfoundlanders of participation
in a conference directed towards bringing
about confederation. Those men many years
ago foresaw Newfoundland becoming a part
of Canada. I think this moment is one of
great historical importance because, even
though those men have long since passed
away, members of their families are probably still living in Newfoundland, and today,
as this measure passes on its way to approval
and eventually brings Newfoundland into
confederation, they are seeing the hopes and
aspirations of their fathers and forefathers
being realized.
I began my remarks by saying that I rose
to greet Newfoundland as one of the partners
in confederation. I also said I spoke as a
senator from one of the newer provinces of
Canada. I emphasized particularly the contribution Newfoundlanders had made in the
past towards the development of this country. I believe that with the addition of this
tenth province there will be greater development in Newfoundland and greater progress
in the rest of Canada, and I hope also that
we will have greater national unity.
Whether Newfoundland will be the last of
the provinces to join confederation, I would
not predict. Some of my friends would say
immediately that no more provinces will be
brought in. That may be so. Yet I wonder
if we may not do in this country as Russia
has done in the development of Siberia. I
read recently of a city of some 50,000 people
within the Arctic circle. I wonder if there
may not come a time when the area known
at present as the Northwest Territories will
knock at the door of parliament and ask to
be brought into confederation. That may
sound ridiculous at the moment, but from
tapping of the resources of the Northwest
Territories we have found that part of the
country to be very rich. We know, for
instance, that the area around Yellowknife is
rich in minerals. There may be other parts
of the northern country which will display
great wealth. I believe there is no doubt
that if we do not make this northern area
another province of Canada, it will clamour
to become part of one of the existing provinces of the West. In world history, and in
the history of Canada, there is probably no
more important area than the arctic region.
Newfoundland, facing out to sea, occupies
a strategic position, and through two world

wars has made great contribution on both
land and sea. The northern part of Canada
is also strategically situated. We must keep
our eyes on these parts of the country and
encourage their development, for we believe
that in the future, with Newfoundland as a
part of this dominion, Canada will be greater
than it has been in the past.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. H. Ross: Honourable senators, yesterday the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) directed the attention of the
Senate to a speech made in the other place by
Hon. Earl Rowe, reported in House of Commons Hansard, 1949, page 359. Mr. Rowe
said:
The predecessor of the Prime Minister stated on
one occasion, when asked about reforming the
Senate, that no one was appointed to the Senate by
his government except those who were committed
to submit to any reforms the present party might
design. Therefore I should like to ask the Prime
Minister whether in the appointment of these new
senators from Newfoundland he would infliet that
obligation upon them which, I understand, bas been
inflicted upon every senator appointed by his
government.

During its tenure of office the King government introduced a great many reforms, which,
in so far as I considered them to be in the
interests of Canada, I was very pleased to
support. I have no doubt that the present
government under the leadership of the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent will continue
the policy of introducing reforms, and I shall
support such measures when I believe them to,
be in the interest of Canada. But I have not
been committed to any particular policy; I
have not agreed to support, nor have I been
asked to support, any particular policy; and
I do not believe that such an undertaking has
been required from any other Liberal member
of this house. The people of Newfoundland
have nothing to fear in that regard. Those
who may be appointed from the new province will be free to exercise their best judgment on all matters which come before this
house, without any restriction or dictation or
direction from anybody. That is a good Liberal principle, and I have no doubt that it will
be followed in their case.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable senators, I should like to emphasize some of
the international implications of the legislation «rhich is now before us in relation to the
agreement between Newfoundland and the
Dominion of Canada. But before doing so may
I express my warm appreciation of the inspiring and eloquent addresses which were made
yesterday, particularly those of the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) and my friend and colleague from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). They provided adequately the historical background of

SENATE
the negotiations; and my colleague from Vancouver South was very happily inspired, I
thought, in associating this chamber with the
earlier history of the contacts between this
country and Newfoundland.
It was my privilege to sit in this very room
Don the ceremonial occasion when the agreerments were signed by the representatives of
Newfoundland and of this dominion meeting
around this table. The occasion was appropriately celebrated, there being in attendance
a distinguished audience, composed of friends
of the various delegates, members of parliament, members of the civil service, officials of
the diplomatic corps. I was impressed particularly by the fact that four of the signatory
delegates from Newfoundland were graduates
of Dalhousie Law School, Halifax, and three
were gold-medallists of that institution, all
having attended there in their student days
from the Dominion of Newfoundland.
Despite all that has been said about the
economic advantages and the great possibilities, financial and economie, of this union, that
consideration did not weigh very heavily with
this country in the beginning of the last
decade. As is well known, in 1932 a very
depressed condition existed not only in this
country but in Newfoundland. As a result, the
system of government which then prevailed in
Newfoundland was discontinued for the time
being, in favour of rule by commission, under
the Colonial office of Great Britain.
It was not until the war broke out that
interest in the union of Newfoundland with
Canada was quickened. I remember being at
Kingston in 1938 when the late President of
the United States, in a memorable speech,
went out of his way to state that the United
States would not stand idly by and see the
Dominion of Canada or any territory adjacent
thereto invaded by an enemy. Two days later,
at Woodbridge, a similar statement was made
by the then Prime Minister of this country,
who said that Canada would never permit the
portals of the United States to be entered by
a foreign foe through or over this country
or along our coasts. I mention that incident
because it was very shortly afterwards that
a meeting took place at Ogdensburg between
the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of the United States, with the result
that a joint defence board was formed, not
only to discuss the problems and dangers of
the period immediately ahead, but to act as
a permanent organization in relation to the
defence of this continent. The United States
acquired about that time a ninety-nine-year
lease near Saint John's, at Placentia Bay and
the adjacent district. The meeting of Roosevelt and Churchill on August 9 to 11, 1941,
took place in the waters adjoining Newfoundland. I have good reason to believe that, as

from that date, interest-particularly official
interest-in Canada was quickened in solving
the problem of union between Newfoundland
and this country.
Reference was made yesterday by my
honourable colleague from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) to events which, many
years ago, culminated in the Ashburton
Treaty and in what is known as the Yukon
Boundary Award, handed down by Lord
Alverstone. As the honourable senator pointed out, those events had a disturbing effect
upon the minds of Canadians, even in those
colonial days. I cannot remember the Ashburton Treaty, but I have a definite recollection of the impact made upon public opinion
by the Yukon Boundary Award. I recall very
clearly an editorial objection recorded by
one of the outstanding editors of the day,
Mr. E. E. Sheppard, in Saturday Night. It
was a leading editorial of that paper, dealing
with Lord Alverstone's decision. I think in
many ways it crystallized Canadian opinion,
which later became more articulate. In those
days we had nothing to say about those
matters, because they occurred during our
colonial status. If my honourable friend and
colleague from North York (Sir Allen Bristol
Aylesworth) were here and were disposed so
to do, he could enlighten us very eloquently
on the Yukon boundary question.
We must remember that those events were
strong factors in equipping this country in
the beginning to accomplish the things that
are being done in this legislation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: They aided in a selfreliant growth of opinion in Canada which
has enabled us on our own to negotiate such
an important treaty as this with the old
Dominion of Newfoundland. This is legislation to ratify an agreement between two
self-governing parts of the British Commonwealth. It seems to me, further, that the
importance of the union cannot be viewed
apart from the fact that, for diplomatic and
international reasons, the defence of this
North American continent is as much the
concern of the United States, our neighbour
to the south, as it is to this country. Diplomatically, geographically and internationally,
the forces that have been crystallized as the
result of the recent war have placed Canada
and Newfoundland in a world position of
which, before the war, we had little appreciation. Whether we like it or not, we find
today that the northern half of the American
continent is geographically one of the most
important strategic areas on the face of the
globe. We should realize that this legislation
indirectly involves responsibilities which will
require a steadfastness of purpose in working

FEBRUARY 16, 1949
together on those things that will reach far
beyond our domestic economy. If I were to
mention one aspect in particular, I would
suggest that when our budgets corne down,
and a great clamour for reduction in taxation
is made, it should be remembered that
we have responsibilities in equipping and
defending our coasts.
Honourable senators, in our relations with
the United States concerning the North
American defence policy, let us take Newfoundland as a symbol of the co-operation
that must continue between these two halves
of the North American continent.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Athanase David: Honourable senators,
it is too bad that the Canadian public at
large has no opportunity to assist in a discussion of this nature, which reflects a dignity,
broadmindedness and respect which we wish
could be observed everywhere else.
I was a member of the Legislature of
Quebec for twenty years and a Cabinet
Minister for seventeen. During that long
period, either under Sir Lomer Gouin or Mr.
Alexandre Taschereau, the Liberal party
always remembered the directives given it
through a speech made in 1905 by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. I have not got the text of that
speech with me, but the thought that animated his words was that the welfare, unity
and stability of Canada resided, in part, in
the respect due by the central government to
the autonomy of the provinces.
We in Quebec have meditated and followed
those words. It is because I have been a
defender of this autonomy that I now rise to
refute the arguments presented in the press
and in political speeches, that the rights of
the provinces are encroached upon by this
legislation. To come to this conclusion one
has to go back to June, 1864, when delegates
from Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince
Edward Island met in Quebec to elaboratelet us say by way of a gentleman's agreement
-upon the conditions of entry of their respective provinces into confederation. These delegates were so well acquainted with the idea
of Newfoundland entering confederation that
they went so far as to discuss the number of
would be
members that Newfoundland
entitled to in the Assembly, the number of
senators that would be appointed, and the
qualifications that would be required of them.
They also went so far as to declare that Newfoundland judges would be appointed from
amongst the members of the Bar of that
country. In their consultations they also
agreed that Newfoundland, abandoning its
rights as to mines, should receive an annual
sum of $150,000, payable semi-annually. More-

over, section 72 of the Quebec resolutions
specifies that the proceedings of the conference, duly authenticated by the delegates of
the different provinces, shall be deposited and
submitted to their respective governments. At
the London conference two years later, on
the 8th of December, 1866, the future entry of
Newfoundland into confederation was again
assumed-by section 10 of the resolution, if
I remember correctly. Finally, the British
North America Act, which was cited so brilliantly yesterday by the honourable gentleman from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), provided that upon addresses to the Crown from
the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the
responsible legislature of Newfoundland, that
colony could be admitted into confederation.
That procedure cannot be followed now,
because there is at present no responsible
legislature in Newfoundland. Who will sign
the address in the name of Newfoundland?
Will it be the Royal commission? Will it be
the authorized representatives of the majority
that voted in favour of confederation? This,
I believe we will admit, is a decision that
Newfoundland itself will have to take, as
legally directed.
Honourable senators, I said that I would be
brief. In conclusion, let me say that having
for twenty years defended, under the leadership just mentioned, the autonomous rights of
Quebec, I would be the first in this Senate to
rise in protest if I thought for a single
moment that the autonomy of Quebec, Ontario,
British Columbia, or any other province was
being encroached upon. For if we want unity
in this country of ours, if we want stability,
if we want contentment the first duty of
everyone must be respect for the rights of
others.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
February 9, the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of
Hon. Mr. Farquhar for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. J. W. De B. Farris: Honourable senators, I feel some hesitation in rising to take
the time of this honourable body for the
second day in succession, but I have a compensating assurance to give honourable members. I find it necessary to leave Ottawa on
Friday night, and I can promise that for
some considerable time I shall not again
inflict myself upon the house.

SENATE
In beginning, I want to say a word about
a matter that was mentioned yesterday by
the honourable gentleman from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) and today by the honourable gentleman from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross).
For my part, I do not feel it consistent with
my self-respect to make any denials. I have
before me the Holy Bible, and I refer honourable senators to verse 16 of chapter 20 of the
Book of Exodus, which says:
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour.

I suggest to my honourable friend the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), who himself would
never be a party to any such scandalous
assertion as was made by an honourable
member of another place, that when he next
sees that honourable gentleman he quote that
verse to him and advise him to live up to it.
Honourable senators, I gladly join in the
congratulations that have been extended to
the mover (Hon. Mr. Farquhar) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Comeau) of the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Their remarks provided a touch of colour
that is perhaps just a little out of the ordinary
in this house, and therefore worthy of
comment.
At this time I wish to express my personal
regret that a number of my friends who sat
opposite me last session are no longer here.
I express that regret not only personally, but
in my public capacity as a senator, for to
those who are interested in the constitution
and best functioning of the Senate it is a
serious consideration that members of the
opposition are dwindling in numbers and
growing in years, which means, of course,
that in some cases their vitality and vigour
of criticism of government or public policy
is not as great as it was. The zest of debate
would be gone if it were not for the fact that
in the speeches of one's opponents-no matter how friendly one may be with those
opponents personally-there is something
that stimulates a reply.
What I have said does not apply to my
honourable friend the leader of the opposition, for which I am glad. The speech of my
honourable friend the leader of the opposition has stimulated me with a desire to reply.
I am sure he will accept that remark in a
friendly spirit and as a compliment. When
be speaks I feel as if I were listening to an
opposing counsel in a case in court, and if
I may say so in a kindly way, I think that
some of the things he has said demand
criticism. In the first place, it seems to me
that in dealing with the Speech from the
Throne he spent too little time on the questions of policy formulated there and perhaps
too much time on wandering into fieldseven into wheat fields-that are not mentioned in the Speech.

I should like to direct the attention of
honourable members to a statement made by
my honourable friend, and appearing on page
30 of Hansard. He stated that $480 million
had been stolen from the farmers of western
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: With greatest respect to
my honourable friend, my answer is that that
assertion is pure nonsenseHon. Mr. Howard: No doubt about that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: -particularly as it comes
from a lawyer of standing. The essence of
theft, honourable senators, is mens rea, as
we term it in law; the basis of the charge is a
guilty or fraudulent intent. If someone in
the other house, who was not a lawyer and
who did not know the definition of theft, made
that starding statement with a view to getting
in the headlines of the newspapers, there
might be some justification for it. But coming
from a gentleman who is a lawyer, a member
of the Senate and the leader of the opposition
in this house, the statement is a regrettable
one.
My honourable friend knows, and so does
everyone else in this house, that the making
of the wheat agreement-which my friend
has designated as theft-was not for the purpose of robbing the wheat growers of western
Canada, but came from an earnest desire to
assist them.
I do not pretend to be an authority on the
wheat problem, but it has come to me from
an unimpeachable source that at the time
this policy was formulated the farmers'
organizations

generally

in

the

West

were

practically united in endorsing it, the reason
being that the foremost concern of the farmers
was security. No, that was not a fraudulent
or guilty intent, an intent to rob; it was the
honest attempt of men working together to
serve the best interests of the farmers of that
community.
If my honourable friend had said that the
prophecies respecting the agreement did not
materialize, and that unfortunately some
money had been lost, or if he had confined
his remarks to a criticism of lack of foresight,
there might have been some force and, may
I say with all respect, some sense to his observations. But the charge that failure to achieve
a hope constitutes theft, is an unfortunate and
incorrect staternent which never should have
been made. I criticize my friend not only
for the extravagance of his language, but for
the unfairness of it. I do not go so far as to
contradict his assertions, but I question their
accuracy.
On Monday of this week I read an editorial
in one of the leading newspapers of this
province, the Ottawa Citizen, which indicated

FEBRUARY 16, 1949

that the editor had informed himself on the
wheat question. I wish to draw the attention
of honourable senators to this editorial, in
reply to my honourable friend's statements.
The editor has this to say:
An interesting thing about criticism of the wheat
agreement with Britain is that it comes mainly from
traders and speculators or interests closely allied
with the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, their main
forum of operation ...
Canadian wheat growers are for the most part
well satisfied-

Hon. Mr. Horner: No, they are not.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I cannot speak with
authority on that point, but there must be
some ground for the statement.
-with the intervention of the federal government
into the wheat marketing picture and the wheat
pact with the United Kingdom which later developed.

I would venture the statement that the majority of the farmers were well satisfied when the
agreement was made.
Hon. Mr. Howard: No doubt about that.
Mon. Mr. Farris: The article continues:
Western farmers are assured by the agreement of
greater stability in the price of wheat, something
that for years they have placed first in their
demands.

From my observations, I believe that to be
a correct statement.
Going on:
For this they are willing, and wisely so, to make
some temporary concessions in price. That is the
principle of the bulk sales arrangement between
Canada and Britain.

Does my honourable friend dispute that?Silence gives consent.
Further:
The farmers have not suffered nearly so badly
under the wheat pact as their newly-acquired
champions, the would-be private wheat traders, try
to make out. Comparison between "world wheat
prices" and the amount stated in the agreement is
deceptive.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt the honourable gentleman? He must not say that
because I keep quiet I am agreeing with his
statements. That is not the case at all. I
have no right to interrupt him, and therefore
I am not saying a word.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My friend has full freedom with regard to interruptions, and he
never hesitates to exercise it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But you said "Silence gives
consent." I am not giving consent.
Hon. Mr. Farris. We will accept my friend's
protest that he does not give consent.
The article continues:
For the Canadian producer gets the full price provided in the contract with Britain, whereas the
Chicago quotations include traders' profits and other

costs. In 1945 for example, Canadian producers
got seven cents more a bushel than United States
farmers.

I take that to be correct.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But it is not.
It certainly is not.

Hon. Mr. Horner:
Hon. Mr. Farris:
responsible source.
Reading further:

It comes from a pretty

And for the past three years the net return to Canadian growers has been only about 35 cents a bushel
less than the amount realized by American farmers.

Hon. Mr. Haig:
Hon. Mr. Farris:

That is not correct, either.
I continue to read:

In normal times the U.S. return runs about seventeen cents more a bushel than in Canada. So that
Canadian farmers have in reality been sacrificing
only 18 cents a bushel.

Hon. Mr. Aselline:
joke.

That statement is a

Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not know whether I
understand my friend's sense of humour or
not.
Going on:
For this they are getting protection against a break
in world wheat prices, and may also realize a continued stable market through extension of the current agreement with Britain. They also have the
assurance of a $2 price for the current crop year,
though the world price may sag well below that in
the near future.

I take it, honourable senators, that is no joke.
It is already down to $2.06 at Chicago-meaning a
net return of less than the price to Britain for those
selling on the "world market."

I quote that editorial as being authoritative,
and so far as I have read in the press generally, these statements in the Ottawa Citizen
have not been chailenged.
Some other statements made by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) have aroused
my contentious spirit. I trust that he will
not take my remarks in any unfriendly way,
but merely as legitimate controversy in this
house. I refer now to the Trans-Canada highway. I was rather shocked that my friend
should attempt to give to Mr. George Drew
the credit for having stimulated the policy of
the government in that regard.
Hon. Mr. Horner: He certainly did.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Drew started it? I say to
my honourable friend, and to those with him
who are smiling, that at a time when in the
other house we were being told to go to Hull,
I should have thought that they, as senators,
would have raised their voices in defence of
the Senate. I call the attention of my honourable friend the leader of the opposition to a
speech made by your humble servant in 1948,
and reported in Hansard at page 211. It was

SENATE
a long speech, I am sorry to say, but among
other things I found this in it:
Hon. Mr. Haig: What year?

No one has ever disputed that.
I think only one province has made inquiries; the
others have not come forward and said that they
wanted the job.

Hon. Mr. Farris: 1948.

I ventured to interrupt my honourable
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought you said "1914". friend to say:
They all refused it last week.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I hope my honourable
friend heard me better last session than he Perhaps it would have been more accurate
hears me now. I made this speech on March to have said that it was revealed last week
9, 1948, and as I recall it, I was speaking that all, with one single exception, had
pretty loudly, so I think my honourable friend refused to take over rent controls, or at least
must have heard me. At the request of the had expressed their desire not to do so.
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. RobertMy honourable friend then said-and I was
son) I was explaining a bill with respect to surprised that before he made the criticism
conservation of exchange, or what has been he was not better informedtermed the austerity program. I then said:
One made inquiries,Now I am going to suggest some things which we
can do at home to bring in American dollars. One
is to develop the tourist trade. We have an unlimited market, an unlimited product, and goods of
unrivalled quality. We, a handful of people spread
over half a continent, can offer every tourist inducement to the 140 million people at our doors. They
are the best spenders in the world, and there are
no other people they like as well as Canadians. I
have said that we possess every inducement. That
is not correct. There are some powerful inducements which we ought to attend to, and very
quickly. First among these are our automobile highways. I suggest to honourable members, not without diffidence, but with a real confidence, that a
trans-Canada highway of the kind which Americans
will find as easy to travel on as their own, and
excelling their own in scenic attraction, under
climatic conditions which for a part of the year
are far better than theirs, is a work-to quote from
the British North America Act-"for the general
advantage of Canada". I believe that no constructive endeavour which this country can make, without a drain upon our resources, would bring in
more Arnerican dollars than the construction of
that kind of a highway, coupled with provincial
and international feeders, so that at strategic points
in every province there would be highways which
of themselves would invite the United States tourist.

I suggest to my honourable friend that Mr.
George Drew read that speech, and that it
was the beginning of his proposals in this
connection; and I should have thought that,
in view of current controversy about the
Senate, my honourable friend would have
been the first to point out that construction
of an all-Canadian highway was advocated
in this house before we ever heard a word
about it from Mr. Drew.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In fact the road has
been under construction for years.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Another matter on which
my honourable friend needs a lot of correction is rent control. Speaking on the 3rd of
this month, he made this statement, Hansard,
page 26:
The administrator is trying to sneak out. I use
that terrn advisedly. It would be far better to say
that the provinces have the right to legislate In the
matter of rent controls. In my judgment it comes
under the heading of property and civil rights.

He referred to one province.
three or four said nothing, and the rest are waiting.

Hon. Mr. Haig: That was the report in the
press.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, when has my
honourable friend ever thought it justifiable
to accept reports in the press rather than
the official information which is available to
him?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My statement had nothing
to do with the fundamental, that is whether
they had or had not refused.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I don't know what is
meant by "the fundamental".
Hon. Mr. Haig: I said that he had sneaked
out, and I still say so.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In view of the failure of
my honourable friend to give the information
to this house, and on the assumption that
our debates are more widely read than those
in the other place, and that it is therefore
very important that the record be kept
straight, I want to call my honourable friend's
attention to the fact that the Prime Minister,
speaking in that capacity in the House of
Commons, gave the facts to all Canadians,
including those who sit in this house. While
there is some disposition on our part to close
our eyes to what is said in the other place, we
cannot ignore facts which are of public record.
It is of record, on the authority of the Prime
Minister, that in October the Minister of
Finance wrote to the premiers of every province. It is quite a long letter, and I shall not
read it all. Honourable senators will find it
on page 75 of House of Commons Hansard.
I quote it in part as follows:
I am writing to you at this time to say that if
your government should decide to introduce provincial legislation relating to rent control, the federal government will be prepared to vacate the field
ai any time after March 31, 1949, to put at your
disposal the records, information and experience of
the federal rent administration with all available

FEBRUARY 16, 1949
staff and, if parliament approves, to pay the costs
of your provincial rent administration for one year.
May I add that the rentals administrator of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board has been instructed to make himself available to you for consultation in
connection with provincial legislation
relating to rent control.

for their own edification they should turn to
page 76 of the House of Commons Hansard
and read the letter of Mr. Maurice Duplessis.
I would put it to your judgment, after you
read his letter, whether it is not the finest
illustration of an obvious attempt to side-

Apparently there were replies to that letter track and evade an issue. It is in marked confrom every province, and those replies were trast with the letters from every other provmade before my honourable friend spoke in ince of Canada.
this debate.

to the federal government. I feel that perhaps your
officiais are better able to advise you as to the need
for rent control, since they have been dealing with
this matter for so long. Consequently it is not the
intention of the government at this time either to
introduce rent control legislation or to make any
representations in regard to this project.

The government of the province of Ontario feels
that rental control should be carried on by your
government at present, and when the year 1950
comes we can decide if we have to do anything
further.

That seems to dispose of Ontario.
Then we turn to page 89 of Hansard for
further replies. I suppose if any honourable

Dear Mr. Abbott:

I have for reply your letter of January 13 in

to the provinces to assume control of rentals.
Since my letter of November 3, this matter has
been considered in detail and I now am in a position
to notify you that the government of Alberta does
not propose to enter into the control of rentals.

Then we skip to the far east, to Prince
Edward Island. On January 13 Premier Jones
wrote as follows:
Dear Mr. Abbott:
Thank you for your letter of January 13 regarding
continuance of rent controls.
The governiment of Prince Edward Island does not
believe that rent control can be better undertaken
and administered locally, and consequently will not
request that federal rent control be discontinued in
this province after that date.

Next we come to my own native province of
New Brunswick. On January 11, Mr. McNair
wrote:
Dear Mr. Abbott:
With further reference to your letter of October
23 regarding rental control, I wish to advise that I
have now had an opportunity to discuss the matter
to some extent with my colleagues.
It was drawn to their attention that, as set out
in your letter, the federal government intends to

ask parliament for power to extend this control for
a further period of twelve months from March 31

next.

It is our feeling that this extension may adequately meet the situation in this province. At any

rate there is no present disposition on our part to
enter this field.

Should there be any change of

attitude in this regard I shall advise you accordingly.

The next correspondence concerns Quebec,
but I do not intend to read it. However, I
would suggest to honourable senators that

Dear Mr. Abbott:
Thank you very much for your letter of January
13, in which you ask for the government's view on
the occupation by the federal government of the
field of rental control. The government of Saskatchewan is desirous that the dominion government
continue to exercise its jurisdiction in this field and
to extend the legislation relating to rental control
for at least another year. In view of the fact that
these matters have national implications, we feel
that they can best be dealt with on a federal basis.

Then we come to what you might call the
coalition government. Is that the term they
use in Manitoba? This letter, signed by
Douglas Campbell, was written on January
28 and reads as follows:
My dear Mr. Abbott:
Re: Matter of rent control.
I received your letter herein dated 14th Instant.
I have referred to our file. It contains the letter
dated October 23, 1948, from yourself to Honourable
Mr. Garson, K.C., the then premier of Manitoba.
I note that the speech from the throne read at the
opening of your paliament on Wednesday, 26th
instant, forecasts the extension of rent control under
legislation of the parliament of Canada.
I have conferred with my colleagues and we have
carefully gone over the whole situation. We are
of the unanimous opinion that, as matters stand at
present, the whole subject of rent control should be
left for the exclusive consideration, attention, et
cetera, of the Dominion of Canada authorities.

Surely my honourable friend from the city
of Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) should have
been familiar with the policy of the government of Manitoba, of which I am sure he is
a loyal supporter.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: What about Nova Scotia?
Hon. Mr. Farris: What about it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: What did it say?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not know. I shall
give my friend an opportunity to check up
on Nova Scotia, and if he can find anything
inconsistent in a single statement of one
province to support his stand, I hope he will
take some satisfaction from it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That does not differ from
my statement at all.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Perhaps Nova Scotia has
answered, and I may have overlooked it.
Honourable senators, it is with the greatest
regret that I continue my speech in the
absence of the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis). I regret
that she is ill, because I have formed the
highest respect and deepest regard for her.
But she too, like my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), is often very provocative in debate. Before I knew that she could
not be here I made some notes on what she
said in her speech on the Address in reply.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Let us have them.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am sure that if the honourable senator were here things would be
more interesting, because I do not know of
anybody more skilful in making interruptions, and nothing spices up a debate more
than that.
I should like to congratulate the honourable
senator from Peterborough on a most clever
speech; J emphasize the word clever; but I
was surprised at the attacks she made. The
first and outstanding one was on the appointment of a royal commission which she
termed, with that apt ability which she has
to turn a phrase, "a cultural omnibus resolution." I was amazed that one who had served
as a school teacher and as a past president
of the Teachers' Federation would frivolously
make fun of a serious government proposal
to further the cultural development of this
country. It is surprising that she, with the
cultural advantages she has enjoyed, would
by her remarks tend to deprive others of an
opportunity in the future to gain cultural
advantages at least approaching, if not as
great as, those she had. I hope my honourable
friend from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) will take
part in this debate. I hope that he will give
to this house some of the knowledge that he
has gained through his identification-and
also, I am told, that of his good wife-with
cultural developments, with the arts and
other things that go to make up the finer
and higher life of our community.
To me it is a matter of real disappointment
that one of our senators who has benefited

most from cultural opportunities-as is manifested by the high character of her diction
and the able speeches she bas made in this
house-bas found occasion to poke fun at the
announcement of the government's intention
to appoint a royal commission. The honourable senator says that the proposed reference
to the commission covers too much territory.
Well, honourable senators, more than thirty
years ago it was my privilege to be a member
of the government of British Columbia and
to occupy two portfolios-those of attorney
general and Minister of Labour. There were
then some socialists in the legislature, as
there still are, but I am glad to say that their
numbers have not increased very largely. I was
young and ambitious and had a lot of ideals
-J
hope I have preserved them-and I
brought in some measures that might generally be termed labour and social legislation.
Among these was, for instance, a mother's
pension act. Every time that I introduced
any such measure, the members who claimed
to represent labour and to stand primarily
for the social advancement of the underprivileged, failed to give me any support.
They well knew that in any government you
have to fight before you can get agreement
to have these measures brought in; but instead
of attempting to strengthen my hand they
would get up and move a resolution to the
effect that I had not gone far enough. But
the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) has taken a new stand.
She says the government bas gone too far,
that it has included too much in this omnibus
undertaking to investigate and promote these
cultural advantages that we should enjoy.
Well, I leave it to the judgment of every
member of this bouse whether I am not right
in saying that the people of Canada will never
criticize the government on the ground that
it has gone too far in attempting to promote
matters of this kind. Better too much than
too little.
My honourable friend from Peterborough
then charged that in this proposed reference
to a royal commission there was an evasion
of parliamentary responsibility. She claimed
that some of the matters mentioned should
be dealt with by the Senate and the other
house. Perhaps that is so. It is now nearly
thirteen years since I first came to the
Senate, and my honourable friend from
Peterborough bas been here for almost fourteen years. Well, honourable senators, let
me point out that the responsibility to agitate
for and promote development of the cultural
activities in this country is not exclusively
the responsibility of the Senate as a whole
or of the House of Commons as a whole; it is
a responsibility of each and every individual

FEBRUARY 16, 1949
member of each bouse. Any senator is free
to get up in this chamber at any time and
advocate investigation or promotion of any
of the things mentioned in the proposed reference. I ask if any single member of the
opposition, including my honourable friend
from Peterborough, has ever moved for the
appointment of a committee to investigate or
promote any of those things, or has even proclaimed the necessity of investigating or
promoting them.
If the announced intention to appoint a
royal commission has done nothing else, it bas
at least stimulated recognition of the fact that
the honourable lady and others ought long
ago to have been doing what the government
now proposes to have done. The proposed
appointment of a royal commission is part of
the forward policy which the present government has been carrying out step by step every
year, in keeping with the vision, such as no
other government of Canada has ever had, of
promoting the welfare of-if I may use a
hackneyed expression-the common people,
who have missed many of the cultural
advantages that have been enjoyed by some
of us, including the honourable senator from
Peterborough. A step in the carrying out of
that policy is not one that should be made
fun of or scorned by a member of this house
or by the leader of the opposition in another
place on the specious and false grounds that
the government is undertaking too much. Nor
should the government's announcement have
been subjected to the criticism that appeared
in a newspaper, to the effect that young men
should be appointed to the royal commission
because its work will take a very long time.
That is just nonsense, honourable senators. I
dislike to say it, but I will say that when I
saw that statement I felt that the newspaper
was thinking about, not the welfare of our
people, but ways of reducing the government's prestige in the coming election.
Then I was more than astounded by what
my honourable friend from Peterborough did
not say about other provisions in the Speech
from the Throne. For instance, the Speech
makes a direct reference to the national
health program, but there is not a word about
this in the address of the honourable senator
from Peterborough, who, of all of our members, might be expected to be the foremost in
praising and commending this program.
The very next paragraph in the Speech
from the Throne says that a bill will be
introduced to broaden the scope of the Family

Allowances Act.
received any commendation from any honourable member on the other side or any member of the Progressive Conservative Party in
another place? I wish my honourable friend
from Peterborough were present so that I
could say to ber that of all the statements in

the Speech from the Throne this is one which
she should have endorsed. There is a special
reason for my saying that, honourable senators. When the original Family Allowances
Bill was before the other house, the then
leader of the opposition, Mr. Bracken, said it
was a bribe to the electors. And in a radio
address delivered on August 9, 1944, the then
Prime Minister of Ontario, who is the present
leader of the opposition, said this of the
Family Allowances Bill:
The Government of Ontario intends to do everything within its power to make sure that this iniquitous bill does not go into effect.

Any member of the opposition party speaking
in this house, and particularly the honourable
lady senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis), should go on record as repudiating the
statements made in this regard by the present
leader of the Conservative party, and his
predecessor, and assure the people of Canada
that he, or she, is 100 per cent behind the
policy of the government, which has already
been endorsed by the people of Canada.
Reference is made in the Speech from the
Throne of the formation of a commission to
inquire into national transportation. I hesitate to criticize this proposal.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Go right ahead.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I know my honourable
friend would be one of the first to pick up
one of my sentences and use it outside its
context. If he does not do so, he differs from
some of his associates.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is not a very nice
statement to make.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I object to that. Surely you
will withdraw that statement.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will have something to
say later on that point.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I was speaking of some
other members of the Conservative party. I
cannot say that my honourable friends opposite have ever been guilty of using the text
without the context. I am glad my friends
can score on me to that extent.
I am not criticizing the proposal, but I am
wondering why the commission is being set
up. As a senator, I think it is my duty to
raise a question about such matters. No
doubt when the subject gets to the proper
stage in the other place it will be fully
explained. We have in Canada the Board of
Transport Commissioners, which has been
headed by outstanding men. The present
chairman of that board, Mr. Justice Archibald,
is a man of great ability. He was a distinguished member of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia, and during the war years served
in a very able way as chairman of one of the
labour boards in Ottawa.

SENATE
I recognize the outstanding ability of the
gentleman who is to be the chairman of the
new commission. The Honourable W. F. A.
Turgeon is a brother of our colleague from
Cariboo. He and I had the pleasant experience
of being admitted to the Bar of New Brunswick and of going west together. We parted
company at Regina, and the next time we
met he was Attorney-General of the province
of Saskatchewan and I was Attorney-General
for British Columbia. He was later Chief
Justice of Saskatchewan, and more recently
has been High Commissioner to Ireland. The
Honourable Mr. Turgeon has a wide knowledge of Canadian affairs; he has sat on other
important commissions, and I have not the
least doubt about his ability.
The only question in my mind concerning
the appointment of the commission is why
is the investigation being taken out of the
hands of the Transport Board, a body which
has a tradition and a wide experience in transportation matters. It may be that the government has felt that the board was too tied down
by tradition and that there was need for
bringing a fresh mind to the solution of the
problem. Those are matters which I do not
feel qualified to discuss at the moment, but
I think we may conclude that this inquiry is
opportune and necessary.
We in this country must face the fact that
our railways have to secure adequate returns
to permit them to operate. If the present
rates do not adequately compensate them,
some method must be devised to assure
them fair returns. Tremendous capital expenditures must be made by the Canadian railroads. At this time of the year, with the
frost in the ground, the sleepers ride quite
comfortably; but when spring comes the
trip from here to Vancouver, bumping over
the ties, is most unpleasant. When we compare our railways with those of the United
States we must realize that if our roads are
to be kept up and are to get their share of
the traffic, tremendous capital expenditures
must be made.
One of the prime purposes of the inquiry
will be to remove jurisdictional injustices.
Coming from British Columbia, as I do, I have
strong feelings in this respect; but as the matter is now in reserve I will not discuss it.
Concerning the mountain differential, the
railways are not only proposing to ask for
the perpetuation of these discriminations, but
they are seeking to impose a percentage of
increase on the differential. That seems to
me somewhat illogical, because the mountains
are no higher and the grades no steeper than
they used to be.
Whatever may be the merits of that question, this is basic: Western Canada's trade and
prosperity depend on fair and equalized

freight rates, and the progress of the West is
essential to the prosperity of the East. We
hear a good deal these days about national
unity; but as long as there are grievances, and
shippers and importers in the West find these
hard-to-explain discrepancies, there will be a
sense of injustice-and nothing does more to
harm the spirit of Canadian unity. Whether
the government is to correct the problems of
transportation by appointing a new commission or by strengthening the Transport Board
and imposing further duties on them, it is
high time there was a complete review of the
situation. I think the people of Canada must
look forward with hopeful anticipation to
good results from this commission.
Honourable senators, a further question
referred to in the Speech from the Throne is
appeals to the Privy Council. I would not
deal with this subject now if I were able to
be here when the bill is introduced in the
house. If honourable senators will permit me,
as one somewhat actively engaged in the
practice of law and a former president of the
Canadian Bar Association, I should like to say
something on this question. I feel that as a
result of our new sense of national independence the sentiment in this country is growing
so strongly in favour of doing away with
appeals to the Privy Council that there is not
much point in speaking against the proposal.
However, with the permission of the house,
I should like to read an expression of opinion
that I wrote for the Canadian Bar Review
after the Privy Council declared that the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction to abolish
the appeals. The editor of this journal invited
me, with some others, to give my views. I
expressed my opinions on the question of the
legality of the decision and its implications,
and finally, on the question whether, the right
to abolish appeals, being admitted, should be
exercised immediately. With the permission
of honourable senators, I will put on record
what I then wrote:
On this question there is something to be said on
both sides. The fact that the power exists is not
of itself a reason for putting it into effect. The
Privy Council has been a useful institution to Canada and has contributed much to our jurisprudence
both directly and as a powerful influence in our
legal and judicial growth and development. England
has been the cradle of the common law and the
high traditions of our profession are deeply embedded in the judicial soil of that country. To say
now that because we are grown up we should
demonstrate our new status by abolishing Privy
Council appeals is a non sequitur which would indicate our continued adolescence.
It is true that
Canada is now big enough to have her own Court
of Appeal. In fact, she is big enough to have any
court she considers in her best interest.
If the
appeals are to be abolished, let us be sure the
reasons are sensible and realistic and not merely
the first flutterings of the wings of the bird newly
dropped from its nest.

If a province or the dominion, fighting a
private litigant, wants to test the constitutionality of a case, and drags a private litigant
overseas, it would be only fair that his costs
should be paid.
(2) Cases between parties where the amount involved is large. I would suggest a minimum of
$25,000, or even $50,000.
(3) Cases for lesser amounts where the appellant
is put on terms to pay all the costs, win or lose.
(4) Cases where both parties stipulate in advance
that the loser below shall have the right to appeal to
the Privy Council. If both sides can afford the luxury
of an appeal regardless of the amount involved, and
so stipulate, there is no hardship.
There is criticism that it is inconsistent with our
present status as a nation that we are dependent
on a court which is paid for by Britain. This is
easily corrected. Canada should insist on paying
its own way and that the share of maintenance costs
of the Privy Council proportionate to the amount
of work connected with Canadian appeals should be
paid by Canada. In this connection I suggest that
some Canadian judges of recognized ability should
be members of the Judicial Committee.

I may say that the Chief Justice of Canada
is today a member of that committee, and I
understand that he may be going to the Privy
Coundil this summer.

the bill of the Honourable C. G. Power with
regard to election expenses. I shall not
discuss the bill, but as to the subject-matter
I want to offer a suggestion which is based
on some experience.
One of the chief expenses in partisan
elections is that of getting voters out to the
polls.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In my judgment that difficulty could be largely remedied by the institution of compulsory voting, which I believe
would be a highly beneficial reform.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What sort of person can
always be depended upon to go to the polls?

There are inevitable forces tending to pull us apart.
These forces should be countered and resisted.
Action by Canada at this time declaring against our

will be interpreted in many quarters as a significant
step in a process of Empire dissolution. My advice

have acquired a cynical attitude towards
politics. They sit at their own firesides or

about the way politics are run, and the gang
who are running them, and so forth; but they
don't go out and vote. Under a compulsory
system the votes of these men would be
disinterested in the sense that they had no
immediate private ends to serve, but they
would reflect a higher interest, namely, the
welfare of the country as a whole. I believe it

SENATE
will be found that a large percentage of nonvoters is in this group. Someone may ask,
"Why force them to vote if they are not sufficiently interested to do so?" My reply is that if
this type of man were compelled to discharge
his public duty he would take more interest in
public affairs, which is an end much to be
desired. I grow very impatient with the
argument, "Oh, there is too much compulsion;
why should I be compelled to vote?" My
attitude toward this question is that while
the exercise of the ballot, like the opportunity to perform any public duty, is ýa
privilege, the vote was extended to our
citizens because in a democracy it is their
public duty to vote and thereby to contribute
their opinions, their ideas and, I hope, their
ideals as to how the state shall be governed.
Jury service is a privilege, but it is primarily a duty. No man has the right to say:
"I refuse to serve on a jury. What right have
you got to make me perform that duty?". In
the name of common citizenship he can be
told that it is his duty to serve on a jury.
By the same principle I say that it is the
duty of every citizen to vote. I have heard
the utterly absurd idea put forth that a person should not be compelled to vote because
he may not be satisfied with any of the candidates. Well, isn't it too bad that we have a
gentleman in our community who is so much
above the rest of us that he cannot soil his
hands with a ballot because he doesn't like
any of the candidates. I do not think there
can be many of these people, and I would
not bother my head about them.
Honourable senators, the compulsory vote
would improve the standard of electors and
would lighten the tremendous burden now
imposed on the various political parties. I
wonder how many voters today go to the
polls because they are transported there. I
think they would be better if they went to
the polls under a compelling obligation to
perform a civic duty rather than by reason
of some party representative calling them up,
inviting them out for a drink, and taking
them to the polls in a motor car.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that system being
employed anywhere today?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, I believe it is being
used successfully in Australia.
Honourable senators, associated with this
is another policy that I should like to see
introduced in Canada-the single transferable vote. Those who do not understand it
confuse it with proportional representation.
They are not to be confused. One is the
antithesis of the other. My honourable friend
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) agrees
with me in this. I do not like proportional
representation.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Theoretically it is of
advantage. It is fine to say that every group
in the community should be represented in
parliament, but what is desired is effective
government. This can only be obtained by
putting in office a group of men who, under
a responsible and representative government,
have people behind them to see them through.
An extreme illustration of the evils of
innumerable groups in parliament can be
found in France. It is such a condition which
has practically destroyed parliamentary
government in that great country, and we
certainly do not vant it here. That is what
proportional representation encourages, but
the single transferable vote is the very antithesis of that system.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Farris: While most honourable
senators understand the single transferable
vote, I would presume on the patience of this
house to explain it. The finest illustration I
know of the single transferable vote was that
carried out, although in a cumbersome manner, in Newfoundland. Two plebiscites were
held. In the first there were three proposals
on the ballot: To remain as they were under
British jurisdiction; to have responsible
government; or to join Canada. In that first
vote no majority was returned for any one
of the three proposals. If there had not been
a second vote, responsible government would
have carried. But a second vote was taken,
and the proposal having the smallest vote
in the first plebiscite. was dropped, leaving
only two proposals, responsible government
and confederation with Canada. Although
responsible government would have carried
on the first vote, on the second vote confederation with Canada carried by a majority of
six or seven thousand. It was not necessary
for Newfoundland to have held two plebiscites. They could have accomplished the
same thing on one ballot. That is what the
single transferable vote does. If you have
three men running in a single-member constituency-it must be a single-member constituency-you have a first choice and a
second choice.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And you vote for all
three?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, just for first and
second. If any one of the three has a clear
majority, he is elected, and that is the end
of it.

Hon. Mr. Haig: A clear majority of the

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is there any opposition

Hon. Mr. Lambert: There is no opposition
whatsoever to the bill.
Hon. Antoine J. Leger: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to try to hinder passage
of this bill. On the contrary, I am all in
favour of the measure, and the observations
I am about to make are intended to be
helpful.
It seems to me that certain things should be
called to the attention of the Senate. The bill
is properly before us, because the railway
company was incorporated under a federal act
and the railway itself was declared a work
for the general advantage of Canada. After
purchase by the city application was made
to the Minister of Transport for permission,
under section 150 of the Railway Act, to
operate the railway until the end of the
present session of parliament, and this application was granted.
As to section 1, I cannot see any objection
at all. In fact, I think the section is a proper
one. Section 2 is necessary because of a
decision that was given in Re Grand Valley
Railway Company, 18 Canadian Railway
Cases, page 430, where it is said:
A municipality may acquire a dominion railway,-

That is what was done in this case.
-but is without power to operate it without authority of the minister and a subsequent enabling Act.

prefer not to have this section included,
because in it admission is made that the
railway operates in two provinces, and this
admission ousts provincial jurisdiction. Under
section 92 of the British North America Act
the province has jurisdiction in relation to
local works and undertakings other than:
Railways . . . connecting the province with any
other or others of the provinces, or extending
beyond the limits of the province.

It is admitted by the proposed legislation
that the railway extends beyond the limits
of the province, and therefore puts the matter
out of provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt my
friend? I am not competent to discuss this
constitutional question with a lawyer of his
standing, but it appears to me that the provincial jurisdiction in both Ontario and Quebec applies simply to the existence of property
rights in each province, and not so much to
the operation of the railway interprovincially.
Because the railway is operated interprovincially the matter comes under the Railway
Act.
Hon. Mr. Leger: The legislation would be
just as faulty that way. I am not opposing
the measure; I am just trying to be helpful.
My suggestion is that this bill should follow
what has been directed or hinted at in a
case from which I shall presently quote. I
am referring to the Railway Act of Canada,
third edition, edited by MacMurchy and
Spence, the latest edition I could find in the
library. Section 7, page 42, reads:
Where any railway, the construction or operation
of which is authorized by a special act passed by the
legislature of any province, is declared, by any act
of the Parliament of Canada, to be a work for the
general advantage of Canada, this Act shall apply
to such railway-

and so on.
The enactment of this section made it clear that
after a declaration that a railway is for the general
advantage of Canada-

It has been so declared here.
-it
must refer exclusively to the dominion act for
a definition of its powers, duties and obligations in
any case in which the provincial and dominion legislation clash even though it had been incorporated

At page 43 of the text, I find these words:

advantage of Canada.

This measure has been declared to be for
the general advantage of Canada, but I see
nothing in the bill Which shows that parliament has attempted to repeal the declaration
under section 92. My argument is that until
the declaration is repealed it must stand.
Reading further from page 43:
By appropriate legislation a portion of a dominion
railway may be transferred to a provincial jurisdiction.

That is what we are attempting to do here.
Mr. Justice Duff had this to say:
."The dominion legislation authorising the transfer
to the provincial company of the property of the
dominion railway company involved by necessary
implication a declaration that such property, when
transferred, should no longer be part of a work for
the general advantage of Canada; I entertain no
doubt that such a declaration by the Dominion
Parliament made with the concurrence of the
Quebec legislature-

This was a Quebec case.
-"would be entirely effective to remove the property transferred from the Dominion jurisdiction
under secs. 91 (29) and 92 (10) of the British North
Arnerica Act."

I would suggest that instead of making the
Railway Act inapplicable and attempting by
legislation to transfer property from the dominion jurisdiction to that of the province, this
bill should follow the suggestion made by
Mr. Justice Duff, to the effect that by
appropriate legislation the railway can be
transferred from one jurisdiction to the other;
that is, by declaration that the railway is no
longer a work for the general advantage of
Canada.
I think that sections 1 and 2 of the bill contain everything that is necessary, except the
declaration that the railway is to be transferred from one jurisdiction to the other.
Therefore, I would suggest that after the
word "property" in section 2 we should add
these words: "which is hereby declared to
have ceased to be a part of a work for the
general advantage of Canada".
In my opinion section 4 of the bill is
unnecessary, and should be deleted. I do not
think there would be any question that the
railway could then operate under the jurisdiction of Ontario. To my mind it would be
unnecessary to obtain any legislation from the
province of Quebec, because to apply for it
would be to admit that the railway was operating in two provinces.
I am a little doubtful about the purpose of
section 5 of the bill. The reason given for it

is that the Winding-up Act does not apply to
building societies or to railway or telegraph
companies. There are reasons for excluding
these organizations. The explanatory note on
that section reads:
In the absence of the proposed section, there is

no legislative authority under which the company
could be wound-up.

-I am inclined to doubt that. I think they
could, and that they should apply to the
Transport Commissioners and obtain directions. The board is constituted a court, and
in such matters as directly pertain to it has
exclusive jurisdiction. So it seems to me
the mode of procedure would be to obtain
a direction from the board and then, having
acted under their instructions, resort if necessary to parliament for repeal or amendment
of the Act.
I do not want to hinder the passage of this
bill. I have tried to be constructive and to
do everything within my power, as I understand the measure, to make it more workable.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am grateful to the
honourable senator for his contribution to
the discussion, and in view of the point he
has raised I think it would be advisable, if
the Senate so agrees, to have the bill dealt
with tomorrow morning by the Banking and
Commerce Committee, who meet at that time,
and who no doubt will expedite action with
a view to third reading the same day. That
is my suggestion, if my honourable friend is
willing that the bill shal receive second
reading now.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Oh, yes.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: I believe the
honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger) has made a distinct contribution to
this debate: he has, at least, studied in
advance the constitutional and other issues
involved. But I think we should go ahead,
because even if the doubts he has raised are
of substance, no very great harm will be
done in incorporating the company on the
terms proposed; and that for three different
reasons. This railroad is under dominion
jurisdiction and not under that of a province;
it connects one province with another; it has
been declared for the general advantage of
Canada, and it is being incorporated by this
measure under dominion jurisdiction. In
these circumstances it is evidently a dominion
railroad.
The doubt I have is whether under the
British North America Act the Dominion Parliament may lawfully delegate its powers to
the provinces, in bringing this railroad in its
two wings, so to speak-one within the province of Ontario, the other in the province of

SENATE
Quebec-under provincial law. It is very
doubtful whether the courts would enforce a
Provision of that kind. But if they do not, it
is flot going to matter very much. If the
court should declare that section 4 is flot
within our jurisdiction, the railroad will
revert to other law, and no public harm xvould
resuit. So I would support the passing of the
bill.
The sarne thought applies to the criticism
of section 5. If the Winding-up Act does not
apply, if its application to this road is unconstitutional, it will not be applied, and other
methods of wînding-up, should winding-up
ever become necessary, will be adopted. So
I ar n ot disposed to be unduly disturbed by
the doubts which have been raised, and which
I think are substantial. I believe we should
go ahead and give the bill second reading at
least. If its constitutionality seems more
dubious after it cornes out of committee, the
situation can then be deait wîth.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
heartily agree with the suggestion that motion No. 2 stand over until item No. 1 on the
Order Paper has been considered.
This gives me an opportunity to say something that I have been wanting to say. I think
that the next time our rules are amended
there should be inserted a provision, such as
is to be found in the rules of most legislatures,
so far as my experience goes, that certain days
of the week-say Monday, Wednesday and
Friday-are government days, and the remaining days are private members' days. On
government days the honourable leader of
the house could call for consideration of any
government item on the Order Paper that he
wished to advance, but on the other days
private members' legislation would take precedence. I think that would be of great
advantage, not only to the government but
to private members. As we know, it frequently happens that government legislation,
or the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne or something of that kind, is
discussed day after day until perhaps a
quarter to six, when a few minutes are devoted to some private bill. We none of us
like to suggest that a bill sponsored by a
private member should be held over for
another day, yet in these circumstances we
sometimes feel that a private bill does not
receive the consideration it deserves.
As to the proposed adjournment, I was
secretly hoping that it would be until the
14th of March. I am not criticizing the
leader of the government at all, for I know
that before making his announcement he has
been in consultation with the Prime Minister.
I am afraid, though, that the Prime Minister
is unduly optimistic in thinking that much
legislation will be put through the other
house in the next two or three weeks. There
being a possibility of an election within the
next fifteen months, and human nature being
what it is, many honourable members of the
other house will wish to make speeches designed to influence their constituents. I am
doubtful that much legislation will come over
to us from the other place within the next
two weeks. However, it is our duty and
responsibility to be here on the date fixed for
resuming, and we shall discharge that
responsibility.
I for one have long felt that we would be
much better liked by the public if we did five
solid days of work every week for two or
three weeks and then took a couple of weeks
recess, instead of meeting for an hour or an

hour and a half daily for three days a week,
which seems like puttering around. I wish to
repeat that I am not criticizing the leader of
the government. On the contrary, I entirely
endorse what he is doing. He was kind
enough to let me know what he intended to
propose to the house, and I appreciate his
courtesy.
NEWFOUNDLAND-CANADA

UNION BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Copp for the second reading of Bill 11, an Act
to approve the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada.
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, although circumstances beyond my
control made it impossible for me to present
this measure for your consideration, I am
grateful that I have the opportunity of closing
the debate. I have read with the greatest
interest the discussion which has taken place
in this chamber, and wish to join with those
who have spoken in extending to the people

of Newfoundland the warmest welcome to the
confederation of Canada.
The speeches which have been made,
honourable senators, are of the quality one
would reasonably expect, having regard to
the talent which exists among the members
of this chamber and the very great occasion
upon which they were exercised. The speeches
were so uniformly good that it is difficult to

select any particular one for comment. However, perhaps I will be pardoned by the other
speakers if I say that while reading the
address of the honourable senator for Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris) I was reminded of
his remarks to me during the early sittings
of the first committee appointed by the Canadian Government to negotiate with the first
committee from Newfoundland. In private
conversation with my honourable friend I
had occasion to comment on matters generally
in relation to Newfoundland, and made the
observation that the proposed union would
entail a very substantial financial obligation
on the part of Canada. The honourable
gentleman replied: "Of course the financial
responsibility is always an important question, especially if it assumes unreasonable
proportions. That is one thing. But my warning to you and to the government is that if
you lose this opportunity for union between
Canada and Newfoundland, the people of this
country will hold you strictly responsible. If
you have any objection to union on financial
grounds, it must be exceedingly strong to
satisfy the people of Canada, should union
fail." I felt that the whole tone of my
friend's speech reflected consistency in that
regard.

FEBRUARY 17, 1949
It was my privilege fifteen years ago to sit
in the gallery of the British House of Cornmons when the Commission Government of
Newfoundland was brought into being. There
seemed to be general agreement then that
because of difficult world conditions in 1933
this was the best solution for al concerned.
Undoubtedly it was. But I remember thinking, as I reflected on the long history of Newfoundland-paralleling for three hundred
years that of my native province of Nova
Scotia-that this surely would be only a
temporary expedient, and that in due course
the pride and rugged independence of the
Newfoundland people would assert itself, and
they would again seek and secure responsible
government. It did not occur to me then that
when the change came, it might take the form
of union with Canada. In 1947 when that
appeared to be a possibility, and a committee
of the Canadian government was formed to
meet a committee frorn Newfoundland to
discuss possible terms, I was more than
pleased to be made one of its members. I sat
with the first committee in 1947, but was
absent frorn Canada during 1948 while the
second committee completed negotiation of
the terms which are now before us for consideration. I am happy, indeed, that the
temper of the house would seem to indicate
that these terms meet with your hearty
approval.
I feel quite certain that the people of
Newfoundland did not elect to enter the
confederation of Canada without certain
doubts and fears. But doubts and fears
existed in other provinces, particularly the
Maritimes, when they originally joined confederation. I think perhaps I am in a position as good as, if not better than that of any
other honourable senator to fully appreciate
the viewpoint of some of those in Newfoundland who are opposed to confederation. Not
only do I represent a province which joined
confederation with great misgivings, but my
whole upbringing, on both sides of the family,
was in an atmosphere of anti-confederation.
Prior to 1867, my paternal grandfather, as a
member of the Nova Scotia Legislature,
fought the confederation movement very
strenuously, and after it was an accomplished
fact supported a movement for its repeal.
Time tends to soften one's viewpoint; but
I vividly recollect that thirty years afterwards the old gentleman would reverently
but firmly remove the Union Jack from the
gate-post of our house on Dominion Day,
saying as be did so that it could fly there on
any day but the first of July. My maternal
grandfather was engaged in the shipping
business over one hundred years ago, when
Nova Scotia's activities in that sphere were at
their height. For years his enterprises were

attended with great success; but some years
after confederation the fortunes of Nova
Scotia's wooden shipping industry declined,
and while I am not sure that this was the
direct result of confederation, there was a
general tendency to consider that such was
the case.
May I say now to the people of Newfoundland, and particularly to those who are
opposed to confederation, that while I can
appreciate their doubts and fears, I believe
for more reasons than one that, on balance,
their decision to join Canada was a wise one.
Undoubtedly they were afraid, as were the
Nova Scotians, that being a relatively small
area with a relatively small population, in
some way the majority, through sins of commission or omission, would do something
which would be detrimental to their interests.
The fears of the minorities cover a wide
range, but let me say at once that the whole
history of Canada, particularly since confederation, gives ample evidence that in the
fields of religion, education and culture, and
in all other phases of human activity, the
people of Newfoundland have nothing whatever to fear. The almost universal experience
of al parts of Canada is that in matters of
this kind the greatest protection to minorities
in Canada is the general good sense and
broadmindedness of the majority.
That has been the history up to the present,
and I believe it will be the record of the
future. Should, however, any majority in
the future so far forget this fact as to attempt
to act otherwise, there stands in its way the
Senate of Canada. The protection of minorities, as one of the cardinal principles of
confederation, is embodied in the very composition and structure of the Senate. The
Maritime Provinces, for instance, were given
representation in the Senate entirely out of
proportion to their numbers, either actual
or potential, and the terms of the union of
Newfoundland with Canada recognize the
same principle. With a population of 300,000
people, Newfoundland is being given six
representatives in a Senate of 102 members
while her membership in the House of Commons, which is on a strictly mathematical
basis, will be seven members in a house of
262. I am certain that the people of Newfoundland can enter Confederation with complete confidence so far as the future is
concerned.
I have no doubt that the people of Newfoundland, like those of us from Nova Scotia,
are fervently hoping for the maximum
increase in the volume of our international
trade. Their position and the nature of their
natural resources make export markets no
less important to them than to Canadians
generally.

FEBRUARY 17, 1949
He said: Honourable senators undoubtedly
are aware that, under the procedure which
has been suggested by the government as
desirable and necessary to be followed after
the passing of Bill 11, to which the Senate
has just given its consent, it is proposed that
an Address be presented to His Majesty in
the terms which I have already moved, and
which is identical with the one that bas been
passed in the other place. I commend it to
your consideration, as the final act in respect
to Canada's participation and action in the
historic incidents which will culminate in
Newfoundland becoming part of the Canadian
confederation.
On the subject in general, I do not know
that I can add much to what bas been so
eloquently said on both sides by a representative group of senators in this house. In time
to come, however, it may be that we shall feel
even more intensely the great privilege and
opportunity accorded us, as members of the
Parliament of Canada, to participate in an act
of such historic importance, and one which I
hope and feel sure will be of great advantage
to both Canada and Newfoundland. From
what I know and have long known of the
characteristics of the people of Newfoundland, I am convinced that they will make a
great contribution to the confederation, and
I welcome them from the bottom of my heart.
I feel, however, in view of some of the criticism that has been made of the procedure,
that it is necessary to refer briefiy to the
particular method.
The British North America Act, which
created the Dominion of Canada, set up a
federal system to govern this country. Under
it matters of national concern were assigned
to the legislative jurisdiction of the federal
parliament, and matters of a local or private
nature within the provinces were assigned to
the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures.
The Dominion Parliament consists of His
Majesty, represented by the Governor
General; an upper house, styled the Senate,
and the lower house, known as the House of
Commons. The Senate was set up particularly by the Fathers of Confederation to guard
territorial and minority rights. The provincial legislatures were set up to legislate upon
matters of a local or private nature within the
provinces, not to defend or preserve the rights
of minorities or of territories. Under the constitution, therefore, they have no right to ask
to be consulted in matters affecting the
national interest. The Fathers of Confederation wisely provided that such matters
should be dealt with by the national parliament. Where, however, provincial rights are
affected by an action of the Dominion Parliament which may infringe upon local or pri29091--9

vate matters, such for instance, as the alteration of the boundary of a province, the British
North America Act, as amended, provides
that the consent of the province must be
obtained. For example, section 3 of the
British North America Act, 1871, provides
that:
The Parliament of Canada may from time to time,
with the consent of the legislature of any province
of the said dominion, increase, diminish or otherwise alter the limits of such province, upon such
terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the
said legislature and may, with the like consent, make
provision respecting the effect and operation of any
such increase or diminution or alteration of territory
in relation to any province affected thereby.

The entry of Newfoundland as a province
of Canada was provided for in the original
British North America Act of 1867. Indeed,
representatives of the island of Newfoundland sat in with the representatives of the
other provinces on the deliberations of the
Quebec conference.* For reasons which we
need not go into here, Newfoundland did not
enter the original confederation nor, in fact,
did Prince Edward Island, whose representatives also sat in at the Quebec conference.
The fact that both these colonies were not
prepared to enter confederation in 1867 was
well known at the time to all the provinces
which did enter; but the way was left open
for them to come in at a later date, and
sections 146 and 147 of the Act were formulated with this object in view. Section 146
sets out a procedure whereby Newfoundland
may enter confederation upon addresses from
the houses of the Parliament of Canada and
from the houses of the Legislature of the
Province of Newfoundland being submitted
to the Queen who, by the Act, is empowered
by an order of the Imperial Privy Council to
admit Newfoundland to the Dominion of
Canada.
Since that section was enacted the situation
with respect to Canada and Newfoundland
has been altered from a constitutional viewpoint. Newfoundland no longer bas a legislature. So some procedure other than an
address of the legislature must be followed if
Newfoundland is at this time to become a
province of Canada. It has been agreed by
the legal experts of Great Britain, Canada
and Newfoundland that the procedure proposed by the government at this time is the
one which commends itself to all parties concerned in the proposal. However, if a statute
is to be passed by the Parliament at Westminster, in view of the Statute of Westminster it is necessary to recite in the Canadian
Act that Canada has requested such a measure and has consented to its enactment by
the Parliament of the United Kingdom in
order to confirm and give effect to the
present agreement. I therefore commend the
present procedure to this house.

SENATE
At the same time I desire to point out in
the strongest possible terms that it is incumbent upon this house-which was set up by
the Fathers of Confederation to protect minority and territorial rights-to satisfy itself
that no territorial or minority interest will
be prejudicially affected by the entry of
Newfoundland as a province of Canada; and
that it is the responsibility of this bouse,
more especially under our constitution, to
deal with this phase of the matter. If we are
satisfied that this proposal to include Newfoundland in our dominion is in the interest
of Canada, it is our duty so to declare, and to
welcome the province and its citizens into
our confederacy. If, on the other hand, we
come to the conclusion that it is not in the
interest of Canada to include Newfoundland
as a province of our dominion, we should
say so. But we should not, by any action we
take in this house, delegate our responsibility
as the protector and guardian of territorial
and minority rights, to a province or provinces. I believe that Canada is a nation and
should function as a nation.

anxious as my honourable friend, the leader
of the government in this house (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), to see this part of British North
America included in the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Howard:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The Fathers of Confederation, who were very able men, felt that this
union was needed to round out our nation.
After listening to the address by my honourable friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) in which he referred to the original
negotiations of 1895, I was glad that when I
spoke on the second reading of Bill 11, I did
not discuss the financial terms. Apparently
$5 million was all that kept Newfoundland
from joining Canada in 1895. Up to the time
he discussed the terrms by which Newfoundland would become part of Canada, I was
entirely in agreement with the address of
the honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson). I am sure that every
Canadian is anxious to see this union take
place, and the Senate is the one house in this
country that can say to Newfoundland "We
will give you protection to no end." But, as
was suggested by my honourable friend from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), some
difficulty may arise from the proposed representation of Newfoundland in this house
by six senators. Manitoba, with a population of 800,000, has only six senators; and
Saskatchewan, with a population of a million

people, also has only six members of this
body. Alberta, which will some day be the
richest province in the dominion-not excepting British Columbia-is represented by only
six senators, as is also British Columbia, with
a population of a million and a quarter.
I must say quite candidly that there will be
a feeling in these provinces that Newfoundland will be enjoying greater proportionate
representation in the Senate than they are.
The original plan was to have territorial
representation in the Senate, with one-quarter
coming from the Prairie Provinces, onequarter from Quebec, one-quarter from
Ontario, and one-quarter from the four western provinces. In effect, this legislation gives
the Maritime Provinces an additional six
senators. I am not disputing that the British
North America Act, 1867, provided that if
Newfoundland were admitted to confederation it would be entitled to four senators, and
that by an amendment in 1915 that number
was increased to six. I am not concerned
about that matter, nor about the question
raised in the other house, but I think that
those who raised it had good ground for doing
so, even though on both sides it was a political question, and the Senate is not interested
in it.
I intend to vote for the motion, but I cannot get out of my mind the fact that the Newfoundland convention whose duty it was to
draft the ballot voted 29 to 16 against placing
the question of confederation with Canada
on the ballot. The members of that convention were representatives of the people, and
the British government forced them to place
that question on the ballot.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Were the members of
the convention elected?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, they were delegates
elected for the purpose of considering this
matter, and by a considerable majority they
voted against placing the choice of confederation on the ballot.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They were afraid the
public would vote in favour of it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, the delegates were
elected by the people, and our government is
run by representatives chosen in that way.
A referendum is another thing altogether.
And I ask honourable members to note that
the number of people who voted on the
second referendum was far smaller than the
number who voted on the first one. What I
am wondering about is whether the Legislature of Newfoundland, if the people down
there had been given the right to elect one,
would have voted for confederation.

Hon. Mr. Howard: Sure.

FEBRUARY 17, 1949
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend says,
"Sure"; but I am doubtful about that, in view
of the vote by the convention delegates who,
as I said, were elected by the people. I trust
the people. I still trust them, even though
I do not have to go to them for election.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my honourable
friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is the voice of the people
more faithfully expressed through a secondary vote by representatives or through a
direct vote of the people themselves?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In this country we have
always adopted the secondary system-that
of having the people's wishes expressed by
their representatives.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Not always.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, nearly always. There
has never been any other system used except
as to some question on which the parties did
not want to take a stand. In my province
the liquor question is the only one that has
been submitted to the people by a referendum. All parties are in favour of the sale of
liquor, but their leaders do not want to say
so publicly.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That does not answer my
question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) says the
convention delegates did not want confederation placed on the ballot because they feared
the people would vote for it. He apparently
has no doubt that the legislature, if the people
had had the right to elect one, would have
voted for confederation. Well, if there had
been a legislature and it had so voted, the
question that is troubling me would not have
arisen and Newfoundland would have become
a province under the simple procedure provided by sections 146 and 147 of the British
North America Act.
I have never been much concerned over
the suggestion that the present provinces of
Canada should have been consulted about
the entry of Newfoundland, because that
entry was contemplated by the Fathers of
Confederation and, as I say, is specifically
provided for in the British North America
Act.
We all want Newfoundland to become part
of Canada. I agree with the honourable
leader of the government that this country
will go out of its way to see that the new
province is given a square deal. I plead with
the Newfoundlanders who have been opposed
to confederation to join with us in an
endeavour to make our combined countries
a greater nation than either country alone
29091-9j

could ever become. Let them be assured that
Canada will treat their province fairly. It
will get at least as good a deal as it would
have got if it had first elected its own legislature and that legislature had then voted
to come in under the terms of the British
North America Act.
We know that the federal treasury will
pay to Newfoundland far more money than
will be returned from that new province for
many years. But history is a long tale. As
I suggested the other day, the people of one
hundred years from now will probably wonder whether Newfoundland did not realize
that the money paid to her in return for
confederating was a mere mess of pottage,
because by that time the tremendous assets
that Canada gained through the acquisition
of the new province's resources in fish, timber
and mines-and, above all, in people of
sterling character-will be a matter of record.
The Newfoundlanders, as we know from
contact with them, are indeed a very fine
people.
I have a theory, honourable senators, that
people who have been brought up in a rough
country where it has been necessary to
struggle against the elements in order to
make a living, are a better type than those
who have always lived in the big cities under
easier conditions. How often have we seen
men who in their youth were subjected to a
rough life become leaders in government, in
science, industry and the professions? I confess that in my younger days I used to have
a grudge against the Maritime Provinces. I
have not seen much of that part of the
countryHon. Mr. Robertson: You are a young man
yet.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and I intend to go down
there. In fact, I have already made a start
by going to New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Then you have seen the best
part of the country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As a young man I was
amazed at the number of prominent lawyers,
doctors, preachers and professors who came
from the Maritime Provinces, and I used to
wonder what kind of place it was that produced such wonderful people.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They were raised without
a baby bonus, teo.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I believe they were.
I repeat that I intend to vote for the
resolution, and I ask my colleagues on this
side of the house to do the same. We pledge
ourselves at all times, whether the party to
which we belong is in office or in opposition,
to do our best to make the new confederation

work to the entire satisfaction of Newfoundland as well as of all the other provinces.
The motion was agreed to, and honourable
senators rose and sang "God Save the King."
BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill N, an Act respecting Bankruptcy.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bill.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, it is quite a jump from the discussion of
the confederation of Newfoundland with
Canada to a consideration of ordinary day-today realities of business and the more or less
inevitable conditions that lead to the situation
described as bankruptcy.
We have before us a bill which one can
judge by its thickness contains many provisions. I assure honourable senators that it
is not my intention to discuss them all in
detail.
The history of bankruptcy legislation is
quite interesting. The present Act came into
force in 1919, and since 1932 has not been
amended.
In 1946 a bankruptcy bill was
introduced in the Senate, and was later referred to a committee of this house which
heard many witnesses representing various
interests; even some of the bankruptcy judges
presented their views on that legislation.
Further consideration was given to the then
proposed legislation, and last year a new
bankruptcy bill was introduced in this house
embodying most of the changes which had
been recommended as a result of the hearings
in the Senate committee. That bill was not
proceeded with but was distributed throughout the country. We now have before us the
bill in its revised form, and I may say that
one would hardly recognize it from its likeness to the Act at present in force. Many and
material changes are proposed. I wish to
point out a few of the notable and some of
the provocative sections, so that when the bill
is dealt with in committee honourable
senators will be familiar with them.
I wish first to deal with the provision
relating to returns to be made by trustees.
Apparently as a result of the requirements in
provincial legislation and some federal statutes, trustees of bankrupt estates have been
saddled with the tremendous burden of preparing returns. This duty is a heavy one,
particularly if before bankruptcy the person
or corporation was careless of his obligations
under various acts requiring the making out
of returns. I know of one instance where the
trustee, an accountant, had to spend three
weeks with another accountant in order to

make up returns that the delinquent bankrupt
should have made. It is the concept of the
draftsman of this bill that a trustee is not
appointed under the Bankruptcy Act for the
purpose of doing things which the person
declared bankrupt should have done. The
obligation should continue to be that of the
bankrupt, and the trustee should be free
to serve the purpose intended-that is to
work out the aff airs of the bankrupt in the
Therefore, subinterest of his creditors.
section 14 of section 8 provides:
The trustee may not be required to make any
returns which the bankrupt is required to make
and has failed to make, notwithstanding any Act to
the contrary.

Sub-section 15 of that section reads:
The trustee shall at ail reasonable times permit
any authorized person to inspect the books and
papers of the bankrupt in order to prepare or verify
returns which the bankrupt is by statute required to
file.

To get some idea of the multiplicity of
returns required one bas only to read the list
in the explanatory notes opposite page 13.
These apply only to the province of Ontario.
I am quite sure that when this bill goes to
committee objections will come from the
Income Tax department down to various provincial departments which require returns.
I come now to perhaps the most provocative section in the bill, that dealing with the
scheme of distribution or the priorities under
which the assets of the bankrupt estate will
be distributed. I refer to section 95, which
commences at page 63. It is not my intention
to deal with this section in detail, except to
point out that the priority rights of bodies
who function under federal authority or provincial enactment are very considerably
changed. Section 125 of the present Act
reads:
Nothing in the four last preceding sections-

Those are the present sections dealing with
priorities and the distribution of assets of
bankrupt estates.
-shall
interfere with the collection of any taxes,
rates or assessments payable by or levied or imposed
upon the debtor or upon any property of the debtor
under any law of the dominion, or of the province
wherein such property is situate, or in which the
debtor resides, nor prejudice or affect any lien or
charge in respect of such property created by any
such laws.

Honourable senators will note that the bill
deals with that section in a revolutionary
manner. The explanatory note of paragraph
(j) of section 95(1) reads:
All government claims, federal and provincial, take
equal rank immediately before trade and other unsecured creditors.

On the page opposite 65 of the bill we find a
"memorandum re priorities", which gives the
explanation as to why the framers of this
legislation think it time to make a change in

FEBRUARY 17, 1949
the priorities granted by federal and provincial legislation, which eat into the estate
of the bankrupt and use up the assets which
have been created by the creditors, thus
depriving some classes of trade creditors of a
fair share in the proceeds of the estate. That
"memorandum re priorities" reads:
The Bankruptcy Act recognizes the rights Of
secured creditors. It has also recognized the right
of municipalities to be preferred for taxes and landlords for rent under their statutory liens. However,
it cannot have been the intention that preferences
should be accorded the large variety of claims which,
because of the preferences they have received, now
rank in priority before the claims of trade creditors
and even, in some instances, before the costs of
realizing the assets and administering the estate.
The fact remains that, under the provisions of
section 125-

I have just read that section.
-of the Bankruptcy Act, various taxing authorities
in the provinces have succeeded in obtaining by
provincial legislation priority rankings in respect of
their respective taxes to an extent that the stiuation
concerning priorities has become chaotic, difficulty
being experienced in many cases of determining the
order in which the many conflicting priorities should
rank without having to submit such matters to the
courts for decision. In the province of Ontario, for
instance, the following claims have priority over the
claims of ordinary creditors.

Then follows an enumeration, containing
twenty-one claims. The memorandum continues as follows:
The Income Tax Act also establishes a special
priority with respect to moneys collected at the
source (section 112 (6)).
It is submitted that if a
bankrupt has misappropriated trust funds he should
be punished accordingly but that the creditors
should not be penalized for his default. The ordinary law with respect to trust funds should apply;
otherwise it should be provided for in this Act and
not in some other Act and similar provisions should
be made for moneys collected with respect to unemployment insurance, gasoline tax, amusement tax,
etc.
The situation respecting the existing preferences
has become so inequitable, particularly as it concerns trade creditors whose goods usually furnish the
proceeds from which such claims are paid, and so
confused, that it is most desirable that the whole
field be reviewed and that an entirely new, comprehensive and equitable scheme of priorities be
established under the sole authority of the Bankruptcy Act.

We may expect that when this bill goes to
committee, representations will be made by
these governing bodies including the income
tax branch, which have enjoyed priorities,
to the end that their preferred position shall
be maintained. But the issue is a provocative
one, and there seems sound reason for a
change in the interests of the class for whom
presumably, bankruptcy legislation is designed, namely the trade creditors who are unpaid
and who, having taken proceedings against
the person who owes them money, find that
while their assets are being sold to put the
estate of the bankrupt in funds, so many
priorities have climbed in ahead of them that

the proceeds realized from their goods do not
become available in any great measure for
the satisfaction of their claims. In these
circumstances, and having regard to the
present list of priorities, it seems a misnomer
to describe the Bankruptcy Act as being for
the benefit of the trade creditor.
Hon. Mr. Davies: How are fees regulated
under this bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The tariff rates are continued, with some changes. Under the present Act, unless there is an agreement, or the
court fixes his remuneration, the highest percentage to which the trustee is entitled is 5
per cent on realization. In the present bill
his fee is increased to 7j per cent. There is
a tariff of fees for legal costs, with provisions
for scaling down in proportion to the capital
value of the estate. Al these matters are
covered in the proposed legislation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before my honourable
friend goes on to another point, may I ask
a question with regard to these priorities? In
the event of bankruptcy, is it proposed to
change the priority or the preference which
governing bodies possess prior to bankruptcy?
Perhaps I may make my question clearer.
The governing bodies to which he bas referred now have certain preferences in the matter of their claims. If this bill is passed, will
the intervention of bankruptcy change the
incidence of those preferences by advancing

the claims of the trade creditors beyond their
position under ordinary suit?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As the result of a provision in the present bankruptcy law, plus the
substantive legislation, federal and provincial, outside the Bankruptcy Act, a system
of priorities bas been built up. In the new
bill there is nothing which corresponds to
section 125 of the Act whereby priority is
established wherever it is prescribed by federal or provincial enactment. Those priorities could be established under the present
Act through action of the federal parliament
or a provincial legislature to give, for example,
priority in Ontario to the gasoline or the
amusement tax, thus increasing the list of the
priorities contained in the Act. That general
authority does not exist in this bill: all government claims, federal and provincial, take
equal' rank immediately before trade and
other unsecured creditors.

In

other words,

following the passage of this measure the
scheme of priorities outlined in the bill can-

not be disturbed by federal and provincial
enactment in such manner as to place federal

and provincial government claims higher in
the scheme of priorities than they are in
this bill.

SENATE
Governments still enjoy a preferred position, although a humbler one, down right
next door to the ordinary trade and unsecured
creditors. And there are no priorities as
among federal and provincial government
claims; they rank equally.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: What claims rank above
those of the federal and provincial governments?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: For example, municipal
taxes; costs of administration; certain wages
and salaries up to $500; landlords' claims for
arrears of rent; all indebtedness of the bankrupt under any workmen's compensation Act
and
any
unemployment
insurance
act
pari passu; claims resulting from injuries to
employees of the bankrupt to which the provisions of any workmen's compensation Act
do not apply. Then come claims of the Crown
in right of Canada or of any province
pari passu notwithstanding any statutory
preference to the contrary.
So the scheme of the bill is two-fold. First,
it is to provide a different plan of priorities;
second, it seeks to establish a scheme of
priorities under-and only under-the bankruptcy law itself. That is made clear in the
explanatory note. No longer will it be necessary to collect and compile a list of priorities
fron provincial and federal statutes; the list
is set out in this bill, and the order in which
they appear must be followed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I wonder whether the
bill would provide trade creditors with an
incentive to put a debtor into bankruptcy,
so as to secure for their claims a better
priority than they would have if the debtor
did not go into bankruptcy?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Of course I cannot speak
on behalf of trade creditors; but I do not
think it would.
In other words, I do not
think it would bring about a rush of bankruptcy petitions, because the basic situation
of an act of bankruptcy by an insolvent person must exist. I would call attention to the
fact that, at the present time, if you can
establish an act of bankruptcy and the petitioning creditor has a claim of $500 or the
sum total of the claims of petitioning creditors is $500, the basis for a petition in bankruptcy is established.
Under the proposed
legislation this amount of $500 is increased
to $1,000. Incidentally, I do not think there
would be a rush of bankruptcy petitions
caused by an improved position, because I
do not think the position would be improved
that much.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Would the honourable
senator please clarify the clause in regard to
wage-earners? Did I understand him to say
that if a manufacturer became bankrupt, and
he owed his employees $1,000, they could get
only fifty per cent?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. There is a priority
in respect to wages. Section 95(d) provides
as follows:
wages, salaries, commissions or compensation of any
clerk, servant, travelling salesman, labourer or
workman for services rendered during three months
next preceding the bankruptcy to the extent of five
hundred dollars in each case,...

That is the priority list.
An Hon. Senator: Would the dollar position
be any different?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: To answer that question
one would have to make a particular analysis
of the priorities that have been moved up in
this scheme. Frankly, I am not prepared to
give an answer to it now. One thing that I
think this revision does is to leave more of
the profits of the estate of the bankrupt
available to be spread over more claims. I
do not believe it confers too great a benefit
creditor, because the
on the unsecured
unsecured creditor is still down at the bottom
of the pile. Somehow or other he has to get
through this mountain of priorities before he
can be considered. Honourable senators will
note that government and provincial claims
have been moved down the list and more
deserving claims have been moved up.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Such as?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Such as the amount of
wages that I have read, and the cost of
administration. After all, if the estate is being
carried on for the benefit of everyone, then
the costs of administration should enjoy a
high priority. Then there is a priority for
municipal taxes and rent. Those things now
go to the top of the list, and when they come
off, the federal and provincial government
claims which appear under this omnibus
clause come in for consideration. They rank
equally and there is no priority amongst themselves. Then comes the unsecured creditor.
He is last in the scale of priorities and I do
not think his position is improved.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: What about the bank?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The bank usually gets
itself into the position of being a secured
creditor.
The next item I want to deal with covers
fraudulent preferences, and is to ba found at
page 47. As this section is legal in its implications I intend to refer to it only briefly. A
multitude of legal precedents have been built
up over fraudulent preferences in transfers
by insolvent persons. The law courts have
come to all sorts of conclusions, and there
has been some difficulty in determining just
what the proper principle of law is. There is
an attempt to overcome this problem by a

FEBRUARY 17, 1949
simple change in the wording of section 64.
You will see that instead of:
. .. with a view of giving such creditors a preference over the other creditors ...

it now provides:
. .. resulting in any person or any creditor or any
person in trust for such creditor or any surety or
guarantor for the debt due to such creditor obtaining a preference, advantage . . .

Under the new bill it will be a fraudulent
preference if within three months an insolvent person makes a transfer which results
in giving any person an advantage or preference over other creditors.

There are other sections to which I should
like to direct the attention of honourable
senators, because they introduce into the
bankruptcy law what I regard as new ideas.
The first deals with the disclosure that a
debtor must make after he has been put in
bankruptcy. If honourable senators look at
the bottom of page 73 they will see that
provision is made for the duties of the bankrupt. Section 117, paragraph (f), reads as
follows:
The bankrupt shall make disclosure to the trustee
of all property disposed of within one year preceding
his bankruptcy, or for such further antecedent
period as the court may direct, and how and to
whom and for what consideration any part thereof
was disposed of except such part as had been
disposed of in the ordinary manner of trade or
used for reasonable personal expenses.

That is completely new, because under the
existing Act no duty is imposed on the bankrupt to disclose prior alienations. It may be,
honourable senators, that in committee you
will argue that too much searching and
inquiring is made into the affairs of a person
who, unfortunately, has become bankrupt.
New bankruptcy offences have been
created, and are to be found in section 156,
page 94. This section struck me as being
rather novel, but apparently it derives from
the English Act. Paragraph (g) deals with
bankruptcy offences for which a bankrupt
may be prosecuted. It provides:
Any bankrupt who has within the two years preceding his bankruptcy materially contributed to or
increased the extent of his insolvency by gambling
or by rash or hazardous speculations not connected
with his trade or business, in determining which the
financial position of the bankrupt at the time when
such events occurred shall be taken into consideration...

That is pretty wide and sweeping, and is a
kind of paternalism that I do not know that
I am prepared to follow.
Hon. Mr. Léger: Perhaps it - will affect
some card players.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. It will cover poker
games for high stakes, betting on the races,
and all that sort of thing. If a person becomes
bankrupt lie had better look to it that his

previous life, so far as any betting was
concerned, was a model one.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Bingo games might be
interfered with.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I think they definitely would be on the black list. Section 156
says:
Any bankrupt who
(g) has within the two years preceding his bankruptcy materially contributed to or increased the
extent of his insolvency by gambling or by rash or
hazardous speculations not connected with his trade
or business . . . is guilty of an offence and is liable
on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term
not exceeding one year or on conviction under indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
three years.

That is a rather severe penal clause.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Who is responsible for
that clause?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, it is in the English
Act, and apparently it was decided to try it
out in Canada. Frankly, if I may express my
personal view, as I have always felt I have
the right to do, I do not think that clause
belongs in the bill. However, that is for this
house to say.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does that apply to bridge
losses too?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, some of the bidding that I have observed in bridge games
would certainly come under the heading of
"rash or hazardous speculations".
I pass on. The bill provides for many
material changes in the Act: some of them are
merely clarifications and others are decided
improvements. I do not propose to go into a
detailed discussion of them this afternoon.
I should point out that one of the improvements is in the part of the bill dealing with
the proposals that a bankrupt or insolvent
person may make. The present law makes
no provision whereby a person approaching
the stage of insolvency may submit a proposal
to his creditors. Even if he does get his
creditors together and, apart from the Bankruptcy Act, make a deal with them, his default
on a proposal to compose his obligations is not
an act of bankruptcy. The present bill provides procedure for the making of proposals.
if an insolvent person follows that procedure
and afterwards makes default in living up to
the proposal, that in itself becomes an act of
bankruptcy. One difficulty under the present
statute is that while an insolvent person is
trying to work out a proposal, the period during which it is necessary to have an act of
bankruptcy in order to file a petition has gone
by, and that works to the detriment of the
creditors.
The bill also contains an automatic procedure for the discharge of the bankrupt.

SENATE
Apparently the last person thought of under
the present Act is the bankrupt himself. The
trustee goes ahead and liquidates the estate,
collects the accounts, pays off the claims, gets
his remuneration and is discharged; but the
poor bankrupt is left in the air. Now a
simplified automatic procedure for the discharge of the bankrupt is provided in order
to enable him to get rid of his difficulties and
problems and come out of the bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is a bankrupt's household
furniture subject to seizure?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Provincial law provides
certain exemptions for debtors. You cannot
take a man's last stick of furniture.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: And a house up to $4,000
is exempted.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I briefly touch on
a few other provisions in the bill! Some of
them make changes aimed at greater clarity
and better administration. These deal with
such matters as proceedings at meetings of
creditors, and the duties of inspectors, who
are required to exercise greater care and
responsibility than hitherto. The bill makes
all claims provable in bankruptcy. There is
a simplified procedure for administration of
what might be called small estates; that is
where the total realizable value of the estate
after the secured creditors have been paid
does not amount to more than $500.
The Supreme Court of Newfoundland is
included among the courts that are specifically
given bankruptcy jurisdiction. Then the
powers of the registrars have been expanded
and clarified. The bill also provides that
there shall be no appeal as of right from a
decision of the bankruptcy judge, but that an
appeal may be taken only by leave of the
court to which one proposes to appeal. The
provisions with respect to legal costs have
been revised, and I would say that in some
small measure recognition has been given to
the fact that we are living in 1949 and not
in 1924 or 1930.
I have already referred to the bankruptcy
offences. They have been revised, greatly
condensed and clarified, so that it is much
easier to follow the series of bankruptcy
offences under the bill than under the
present act.
All the provisions of the Act are made
applicable to the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will you be able to put
the Crown in bankruptcy now?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. I should think there
would be some difficulty in doing that, because
the Crown can always pay its debts. My
honourable friend and I, in common with
every other citizen of Canada, have to provide the funds to support the crown.

Hon. Mr. Kinley: Can Crown companies be
put into bankruptcy?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Crown companies that
are incorporated are of course treated in the
same manner as any other companies, in so
far as bankruptcy legislation is concerned.
As to special emanations of the Crown, I
certainly am not going to get into a discussion
on their position, because it is difficult to
reconcile some of the court decisions and my
own thinking on the question is not clear.
They do present a problem.
May I make this general statement with
respect to the bill? I think it is putting it
mildly to say that it represents a very considerable improvement over the present Act.
That Act was passed in 1919, and prior to
1932 there were various amendments, but
there have been none since then. In the
course of the years experience has been
gained in the administration of the Act, and
practical difficulties have been noted. These
experiences and difficulties are reflected in
the bill that is now before us-in its general
scheme, in its language, and in its provisions
with respect to various officials, to the obligations of debtors, the priorities of creditors
and the bankruptcy offences. They have all
been correlated in a way that makes it easy
to get an understanding and an appreciation
of the Act. I would say that it has been done
with considerable thoughtfulness, requiring a
great deal of research of the bankruptcy laws
of the United States, Great Britain and some
other countries. Those foreign statutes have
been consulted and, where practicable, provisions have been adopted. One can definitely
say that this proposed legislation marks a
change for the better in bankruptcy law.
Before concluding, I should like to compliment those who worked on the bill, and
to sound a note of praise for the Senate
committee on Banking and Commerce which
sat so diligently in 1946 and heard representations from trustees, solicitors with wide
practice in bankruptcy, and judges and registrars of the bankruptcy courts in various
These witnesses related their

experiences and voiced their objections to the
existing Act and to the bill which was proposed at that time, which provided for great
centralization of authority in the superintendent's office at Ottawa. All that information has been studied, and this bill is the
result. The legislation is timely and marks a
forward step. I am not claiming that it is
perfect or that we will not make further
changes in committee; but in the main it is
evidence of our moving ahead as far as possible to more simplified procedure in dealing
with bankruptcy matters.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

FEBRUARY 17, 1949
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Would my friend care to
say a word with respect to the relation of this
bill which will be a federal statute-presumably under authority of trade and commerce
-to provincial laws dealing with the same
subject?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That would of course
take us into a larger field. Bankruptcy is a
subject matter which comes exclusively under
federal authority.
Hon. Mr. Léger: I think the honourable
senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) is referring to the question of the
indebtedness of $500 or less, which is exempt
from the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have said that when
an act of bankruptcy takes place, and the
creditors get together and launch a petition
for a receiving order, the total indebtedness
to the petitioning creditor, or creditors, must
amount to at least $1,000. Under the present
Act it is $500.
Hon. Mr. Leger: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If I followed the remarks
of my friend from Toronto, I take it that
when certain provisions are made in the
Bankruptcy Act the provinces can do nothing to vary them. However, under property
and civil rights they can do a good deal that
would seem to relate to this subject.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is getting into the
constitutional aspect, but may I speak for a
moment on the point?
Section 91 of the British North America
Act enumerates specific matters which are
under the exclusive authority of the federal
parliament. Bankruptcy is one of them. In
Section 92 there are various items set out
which come under the authority of the provinces. One has only to refer to these sections
to know in which category the subject
belongs. Section 91 certainly gives exclusive
authority to the federal government over
bankruptcy, and if the dominion does not see
fit to allow the provinces to establish their
own classes of priority, they have no right
to do so.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: What if the question were
lef t open?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then the federal authority would have to provide permissive legislatian, as in the present Bankruptcy Act,
enabling the federal parliament or any provincial legislature to enact legislation to
establish classes of priorities that are not
given in the current Bankruptcy Act. However, in the new bill that right has been taken
away, so that the provinces cannot establish
their own priorities.
29091-10

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I say only a few words? I have long
thought that the Bankruptcy Act could be
improved. I have not studied this bill sufficiently to know whether or not it is the
answer, but I may say that it has been of
great advantage to listen to the explanation
of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden). I rise at this time to express
my appreciation to him for the clarity with
which he has explained this proposed legislation.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the second reading of
Bill N, an Act respecting Bankruptcy. Is it
your pleasure to concur in the second reading
of this bill?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed'to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. A. McDonald moved the second
reading of Bill M, an Act respecting the
Dominion Atlantic Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Dominion Atlantic Railway Company was incorporated by the federal parliament in 1895,
and since then it has been in continuous
operation. In 1912 it was leased to the Canadian Pacific Railway on a 999 year lease.
The railway extends from Yarmouth
through Digby and Annapolis-the famous
Evangeline land-to Windsor Junction; it has
running rights over the Canadian National
Railways line from Windsor Junction to
Halifax, and operates branches from Windsor
to Truro, Kentville to Kingsport and Weston
to Soulnierville. It also has an up-to-date
passenger and freight steamship service from
Digby to Saint John. The railway operates
an excellent summer hotel at Yarmouth,
another at Digby, and the Cornwallis Inn, a
year-round hotel at Kentville.
The present bill is for the purpose of rearranging to some extent the internal management of the company. It seeks to make
three amendments to chapter 101 of the
statutes of 1908. The first amendment will
change section 7 of that Act so as to allow a
maximum of ten directors instead of five.

SENATE

This is asked for because it was found desirable to have on the directorate representatives
of the people who live in the area in which
the railway runs, and who naturally are
interested in the success of its operations.
The bill proposes to repeal section 8 of the
Act of 1908, which provided that three directors would hold office for one year and
would retire in rotation. It has been found
that the compulsory retirement of directors as
required by this section of the Act has not
proved to be in the best interests of the
company. With the repeal of section 8, the
directors' term of office will be regulated by
the general provisions of the Railway Act in
that regard, section 114 of which is as
follows:
The directors appointed at the last election, or
those appointed in their stead in case of vacancy,
shall remain in office until their successors are
appointed.

The third and last amendment contained in
this bill would repeal section 9 of the Act
of 1908, and change the date of the annual
meeting from the second Friday in October
to the second Tuesday in April. As the company's financial year ends with the calendar
year on December 31, it has been found impractical and not good business practice to
have the annual meeting deferred until so
late a date as the second Friday in October.
It is felt, therefore, that the company should
be empowered to hold its annual meeting in
the month of April, at which time reports of
the previous year's activities will be submitted.
I suggest that, if second reading is given to
this bill, it be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

APPENDIX

TERMS OF UNION OF NEWFOUNDLAND WITH CANADA
Memorandum of Agreement Entered into on the Eleventh Day of December, 1948,
between Canada and Newfoundland.
Whereas a delegation appointed from its
members by the National Convention of Newfoundland, a body elected by the people of
Newfoundland, consulted in 1947 with the
Government of Canada to ascertain what fair
and equitable basis might exist for the union
of Newfoundland with Canada;
Whereas, following discussions with the
delegation, the Government of Canada sent
te His Excellency the Governor of Newfoundland for submission to the National Convention a statement of terms which the
Government of Canada would be prepared to
recommend to the Parliament of Canada as a
fair and equitable basis for union, should the
people of Newfoundland desire to enter into
confederation;
Whereas the proposed terms were debated
in the National Convention in Newfoundland
and were before the people of Newfoundland
when, by a majority at a referendum held on
the twenty-second day of July, 1948, they
expressed their desire to enter into confederation with Canada;
Whereas the Governments of the United
Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland agreed
after the referendum that representatives of
Canada and Newfoundland should meet and
settle the final terms and arrangements for
the union of Newfoundland with Canada;
And whereas authorized representatives of
Canada and authorized representatives of
Newfoundland have settled the terms hereinafter set forth as the Terms of Union of
Newfoundland with Canada;
It is therefore agreed as follows:
TERMS OF UNION

of these Terms (hereinafter referred to as
the date of Union), Newfoundland shall form

comprise the same territory as at the date of
Union, that is to say, the island of Newfoundland and the islands adjacent thereto, the

delivered by the Judicial Committee of His
Majesty's Privy Council on the first day of
March, 1927, and approved by His Majesty
in His Privy Council on the tweny-second day
of March, 1927, and the islands adjacent to
the said Coast of Labrador.
Application of the British North America
Acts
3. The British North America Acts, 1867 to
1946, shall apply to the Province of Newfoundland in the same way, and to the like
extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in Canada, as if the Province

varied by these Terms and except such provisions as are in terms made or by reasonable
intendment may be held to be specially
applicable to or only to affect one or more
and not all of the provinces originally united.

4. The Province of Newfoundland shall be
entitled to be represented in the Senate by
six members, and in the House of Commons
by seven members out of a total membership

that may be required by the Government of
the Province of Newfoundland to enable it
to continue public services at the levels and

and operating a master index which contains
information on nearly three million people.
To date, 63,000 cases have been satisfactorily
solved. Though the International Tracing
Service does not issue death certificates, it
often can provide enough documentary evidence to enable European courts or governments to make decisions regarding wills,
inheritance of property and other matters.
The present situation in China is causing
great concern, and relatives in Canada of
refugees in China are anxiously inquiring
whether something can be done to expedite
the movement of these refugees to Canada.
The United States has offered temporary
asylum on the small island of Samar in the
Philippine group, to 6,000 persons now in
Shanghai, and for another 6,000, also from
Shanghai, who will occupy the former United
States Navy Base of Guicean. Preference
will naturally be given to those holding visas
for immigration into other countries. It is
for visas that the relatives in Canada plead.
The senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) recently visited displaced persons camps in Europe and may therefore
speak with more knowledge and authority on
the situation than I can. My information is
that there is still available a great reservoir of
skilled labour of all kinds which anxiously
awaits emigration; and in addition, there are
63,000 agricultural workers, who are sadly
needed in Canada. Entry for the professional
classes has been more difficult, and many
have already come to work in our woods,
in our mines, and on farms. Recently, the
Department of Labour admitted a limited
number of family groups for placement in
rural areas and in small centres. Your committee has always advocated that greater
attention should be given to the admission
of family groups. The preference has been
for single men and women.
In the camps operated by the International
Refugee Organization, effort is now being
intensified in the teaching of languages, particularly English, to would-be emigrants. The
linguaphone method of instruction, which
involves the use of phonograph records, is
employed, and the 1,000 sets in use permit
60,000 persons to study various languages at
the same time. In addition, there are 500
language teachers at work in the three zones
of Germany, instructing regular language
classes. Our Immigration Department has
forwarded copies of the small book This is
Canada, and other material, in order that
those coming here may have some knowledge
of the country before their arrival.
The Minister of Mines and Resources has
given the information that during 1948 a
total of 125,414 immigrants entered Canada.
This is the largest total for any year since

1929, and is almost exactly double that of
1947, when the figure was 64,127. Of the
1948 total, 46,057 came from the British Isles,
7,381 from the United States and 16,957 from
northern European races, including 10,169
Dutch. Other races contributed 55,019 new
Canadians, the largest individual groups being
13,799 Poles and 10,011 Ukrainians.
I should like to place on the record the
information with respect to the disposition of
the immigrants by provinces. It is as follows:

The movement of immigrants to Canada
during 1948 was facilitated by an arrangement made with the Cunard White Star line
by which the Aquitania continued to operate
on the north Atlantic run, and provided over
12,000 priority berths for immigrants. This
arrangement was expanded to cover 15,400
priorities, and will be continued throughout
the year 1949. The government also assisted
in the conversion of a German prize vessel,
now known as the Beaverbrae, which is
engaged in carrying to this country from
continental Europe close relatives of persons
resident in Canada. Finally, the government
has arranged with Trans-Canada Air Lines
for 10,000 air passages to be made available
to immigrants from the United Kingdom
between the lst of July, 1948, and the 31st
of March, 1949.
During the year immigration offices were
opened or reopened in Glasgow, Liverpool
and Rome.

On Wednesday morning the press carried
a report from Lake Success that, according
to information furnished by I.R.O., Canada
stands third in the list of countries receiving
war refugees during the past eighteen months.
Great Britain heads the list, with Israel
second, France fourth and Belgium fifth. But
despite all that has been done, the figures as
furnished in January are larger than in
August, and show that 715,090 men, women
and children are being cared for by the
International Refugee Organization.

subject. I am glad to know that it is the
committee's intention to continue this work

SENATE
neither of them is in the chamber, and I
particularly regret the absence of the
seconder, the honourable senator from Clare
(Hon. Mr. Comeau), whose references to his
ancestors and their struggles in the early
days of this country I found very pleasing
and interesting.
The address of the honourable senator
from Algoma (Hon. Mr. Farquhar), who
moved the resolution, was of a more political
nature; but as be recently came here from
the other chamber, one can sympathize with
him.
As I listened to these speeches, with their
words of praise for the socialist measures we
are getting from the government, I wondered,
were it possible to return to this chamber
seventy years hence, what type of men one
would see and what kind of stories they
would have to tell. No doubt they would be
forced to admit that they had been raised
with the aid of baby bonuses, that they had
been ordered about by the state and denied
freedom of choice-and, if they were farmers,
that they had had their grain taken from
them and given away. What type of men will
they be?
The leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) was kind enough to apologize for
his absence. He said he did not know that I
intended to speak, and he had other appointments. I regret that he is not here, because
I did not like the way be reacted to the
western farmers' complaints about the low
price of their wheat. He was tired, he said,
of hearing people asking for more-moremore. Well, I remember that a year or two
ago, in this chamber, I was opposed to a
couple of honourable gentlemen getting a
little "more", and I gained no popularity by
doing so.
I cannot accept the honourable senator's
assurance that everything in this country is
going splendidly, that there is more money
than ever, and we have no cause for alarm.
I am thinking of a class of people who
deserve more credit than they have received.
The honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) knows well what people
I mean: men who started in Western Canada,
most of them without any money; who
worked hard, saved enough to buy lumber
and proceeded to make a home; and who
carried on against all kinds of difficulties and
raised their families without help from anyone. Surely after all these years they are
entitled to some comforts and, to the belief
that they have made some progress. But
what is their present position? I say to the
leader of the government that, in my opinion,
conditions are worse than they have ever
been. Mere money is not wealth. Money bas

never created character, and never will. In
the days when parents had to struggle along
without state aid, did we hear of groups of
boys and girls who-some in Vancouver,
some in Toronto-became young bandits?
I should like to read from the Ottawa
Journal an article dealing with a speech
delivered in Pembroke, Ontario.
Warning that communism was surely growing
stronger in Canada, Mrs. Katherine Doherty, of
Combermere, the former Baroness de Hueck, Monday night told a meeting of the Business and Professional Women's Club "the only way we can fight
communism is to fight for an ideal, and our common
ground in Canada is that we believe in the Almighty
-the Communist does not".
Mrs. Doherty was addressing an international night
supper meeting of the club at the Copeland Hotel
attended by some thirty new Canadian girls, representative of Lithuania, Poland, Estonia and the
Ukraine.
"Neither an atomic bomb-nor fighting on the
levels of old wars will eliminate communism," she
said.
"The shadow of communism will grow, it is growing, and it's almost too late," the speaker said. "But
let us face the fact that we still can light the world
if we stop thinking of money as our god, and change
our conception of other people on the wrong side
of the track.
"You Christians preach, but you don't make your
preaching a reality; the Communists do".
Speaking to the group of new Canadians in
Russian for a moment, Mrs. Doherty referred to
their common bond, of their sufferings and apprehensions, and exhorted them not to be alarmed or
puzzled about Canadian customs.
Reverting to
English, she urged kindness and love toward these
new Canadians by the people of Canada.

Surely communism is on the increase. I
claim that the morale of the people is at low
ebb instead of high tide, and this is mainly
responsible for our paternalistic government
bonuses and socialism. A year ago the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) made the best Conservative speech I have heard in this chamber. He
wound up by saying that we could not exist
half bound and half free. That is about what
we have been trying to do. A year ago the
senior senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
Farris) went to great pains to introduce a certain motion so that he could discuss the
wickedness of attacks on public men. As I
see it, be did so because he saw a figure looming on the horizon whom he wanted to take
a crack at. It is well known that all over
Europe people have been shot for criticizing
men in power. I am certainly one to uphold
our judges when they are sitting as such, but
when a man is appointed to the bench he does
not join any ethereal body. My honourable
friend went on to say what a great crime it
was that unfair criticism should be made of
public men. I endorse that, and now that
new citizens are coming to Canada I want to
tell the Senate how obnoxious that kind of
thing can be when it is unjust and untrue.

FEBRUARY 18, 1949
Before I went to Western Canada as a
young man I had never cast a vote. To my
knowledge, my father had voted both ways,
as I think any good citizen should if democracy is to survive. I settled in a community
where only a few of the inhabitants were
Canadian-born. Most of them were Russians,
Ukrainians and so on, and had only recently
arrived from Europe. When they met me
they would take off their hats and start to
bow. They had been used to kow-towing to
every policeman and semi-official person in
their own countries, and as a result they
entertained a certain fear. I took great pride
in explaining our politics to them. But when
the election came what did I find? People
from Winnipeg and elsewhere were telling
them that the Liberals had brought them
into the country and that the Conservative
party, which was the King's party, would
chase them right out again. As a result, these
people were in real terror. Well, that turned
me against the Liberals, and I have voted
Conservative ever since. I tell my honourable friends opposite that that is the most
vicious kind of political campaigning.
Perhaps the only speech in which I ever
won converts to my party was made about
that time in the town of Krydor. A very
famous politician, known to many of you, had
been the Liberal member for that constituency for a long time. I heard that there was
to be a meeting, and after I finished my work
I got in the car and drove down to the hall.
I was still dressed in my overalls-and I even
think that one strap was hanging loose from
the shoulder. The hall was full, so I stood
at the door. I interrupted the speakers a
couple of times with the remark "That's not
true!" One speaker said to me: "If you don't
interrupt, we will give you the floor for half
an hour before the next speaker". So after
he finished I marched up to the front. They
were repeating the same thing their party had
been saying all over,-that the Conservative
party would put them out of the country.
They told these people that the reason they
had been spared was that the member for the
constituency was a Liberal. I was a bit
angry at this. I knew every one of the men
attending the meeting, although perhaps not
by name, and I looked directly at them and
said: "Gentlemen, I don't know this Conservative candidate, and I have never met
him -

-

"

Hon. Mr. Copp: Will my honourable friend
tell me in what year this campaign was carried on?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I believe it was around
1920.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Was it a federal election?

Hon. Mr. Horner: It was a provincial election. I told them that they were in a free
country in Canada and that they had been
throwing away their votes. I advised them
not to do it any longer, because things would
go on just the same if the other candidate
were elected. Well, the Liberal candidate was
defeated.
Honourable senators, I speak for the farmers of Canada, particularly of Saskatchewan,
which is the greatest agricultural province
in the country. I only regret I am not better
qualified to speak for them.
I do not think our practical farmers can
be very proud of the legal representation
they have in this chamber. When the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) proceeded to make what I suppose he
thought was a brilliant attack on the lady
senator from Peterborough, who was absent
from the chamber through illness, he misinterpreted what she had said. The honourable
lady apparently realized that her words were
burning rather deeply and anticipated some
such criticism, for she said, as appears on
page 52 of Hansard:
I hope that when I have finished, nobody will rise
to read me a lecture, such as was read in another
place, on the theme that "man shall not live by
bread alone", and on the necessity of enriching and
encouraging the cultural and educational life of this
country; because, as I said-in the beginning, with all
these objectives I am in complete accord, and would
support anything within reason which would achieve
them. But I do not consider that this proposal is
within reason.
Honourable senators, what is parliament for? For
what do we or the members of the other place,
receive our indemnities from the people of this
country?

Now, I intend to say something as to what
I think our duties are. If this chamber is to
be a mere political arena, then I agree with
what was said by a clergyman in the other
chamber, that we should go to Hull-or a
worse place than that. I respect the leader
of this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the
former leader (Hon. Mr. King) for telling us
that senators should express their own ideas.
We took a solemn oath to do that and to
advise the government, not to continue to
praise the political party that sent us here.
I may be in a rather more fortunate position
than the honourable senator from Vancouver
South, in that I have no worries about the
ability of my leader to speak for himself or
to advertise himself throughout Canada. But
I think the honourable senator from Vancouver South is unduly worried, because there
are members of the other house who are well
qualified to take care of the political
situation.
The honourable gentleman suggested that
there should be compulsory voting. Well, I
have favoured that policy for thirty years.
He also said he would like to see the single

SENATE
transferable vote. I am not in favour of that.
It has been tried in several countries, and if
the honourable senator would like to get some
information on it from a man who, I think,
bas made a real study of the question, he
should call on Mr. John R. MacNicol, an
honourable member of another place. You
can have a man elected on a minority vote
under that system.
Though I am in favour of compulsory voting, I would ask honourable members to consider for a moment what kind of results the
transferable vote might have. If a bitter
partisan like the honourable senator from
Vancouver South were placed second and I
were forced to vote for him, that would be
cruelty.
Hon. Mr. Farris: To me?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It would be a different
matter altogether if I were forced to vote
for the honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan), for whenever he speaks
in this chamber he says something that I
agree with.
We are getting a lot of socialistic legislation these days. I wonder how many senators
take time to go around and admire this beautiful edifice, the parliament building. I am
thankful that Mr. Jacques Greber has not
suggested that the building be moved away
from its lovely setting. Well, the thought
occurs to me that if the present trend of
shorter and shorter working days continues,
it may be that in two or three thousand years
from now a muscleless generation will have
grown up who will gaze at this building as
we gaze at the pyramids in Egypt and wonder
how they were ever built. By that time there
will be no men capable of building a high
tower, for everybody will be afraid to venture more than a few feet above the ground;
neither will there be anybody strong enough
to handle heavy stones.
I suppose that when this building was
erected men used to work ten or twelve hours
a day. It would take a lifetime to put up a
building like it now, because ten men would
be required to do what one man did back
in those days, and each of the ten men would
have to be paid ten times the wages of those
days. From the money standpoint this building would be a pretty costly proposition nowadays, although I think the government should
print the money required for the erection of
public buildings.
This brings me to the public debt. When
is it going to be paid off? While we were
creating this debt, people bought bonds in the
belief that they were benefiting the country
and being good citizens. Now thousands of
them are out of employment. It is claimed
that there is a shortage of steel. Right here
in Ottawa there are thousands of carpenters

unemployed, as there are in Vancouver. These
men will have to sell their bonds. To whom?
To people who are able to buy them. We are
getting into the position where the people
who have the least will be paying to wealthy
people the interest on the national debt. If
it is a good thing for an individual to pay off
his mortgage, why would it not be a good
thing for a country to do that?
An Hon. Senalor: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: To my mind-Mark my
words! -as a result of this continued debt
and taxation we will have inflation or debt
cancellation or communism and a breaking
up of large estates. Our taxes are so high
now that a young man who has no parents
to assist him cannot afford to build a home
for himself. We are taxing people like that
right out of existence. Instead of being
engaged in the production of new wealthwhich is what we farmers out in Saskatchewan are doing-half of the population will
soon be working to supply funds to keep the
socialistic agencies going.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South also had something te say about the
wheat situation, and he read an editorial
from the Ottawa Citizen. I give him credit
for knowing that that editorial was ridiculous.
The Winnipeg Free Press is a better source of
information about wheat. Also, the American
farmers and the Canadian farmers on either
side of the long borderline from Winnipeg to
the Rocky Mountains know what the price of
wheat is. The man who prepared the Searle
Grain Company's report is ready to challenge
anyone in debate as to what the western
farmers have lost on the sale of their wheat.
Why, a farmer in Prince Edward Island can
buy feed at 15 cents a bushel less than I can
get it right out where it is produced. The
western farmers lost at least $580 million on
the wheat supplied under the agreement with
Great Britain. But that is not all. In 1937
Dr. Motherwell, a well known Liberal, told
the government in no uncertain terms what
it had done with the Wheat Board. When I
returned home from this chamber that year
the board was giving away our wheat at 70
cents a bushel. It boasted of selling 70 million
bushels at that price, and two months afterwards the price was $1.54. So millions of
dollars were taken from us back in 1937.
To correct what may be a false impression
on the part of honourable senators as to the
bonus payment situation, I would point out
that we have a system whereby one per cent
of all our receipts from the sale of wheat is
applied to set up a reserve for the assistance
of farmers in communities where the yield is
very low. For instance, where the yield is
less than 8 bushels to the acre there is a

FEBRUARY 18, 1949
bonus payment of $1 per acre and where
the yield is less than 5 bushels to the acre
the bonus is higher. But many farmers who
have got assistance in this way have had to
pay it back in income tax, although part of
the bonus that they received may have been
their own money. When the Minister of
Agriculture was out in Saskatchewan on an
election campaign he did what I think was a
very unwise thing. He told the farmers not
to make out income tax returns, that it was
only the bad Tories who would report them
for not doing so, and that no attention should
be paid to them. But despite this, 55,000
returns were filed by farmers in Saskatchewan-a larger number than was filed by
the farmers of any other province. I advised
them to make out income tax returns, because
if they do not pay a tax while they are living
the money will be taken out of their estates
when they die.
We in Saskatchewan are in a much worse
position with respect to freight rates than is
either Manitoba or Alberta. The suggestion
was made to us that Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba should pay the Hudson Bay
freight rates. We pay high freight rates on
goods going both east and west.
I should like to refer to what the leader of
the government in this house said about
keeping the price of lumber down. The
honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr.
Jones) was laughing about it, because the
so-called price control did not hurt him. Why
do houses cost so much? Here is one reason:
I bought some lumber recently for $80 a
thousand, which could not have been sold
some years ago for more than $8. There was
not a decent board in the whole lot. Then
what about keeping the price of nails down?
The farmer paid as high as 12 cents a pound
for them; and cement in some cases sold for
$3 a bag. And what about the extremely
high price of barbed wire, which would
stretch four feet in a half mile, every month?
Another item is the mowing machine. I
bought a machine a few years ago for $45 or
$50, and last year I paid $175 for one. That
is the kind of money the farmer is required
to spend.
Much has been said about the proposed
royal commission on transportation. I would
point out that no one is better qualified than
the members of the Senate, who have done a
great deal of travelling and shipping over
railways, to study the question of transportation. Yet the government insists on an
inquiry into railway matters. Such a commission just means delay and expense, and it
will do work which I claim the members of
this Chamber should do. In this connection
I should like to refer to an article concerning
railways in the United States, published

recently in the Time magazine. It is under
the heading "Too Much Candy", and reads
as follows:
Like a doting grandfather who has fed the youngsters too much candy, the Interstate Commerce
Commission was getting alarmed at its own generosity te U.S. railroads. Since war's end, it had given
them six freight-rate boosts. Yet freight revenues
were declining; in the first half of January, carloadings were 11-2 per cent below last year. Last
week, in its annual report to Congress, ICC guessed
why. It thought that railroads might be pricing
themselves out of business.
Because of higher rates, the railroads were losing
more and more business to trucks, which were hauling 12 per cent more than a year ago, and barges,
which were carrying 20 per cent more. "Rate increases", said ICC, "may be carried to the point
where they are largely self-defeating". As an example, it cited the fact that while the Railway
Express Agency, Inc., got three increases totalling
46 per cent last year, its revenue decreased 4 per
cent.
Instead of higher rates, said ICC, U.S. railroads
should step up efficiency and cut costs by "bold
experimentation with new devices and methods ...
imagination and ingenuity . . ."
The advice was easy to give, but harder to follow.
U.S. railroads, which last year spent $279,400,000 on
dieselization and this year will spend as much more,
had already gone a long way toward improving
efficiency. But the diesels were more efficient partly
because they required less manpower-and the
unions did not like that. This week, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers served strike warnings against 15 western roads, to force them to
"featherbed" an extra engineer on diesels.
Furthermore, one of the biggest drops in car loadings had been in coal, which provides the biggest
single source of rallroad freight (14 per cent). Thus,
the more oil-burning diesels the roads bought, the
more they would cut their coal revenues.

Now, so far as Canada is concerned, I am
opposed to this "featherbedding", and other
things like running two roads parallel to one
another. Why is it that a government-owned
road and a private railway, running side by
side, must have their trains arrive at Winnipeg at the same hour? No consideration is
given to public convenience, and no attempt
is made to stagger the hours of arrival of
these trains. This is the kind of service the
people have to pay for, and we in Saskatchewan are particularly concerned about it.
Concerning the question of wheat, I believe
I can speak for the majority of farmers in
Saskatchewan. It is true that the farm leaders have adopted the same policies that are
being followed in other fields. For instance,
the wheat pool is just a farmers' organization, with one of its own members being
appointed president; but it is treason to say
anything against it. As for the U.F.A., I do
not think they would represent more than
fifteen per cent of the farmers. Certainly, I
am a member of the pool, but I never gave
them authority to endorse a system for giving
away my grain. So far as the Grain Exchange
is concerned, the people of western Canada

138

SENATE

are not opposed to it; it may be quite necessary for the purpose of carrying out domestic
and export selling, to have a futures market.
It would be all right if the farmer knew what
price he was going to get for his wheat in a
market which is actually controlled-I do not
mean a gambler's market, but rather a market
where the purchaser actually takes delivery
of the wheat. In my opinion we need a
futures market for hogs and cattle as well.
It should be pointed out that the farmer is
the only man who cannot go to the bank and
arrange his financing on the strength of an
assured market. For instance, the manufacturers are all organized, they know what their
goods will sell for, and they are often sold
before they are processed. The farmer is
entitled to operate on a similar basis; he
objects to others gambling with his wheat.
Huge sums of money may be used in the
operation of an international cartel or a
cornering of the market to work against him.
I do not think the farmers are against both
systems in the marketing of wheat. That
would apply to coarse grains as well.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Does my friend mean
by "both systems", a board and a grain
exchange?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, a board and a grain
exchange. The grain could be sold either
way.
Now may I speak about the opening of the
cattle market to the United States? The
honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw), who is always fair in his comments, said that 1948 would long be remembered as the year when the embargo against
our cattle entering the United States was
removed. He had previously pleaded with
the government for the removal of the
embargo, but he is now praising them for lifting it. While 1948 may be favourably remembered, the winter of 1947 will be recalled as
the winter when a great many cattle died
because of lack of feed, and when five or six
persons committed suicide because the government made the announcement in the fall
that we were short of American dollars.
The people on the prairie visit back and
forth across the boundary, and it is hard for
them to understand why a cattle-raiser on
one side of an imaginary line shall get $100
or $125 each for his cattle when the fellow on
the other side gets $400. As I said, my complaint is that the government did not come
out in the open and say, "The American
market will be closed until next summer".
Had that definite statement been made, the
ranchers would not have gone into the winter
with more cattle than they could feed. I
know one man who operates a ranch in my

community who lost 125 head of cattle. In
another area the ranchers who had shipped
their cattle to the Lethbridge feeding camp
sent a petition or a letter to the government
complaining that because of the high cost
of feed they were going to lose a lot of money.
They pointed out that costs had risen almost
80 per cent. Yet the Minister of Agriculture
made a speech quoting Fort William prices.
It has to be remembered that Fort William is
a thousand miles from the ranches, and the
cost of the freight to ship that grain back
makes a tremendous difference. I left Ottawa
in the last days of March and went straight
through to Calgary, as I had word from men
on the ranch that there was no more feed. I
could not buy oats for $1.25 a bushel around
Calgary, but I was asked to pay $100 a ton
for a sort of pressed cake made of alfalfa.
Hay was selling up to $75 a ton, and inferior
kinds, of no sustenance value, for $50. I was
fortunate in getting a carload from Saskatoon
at $60 a ton, not at the 70 cent figure quoted
by the minister. I know of several ranchers
who were in the same fix: where they were
able to get hay, it was only at a price much
higher than that stated by the minister.
My remarks, I admit, are somewhat disjointed, but I want to revert to and emphasize
the proposition that farming in Saskatchewan
is a perpetual gamble. In large areas of the
province there are reported to be 2,000 grasshoppers' eggs to the foot; there is no moisture
in the soil; and it is problematical whether we
shall have any crop in 1949. So far from
anticipating a surplus, I believe we may find
ourselves with very little grain. It is a
common experience out West that men work
away year after year and consider themselves
fortunate if they break even; then after ten
years they may get one or two bumper crops.
That is in general the condition prevailing
in Saskatchewan, over that great area of
agricultural land almost as large as that of
all the other provinces combined. We have
had to contend with grasshoppers, drought,
hailstorms and other plagues. So, as I have
said, the farmer is a great gambler; and while
I do not urge that we should take advantage
of the people who need our grain, it is my
contention that the whole country should help
to compensate the western farmers in some
degree for the reduced price. It must be
remembered, too, that the government of
Saskatchewan is socialistic, and therefore
willing, no doubt, to help a socialist government in England; but I may not feel so kindly
to British socialism. The other day Mr.
Winston Churchill, in describing a bill before
the Imperial Parliament, said "This is not a
bill, it is a plot, a burglar's jemmy to crack
the capitalistic crib." That may be the aim
of the British Government, but it is not ours;

STATUTE LAW AMENDMENT
(NEWFOUNDLAND) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill 12, an Act to amend the
Statute Law.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. Fogo) to explain this bill.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo: Honourable senators,
it is a privilege for me to comply with the
request of the honourable leader of the government to make a few explanatory remarks

on Bill 12, an Act to amend the Statute Law.
I appreciate the privilege all the more
because my name suggests to many people
that I am a native of Newfoundland. Though
I am not from Newfoundland, there are an
island and a bay in this new province which
bear my name. I am informed that the district is most beautiful, and I recommend that
visitors to Newfoundland see it. It contains
one of the oldest settlements in that ancient
colony; in 1738 it had a population of 215,
and is said to have been visited by Jacques
Cartier in 1534.
It is also a privilege to play a small part,
as all of you have done, in consummating
the union between Newfoundland and
Bills to approve the terms of
Canada.
union have been passed by the Parliament
of Canada, the Newfoundland Legislature and
the British House of Commons, and the plan
envisaged by the Fathers of Confederation
is rapidly being realized.
This bill, as its title indicates, is designed
to adapt the statute law of Canada to the
new province. Term 18 of the agreement
with Newfoundland provides not only for the
continuation after confederation of Newfoundland's provincial laws, but also that
all the laws of Canada shall in due course,
either by statute or by proclamation, become
effective as respects that province. This bill
will, if passed, become part of the general
law of Canada, which thus will be made
applicable to that province. However, certain
amendments to our statute law are required
to fil up gaps where no provision is made
to meet the fact of a tenth province.
I am not going to attempt to deal with
every one of the fifty statutes or sections of
statutes which are mentioned in this bill. To
do so would be a very lengthy and tedious
task. I intend merely to indicate some of the
highlights and, perhaps, group them a little,
for I believe that by so doing I shall be
adequately serving my function in this connection.
One example of the simple things which
are done under this Act is the designation
of courts for the purpose of various Acts: for
instance, the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, the Fugitive Offenders Act, the
Winding-up Act, the Juvenile Delinquents
Act, the Companies Act and the Companies
Creditors Arrangement Act. All of these
statutes indicate the courts which are to have
jurisdiction with respect to them. Various
sections, which I will not mention, but which
are indicated by headings, provide for these
courts.
Certain other amendments are consequential upon the terms of union, terms which
were arrived at by agreement and which
are embodied in this bill; others are conse-

MARCH 8, 1949
quential upon a certain memorandum, dated
December 11, 1948, in which answers to
questions raised by the Newfoundland delegation are set out. That memorandum will
be found at page 33 of Reports and Documents
relating to the negotiations for the Union
of Newfoundland and Canada. Examples of
the first group, namely amendments required
by the terms of union, may be found in
sections 6, 23, 26, 35 and 51; which relate
respectively to the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Unf air Competition Act-dealing
with trade marks-Newfoundland patents,
and the Judges Act, 1946. All these amendments carry out specific undertakings in the
terms of the union.
In the same category is an important group
of sections providing for the application of
the Canadian veterans charter to Newfoundland veterans. The legislation affected
includes the Pension Act, the Veterans Land
Act, the Veterans Insurance Act, the War
Services Grants Act, the Veterans Business
and Professional Loans Act and the War
Veterans Allowances Act. All these are
amended to provide for and carry out the
provisions of Term 38 of the Terms of Union,
which assure that Canada will make available to the veterans of Newfoundland benefits
under these statutes as if such veterans had
served in His Majesty's Canadian forces. In
that connection it may interest you to know
that there are about 7,000 Newfoundland
veterans of World War I, about 4,000 of whom
are now residing in the island. The total
number of Newfoundlanders enlisted in
World War II was approximately 8,500, practically all of whom, so far as we know, are
veterans. War pensions under Newfoundland
legislation are now being paid on behalf of
about 1,700 persons. These figures give some
conception of the magnitude of the obligation
undertaken in this particular field.
Section 47 is in a somewhat similar category. It brings under our Civilian War Pensions Act salt-water fishermen and Newfoundland merchant seamen who served on either
British or Allied ships employed in the prosecution of the war. Again, under a specific
term of the agreement, there is an addition
to the Canadian Citizenship Act. In section
46 we find the implementation of what I
believe is the shortest term of the agreement
with Newfoundland. It is term 43, and it
reads:
Suitable provision will be made for the extension
of the Canadian citizenship laws to the province of
Newfoundland.

reads "had Newfoundland domicile in Newfoundland on the said first day of April".
I think the words "in Newfoundland" are
redundant and have been carried into the
section in error. Further, it has been pointed
out to me that there is a word missing in
subsection 5 of the same section. At line 13,
page 20, the second "domicile" means domicile maintained in Newfoundland for at least
five years, and the word "maintained" should
be inserted.
Some of the amendments consequent upon
the memorandum of December 11 are contained in sections 9, 27, 33, 37 and 41. They
deal with such things as the Customs and
Fisheries Protection Act, the Fisheries Act,
the Canada Shipping Act, the Penitentiary
Act and the Family Allowances Act, 1944.
All these sections are designed to carry out
the undertakings of the Canadian government
contained in the memorandum to which I
have referred. Honourable members may be
interested to note that by the Customs and
Fisheries Protection Act, the sale of bait to
foreign fishing vessels will be continued in
Newfoundland ports, although the entry of
foreign vessels into Canadian territorial
waters except by special treaty or convention,
has been prohibited. Similarly, by the amendment to the Fisheries Act, Newfoundland
trawlers and draggers will be permitted, as in
the past, to fish to within three miles of the
coast, whereas the twelve-mile limit will
remain in effect elsewhere in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would that mean within
three miles of the coastal waters of Newfoundland, or of any part of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Within three miles of the
coastal waters of Newfoundland.
Another important part of the bill is section
13, which extends the benefits of the Maritime Freight Rates Act to Newfoundland.
This section carries out the Terms of Union,
particularly No. 32, which reads as follows:
32. (1) Canada will maintain in accordance with
the traffic offering a freight and passenger steamship service between North Sydney and Port aux
Basques, which, on completion of a motor highway
between Corner Brook and Port aux Basques, will
include suitable provision for the carriage of motor
vehicles.
(2) For the purpose of railway rate regulation
the Island of Newfoundland will be included in the
Maritime region of Canada, and through-trafflc
moving between North Sydney and Port aux
Basques will be treated as all-rail traffic.
(3) All legislation of the Parliament of Canada
providing for special rates on traffic moving within,
into, or out of, the Maritime region will, as far as
appropriate, be made applicable to the Island of
Newfoundland.

Section 46, which was amended slightly in
the other place, provides for the inclusion of

SENATE
Rae Duncan, legislation known as the Maritime Freight Rates Act was enacted to extend
to certain freight movements over territory
known as the Eastern Lines, a reduction of
20 per cent in the rates. This relief was confined to movements over lines which were
d'efined as including all railways and car
ferries in Canada east of a line passing
through the provincial boundary at Matapedia, Diamond Junction, and Levis. Three
movements of traffic benefit. The first movement is the purely local traffic within the
selected territory; that is, all-rail traffic
between any two points on the eastern linesfor example, from Sydney to Newcastle or
from Sydney to Fredericton. The second
movement is all-rail traffic moving outward,
westbound from points on the Eastern Lines
to points in Canada beyond Diamond Junction
or Levis. The reductions in this class of
traffic apply only to that part of the haul
which is over the Eastern Lines. The third
movement to benefit from this statute is
export traffic originating on the Eastern Lines
and passing through ocean ports on the
Eastern Lines and destined for points outside
of Canada. For example, in the case of traffic
from Fredericton to Liverpool, England, via
Saint John, the rate from Fredericton to Saint
John would be subject to reduction.
It will be noted too that for the purposes
of this Act the traffic moving by water from
Port aux Basques to North Sydney and
vice versa is to be treated as all-rail traffic.
So the effect of section 13 is to embody Newfoundland in the selected territory on the
Eastern Lines and to extend to Newfoundland the same relief as is accorded to points
and to shippers in the Maritime Provinces.
In fact, it might be said that this is one
instance of official recognition that Newfoundland is now one of the Maritime
provinces.
The other section to which it might be
appropriate for me to make reference is the
last section but one of the bill. It is a rather
unusual section in that it provides against
the importation of certain things from Newfoundland to the rest of Canada for a period
of twelve months, beginning April 1, 1949.
The object of this section is to prevent
evasion of the Emergency Exchange Conservation Act-that unpleasant statute which
imposes restrictions on imports, and which
we hope it will not be necessary to keep in
force too long. Nevertheless, in order to
protect our merchants and dealers in Canada
from the possibility that persons in Newfoundland might accumulate large quantities of automobiles and the like and ship
them into other provinces after the union,
this section was suggested and, I understand, was quite acceptable to the New-

foundland delegation. It was also brought
to my attention, and I think it was stated in
Hansard, that notice of the intention to have
this restriction enacted was given to the
public on December 13, 1948. I am informed
that the twelve-months period was provided
for in this section because it was necessary
to have some time limit. As I have said, if
the
restrictions
under the Emergency
Exchange Conservation Act are sooner
removed, this section will then cease to be
effective.
It is unnecessary for me to add that by its
very nature this is a bill which I feel sure
the members of this honourable Senate will
support.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, I rise to ask two questions, for
information only. My honourable friend who
so ably explained this bill mentioned that it
was endorsed by the House of Commons in
Great Britain. My recollection of the procedure that was followed in 1946, when we
sent over a constitutional amendment, is that
a resolution was introduced by Viscount
Addison in the House of Lords, which
approved of it and sent it to the House of
Commons. I am wondering if the two houses
there have concurred in the Address that
was sent over from our parliament in this
instance.
Secondly, I would ask the honourable
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) if he is yet in receipt of a record of the
proceedings of both houses with reference
to certain constitutional questions that were
raised there affecting this issue.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Honourable senators, as to
the first question my information is that the
bill was introduced in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and passed, and
that it may now have reached the House of
Lords, but that it has not yet been passed
there.
I am not in a position to answer the
second question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In reply to the right
honourable gentleman's second question, I
may say that I have no knowledge that the
report of the proceedings has been received
here. However, I shall make inquiries, and
if the report is available I shall undertake
to secure it for my right honourable friend.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: May I ask the honourable leader of the government if it is necessary to have this bill passed in a hurry? The
bill is a fairly comprehensive one, and
although I followed the debate on it in the

MARCH 8. 1949
other chamber I am uncertain about a number of points. For that reason I think that
there should be a reference to committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In answer to my honourable friend's specific question I can say
that there is no great urgency about having
this bill passed, other than that it must of
course be done before the end of this month.
I am quite agreeable to my honourable friend
moving the adjournment of the debate; but
if the bill should receive second reading
tonight I would suggest that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, where officials could be present
to give us further information. I shal be
glad to accept whichever course my honourable friend prefers.

29091-11j

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Unless someone else
wishes to speak, I am quite prepared to agree
that the bill go to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Then, if the motion
for second reading is passed, I shal move for
reference to committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

NEWFOUNDLAND-CANADA
UNION BILL
INQUIRY

On the orders of the day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
last evening the right honourable gentleman
from Vancouver Centre (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) asked me whether I had received a
report of the discussion in the Parliament of
the United Kingdom as to the constitutional
issues raised by the Newfoundland-Canada
Union Bill. I am advised that during the
second reading of the bill Mr. A. P. Herbert
made a motion relating to the constitutional
issues involved. Some discussion followed,
and Mr. Herbert gave notice that he would
raise those issues when the bill was considered in committee. For the information of
my friend and other honourable senators, I
would say that the Department of External
Affairs receives the official report of the
debates. I do not know that the supply is
unlimited, but I am advised that a reasonable
number of copies can be secured from that
department as they arrive. I presume there
is some slight delay in transmitting the copies.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Thank you.
NATIONAL PARKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill 0-2, an Act to amend The
National Parks Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Calgary to
explain this bill.

Hon. George Henry Ross: Honourable
senators, the southern half of the province of
Alberta, particularly the city of Calgary and
the surrounding country, is badly in need of
power for industrial and domestic purposes.
The Calgary Power Company is now supplying power, but cannot for long meet the
demands made upon it unless the resources
of Spray Lakes can be developed. The
power company has made a deal with the
province of Alberta, whereby it will develop
this area if the province can effect a change
in the boundaries of the Banff National Park
to exclude 21-2 square miles which are
necessary to carry out the development.
The purpose of this bill is to exclude this
acreage from the park, and to turn it over to
the province. The power company will then
develop the project under its agreement with
the province. I understand that when this
bill has been given a second reading, the
leader of the government intends to move
that it be referred to one of the standing
committees.
The Calgary Power Company, which
supplies power to the city of Calgary, is now
developing 110,000 horsepower from the Bow
River and its tributaries; it also receives some
steam-produced power from Edmonton. From
the Spray Lakes project the company would
develop an additional 90,000 horsepower.
Unless further power is developed in the
very near future, Calgary is bound to experience a serious shortage of power. During
the last week in February there was trouble
with the power plant in Edmonton, so that
the company did not receive its full quota
from that source, with the result that the
ammonia plant in Calgary, which is the
largest producer of any commodity in the
province of Alberta, received only 75 per cent
of its requirements. In the same period the
cement plant at Exshaw could obtain only
50 per cent of its requirements. A shut-down
of the Exshaw plant, even for an hour, is a
serious matter at this time when cement is
so urgently needed for building and other purposes. In Calgary since the end of the war,
new demands have increased the power load
by approximately 9 per cent each year. If
this rate of increase continues, the power
company cannot hope to supply industrial
requirements and domestic needs without the
development of additional reserves.
When the natural resources were transferred to the province, it was agreed between
the federal and provincial governments that
certain areas of substantial commercial value
would be excluded from the National Parks.
Honourable Charles Stewart, who was Minister of the Interior when the legislation
effecting the transfer was enacted, upon being

MARCH 9, 1949
questioned as to the Spray Lakes project, had
this to say, as reported in the House of
Commons Hansard 1929, page 2885:
I want to make our position clear with regard to
the Spray lakes. After a great deal of negotiation
we have practically come to an agreement with
regard to that question. A great many members of
this house object to that development altogether on
account of the scenic properties which will be interfered with, but in order to quiet a public opinion
which is becoming aroused over the thought that
we are going to trespass on the scenic properties of
the national parks reserved for the people of
Canada I have tried to readjust the boundaries of
the park to cut out all the coal areas, with the single
exception of one seam of which we know, and of
course with the exception of the precious metals
which might be discovered.
We have a proposed new line which Is fairly
satisfactory to the government of the province of
Alberta and to ourselves, with the exception of
some very minor adjustments, which cuts out the
Spray lakes.

Later in the same speech Honourable Mr.
Stewart had this to say:
I have said that the Calgary Power Company may
have that licence provided that for the months of
June, July and August we are guaranteed a flow of
350 second cubic feet daily down the Spray river.
We belleve that is the smallest flow which will provide against the fire hazard and net destroy the
appearance of a very beautiful stream. That is the
only restriction which has been placed upon the
development of the Spray lakes up to the present
time. It will be outside the park boundary and, of
course, if this Act becomes law it will be under the
jurisdiction of the province.

The agreement was entered into and the
natural resources were turned over to the
province. The parties thought they were
excepting from the transfer the lands required
for the Spray Lakes development. However,
up to this time no definite survey had been
made. The location of the boundary was
necessarily general. A subsequent survey
showed that the boundary about the lakes
was not properly drawn. The object of this
bill is to amend the boundary, and to convey
to the province the property that both parties
had intended it to receive.
Honourable senators can see in the excerpts
which I have read from the speech of the
Honourable Charles Stewart, that he thought
it would be necessary to retain during June,
July and August a flow at the mouth of the
Spray River of 350 cubic feet per second. Mr.
Ben Russell, Director of Water Resources for
Alberta, after investigating this matter
thoroughly, wrote to the Premier of Alberta.
I think I should read the letter in full, because
it is important to those who have a knowledge
of power development. The letter is dated
June 18, 1948, and reads as follows:
At your request I have wired to the Honourable
J. A. MacKinnon the following:
"Regarding the flow of Spray River for scenic purposes at Banff it is my opinion based on knowledge of the stream flow and conditions at the
location two hundred cubic feet per second would

be adequate. Considering the value of the stream
for power purposes any requirement above two
hundred second feet would be wasteful."
A characteristic of streams is that the rate of flow
varies, not directly as the depth, but more nearly
as the fourth or fifth power of the depth. That is
to say, a small increase in depth greatly increases
the velocity, and therefore, the volume. The following water level elevations of the Spray River
recently recorded at Banff adequately show the
conditions there:
Flow 150 second feet-the recorded depth is 4.14
feet.
Flow 250 second feet-the recorded depth is 4-36
feet.
Difference 0-22 feet.
Flow 350 second feet-the recorded depth is 4-57
feet.
Difference 0.21 feet.
For each increase of 50 second feet then, the
corresponding increase in depth is about one-tenth
of a foot, an increase which is hardly perceptible
even by those experienced to judge.
Assuming the tourist season to be from June 2 to
September 10, or 100 days, the stream flow records
would indicate that to maintain a flow of 200 second
feet at Banff it is necessary to release from storage
approximately 2,500 acre feet, which at say $3.50 per
acre foot, its value for the production of power,
amounts to $8,750. An increase in depth of one-tenth
of a foot to increase the discharge to 250 second
feet would require a release of an additional 10,000
acre feet or 12,500 acre feet, which at $3.50 per acre
foot amounts to $43,750, and so on.
Although the above calculations are approximate
they serve to show the extravagance of endeavouring to improve the scenery at the expense of the
power development.
If greater stream flow depth was absolutely necessary then a more economical method of creating it
would be to slow the velocity by weirs or other
means.
(Signed) Ben Russell.

The present Minister of Mines and Resources
is satisfied that a flow of 200 cubic feet per
second would be sufficient to protect the
scenic beauties, and that the company cannot
economically operate if it has to supply more.
I should point out that the park authorities
are opposed to the development of power
within the boundaries of the park on the
ground that it would interfere with the scenery. I have a great deal of sympathy with
those who are anxious to preserve the beauties of our parks. The beauties of Banff
National Park probably cannot be surpassed
anywhere. However, I think the transfer in
this case would not detract very materially
from the scenic attractions for the following
reasons:
1. Should these 21.2 miles be transferred
to the province there would still be 2,563
square miles, or more than one and a half
million acres within the park; and there are
several hundred miles of roadway. The park
is vast and contains great varieties of scenery.
2. The area proposed to be excluded from
the park is all on the edge of the park.
3. The dam on the Spray River would be
23 miles up the Spray from where it enters
the Bow river. From the north end of the
reservoir so created the stored water would

SENATE
be diverted through a system of canals, pipe
lines and power houses, down Goat Creek
valley, and out through the pass opposite Canmore, to the Bow river. I might say here that
there is a mountain between Banff and the
reservoir, so that the reservoir would not be
approachable directly from Banff. Anyone
wanting to go from Banff to the reservoir
would have to travel 15 miles east to Canmore
and then take the road that the company is
building from there to the reservoir.
4. The streams and watersheds emptying
into the Spray River below the proposed dam
are usually adequate for scenic purposes. In
the event of this bill being enacted, the power
company has undertaken as follows:
1. That the licensee will not by works outside the
boundaries of the said parks reduce the flow of
water in the Spray river ai its junction with the
Bow river in Banff National Park to an amount
less than 200 cubic feet per second during each of
the months of June, July and August in each year
hereafter.
2. That the licensee will, during the month of
September in each year hereafter, supply such
amount of water as may reasonably be required by
Banff Springs Hotel for essential sewage and water
supply.
3. That the licensee will provide in its works for
the storage of water a valve capable of discharging
water at the rate of 100 cubic feet per second and
will discharge through such valve into the Spray
river such water as may be necessary from time to
time for the purpose of fighting fires within the
said park.

5. Along the 23 miles between the proposed
dam and the confluence of the Spray and Bow
rivers there are no waterfalls, no cascades or
other noteworthy features.
On the other hand, the advantages to be had
from the development of this project are
many. In the first place, as I have already
pointed out, it would provide the city of
Calgary and the southern half of the province
of Alberta with power, without which they
cannot continue to grow and prosper.
Secondly, the reservoir control at the Spray
Lakes will materially lessen summer floods
and help to avoid winter floods that are
dangerous to property and lives in Calgary.
The city council of Calgary gave expression
to this opinion on the 1st day of March 1948,
when it passed the following resolution:
Whereas melting snow and rains in the Rocky
Mountains west of Calgary have caused damages to
properties in the city of Calgary;
And whereas serious winter ice jams and the
consequent flooding during low temperature periods
have resulted in considerable property damage in
and adjacent to the city of Calgary;
And whereas storage reservoirs would collect and
store excessive spring and summer water run-off
and eliminate, or partially eliminate, the possibility
of damage by flooding; and futher, as this reservoir
stored water can be used to produce electric power
during all seasons of the year and particularly in
the winter season and provide the possibility of a
more even water flow in the Bow river;
Therefore it is the opinion of this council of the
city of Calgary that the construction of such

reservoirs and electrical power developments known
as the Spray lakes and Bearspaw developments will
provide protection, and we therefore urge upon the
governments of the Dominion of Canada and the
province of Alberta the importance of issuing the
necessary permits authorizing the construction of
these projects.

It would provide also a scenic lake drive
from Canmore. The City Commissioner of
Calgary, who takes a special interest in fishing and sports generally, writes as follows:
By controlling the flow of water in the Spray
river, this is one of the recognized methods of improving fishing in mountain or flood streams. The
violent flooding of the streams scours the bottoms
and washes the fish down to larger rivers, whereas
if the Spray river were controlled there could be
ponds and pools constructed which would be of the
same size during the spawning season as during the
fishing season.

I submit, therefore, that the production of
waterpower cannot have any appreciable
adverse affect upon the scenery of this vast
park. Such adverse affect, if any, would be
infinitesimal compared with the great benefit
to Alberta and to Canada generally.
The project will cost upwards of $18 million. The company is already clearing brush
and building roads, and is anxious to rush
the work to a conclusion in accordance with
the undertaking made with the provincial
government, that the work would be com-

pleted by November 1, 1950.
We now come to section 3 of the bill, concerning the Elk Island National Park. The
Province of Alberta has applied to the
Dominion Parliament for the transfer of
thirty-three feet of land from the north end
of the park for the purpose of widening the
highway which runs along the park's northern boundary.
By section 4 of the bill the Province of New
Brunswick expresses its desire to have the
name "New Brunswick National Park"
changed to "Fundy National Park." As the
province is making the request, I presume
there will be no objection raised by the
members of this house.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, to
sections 3 and 4 of this bill, as I see them,
there can be no possible objection. The proposed amendment to the statute creating the
Elk Island National Park simply takes out
twenty odd acres for road purposes. Concerning the New Brunswick National Park, which
is adjacent te the Bay of Fundy, "Fundy
National Park" is probably a better designation than the old one.
I am not at all satisfied, however, with the
proposed amendment whereby a certain area
is to be taken out of the Banff National Park
and be restored to the Province of Alberta;
and I must confess that I am not greatly
impressed by the authorities which the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross)

MARCH 9. 1949
has cited in support of the change. I do not
mean that I am opposed to the bill; but I
think we should examine this proposal very
closely.
When the National Parks Act was first
enacted, many years ago, the cardinal principle implicit in the legislation was the setting aside throughout Canada of certain areas
here and there which would forever remain
in their natural state, to be an attraction to
tourists and an evidence to future generations of the original condition prevailing in
various parts of this country. One of the
first parks set aside was the Banff National
Park. This area was chosen because it had,
to a peculiar degree, very considerable scenic
value. So far as I am aware, Banff is the
only national park where an effort has been
made to extract for commercial purposes a
portion of the originally designated area. I
repeat that when the national parks legislation was enacted it was for the very purpose
of preventing that sort of thing.
I must plead guilty to a lapse in that connection when, as Minister of Mines and
Resources, I had the administration of
national parks within my control. But that
was during the war. One of the most
beautiful lakes in the Banff National Park
was Lake Minnewanka. It was situated in the
hills as my honourable friend from Calgary
will remember. During the progress of the
war certain industries were established in
the vicinity of Calgary for the purpose of
adding, if I recall correctly, to Canada's output of explosives. The successful promotion
of the work required additional power. The
quickest way of securing it-indeed, at that
time, the only way-was by tapping the

waters of Lake Minnewanka.
accomplished by the erection of a huge dam
behind which the waters were allowed to
accumulate during the season when the flow
was strong, and from which they were drawn
off when the streams were low. In this way
the output of power was maintained. I recall
distinctly that when I recommended legislation for the production of power in this way
to my colleagues in the government, I did
so solely on the basis of the urgent need of
explosives for use in the war. At the same
time, I made it very clear, I think, that but
for that overriding necessity I would not have
made my recommendation, for it resulted in
a change in beautiful Lake Minnewanka. At
a certain period of the year the shores of that
lake are a huge mud flat; its natural scenic
beauty has been largely destroyed, now and
for all time to come.
There is the additional proposal in this bill
that the waters from the Spray Lakes be confined, and that the amount of water which

comes down the Spray River to join the Bow
River be diminished to 200 cubic feet per
second. Honourable senators who have been
at Banff in the summertime will remember
the beautiful stream which flows in front of
the Banff Springs Hotel. That is the Spray
River. I do not think a finer example of
natural beauty can be found in Banff Park
than these waters, tumbling over the rocks
and past the Banff Springs Hotel to join the
Bow River. It is now proposed to dam these
waters, hold them in the Spray Lakes, and
divert them to another route for the purpose
of creating an additional 90,000 horsepower.
Our only protection so far as this legislation
is concerned is an understanding with the
Province of Alberta that the flow will never
be allowed to go below 200 feet per second.
My honourable friend argues that reduction
of this limited flow will not impair the scenic
value of the stream, and he quotes as an
authority the secretary of, I believe, a fishing
club in Calgary, to the effect that it will
actually improve the stream for fishing. That
statement, it seems to me, is not borne out
by facts, because from primeval times down
to the present these waters while they flowed
uninterruptedly, untouched by the hand of
men, have been good fishing streams. To me
it is inconceivable that it is now necessary
to reduce the flow of the stream to 200 cubic
feet per second in order to provide conditions
suitable for the culture of fish. So, with all
due regard to my honourable friend, I cannot
think that any great weight can be attached
to that argument.
The point I am making, the issue I am trying to raise, is that the bill is a violation of
the original purpose of the National Parks
Act. If this spoliation is permitted in Banff
National Park, will not a precedent have been
created for similar action in any other park,
if commercial interests deem it desirable.
Personally I do not like this at all. My attitude
is the same now as it was in regard to the
Lake Minnewanka development, which, I
repeat, I would never have recommended to
my colleagues in the government had it not
been for the necessities of war. When this
bill goes to committee, I hope it will be carefully scrutinized, and that if it is to go
through, it shall only be on condition that the
flow per second be raised to something substantial enough to ensure that at all times the
Spray River will be the really scenic stream
it always has been, and not a mere procession
of bare rocks with water skirting around
them.
That is the only contribution I wish to
make to the debate. I would again impress
upon my colleagues in this honourable house
that there is a definite purpose behind the

SENATE
National Parks Act. The Act was passed
with the object of preserving the pristine
beauty and glory of places such as this. The
impulse so to maintain them is as strong today
as it has ever been in our history. We should
be very loath to take any steps, because of
purely commercial necessities, to weaken the
purposes and principles which are the very
basis of the Act.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
this bill proposes to do three things. The
first is to remove from the Banff National
Park approximately twenty-two square miles
of land. Possibly that is the only part of the
bill which is open to objection. Another purpose is to provide a strip of land thirty-three
feet wide for a roadway. To that I do not
take exception. Nor am I opposed to the
changing of the name of "New Brunswick"
National Park, if honourable senators who are
present from that fair province do not object.
As regards the exclusion from Banff
National Park of the area referred to in section 2, I wish to mention that when I first
read the bill I could see many objections to
the proposal. After having listened to the
honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr.
Ross) I was less sure whether my doubts were
justified. But the speech of the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) did
something to confirm them, because the
honourable senator more or less backed up
what I said in 1947 when a bill somewhat
similar to the present one was passed by this
house.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That was to take the
swamps out of a park.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: At that time the honourable senator from Churchill approved the
removal of 350 square miles from the Prince
Albert National Park, in the province of
Saskatchewan. I was the only person in this
house who opposed that removalHon. Mr. Horner: I opposed it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -with the exception of
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner). The speech of the honourable senator from Churchill today represents
an entire change of policy.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: At least, I am of opinion
that it does.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If my honourable friend
will permit, I shall correct him. My agreement to taking the area out of the Prince
Albert National Park was based on the fact
that it was mainly swampland and a breeding
ground for mosquitoes. That is different from
removing natural scenic beauty from the
park.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: There are plenty of
mosquitoes at Banff. I was there one summer
when the mosquitoes came right through the
screened windows, and I could not sleep
because of them. In my opinion, my honourable friend's reason for removing 350 square
miles from the Prince Albert National Park
in Saskatchewan is not a sound one. During
the debate of June 24, 1947, at page 459 of
Hansard, I said that I was unalterably
opposed to the boundaries of any of our
national parks being substantially changed.
I am still more or less of that opinion. As
has been stated, these parks were first established as playgrounds where people could
spend two or three weeks each summer at
little expense. Camping facilities have been
supplied, and people find themselves right
out in the open with nature as it has always
been. Parks were established not only to
provide the people with playgrounds in perpetuity, but also to conserve wild life within
the park boundaries. Elk, deer, moose,
beaver and many other kinds of wild animals
can be seen in their natural state in every
one of these parks. We should be very careful what we do.
I notice in the explanatory notes to this
bill that in 1930-probably before my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) became Minister of Mines and
Resources-630 square miles were withdrawn
from Banff National Park. At that time it
was thought that 630 square miles would be
sufficient for the development of this power
site; but it is now found that an additional
22 square miles are required. As I have
stated previously, I am opposed to interfering
with park boundaries. I feel that if 350
square miles were to be taken from the Prince
Albert National Park, the province of Saskatchewan should give in return another 350
square miles of land which is not good for
agriculture or anything of that nature, and
which borders on the park itself. This practice should be followed so that the areas of
these parks shall remain as large as they
were intended to be in the first place. It
seems to me that in this particular case the
Province of Alberta should give to the federal
government, for inclusion in the park, an
area equivalent to the area which is being
taken away.
There are many questions I wish to ask
about this matter before the bill is passed.
In looking at the map of the park I find that
the location of the power site is a considerable distance from the town of Banff.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Twenty-three miles.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is quite possible that
the erection of this dam will not injure the

MARCH 9, 1949
scenie beauty of the park. I am somewhat
infiuenced by the fact that this dam may
create a large lake in which there might be
good fishing in the near future, but I am more
influenced by representatives from Alberta
in another place. The honourable senator
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) may
have something to say, but the members of
the House of Commons to whom I have talked
are all in favour of this legislation and claim
that it will not injure the park in any way.
They say this measure is absolutely necessary, and they want it put through as quickly
as possible.
Subject to getting satisfactory answers to
certain questions which I intend to ask in
committee, I do not intend to oppose the bill.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Am I right in saying that the ammonia plant in Calgary, which
is to receive the benefit of this increased
power, is now owned by the Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) might be able
to answer that question.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I am not sure, but I understand it is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It was previously a
Crown company, and now it is the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
I do not want to delay the progress of this
bill. I more or less agree with the former
Minister of Mines and Resources (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) about the preservation of our parks
and in the idea that nothing should be permitted to lessen their scenic value. I would
oppose this legislation if I felt that there was
any strong sentiment from that standpoint
amongst people who aire interested in the
Banff National Park a good deal more than
I am. I have a special park reserve of my
own over which I try to keep watch. It is
in another part of the province. There is an
organization known as the National Parks
Association and when anything is proposed
in Ottawa that it regards as likely to damage
a park, I immediately receive protests. The
organization has an alert secretary who keeps
a watchful eye on the national parks of
Western Canada, especially in the mountain
area; but I do not recall having received any
protest when this legislation was introduced.
I agree with the honourable acting leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that, as
far as Alberta sentiment is concerned, there
probably is not much opposition to this legislation in the other place. However, I too
should like to have more information on this
bill as it affects the Banff National Park, and
29091-12

I think it can only be obtained from officials
in the Department of Mines and Resources.
Although the boundaries of our national
parks have been defined, they have been
altered in the past. For instance, the boundaries of Waterton National Park, where I have
my summer home, were altered by taking out
a portion of land that I never thought was
of any value. It had no outstanding fishing
streams and was never visited by tourists. It
was some distance from the mountain area
of the park, and there was justification for
its removal.
I do not think any rigid rule can be laid
down in relation to the boundaries of parks;
but I do feel that any legislation that would
interfere with the scenic value of a park
should be considered very carefully before
being passed by this chamber. The opinion of
officials of the Department of Mines and
Resources, particularly those responsible for
the administration of the parks themselves,
should be made available to us in committee,
where we can ask any questions that are in
our minds and become either satisfied with
the measure or more critical of it than we are
now.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I heartily agree as to the desirability of sending this bill to committee. In fact,
in view of the number of committee meetings
already set down, I took the precaution of
arranging for a meeting of the Natural
Resources committee to consider the bill
immediately after the Senate rises this afternoon. The necessary departmental officials
will be present at that meeting.
I do not think anyone can take exception
to one point that has been stressed by the
honourable the acting leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the honourable
gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and the honourable gentleman from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan), namely, that it
is desirable to protect our national parks from
encroachments that would in any way detract
from their scenic value. I am not in a position to give specific answers to some of the
questions that have been raised, and I think
these had better be dealt with in committee.
However, from what was said by the honourable gentleman from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross),
I gather that when the original transfer to
the province was made there was excepted
from Banff National Park an area of some
630 square miles which it was contemplated
would be required for power development.
That area was never included in the park
area, or if it was included, it was taken out
again in 1930. It seems to me that if an additional 22 square miles had been considered
necessary for power purposes when the actual

SENATE
surveys for the transfer were made, no one
would have objected very much to making
the excepted area 652 square miles instead of
630.
My honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) raised a question as to the
sufficiency of the restricted quantity of water
which the Province of Alberta will undertake
to supply during the summer months from the
flow at the confluence of the Spray and Bow
rivers. I am not in a position to make a
definite statement as to this, and I think the
best way to secure any further information is
by a reference of the bill to committee. I
propose to move a reference if the Senate sees
fit to give the bill second reading.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, may I take just a moment to offer
congratulations to my honourable friend from
Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross)-my old friend,
with whom I was long associated in another
place-upon the clarity with which he presented the case for the application under this
bill? Also I should like to congratulate my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar)-if he will permit me-who
brought to this discussion a very full
knowledge gained from many years of
administration of our National Parks.
I desire to give notice that when the
committee meets I shall ask for a complete
picture of the financial structure of the
corporation on whose behalf this application
is being made. The department should be
prepared to supply that information to
honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Honourable senators, I
wish to refer to section 4 of the bill, which
proposes that the name "New Brunswick
National Park" be changed to "Fundy
National Park." To me the proposed name
means absolutely nothing. The word "Fundy"
standing by itself is not even a name. If the
new name were to be "Bay of Fundy National
Park" there would be some sense to it.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Who was Fundy?
Hon. Mr. Leger: I do not know. If the
name were to be changed to "Bay of Fundy
National Park" people visiting New Brunswick would have some idea where the park
was.
Hon. Mr. Jones: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I may have something to
say about this when the bill goes before the
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Friday, February
18, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon.
Mr. Farquhar for an Address in reply thereto.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable sentors, a little over a hundred years ago, our
great compatriot La Fontaine obtained from
the Parliament of Canada the right to use
the French language in Parliament on the
same footing as the English language and, in
order to commemorate that event and the
recognition of that right, I would like to
express myself today in my mother tongue.
First, I want to thank our Speaker for his
fine gesture in reciting in French the opening
prayer, at least once every week.
I also thank the mover and the seconder
of the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, and I wish to congratulate them on
the brief, clear and precise statements which
they made on that occasion.
I would also welcome our new colleagues,
because I know that their experience and
their sound judgment will be most valuable
to us all.
As the leader on the other side mentioned
in his speech, many things have happened
since the last session. It is a fact. First,
there is the resignation of the Right Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King, who,
after more than twenty-five years in office,
has resigned the post of Prime Minister of
Canada.
As a Canadian citizen, I feel bound not
only to pay tribute to him but also to let
him know in all sincerity how much we
admire everything he has done. Posterity
may well regard him as one of the greatest
prime ministers in the world, because he was
one of the greatest economists in modern
times. History will also recognize him as
having inspired, even created, all the social
legislation which we have passed in the last
seven or eight years.
This legislation is not perfect, but at least
it lays the foundations of something better.
There were two great conventions: one in
the summer and the other in the fall. As
etiquette requires that one should always
mention the other party first, I will deal in

MARCH 9, 1949
the first place with the Progressive Conservative convention where a new leader was
chosen. This time, however, a change in
leadership did not mean a change in name.
It seems that the new leader of the other
party has reawakened hopes, and stiffened
the morale of his supporters which appeared
to be faltering. The new leader, who is an
able debater, is worthy of his party and
will, I am sure, make a good leader of the
opposition and I hope that he will remain in
the opposition for a long time.
A Liberal convention was also held last
summer to choose a new leader-I mean a
new leader who seven or eight years ago was
unknown in political life. He was called
upon to accept that important post, because
in his private life, as well as in his profession,
he had shown such character and insight
in all spheres of activity; such vision and
learning, that everyone claimed that no
greater man could be found. He was chosen,
however, especially because he was an honest
and worthy man who never had to repent
having told his fellow citizens the truth, even
though the truth sometimes hurts. I hope
that he will ever wish to remain in public life.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourit: In fact, to describe
adequately the character of our new leader,
I could do no better than quote the words
addressed to him by His Excellency Bishop
Desranleau of Sherbrooke on the occasion of
a reception given in his honour by his alma
mater. Bishop Desranleau said the following
to his former school-mate at Sherbrooke
Seminary:
What makes you stand out particularly, Mr. St.
Laurent, is your sincerity and unshakable confidence
in truth. You found out, as we all did, that one
must always tell the truth and never hide it; truth,
in the final analysis, is always the best policy. You
are a man so sincere, so upright and loyal that it
is a great honour and pleasure for me to hold you
up as an example to our Canadian youth.

Could anyone speak more highly of our
new

Prime Minister?

I

stress this point

because I have known Mr. St. Laurent for
quite a long time and to my knowledge he
bas never contradicted himself whether in
private or in public life. If I insist upon the
great frankness and sincere loyalty of our
Prime Minister, it is in order to answer certain insulting remarks made about a man
who has such a high sense of duty, integrity
and honesty. It is high time to say these
Encouragement must be
things publicly.
given to those who respect themselves
and still believe in loyalty and honesty. No
one could be loyal and honest and at the same
time be disloyal to his people. Only sectarian
minds could entertain such thoughts.
29091-12J

Some of his fellow-citizens believe that
because he is a politician he must be slandered and vilified. He is not a politician; he
is a statesman, which is not the same thing,
because a statesman is the leader of a nation.
He is an honest man, and when someone says
that he is too honest to be Prime Minister, I
find such a statement disappointing and discouraging. When a nation possesses a man
endowed with such frankness, it is our duty
to give him public recognition and to acknowledge his integrity, his honesty, his greatness
and his frankness. This is the reason why I
make such a statement today.
Since I am speaking of facts which do not
exactly concern the Speech from the
Throne . . .
Hon. Mr. Howard: Go on.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourit: I shall come back
to that presently. However, I will not discuss
the matter at length. Something else bas
happened: oleomargarine has been placed on
the market.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh oh.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: We were told: "We
must have margarine because there will be
a shortage of butter." For a year now
newspapers have been warning the public
that there would be a shortage of butter. In
my province, before the war, when August
or September came along, a great number
of people used to bring in their supplies for
the winter; they would buy a hundred, two
hundred pounds of butter, because they knew
that most creameries were closed during the
winter months. There was no shortage of
butter. Indeed, butter made in August or
September is better than butter made during
the winter. This year there is no rationing.
People are coming back to the old custom.
However, there were some who feared a shortage of butter; so they brought in their supplies. But as soon as oleomargarine appeared
on the market, rumours about an impending
butter shortage died down. However, we
were told in the fall that butter stocks were
smaller than those of last year, that we were
forced to import butter; but, believe it or
not, while butter stocks were decreasing, the
price was going down also. At present, the
wholesale price of butter is, I understand,
a cent and a half lower than it was at the end
of the summer. Here is the explanation. I
made inquiries in Montreal, Quebec and in
my home town of Levis, where there is only
one cold storage plant, thus facilitating matters. People were saying: "There is no butter, but warehouses are filled with it." There
is less butter in warehouses now, than last
year, because grocers are selling more butter

SENATE
this year. It is claimed that butter supplies
have gone down; this is because warehouses
declare only the stocks of butter stored on
behalf of wholesalers. Grocers are selling
much less butter because thousands of families
have brought in their supplies in the fall.
However, butter was selling for 70 cents per
pound wholesale in September, whereas in
November the price had fallen to 681 cents.
There was no margarine on the market
at that time. Newspapers laid too much
emphasis on the matter. Figures are often
misleading. That explains the situation.
It is frequently claimed that with figures it
is possible to prove anything, even a f alsehood.
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that
dairying is one of the chief branches of agriculture in the Eastern provinces as well as
in the Maritimes. If dairying is destroyed,
the livestock industry will be destroyed, and
in that event our fellow-citizens of Western
Canada will be unable to sell their grain. As
a result, if farmers can no longer make a
decent living on the farm they will leave
the land to swell the population of cities, and
economic and moral crises will follow.
To sum up, price is not the only factor to
be considered in the controversy over butter and margarine. The problem may have
far-reaching effects on the economy of our
country. Some may say that other countries
also face similar problems; but is there
another country like Canada where the growing season lasts only six months and where
during the rest of the year farmers must feed
their stock without getting any returns?
An Hon. Senalor: Let us change the climate,
and then we may discuss the matter.
Hon. Mr. Howard: It seems that the climate
bas changed.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Now, owing to their
jealously guarded autonomy, provinces will
tear one another apart; in some margarine
will be allowed while in others it will be
prohibited.
It is said that Quebec has
passed a law prohibiting margarine. This is
not quite true. The law prohibits the importation, manufacture and sale of margarine in
the province of Quebec, provided the Minister of Agriculture requests that it be
enforced.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It was a disappointment.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: It is difficult to
prohibit a certain thing in one province while
it is allowed in another.
Be that as it may, let us leave the matter
of butter and margarine to return to the
Speech from the Throne.

Hon. Mr. Lacasse: If there is ever a threat
of divorce between butter and margarine,
the Senate could attend to the matter.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: This reminds me
that I intended to discuss divorce. Things
are going badly enough among families; for
heaven's sake, let us refrain from extending the scope of the law in order to make
divorce even easier. People claim that when
a man and a woman can no longer get along
together, it is preferable that they should
separate. But let us think of the other families who live happily. We must not pass
laws for each individual case; otherwise there
will be no end to it. I do not wish to blame
the senators who sit on the Divorce Committee; on the contrary, I admire them; I
admire their virtues, for it takes a well tempered soul to listen to all those testimonies
without despairing of human virtues. However, we would be happier if we reverted to
the habits of living of the past.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Vallincourt: Reference is made
to housing in the Speech from the Throne.
Since the end of the war the government bas
been trying to eliminate discriminatory laws.
No one will deny, I a msure, that discriminatory laws are necessary in wartime. "We
have an Act respecting rent control," says the
government, "and we are prepared to let any
province assume such control". The provinces reply that they do not want to assume
it. The housing problem, however, is a matter
which comes under provincial or local rather
than Dominion jurisdiction. When the provinces are reluctant to deal with a matter, they
pass the buck to the Dominion Government
and prate about autonomy; at other times,
however, they denounce centralization. All
the same, there should be co-operation
between the provinces.
There is a housing problem not only in
Canada but throughout the world. The fact
that this problem is universal in scope does
not mean that it could not be solved. There is
much talk of communism in Canada. What
does it matter to people living five or six
together in, say, two roons? It is useless to
talk and protest; they do not care, as they
have nothing to fight for, no home to protect.
In the cities of Moneral and Quebec, for
instance, where the number of home owners
hardly represents 14 to 18 per cent of the
total population, is it possible to fight communism?
To build a $6,000 bouse, the
Central Mortgage Corporation will lend 90
per cent of the total value. Who will supply
the other 10 per cent? A labourer earning

MARCH 9, 1949
$34 a week will never be able to a save cent.
Do you think he can build a home and thus
become a home-owner?
What then is the solution to the problem?
In my opinion, it is a question of co-operation
between the provinces and the municipalities.
The province of Quebec is prepared to lend
money at 2 per cent to prospective homebuilders. That is all very well for houses
built since December 17, 1948. That is not
enough, however, because the 10 per cent
has still to be found and the tenant has not
got it. The local or provincial government
should advance the 10 per cent. The workingman can pay his monthly rent, but that is
all he can do. While we spend hundreds of
millions of dollars for road construction,
could we not earmark a few millions to
house our workers? That would be one of
the best ways to combat communism, and
co-operation between the federal and provincial governments is needed to this end.
Co-operation is different from assimilation,
state control or socialism. It is the union of
all efforts however small.
From January to November 1948, the
Central Mortgage Corporation made 15,703
loans, amounting to about one hundred million dollars, and covering a total of 19,093
housing units. Out of this total Quebec
received $25,313,480, for 5,017 housing units.
So, with the co-operation of the provinces, the cities and municipalities, it would
be possible to do a great deal more, and, over
a period of five or ten years, to solve this
moral and economical problem.
The Speech from the Throne mentions certion improvements to the Family Allowances
Act. The Act, as it stands today, is not
perfect, but even so it is a good piece of
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: There are some who
in a fit of temper have talked of a "baby
bonus" as a vote catcher.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: That name has not been
used for some time.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I shall not dwell on
the point. I may refer to it when the bill is

twenty-six Acts and have failed to find one
that was better than our own.
Who can deny today that the Family
Allowances Act is helping the population
tremendously. Without it, how many homes

would be in straitened circumstances, or
even poverty stricken. Once it is completed
and improved, this Act will represent one of
the fairest and best social measures ever
enacted by any government.
We have considered the Family Allowance
Acts of all other countries. I am happy
to say that ours is the fairest in its application. For instance, there is no special taxation of employers to take care of these
In countries where
family allowances.
there is such taxation, employers are inclined
to employ those who have fewer children.
These countries, where the birth rate is
decreasing, are bound to disappear as economic and geographic entities. Economically
speaking, consumption must be increased if
production is to be increased. How could
consumption be better increased than by
increasing population, especially through the
birth rate? Children, therefore, represent a
great contribution to the economic life of a
nation.
The Speech from the Throne mentions the
North Atlantic Pact. This, for a Quebecker,
is dangerous ground.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Oh no, oh no.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: After a trial such
as took place in Hungary, can we remain
neutral before the danger which threatens
us? The Pope, that great Christian authority
who advocates peace, understanding and
charity, stated in his Christmas message:
A convinced Christian cannot confine himself
within an easy and egoistical "isolationism," when
lie witnesses the needs and the misery of his
brother; when pleas for help come to him from
those in economic distress; when lie knows the
aspirations of the working classes for more normal
and just conditions of life; when he is aware of the
abuses of an economic system which puts money
above social obligations; when lie is not ignorant
of the aberrations of an intransigent nationalism
which denies or spurns the common bonds linking
the separate nations together, and imposing on each
one of them many and varied duties towards the
great family of nations.
A people threatened with an unjust aggression,
or already its victim, may not remain passively indifferent, if they would think and act as befits Christians; all the more does the solidarity of the family
of nations forbid others to behave as mere spectators, in an attitude of apathetic neutrality. Who
will ever measure the harm already caused in the
past by such indifference to war of aggression,
which is quite alien to the Christian instinct? How
much more keenly has it brought home to the
"great" and especially to the "small," the sense of
their insecurity?
One thing, however, is certain: the commandment of peace is a matter of divine law. Its purpose is the protection of the goods of humanity,
inasmuch as they are gifts of the Creator. Among
these goods some are of such importance for society,
that it is perfectly lawful to defend them against

SENATE
unjust aggression. Their defense is even an obligation for the nations as a whole who have a duty not
to abandon a nation that is attacked.

I shall leave it at that. We all seek peace;
but are we really trying to find a real peace
based upon security? Are we taking the
proper steps to insure such peace? For about
two years, delegates from nearly every
country of the world have been meeting at
Geneva to explain what is meant by human
rights. If someone possesses a right, it is
because it has been given to him. The fact
that I am here does not give me any right
to be here; if I am here, if I speak in this
house, it is because I have been appointed as
a senator; that constitutes my right to speak
in your presence. If my children enjoy a
right to life it is because my wife and I have
given them the right to live. For two years,
people have been talking about human rights;
even so, they have forgotten to mention where
these rights originated. Read the Charter of
Human Rights and try to find anywhere the
name of God. Where did man get these
rights if not from God? Who would protect
mankind if men were pitted against one
another? One would say: "It is my right";
the other would answer: "No, it is mine".
What would happen if there were no authority to make a decision? Is there anyone
today to deny God's existence? I fear for
tomorrow's democracy because the Author
of all human rights has been forgotten. It
seems to me that instead of catering to
atheistic Russia's wishes, Christian countries
should have recognized God. Unfortunately,
mankind is sinking lower and lower, because
everybody thinks that the rights he holds
are not accompanied by any kind of duty.
If my neighbour is entitled to the right of
living, it is my duty to respect that right. If
I have a right to work for my employer, it is
my duty to earn my wages. People clamour
for the recognition of their rights; they never
talk about their duties. No one wants to
work, but everybody wants more money and
yet it is thought that the world will be the
better for it.
In order to illustrate better this idea of
co-operation, which I have expounded before,
I would like to give as an example our own
Confederation. If we are today under Confederation it is because, previously, there was
nothing but disunity in the country. To be
convinced of the fact, one has but to read
the reports of the discussions which preceded

the establishment of Confederation.
On
February 6, 1865, Sir John MacDonald said,
as it is reported on page 31 of the debates on
Confederation:
It is impossible not to see that although we have
been nominally under a legislative union and
although we sit in one Parliament which, according
to the Constitution is supposed to represent the
population as a whole, regardless of the various
sections or localities, we know, through experience,
that following the Union we have been really under
a Confederation; that, in matters concerning Upper
Canada, the representatives of that section deal
exclusively with the laws affecting them; and that
the same applies to Lower Canada. We are in fact
under a federal union even if the said union is
purely nominal; and we know that, in the course of
the very lively discussions which have taken place
in recent years when a measure concerning one of
the sections was attacked by members of the other
section who were not directly concerned; or when
a measure dealing with the local interests of Upper
Canada was adopted or rejected in spite of the
wishes of the majority with the help of Lower
Canada's votes, my hon. friend the Chairman of the
Council and his followers denounced, with the most
consummate skill and the greatest energy, this mode
of legislation as being a violation of the rights of
Upper Canada.
(Hear! hear!)
The same thing
applied to Lower Canada when a bill became a law
against the will of the majority; all its representatives rose as one man to protest against the violation
of their rights.

The purpose of Confederation was to create
a central government which would co-ordinate the interests of the provinces which would
participate in it. In conclusion, I earnestly
hope that the unity, the co-operation, the
strength so necessary to ensure in Canada a
happy and a full life will not be lacking. We
are often told: "Follow in the steps of your
worthy fathers". Let us remember that if it
is true that we are the sons of our fathers, we
are also the fathers of our sons. Let us be
worthy fathers to our sons in order that
tomorrow they shall respect us as we today
respect the memory of our fathers, and
shall love their country, their Canada which
extends from coast to coast, because throughout its breadth will exist true co-operation,
the most complete form of charity and
understanding.

Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable senators,
as a matter of personal conscience I wish to
raise the question which I had the honour
of raising in committee this morning. I am
not objecting at all to the report just presented, but I do object most strongly to the
phraseology of section 8 of the bill. I dislike
particularly the part which says that a person
who does certain things "is guilty of an
offence". Honourable senators, the language
of the Criminal Code is "shall be guilty of
an offence", which is entirely different. But
this bill pronounces a man guilty before he
enters court for his case to be heard. As a
Liberal whose beliefs are largely founded
on the Liberalism followed in the Old Land,
I protest against this phraseology, which is
now appearing in practically all our statutes
that provide penalties.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Farquhar for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas H. Wood: Honourable senators, may I join with those who have previously spoken in extending my sincere
congratulations to the mover and seconder of
the Address. Both these honourable senators
bring to this house a rich experience of public
service in their respective provinces.
May I for a moment strike a personal note
in sincere appreciation of the expressions of
good will and the courtesies extended to me
since I became a member of this house? I
know this kindness is intended as a compliment to the province of Saskatchewan, and
particularly to the city of Regina, which I
represent.

May I, at this time, extend Saskatchewan's
greeting to our new sister province, Newfoundland?
Though I have spent the greater part of my
adult life in Saskatchewan, my earlier years
were spent in Ontario, and it is my intention
in the not-too-distant future to visit the
Maritime Provinces. I hope that many
Easterners, who have not visited Western
Canada, will do so, especially the graingrowing section.
This brings me to my subject-matter for
this afternoon-some of the problems of the
western farmer. Briefly and simply I should
like to discuss some of the causes for the rise
and fall of wheat prices, as there has been
some discussion in this house on the subject.
During the first thirty years of the century
the export of wheat provided a basis for the
rapid growth of Canadian wealth and population, and the war of 1914-1918 greatly
quickened the production of wheat in Canada.
This same cause greatly reduced the European
wheat acreage. The high cost of marine
insurance and freight in wartime put Australia
and Argentina at a disadvantage, so the
European demand for wheat during this
period had to be met by Canada and the
United States. Wheat prices rose to average
for the following years:
1914-15 .......... $1.32 per bushel
1.10 "
1915-16 ..........
1.97
1916-17 ..........
2.22
1917-18 ..........
1918-19 ..........
2.24
1919-20 ..........
2.59
2.07
1920-21 ..........
1.34
1921-22 ..........
1.10
1922-23 ..........
It will be noted that the prices over this nine
year period are higher than what the farmer
may expect in a similar period during and
after the Second World War. The cost of
living in this period of the First World War
was pretty much in line with the cost of
living in the Second World War period.
In this wartime increase of wheat production there were weaknesses. Trouble could
be expected when Europe settled down to
peacetime agriculture again. European countries, especially Germany, had learned
through the wheat blockade how dangerous
it was, without command of the seas, to be
dependent upon foreign food, and they were
prepared to protect their farmers. By 1929
only the United Kingdom, Eire, Belgium and
Holland admitted wheat without payment of
substantial import duties.
The consequences for Canada of the
re-establishment of European agriculture to a
peacetime basis after the first war were made

SENATE

more serious by the slow growth of population in Canada, and by a change in consumer
habits in Europe, which reduced the preference for hard wheat. In 1931-32 the average
price of wheat at the farm was 35 cents to
38 cents in Canada.
During the First World War we had available markets in Holland, Italy, Roumania,
Russia, France, and part of Belgium and
some other countries. Most of these countries
used all their manpower to wage the war. In
the Second World War, within a few months
of early 1940, Italy and Roumania were fighting against us; France, Belgium and Holland
had been overrun. This left us only one
important market for our wheat-England.
The result was that wheat was accumulated
in Canada until 1944, when we had a surplus
of wheat, including that year's crop, of nearly
one billion bushels. There was so much
wheat that the Dominion Government supplied funds to build lean-tos and other storage
space in co-operation with the elevator companies. Producers were urged to keep their
wheat on the farm, and farmers were paid
not to grow wheat.
It must be remembered that much of this
surplus was available when the war ended.
In anticipation of the war ending at this time,
the various nations opposing Germany had
their economists report on probable conditions in their own countries as to what would
be the outlook for business and employment.
In each country, including Canada, the
response was a so-called "white paper" report
that there would be great dislocation in each
country's economy, and great unemployment
for at least a year or two, until the men
returning from war could be re-established.
In the light of these reports, and with nearly
a billion bushels of surplus wheat in Canada,
it is understandable why Britain was prepared to pay only $1.35 and $1.55 per bushel
for wheat in the first two years of its contract. In fact it was thought that wheat on
the world market might go even lower than
these prices, and this opinion was expressed
in the report of at least one of the nations.
But what really did happen-which no one
seems to have taken into account-was that
Europe, particularly Germany, was so badly
dislocated that former enemies had to provide the people with food, clothing and other
necessities from stocks accumulated on the
American continent. I doubt very much if
anyone could have foreseen that it would be
necessary to supply food and clothing to the
desperate people of Europe for over three
years: but now the people of Europe are
supplying, to a greater degree, their own

needs so far as grain is concerned. This they
must endeavour to do because of a lack of
dollars and the high price of wheat.
I recall a conversation which took place in
1929 with a man connected with the Grain
Growers' Association. He asked this question:
"Why don't we sell our surplus wheat to
China, even if we receive only 50 cents a
bushel?"-a price which, I understand, had
been offered for low-grade wheat. It must
be remembered that in 1929 Western Canada
had a surplus of wheat which was frozen
and of a very low grade, and which could not
be disposed of to our regular customers. They
desired our hard wheat to mix with the softgrade wheat of their own growing. Because
of this surplus of low-grade wheat, markets
would have to be found elsewhere. A few
years later, with carrying charges and interest
deducted, this same wheat was sold for 25
cents a bushel or less, simply because we
had a price tag beyond what poorer nations
could pay.
In demanding an unreasonably high price
for his wheat the farmer is defeating his own
purpose, because European re-establishment
and the dislocation of currencies will result
in forcing down the price obtainable, and we
may find ourselves again facing the possibility
of 35 cent wheat. The people on this continent will not be the only ones to suffer as
a direct result of a price held unreasonably
high.
In European countries when the protection
of wheat, in particular, became stronger after
the First World War, grain growing expanded,
but other agricultural activities were curtailed. The result has been a serious decline
in the standard of nutrition in Europe. Thus,
other parts of the world, already with "two
strikes against them" in their struggle to
rehabilitate themselves, cannot now and
never could afford to pay a high price for
wheat.
I have lived in Western Canada for nearly
thirty-seven years, and I think I may say
without fear of contradiction that the western
prairies as a whole have never known such
prosperity as we have at the present time.
There is the possible exception of those parts
which perhaps never should have been sown
to wheat, and even some of these areas will
in time be served by the great Saskatchewan
River project. This prosperity has come about
on $1.55 wheat. That is the price that has
been paid on the British contract to date. I
repeat that this prosperity on the prairie is
based on $1.55 wheat, and if the farmers of
Western Canada demand much in excess of
this price, they will only hasten the day when
the European farmer can also profitably
produce wheat at this high price, and will

MARCH 10, 1949
do so, for the European farm is becoming as
mechanized as the Canadian f armn. As most
of the honourable senators know, the Massey
Harris Company has a plant in England and
also in France, and so have other manufacturers of farm equipment.
At the Wheat Conference in Washington a
f ew weeks ago France indicated that she
would have about thirty million bushels of
surplus wheat ta seil. This is but one of the
European nations that wiil have wheat to sel
in campetition with Canada if we keep our
prices toa high. It has been stated that
Argentina was selling wheat about a year
aga at $3.50 a bushel, but the f armers were
receiviag much less than the farmers of
Canada. What happened in Argentina? I
understand that they have a real depression
on their hands there. Before the war Argentina shared with Canada the British market
for wheat. No one today hears Argentina
mentioned in connection with sales of wheat
to Britain. Britain has not forgotten that
our country supplied her with food at reasonable prices and at the samie time left aur own
farmers with reasonable profits. 1 arn sure
that Western Canada should and will be
able to raise wheat at a profit in competitian
with any country in the world. With mechan-

ized farrning and an abundant supply of ail,
what country is s0 blessed?
It is no new thought ta honourable senators
that Canadians are a blessed and fortunate
people. There are many among us who have
raised families in Canada. I think now of
the lavable senator from Clare (Hon. Mr.
Comeau), whose only sad moment seems to
be when he speaks of the two little children
taken from their circle in babyhaad. He
will forgive the personal reference, I arn
sure, for he is a fine example of a man wha
realizes and counts his blessings, as we
ail should do. When, every day in this
chamber we pray, "Give us this day aur
daily bread," we pray not only for ourselves
but for ail mankind. We could give this
prayer a real and practical meaning. Let us
be charitable ta other people less fartunate
than aurselves; such a course will in time,
I arn sure, pay handsame dividends, not in
big profits, perhaps, but in security for ail.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
when I adjourned the house until this afternoon, I did so with the intention of tabling,
concurrently with its tabling in the other
place, a copy of the North Atlantic Pact with
the resolution appended thereto. As honourable
senators have perhaps noticed in the press,
the tabling in the other place has been postponed until Friday afternoon at three o'clock.
Therefore I will ask the house to sit on
Friday afternoon of this week. In view of
the amount of legislation which is likely
to come to us between now and the end
of next week, when the Senate adjourns at
the end of this week I shall move that it
re-assemble on Monday afternoon at three
o'clock. I make this announcement so that
honourable senators may make their plans
accordingly.

of the honourable senators from every part
of Canada to the fact that there is a little
province called ManitobaSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and tell those senators

Honourable senators, I was never so proud
to be a Canadian as I was when watching
rinks from every province of Canada taking
part in that bonspiel. I am sure that if other
honourable senators had been there they
would have been just as proud as I was. It is
expected that teams from all ten provinces
will be represented at the competition to be
held in Vancouver next year.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill N-2, an Act to amend the
Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) to explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this bill amends the Exchequer Court Act in
three particulars, all of which should meet
with the approval of honourable senators.
The first amendment is to Section 18, which
has to do with the jurisdiction of the
Exchequer Court. The present wording of
this section is rather peculiar. It reads as
follows:
The Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction in ail cases in which demand is made
or relief sought in respect of any matter which
might, in England, be subject of a suit or action
against the Crown, and for greater certainty, but not
so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing
terms, it shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in
all cases in which the land, goods or money of the

MARCH 15, 1949
subject are in the possession of the Crown, or in

which the claim arises out of a contract entered

into by or on behalf of the Crown.
Honourable senators will observe that as the
section now reads it makes the jurisdiction of
our Exchequer Court subject, in some
respects, to what may be decided by the
British Parliament. It provides that the
Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction in
respect of any matters which in England
might be the subject of action against the
Crown.
I do not think that in our present position
this provision should remain on our statutes.
There is one particular reason why I do not
think so. I understand that in Great Britain
last year the British Parliament passed an
Act called the United Kingdom Crown Proceedings Act which, in effect, altered the
remedies which the subject might have
against the Crown; so as Section 18 of the
Exchequer Court Act now stands, the jurisdiction of our Exchequer Court may have
been altered by the British Parliament without any action by this parliament at all.
Honourable senators will see that the
amendment now proposed to section 18
simply leaves out the reference to jurisdiction in England and recites that:
The Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original

jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods or
money of the subject are in the possession of the
Crown, or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.
The second amendment, or rather series
of amendments, is proposed to be effected
by section 2 of the bill. Section 2 does three
things which I think should meet with the
approval of the Senate. Firstly, it extends
from thirty to sixty days the delay within
which an appeal may be lodged from a
decision of the Exchequer Court, thereby
bringing the period into line with the ordinary period which is allowed on appeals
from provincial courts to the Supreme Court.
Secondly, it introduces a provision for an
appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the
Exchequer Court, if a judge of the Supreme
Court permits an appeal from such interlocutory judgment. Then, in the third place,
it changes, simplifies and makes clearer the
procedure which is required to be followed
by an appellant upon an appeal from the
Exchequer Court. It provides that in any
ordinary appeal the appellant shall give
notice of his appeal to the other parties, that
he shal lodge his appeal with the registrar
of the Supreme Court, and that he shall file
a copy of the appeal with the registrar of
the Exchequer Court. Under section 82 of
the Act there has been a rather unusual
practice, which required the appellant to
give notice to the registrar of the Supreme

Court, and then required the registrar to set
the case down for hearing before notice had
been given to the other side. That is an
illogical and unusual way of proceeding, and
it is remedied by the changes proposed in
section 82 of the Act by section 2 of the bill
now before us.
Section 3 of the bill is merely a consequential amendment resulting from the
change in section 82.
Section 4 of the bill is designed to make
it quite clear that in making rules for the
practice and procedure of the Exchequer
Court the judges of that court may include
rules providing for the examination for discovery of officers of the Crown in cases to
which the Crown is a party; and that they
may also, as is the modem practice in our
provincial courts, make rules providing for
the medical examination of parties in respect
of whose injuries a claim has been made.
These are the changes that this bill proposes to make to the Exchequer Court Act.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I ask my
honourable friend one simple question for
information? What arrears of work are now
before the Exchequer Court in cases awaiting
decision, and for how long have these cases
been awaiting decision?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is a question
which I am unable to answer in the terms
in which it is asked; but I take it that this
bill will go to one of our standing committees,
where officers of the Department of Justice
will be present and no doubt will be able to
furnish the information required by my right
honourable friend. I can give only a partial
explanation, namely, that in 1946 this parliament, by legislation increased the number of
Exchequer Court judges from three to four,
and it is therefore to be hoped that any
arrears that existed at that time are being
met and caught up with at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Leger: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question for my own information? Is is not true that judgment upon a
demurrer is abolished under the Judicature
Act? I see that we have that kind of judgment referred to in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Does my friend refer
to the English Act?
Hon. Mr. Leger: To the provisions in all
the provinces. Paragraph (a) of subsection 1
of section 82 of the Act, as set out in section 2
of the bill, provides for appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada from a judgment upon a
demurrer.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am unable to answer
my honourable friend. There may be some

SENATE
language in this bill which requires correction. If my honourable friend will put his
question to the officers of the Department of
Justice when the bill is considered in committee, I am quite sure he will get a
satisfactory answer.

Hon. Mr. Haig moved that the bill be
referred to the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.

The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
10, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Farquhar
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. P. McIntyre: Honourable senators,
allow me first to congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I also wish to
associate myself with the leader of the government in this chamber (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and all other senators who have so cordially
welcomed the new members who now grace
this chamber.
The Speech from the Throne forecasts
legislation which is to come before both
Houses of Parliament of Canada, and provides
a wide range of discussion of which honourable members and senators can take full
advantage. I hope you will bear with me if I
do not follow the usual custom in this debate.
I have always listened with great attention
to the speeches which are delivered in this
chamber, and which are of a high order. I
have also read some of the speeches delivered
in the other place, and I have come to the
conclusion that at times some honourable
members there fall short of debating material,
because they see fit periodically to criticize
the activities of this chamber. I refer now to
supporters of the Co-operative Commonwealth
Federation, who in this respect, I suggest, are
great offenders. Probably it would be more
appropriate that those honourable members
should try to check up on some of their own
shortcomings before they undertake to criticize the Senate of Canada. Their proclaimed
policy of nationalizing industry if ever they
should gain power in this country has not, I
think, worked very well in the province of
Saskatchewan.
On this topic I have a clipping from the
Financial Post which, with the permission
of this chamber, I should like to have recorded
in Hansard.

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the standing committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL TRADE MARK BILL
CONCURRENCE

IN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill C,
an Act respecting the Application of a
National Trade Mark to commodities and
respecting the true description of commodities.
Hon. J. E. Sinclair: Honourable senators,
I move concurrence in the amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John T. Haig moved the second reading of Bill M-2, an Act to incorporate the
North West Commercial Travellers' Association of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, under this
bill the commercial travellers of Manitoba
are asking a Dominion charter for what is
now and has been for many years a local
fraternal organization. Each member pays
so much into the organization, and upon his
death the funeral expenses are taken care of
and a sum of money is paid to his widow.
The members now wish to come under the
federal insurance law. When the bill has
been given second reading, I intend to move
that it be referred to committee, where members of the organization will be present to
make the necessary explanations.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

ADDRESS IN REPLY

Four years ago the C.C.F. Government of Saskatchewan started taking over private industry. In the
face of repeated warnings from those of experience,
substantial sums of taxpayers' money was used to
acquire or start six purely commercial undertakings.
These were a couple of fish processing plants, a
shoe factory, a brick plant, and a box factory.
Today half of these ventures, the first three, are
closed down and Premier Douglas himself admits
that there is grave doubt about the Government

MARCH 15, 1949
ever reopening them. He also admits that the other
three have yet to prove themselves successful. And
this admission comes during a period when the
whole country was never more prosperous, when
purchasing power was never stronger. How long
such uneconomic ventures would have lasted in
normal times, it would not be hard to guess.
In the meantime, scores of workers have lost their
jobs in the middle of winter and in a province
where industrial jobs have always been scarce. Lost
too, have been large sums of public money which,
if not used for legitimate government expenditures
on such things as schools and roads, might better
have been left with the taxpayers for private investment.

MARCH 15, 1949
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The farmers of Saskatchewan have been paying income tax ever
since 1917. A lot of them filed returns
immediately after the law came into force,
and they have been paying ever since.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: The farmers of Saskatchewan may be more enlightened than those
in other provinces. I do not think that
farmers in other provinces were aware that
they were required to do this.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They should have been
aware. Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: I know that, but the
farmers did not keep account of their revenues
and expenditures, and therefore were not in
a position to make their returns. I suppose
many of them did not know they had to
make returns at all. My honourable friend
himself has of course filed his returns, but if
be looked around his province be would
probably find many farmers who have not
done so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable gentleman answer me a question?
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: If I can.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What proportion does the
number of inspectors in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario bear to the number of
farmers in each of those provinces?
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: I never looked it up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I suggest to you that there
are more inspectors in Saskatchewan than
there are in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: If that is so it indicates,
not that the farmers in Saskatchewan are
crooks, but that probably more inspectors are
needed to make them obey the law.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but the government is
after them to make them pay.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: In Prince Edward
Island we have only one inspector.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There should be a good
many more.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: When officials ask a
farmer how much be made in 1942, 1943,
1944 or 1945, he does not know, because be
kept no records. If farmers do make returns
for those years they have to guess, and I
claim that they should not have to pay any
income tax in those circumstances. If any
returns were made for any year prior to
1946, and any taxes were paid on those
returns, the moneys should be refunded.

Moreover, honourable senators, I say that
if the department is not able to assess returns
in the year in which they are made, the
returns should stand. There should be no
going back into the records of an individual
or corporation for five or six years.
One other matter that I would like to bring
to the attention of the leader of the government is the financial position of civil servants
who retired not later than ten years ago. In
those days salaries were generally much
lower than they are at present, and the civil
servants who retired then were given a considerably smaller allowance than is being
paid to those in their respective classes who
retire today. In many cases the pension paid
to people who retired ten years ago is not
sufficient to buy the necessities of life at
present high costs. The leader of the government in this chamber is also a member of
the cabinet, and I would suggest that he bring
this matter to the attention of his colleagues
and recommend that a bonus be paid to civil
servants who retired not later than ten years
ago, and that this bonus be continued until
such time as the cost of living comes down
to normal. Railwaymen who retired on small
superannuation ten years ago and before are
in the same situation. The wages of those
days were low as compared with today's
standard, and many of those people are finding it hard to make ends meet. They too
should be paid a bonus until the cost of
living comes down to normal.
I would like to commend the Department of
Fisheries, the Deputy Minister of Fisheries
and Mr. McNaught, the Parliamentary
Assistant to the Minister, for co-operating
with Prince Edward Island members of the
House of Commons and senators in rearranging the time within which lobster fishermen
may run their lines out in the gulf. For many
years prior to last year the law and the
practice were that lobster fishermen could not
leave the shore until six o'clock in the morning; but last year, through some misunderstanding or some action by somebody who did
not know anything about the matter, this
hour was changed to 12 o'clock midnight. At
that time of night landmarks around the
shore are not visible, and furthermore the
small boats used by some fishermen cannot
easily be seen and would be in danger of
being run down by speed boats. Now the hour
has been shifted back to 6 o'clock in the morning. That is satisfactory to all concerned, and
I am glad that it has been done.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I do not think that
any political feeling should be displayed in
this chamber, nor should any prejudices be
exhibited by anyone here. In our hands lies
the destiny of this vast Dominion, and great
would be the pity if anything should intervene to prevent us from carrying on the
traditions and activities of the Senate in
accordance with the noble objective which
the Fathers of Confederation had in mind.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.

STATUTE LAW AMENDMENT
(NEWFOUNDLAND) BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Beauregard presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 12, an Act to amend the
Statute Law.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of
reference of March 8, 1949, examined the said
bill, and now beg leave to report the same
without any amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, I was called out at the last moment
from this morning's meeting of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, which considered
the Bankruptcy Act at considerable length.
I wonder if I might ask the chairman of
the committee about the title of the bill now
before us. I do this for purposes of information and not at all by way of criticism. I do
not wish to enter into any argument at all,
but it would appear to me, honourable senators, that a particular bill, dealing largely
with the provisions of a particular agreement,
should not be entitled "An Act to amend the
Statute Law of Canada", because the statute
law of Canada consists of more than a thousand statutes. I suppose the law officers could
inform us why this appellation was given to
the measure. It seems to me a most peculiar
procedure to amend the entire statute law of
Canada by a measure dealing with a particular
agreement, the agreement between Canada
and Newfoundland. There may be a very
good reason for this, and my good friend
the chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr.
Beauregard), who is a lawyer, probably will
be able to explain it.
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: The only answer
I can give is to be found in section 1 of the
bill itself, which reads:
This Act may be cited as the Statute Law Amendment (Newfoundland) Act.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: The short title
is what?

Hon. Mr. Beauregard: That is what I have
just been reading.
Righ± Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: The right title
of the bill, as I understand it, is "An Act to
amend the Statute Law of Canada".
Hon. Mr. Beauregard: Section 1 of the bill
says:
This Act may be cited as the Statute Law Amendment (Newfoundland) Act.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: That is all right.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it your pleasure to adopt the motion for
third reading of this bill?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
read the third time.
Righ± Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: On a question
of privilege, I must object to saying that we
are passing an Act to amend the Statute Law.
I say it is not an Act to amend the Statute
Law, but it is an Act to amend the Statute
Law in certain particulars, with reference
to the Newfoundland agreement. It should
not be cited, as it has been by the Assistant
Clerk, as an Act to amend the Statute Law
of Canada. I wish to register my objection
to that appellation.
The Hon. the Speaker: I did not understand
that my right honourable friend wished to
delay passage of the bill. The bill has been
given third reading. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators to pass the bill?
The bill was passed.
PRIVATE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Beauregard presented the report

Commerce on Bill L-2, an Act respecting the
Pension Fund Society of the Bank of

He said: Honourable senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of
reference of March 10, 1949, examined the
said bill, and now beg leave to report the
same without any amendment.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the third reading
of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
SUPREME COURT BUILDING
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Farris inquired of the government:
1. What was the cost of the Supreme Court Building?

SENATE
2. What are the facilities in the library;
(a) for rooms for lawyers, giving privacy and
quiet when reading their reports?
(b) rooms for the librarians and their staffs?
(c) for bringing books to the Supreme Court room
and other court rooms?
(d) for replacing the books of the library at the
disposal of judges and lawyers requiring their use?
3. What is the cost of the lighting system in the
Supreme Court room and in other court rooms?
4. What provision is being made or intended to be
made to provide a modern lighting system for use
in court rooms and judges' rooms?
5. How many clocks are in the ante-rooms of the
Supreme Court room?
6. How many clocks in the Supreme Court room?
Where located?
7. How many toilets in the building:
(a) for men?
(b) for women?
8. How many showers in the building, and the cost
of each?
9. What provision has been made for lockers for
barristers and where located:
(a) how many in oak?
(b) how many in soft wood, out of keeping with
the architecture of the building?
10. How long is it intended to use rough planking
in the main hallway across the marble steps?
11. How much in commissions or fees have been
paid the architect?
12. What are the approximate dimensions and cost
of the entrance chamber?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: The answer is as
follows:
1. $2,870,244.34.
2. (a) Four carrels have been provided for
lawyers in the original plans for bookstacks,
rooms Nos. 90, 91, 92, 93, and, adjoining the
original attorneys' locker room and lounge,
four private rooms, under lock and key, were
provided for the use of lawyers: rooms Nos.
35, 36, 37 and 38. However, with the idea
of segregating the attorneys of the Supreme
Court from those of the Exchequer Court, the
present Registrar has decided to abandon
these four rooms and replace them by rooms
Nos. 157 and 153 with a new lounge in room
No. 171 and new locker room in No. 155.
(b) Librarians' offices are rooms Nos. 87 and
88, now occupied by temporary shelving.
The attendants are to have desks in the
reading room.
(c) The former Chief Justice Sir Lyman
Duff was of the opinion that no trucks were
to enter the court room. Books were to be
brought in a book truck, using freight elevator No. D to a vestibule, No. 44, next to the
Court and, for a distance of thirty feet, carried by hand to the attorney's tables. The
present registrar has decided that, for the
greater conveniçnce of the messengers, the
truck should be brought in the Court, entering by the main entrance of the Court. As
a result, it is necesary to make an additional
travel of 350 feet bridging over steps, opening four doors and risking damage to the
furniture and carpets. It is doubtful that this

means less exertion for the messengers, and
certainly does not enhance the dignity of the
Court.
(d) When the program is completed, the
four carrels adjacent to the bookstacks as
mentioned in (a) will be at the disposal of
the lawyers. The judges will have their
recess room, No. 195, and conference room,
No. 295, with direct access to the bookstacks.
Note: The present installation of the
library is only temporary, the shelving of
the bookstacks is not yet installed with the
consequence that the reading room and
adjoining space are crowded with temporary
shelving.
3. This cannot be answered at present, as
the lighting system is not completed as yet.
It is unfair to judge the lighting of the court
in the state in which it was left when all
work was stopped at the beginning of the
war. The work is progressing as fast as
industry can supply the material.
4. In Supreme Court room No. 139, the
original lighting system is completed since
February 1. Six movable desk lamps have
still to be delivered. In the two Exchequer
Court rooms, Nos. 8 and 9, the installation is
in progress. For the judges' rooms, a sample
fixture has been set up in room 277, since
February 1. It gives an illumination level
of 40 foot-candles at desk height. However,
the approval of the judges has not yet been
received.
5. One in room No. 137 and one in room
No. 138. It must be pointed out that these
are located at a distance of 15 feet from the
clock of the court room and consequently
did not entail the expense of a special circuit
and wiring.
6. One clock is located above the entrance
in full view of the five judges and the other
officers of the court. For the convenience
of the attorneys it is intended to have a small
clock on their lectern.
7. (a) For men: Each judge has his private
toilet. There are also two toilets off the common robing room No. 188, one toilet for anteroom No. 137, four toilets in rooms Nos. 30
and 31, adjacent to attorneys' lounge, three
toilets in room No. 23 adjacent to men's
cloakroom of the main floor, three toilets in
room No. 123 adjacent to men's cloakroom
of the first floor, two toilets for messengers in
room No. 223, two toilets in room No. 125
adjacent to new attorneys' locker room No.
155 formerly room for the Press, one toilet
each in rooms Nos. 035, 036, 025, 026, 019 and
022 for maintenance staff and superintendent, and two toilets in rooms Nos. 323 and
353 for men employees working on the third
floor.

MARCH 16, 1949
(b) For women: One toilet for anteroom
No. 136, three toilets adjacent to women's
cloakroom No. 20 main floor, three toilets
adjacent to women's cloakroom No. 120 first
floor, two toilets in room No. 223 adjacent to
secretaries' locker room, and two toilets in
room No. 322 for women employees working
on the third floor.
8. One shower in each of the judges' toilets
or thirteen showers at $210 each. (This was
demanded by the former Chief Justice. This
arrangement exists at the Supreme Court of
Washington and in some other court houses
in the United States. The present group of
judges may not have the same requirement.)
9 (a) Twenty in room No. 34 and eighteen
in new location in room No. 155.
(b) None.
10. As long as, against the architect's protest, the distribution of books to the court is
made by the extra long circuit of 350 feet
instead of the 30 feet originally intended and
that on the doubtful pretext of saving
exertion for the messengers.
11. Five per cent of $2,870,244.34, or $143,512.22, fees as architect and engineer of the
building.
12. It is supposed that this refers to the
main hall of the building. The dimensions
are:
Length ......... 109 feet.
Width .......... 53 feet.
Area ........... 5,777 sq. ft.
Volume ........ 231,080 cubic feet.
The cost is $120,161.60.
GOVERNMENT WHEAT POLICY
CORRECTION OF PRESS REPORT

Hon. J. P. McIntyre: Honourable senators,
I wish to correct a report in this morning's
press, in which these words appear:
Defending government wheat policy, Senator
McIntyre said George Drew, Progressive Conservative Leader, had made "sweeping statements" that
prairie farmers would lose $500,000,000 because of
the prices in the British food contracts.

I did not say any such thing. I said the
statements had been made by the honourable
leader of the opposition in this house (Hon.
Mr. Haig).

SECOND READING POSTPONED

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill P-2, an Act respecting the
Incorporation of Pure-bred Live Stock Record
Associations.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I had arranged with an honourable senator
who is familiar with this measure to explain
it. Unfortunately he will not be in the chamber before Monday next. I therefore ask the
indulgence of the house to allow the order
to stand until that date.
The order stands.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill Q-2, an Act to incorporate the
Sisters of Saint Elizabeth Hospital.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is in
the form usual for measures of this kind; in
fact, it has been drawn on the lines of several
other bills of the same nature. The object of
incorporation is to enable this order to build
hospitals in other parts of Canada than the
province of Saskatchewan.
At the present time the Sisters of St.
Elizabeth have hospitals at Humboldt, Cudworth and Macklin, all in the province of
Saskatchewan. I could inform you of the bed
capacity, the number of sisters, nurses and
novices employed, and so on, but perhaps it
would be better to do this when the bill goes
before a committee. If there are any questions which honourable senators wish to ask
now, I can answer them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Aseltine moved that the bill be
referred to the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.

the following clause: "This Act may be cited and the motion of Hon. Mr. Farquhar for an
as the Statute Law Amendment (Newfound- Address in reply thereto.

SENATE
Hon. John C. Davis: Honourable senators,
it is with mingled emotions that I rise in my
place for the first time in this honourable
body, to speak to the motion for an Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Initially I want to compliment the mover and
seconder of this Address upon the distinguished manner in which they acquitted
themselves, particularly my friend the
honourable senator from Clare (Hon. Mr.
Comeau), who described his ancestral attachment to the soil of his native province.
Representing as I do a central province of
the Dominion of Canada, the province of
Manitoba, one matter which comes to my
mind is the concern caused by the proposed
transfer of the administrative office of TransCanada Air Lines from an isolated position
in the city of Winnipeg to a site in the congested area of the city of Montreal, where the
executive and administrative officials will be
housed in the new Aviation Building which is
in close proximity to the Central Station of
the Canadian National Railways. This concentration of personnel is both unfair and
unnecessary.
I want to read into the records of this body,
and to associate myself with a statement,
made by the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce
on February 22 last:
Whereas it bas been announced that it is proposed
to remove the operating headquarters of TransCanada Air Lines from Greater Winnipeg to Montreal-such operating headquarters now being located
at the St. James-Winnipeg Airport;
And whereas the contemplated removal which
involves 155 employees and their families, including
the president, general manager, some 40 senior
executives of several departments, plus 115 other
employees, would be a serious blow to Greater
Winnipeg and Manitoba, and work a hardship on
the personnel involved;
And whereas representations made to directors of
Trans-Canada Air Lines and others have not elicited
any substantial reasons to justify such removal;
And whereas the contemplated transfer would further accentuate the concentration of industry, population and payrolls in the East to the detriment of
the West, and the further dislocation of the nation's
economy, the acceleration of ibis policy during the
war having resulted in the permanent loss to the
Prairie Provinces of many thousands of young
people, mostly skilled workers, and directly contributed to the "population ratio" which has entailed
a reduction in the parliamentary representation of
the said provinces;
And whereas the essential requirements of war
needs and the present needs of national defence
have proven the worth of air development in Western Canada to our whole national welfare;
And whereas no factual information has yet been
advanced that the proposed administrative change
would effect any worthwhile operating economy.
But on the contrary:(a) While Trans-Canada Air Lines was established
as a transcontinental system with headquarters in
Montreal, its operating headquarters were subsequently transferred to Winnipeg, the centre of tbe
continent, as the most suitable place for the efficient
and economic operation of the system.

(b) Trans-Canada Air Lines now bas ample space
in Winnipeg to accommodate all officials and staff.
(c) The removal to Montreal would entail occupying office space there involving a greatly increased
expenditure.
(d) The removal of employees from a lower to a
higher expense area would result in greatly increased expenses in operation and additions to the
already large operating deficit with no apparent
compensating operating benefits.
(e) The operations of Trans-Canada Air Lines
within Canada constitute a major portion of its
business in that the domestic service during 1948
carried 537,000 passengers, 5,685,000 pounds of mail,
and 3,722,000 pounds of cargo. The overseas flights
accommodated only 31,500 passengers, 223,000 pounds
of mail, and 667,000 pounds of cargo.
(f) A year-end press release by Trans-Canada Air
Lines indicates the immediate revenue prospects
are uncertain in the two new international air
services instituted in 1948 to Bermuda and the
British West Indies, respectively.
(g) While it might be a matter of convenience to
officials of the Canadian National Railways and
others to have all officials of Trans-Canada Air Lines
in Montreal, this matter of convenience should not
outweigh the matter of economic operation.
And whereas the removal in 1947 of the traffic
department, comprising some 40 employees from
Manitoba to Montreal is now cited as a reason for
the transfer of other departments;
And whereas the proposed removal of the 155
executive officers and other employees of TransCanada Air Lines now contemplated from Manitoba
to Montreal is likely to result in the removal of
other departments and employees to Montreal, leaving Winnipeg as a maintenance centre only for part
of the operations;
Therefore be it resolved, and it is hereby resolved
that the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce protest
most emphatically against the proposal to remove
the operating headquarters and officers and employees of Trans-Canada Air Lines from Manitoba to
Montreal, and urgently request that the decision to
make such a removal be reconsidered and the plan
abandoned.
Winnipeg, Manitoba, February 22nd, 1949.

I heartily endorse this representation.
There would seem to be no justifiable
reason why this additional concentration of
administrative control should go into one
of the two great taxworthy areas of the
Dominion of Canada. It has been pointed
out that the two provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, on account of the accumulation of
head offices in these two central districts,
collect 90 per cent of the total corporation
taxes of the Dominion of Canada, thus leaving
to minor provinces the remaining 10 per cent
with which to maintain their administrative,
educational and other services.
But there is a more serious aspect to this
situation than the mere economic one. I have
in my hand a pamphlet, published in the
United States in 1946 by the Government
Printing Office in Washington, entitled "The
United States Strategic Bombing Survey." It
outlines the effect of the atomic bombing on
the Japanese centres of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The first atomic bombing of Hiroshima occurred at 0815 on the
morning of August 6. Nagasaki was bombed

MARCH 16, 1949
three days later. It is interesting to note at
this time, and to read into our records, the
effect of this revolutionary blast. One plane
exploded a bomb over Hiroshima, a city of
340,000 people and a population density of
35,000 per square mile. As a result 4.7 square
miles of the municipality were completely
destroyed, the killed and missing totalled
between 70,000 and 80,000, and the injured a
like number. The mortality per square mile
was 15,000 and the casualty rate was 32,000
per square mile.
It is fair to point out that this was in the
infancy of the development of this most
destructive agency, and we are reliably
informed that the potential destruction by
this apparatus has been immeasurably
increased since then. This dastard apparatus
of war is so fantastic that the ordinary mind
finds it inconceivable, and I would hardly
find it comprehensible myself were it not that
I have been reading a United States government report, which is supported by a similar
document of the Government of Great
Britain, published by His Majesty's Stationery Office in London in 1946.
Let us apply the pattern of Hiroshima to
the concentrated district of the city of
Montreal, to which it is proposed to move
the executive and control offices of the TransCanada Air Lines. An atomic bomb with no
more potency than the Hiroshima apparatus
would wipe out the head offices of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the directional offices
of the Canadian National Railways and of
the Trans-Canada Airlines, the Sun Life
Insurance Company, McGill University, the
Royal Bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal,
and a large part of the harbour area.
The recommendations in these reports are
that control, essential personnel, equipment
and buildings be decentralized.
This transfer of the administrative offices
of Trans-Canada Air lines from their isolated
position in Winnipeg to the new Aviation
Building in Montreal is a permanent move.
It is a move, not for one generation, but for
a long time to come. I place it before you
honourable senators, as the height of absurdity and foolhardiness to increase the longterm hazard and peril to Canada by further
concentrating the administrative control of
transportation to one city centre.
For further illustration, and not to conjure
up a bogey, suppose a similar bomb were to
be dropped or exploded anywhere near these
Parliament Buildings. You would have the
following result: complete destruction of the
Centre Block, East Block, West Block, Confederation Building, Justice Building, Supreme
Court, Temporary War buildings to the west,
Chateau Laurier, Navy Headquarters, Air
Force Headquarters, Army Headquarters, etc.

As far as I have been informed through
technical magazines-and I am an engineer
by profession and a pseudo-scientist by avocation-the explosive parts of the bomb consist
of two semi-globes, each about the size of a
half-coconut, and these must be brought into
immediate and forceful contact with one
another to start the chain reaction of explosion with the instantaneous production of
inconceivably high pressures, temperatures,
and destructive radiations. It is not even
necessary that this bomb be dropped from an
airplane. The two parts of the explosive
globe might separately be brought to the site
by any of a number of other means. It is
conceivable that the immunity of a diplomatic dispatch case might serve the dire
purpose. Arranging the compressed contact
of these two parts with one another should
not be a very difficult engineering problem.
The ordinary lighting circuit might be used
for such purpose, or hydraulic pressure, or
even a fanatical zealot with a martyr complex
and a sledge hammer might do the trick.
During the height of the storm of Hitler's
first air attack on Great Britain, Winston
Churchill at a secret session of the House of
Commons recommended that the meetings of
that body be held at irregular intervals,
advancing as a reason therefor the embarrassment that the British Government would
be put to if it were immediately confronted
with the simultaneous necessity of holding
one hundred by-elections. Imagine the inconvenience it would be to a Canadian war
effort, and defence against a Pearl Harbour
type of attack, if the members of this body
and of the other place, along with the Cabinet
and all the control officers in our defence
forces and auxiliary services and the administrators of this country, should suddenly disappear with all their records. Dispersal of
government personnel and administration
may take a long time, and it just might
happen that it is not now too early to start
consideration of it. I have in mind, not the
conditions of the last war, but the probable
conditions of a future war.
I can quite conceive that honourable senators might consider it necessary for the
country's welfare to provide, by rules of this
house, for a rotation of attendances and
absences of members. On a Sunday afternoon, for instance, the stipend in absentia
for an honourable senator who spent that
time in Toronto might be greater than if he
spent his time in the city of Hull. Let us
not be too lugubrious.
It is interesting, however, to speculate on
the Toronto situation. One bomb there could
wipe out the Toronto General Hospital, all
the provincial government buildings, the
cream of Ontario youth at the University of

SENATE
Toronto, and the control of various important
financial and industrial organizations.
My own city of Winnipeg is doing what
to my mind is a very foolish and dangerous
thing from the long-term point of view. For
the purpose of medical efficiency it is
assembling or attempting to assemble, all its
hospital services, along with the medical
college, in one spot to be called the Medical
Health Centre. Well, Hiroshima had a medical health centre, and when that city was
bombed the effect, according to the American
report, was as follows:
The status of medical facilities and personnel
dramatically illustrates the difficulty facing the

authorities.

Of almost 200 doctors in Hiroshima

before the attack, over 90 per cent were casualties
and only 30 physicians were able to perform their
normal duties a month after the raid. Out of 1,780
nurses, 1,654 were killed or injured. Though some
stocks of supplies had been dispersed, many were
destroyed. Only three out of forty-five hospitals
could be used, the two large army hospitals being
rendered unusable.
Honourable senators, we are either in the
atomic age and subject to its effects, or we
are not. If we are in the atomic age, the
perseverence in routine concentration of
administrative personnel and facilities, and
of transportation, government offices, parliament, hospitals and medical services, is
dangerous, and we should not allow the mere
inertia of our thinking of the present day to
prevent us from taking remedial measures

while we have time.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, may I congratulate
the senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) who has already spoken on the subject
of Canadian culture.
I should also like to endorse the sincere
congratulations he has offered to the government when he praised the dual culture which
exists in this bilingual country.
Everybody knows that I am of English and
Irish descent. As my wife is a FrenchCanadian and as my children are bilingual,
I think I am in a postion to appreciate the
two chief races of the country. I have much
admiration for the survival of the FrenchCanadian race; I bow before this phenomenon
which has been going on from the days of
New France to the present time. I would be
remiss in my duty if I did not claim equal
rights for the French and the English
languages. Honourable senators, I hope you
will bear with me, but I wish to pay proper
tribute to the two great races represented in
this house, which, traditionally, bas assumed
a protective role in respect to the rights
granted by England to every section of our
country.

(Text):
Honourable senators, you have been most
kind. As I rose in my place for the first
time, I stated that I felt various emotions
crowding my breast. Some fifty years ago I
started on my education. Since then I have
wandered and made many contacts with the
human race on this North American continent, and I have ever felt that I was in the
continuous process of always learning. The
feeling presses upon me that this chamber is
my last classroom and that you, honourable
senators, are my last companions and my
last teachers. Fifty years ago, following one
month's schooling, after a little act before an
audience, I was taught by a little old teacher
in a little old school on a little old street to
recite a little old ditty. It is, of course, very
bad poetry, and it may be in worse taste, but
I would like to paraphrase it and apply it to
the present situation.
I am the newest boy in school,
As you have readily seen just now;
And fondly I hope this body long may rule,
As thus I make my maiden bow.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
before the debate on the Address is completed, I should like to speak on two or three
subjects which I have in mind. Before doing
so, however, I wish to congratulate the
mover and the seconder of the Address, and
also to welcome to this chamber those senators recently appointed, from whom we
expect much in the future.
My first remarks will be directed to that
and controversial subject,
much-debated
wheat.
Hon. Mr. Hushion: Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: We have heard much
about the growing, marketing and all the
other aspects of wheat in the debates of this
chamber and those of the other place; also,
Royal Commissions have been appointed to
investigate the Grain Exchange.
As honourable senators know. for the past
thirty years I have been greatly interested in
the growing and marketing of wheat, and
I can assure honourable members that it is a
most interesting business. I was so involved
in the growing of wheat that just before New
Year's Day 1934 I was appointed to this chamber to represent the wheat growers of the
province of Saskatchewan. Therefore, I feel it
is my duty to answer some of the criticisms
which have been made in this chamber of
the speech delivered by the honourable leader
on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig).
First, I should like to clear up some confusion that appears to exist about the price

MARCH 18, 1949
the farmer receives for his wheat. When it
is stated that he gets $1.25 a bushel, that
is not exactly correct. That is the price at
Fort William, Vancouver or Churchill, and it
includes the freight, elevator and other handling charges connected with the transfer of
the grain to the shipping point.
Those
charges amount to about 18 cents a bushel.
Under these circumstances the farmer does
not receive $1.25 a bushel, but rather $1.07.
That is for No. 1 wheat. Should the wheat
be No. 2, he gets 3 cents a bushel less, and
for No. 3 6 cents less, and so on down the
line. We have talked a good deal about
$1.55 wheat, and now we speak of $2.00
wheat. In each case the farmer receives 18
cents less than the quoted price. I should
point out that Manitoba seems to be a
favoured province in this respect.
The
farmers there are dloser to the head of the
lakes than are the Saskatchewan farmers, and
therefore get 7 or 8 cents a bushel more than
we do.
Han. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think the question concerning the prîce has been cleared Up. As
I develop my remarks and refer to the price
of wheat, honourable senators will bear in
mind that the figure quoted is reduced by the
handling charges.
When I spoke on this subject two years ago
I referred to the fact that we had at that time
four different prices for wheat in Canada.
First, there was the price to the miller, of 77
and a fraction cents a bushel; second, the price
the farmer received for the wheat deliverei
to the miller, of $1.25 a bushel; third, the
price being paid by Great Britain, of $1.55 a
bushel; and last, the world price for what we
caîl No. 2 wheat, which was the price received
by the Canadian Wheat Board for wheat
exported to countries other than Great
Britain.
Hon. Mr. Howden: My honourable friend
quoted the first three figures. Will hie also
quote the fourth figure?
Han. Mr. Aseltine: The last figure has been
as high as $3 and some cents a bushel.
According to the Winnipeg Free Press of Saturday last, No. 2 wheat was being exported
to countries other than Great Britain at $2.19
a bushel.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: My honourable friend
should not cail it No. 2 wheat, but rather
Class 2 wheat. No. 2 means No. 2 Northern.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I stand corrected. It is
Class 2 wheat, but it may be No. 1 Northern
or No. 1 Hard. I rather expected that the
honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson) and perhaps the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
29091-13

would take part in this debate. I was hopeful
that they would, because I think their views
with respect to this subject do not differ
greatly from mine.
I may say that the honourable leader on
this side, before he made his speech a few
weeks ago, obtained from the Canadian
Wheat Board certain facts and figures, some of
which I propose to use today. I wish to
point out that the figures with respect to
numbers of bushels and prices are those
which he obtaîned, but the subtraction and
the multiplication is my own.
In 1946 we grew a large quantity of wheat
-the figures are not important-and we sold
169 million bushels, in wheat and flour, to
Great Britain under the wheat agreement.
The price was $1.55 a bushel, but the average
world price for Class 2 wheat during the
saine period was $2.44J.
The difference
between these two prices is 891 cents a
bushel. If we multiply 169 million by 891
cents we get $150,410,000, which is the amount
the farmers would have received had the
wheat been sold at the world price.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And if it could have
been sold at the world price.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In 1947 we sold 170
million bushels to Great Britain under the
wheat agreement. The price was $1.55 per
bushel, and the average world price, which
had gone up from the previolis year, was
$2.881 per bushel. The result is that on every
bushel of wheat sold under the wheat agreement to Britain the farmers lost $1.33J. When
you multiply 170 million bushels by $1.33j,
you get $226,100,000.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Has the honourable
senator information as to how much wheat
was sold as Class 2 in that saine year?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes: 77 .8 million bushels
in 1946, 19.3 million bushels in 1947, and, as
estimated, 84 million bushels in 1948. Add
$150,410,000 to $226,100,000 and you get a total
loss of $376,510,000. This is a lot more than
the. 17 cents per bushel mentioned yesterday
by the honourable senator f rom Mount
Stewart (Hon. Mr. Mclntyre). Had he lived
on the boundary between Saskatchewan and
the United States hie would have found that
during all thîs period the farmer on the
Canadian side got $1.50 less per bushel for his
wheat than the farmer a mile away, across
the line.
In addition to sales of wheat to the United
Kingdom and to the world at large we must
reckon domestic sales. In 1946-47 78.8 million
bushels were sold for domnestic purposes. For
this the farmer obtained, from August 1, 1946
to February 17, 1947, $1.25 per bushel, and
from February 17, 1947 to July 31, 1947, $1.55

SENATE
per bushel. I have been unable to obtain
information as to the quantity the farmer
delivered for domestic purposes in each of
these periods, but I amn assuming that he
received $1.55 during the whole year, though
this is considerably more than he actuaily
obtained. On this basîs, if you multiply the
price by the bushelage, you will find that his
losses on domestic sales for the year amounted
to $73 million. In the 1947-48 crop year 77-7
million bushels were delivered to the Wheat
Board and sold for domestic purposes at $1.55,
representing a loss per bushel of $1.33à, a
total of $103,341,000. This, added to the $73
million for 1946, totals $200 million, and if
the amount of which the grower was deprived
on domestic sales is added to the figures I
have previously given, the grand total considerably exceeds the $500 million which the
honourable leader o! the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) mentioned in his speech. I think
I have made this very clear. If not, I have
plenty of figures to back up what I have
said.
I propose now to deal with the safety
clause, and the argument of certain eastern
newspapers and some honourable senators
on the floor of this chamber that if the
Canadian Wheat Board had thrown on the
market 160 million bushels of wheat in 1946
and a similar amount in 1947 the market
would have been broken and the price would
have gene down. I say that that is not correct, because during that whole period there
ýv7& a scarcity o! food. While it is quite
possible that the price might have been
depressed a littie, it could not have gone down
very much. It must be remembered too that
during that period xvhile Britain was paying
us $1.55 per bushel, she was buying wheat
fromn other countries for as much as $4 per
bushel.
It is not often in making a speech that I
quote from newspapers, but I have in my
hand a page removed from a great western
newspaper, the Winnipeg Free Press, which
on most issues is such a strong supporter of
the present Government of Canada that I
hope I may be allowed to read into the record
an extract frorn the issue of February 28, 1949,
dealing with this safety clause and the argument, to which I have just referred, that the
market would have gone down if large
amounts of wheat had been offered. Here is
what this paper has to say:
The United Kirigdom-Canada Wheat Agreement
contains a clause which is supposed to protect
Canadian farmers against losa in the first two years
of the contract-that is, f£rom August 1 1 1946, until
July 31, 1948. In this period the Agreement required
Canada to deliver to the U.K. 160 million bushels
per year at $1.55 per bushel.
The safety clause
provided that if this price proved to be lower than
the world price then the British government would

"have regard to" the loss in fixing the prices for
the last two years of the contract. The $1.55 price
in those two years did prove to be a losing price to
the amount of $330 millions.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my honourable friend? 1 think he will find that this
statement refers to the British contract and
agrees with his figures.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I thought mine were
higher than that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1 do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The extract continues:
Those in Canada who defend this agreement somnetimes argue that it is not possible to calculate the
loas in that way. They dispute the existence of a
world price. They argue that if the 320 million
bushels delivered to the United Kingdom in the
crop years 1946-47 and 1947-48 had been put on the
world market, the world price would have collapsed
like a deck of cards.
0f course, people who argue in this way must go
further and declare that the "have regard to"
clause in the Wheat Agreement was worthless and
that therefore, the Canadian wheat producer neyer
had any protection against loas. Moreover, this
argument means that because the Canadian producer
took less, every other wheat exporting country was
able to charge more than would otherwise have been
possible.
This, of course, would not please the
wheat farmer. It would mean that under the Wheat
Agreement, he has held the bag for everybody else.
There is, however, no virtue in this argument.
Tnere is no reason to suppose that the Wheat
Board's Class 2 or world price in these crop years
would have been significantly lower if the 320
million bushels ef wheat had been sold under it.
Why tis is so is clear in the figures on world wheat
production for this period. They are available in
the November statistical abstract of the Bank cf
Canada.
Honourable senators, when a fariner sows

is crop he takes quite
net harvest any crop at
te contend with frost,
grasshoppers and many

a gamble. He may
all because he has
rust,

drought,

hail,

other handicaps. I
have also been told that the farmer used to
garnble a bit on the Grain Exchange, and
lost money in that way; but ne one ever
expected that the government of this country
would gamble in wheat. I hold that the
agreement our gevernment made with Great
Britain for the sale of our wheat at fire-sale
prices was the gi catest wheat gamble of alI
times. I have always had the utmost respect
for our present Minister of Agriculture. We
attended the saine uriversity together and
played on opposing cellege football teamns.
At that tim-e he was a great debater-he stiil
is; but since hie entered into this agreement
I have lest my confidence in him.
I do net blame the minister entirely for
what he advised the government te do. I
blame the heads of the wheat pools in Western Canada. It has been stated in this house,
in the press and elsewhere that hie took hîs
advice from the heads of these pools, but
these people did net represent ail the wheat
growers of Western Canada. I amn a member

MARCH 16, 1949
of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool myseif, but
1 was neyer consulted ini the matter and I
did not know anything about the Wheat
Agreement until it was signed and the story
was published in the newspapers. As I say,
perhaps we cannot blame the Minister of
Agriculture as much as we otherwise would
for having accepted this bad advice, but both
he and the government should have known
that following every war the price of wheat
goes up and stays up for some time.
What happened after the Crimean War, the
Boer War and the First Great War? Surely
the same thing could have been expected
to happen after the Second World War. In
fact, it is exactly what occurred. Wheat flot
only went Up in price, but it stayed up; and
as 1 told my honourable friend f romn St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden), class 2 wheat was
selling for $2.19 a bushel last Saturday.
1 imagine the Minister of Agriculture would
be the happiest man in this country if, before
the next election, wheat should drop in price
as he expected it to do. The honourable
senator from Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood) stated
the other day that the government expected
wheat to go down in price and that is why
the government made the wheat agreement
with Great Britain.
Honourable senators, I think I have said
enough about wheat. There are some other
matters; with which I should like to deal. One
of these is the Incarne Tax Act, a piece of
legisiation that is about as popular as the
British Wheat Agreement. Honourable senators will recail that during the closing week
of last session this house hurriedly passed
the new Income Tax Act. My recollection
is that it was only before the Banking and
Commerce Committee for a few days. When
the bill was being discussed in committee
certain sections affecting personal corporations were considered. At that time I
distinctly recail the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and myseif asking the tax
officials from the Department of National
Revenue if there was any change in the new
Act relating to personal corporations. We
were advised that there was no change, just
a littie clarification.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: What year was
that?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It was last yeair. The
new Act went into effect on January 1, 1949.
I am interested in a small company, a personal corporation which pays no tax and
whose dividends are only taxed in the hands
of the shareholders when received by them.
Well, you can imagine my surprise when in
the first week of December I discovered that
the law had been entirely altered. In order to
save my small company I was obliged to
2909-13j

practically wind it Up in a hurry before the
end of the year. I refer to subsection 6 of
section 21 of the old Act. It read as follows:
When the total mncome earned by a personal cor-

poration since its incorporation has been taxed
against and recelved by its shareholders, any further
dividends declared and paid by such a corporation
out of capital shaîl flot; be liable ta taxation in the
hands of the shareholders.

Hon. Mr. Burchiil: Would the honourable
senator please explain what a personal corporation is?

Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is a corporation which
does not actually do any active business but

deals more with investments, and in which
one person residing in Canada holds the
mai ority of the stock. For instance, you and
I might form a personal corporation to invest
some money. It would be a personal corporation if I held 51 per cent of the stock and you
and the other shareholders held the balance.
It is entirely different from. an ordinary corporation which
pays double taxes. The
company pays the tax on its earnings, and the
shareholders pay a tax on the dividends when
they receive them. That is the difference.
This subsection 6 of section 21 was lef t out
of the new Act entirely, and the new sectionx
proved to be the most difficuit I have evertried to interpret. When I discovered this;

new section I sent a telegram to Ottawa and
received the followlng replyUnder

cor-

poration paid out of capital not exempt from tax
<Stop) situation the saine as an ordinary corporation
in this respect.

Honourable senators can understand the
position I was in. From talking to Toronto
and Montreal lawyers since returning to,
Ottawa I gather that they were in the same
"stew" about personal corporations for which
they acted. At the last moment I discovered
that this matter had been taken up with the
Minister of Finance, and that he had made
the following statement:
The change in the wording of the new Act as
coinpared with the old was not; the result of a deliberate decision to change the pollcy wlth respect to,
personal corporations, and my present intention is
ta recomxnend to parliament in the forthcomlng
session an arnendment which wlll carry forward into
1949 the practice that has obtained under the Income
War Tax Act.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Assumie: The reason I amn bringing this Up is that I want to make sure that
that amendmnent is brought in. I have not
heard a thing about it.
Righi Han. Mr. Mackenzie:

Wihat is the

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have not the exact
date, but I know the letter was written some
timne last fail. It was addressed ta the
Toronto General Trusts Corporation, whose

manager told me they were interested in a

nurnber of these personal corporations.
saw the letter and copied this extract from
it. I arn calling attention to the matter now
so that it will flot be forgotten, and in the
,hope that an appropriate amenâment will be
brought in by the minister. I now inquire
fro'n the leader of the government if the
government intends to amend the new act in
accordance with the minister's statement.
My next point is flot so involved. It conterris these wonderful new income tax forms
that we received flot long ago. In my hand
I have one of the new formns for individuals,
the T.1 Short Form. The print on it is s0
fine that one almost requires a magnifying
glass to read it. I have no objection to what
is on the f orm, but the wording should be
legible. I arn holding up now the old form,
which honourable members can see is just
twice as big. It has the same or nearly the
:same wording as is on the nexv short form,
and is in print large enough to be easily
read. I suggest to the government that a
readable size of type be used on future
forms. I neyer saw anything wrong with the
old form, the bigger one, and I do not consider that the new one is easier to fill out.
I should like now to say a few words about
the incorne tax forrn for farmers. In my
office at home we do a lot of farmers' income
tax work, not because we like doing it but
because it has to be done, on account of the
fact that farmers keep poor records. Here is
the return the government put out for farrners in 1947, a form with a blue margin. It
consists of six pages and was far frorn satisfactory, although if the last two pages had
been lef t off altogether it would flot have
been so bad.
Righi Han. Mr. Mackenzie: Has the f orm

not been changed since then?
Han. Mr. Aseitine: Oh, yes. I arn showing
now the progress in simplification. Somnebody
-I do not know who had the brain waveprepared the 1947 formi so that a farmer was
required to set out ail his assets and liabilities,
stock on hand and ahl that kind of thing, just
as a big business has to do. The form for the
previous year was, I consider, the best one
ever put out. Here it is, a simple sheet, the
Farmiers T.1 Supplernental. We calied it the
.blue form. In rnaking out this form you
started on the back, where there was a good
deal of room for setting out depreciation on
buildings and equipment, and so on, and
beneath that there was a space for the
schedule of wages paid and board supplied to
bired help. The totals of the depreciation
and of the wages and board were carried
'forward to page 1. On that page also the
farmer set c:ut ail his receipts during the

year-fromn the sale of crops and seeds, live
stock and dairy products, as well as from
patronage dividends, produce raised on the
farm and consumed in the farm home, hail
insurance received, and so on. The figures
for ahl these items were placed on the lefthand side of page 1, and the farm expenses
were set out on the right-hand side. The
total expenses were then subtracted from the
total receipts, and the net profit, if any, was
transferred to the four-page form, on which
the tax was computed. That was very simple.
Hon. Mr. David: That form was for what
year?
Hon. Mr. Aseifine: 1946.

The T.1 General 1948 form is for use by
individuals in business, farmers, fishermen,
professional people-in f act, by everybody
except wage earners, who use the T.1 Short
Form. On the back of the T. 1 General 1948
form the farmner is required to state his
income and expenses, but the items set out
for claiming expenses are not comprehensive
enough and the space is too limited. If a
f armer furnishes only the information asked
for on this return the department wiil be
writing hlm for the next ten years, wanting
to know how the varlous amounts were made
up. The Income Tax Office in the city of
Saskatoon has already discovered that this
1948 formi is no good, and has sent us a supply
of the old forms, asking us to fill them out
and send them in as supplemental sheets.
If we do that we are flot required to fill out
the back of the new form. I suggest to the
government that the T.1 General 1948 f ormi
be discarded in favour of the 1946 form, and
that the T.1 Short Form for individuals be
made twice as large as it now is. I think this
would be far more satisfactory to taxpayers
in general, and would resuit in a much
speedier Miing of returns.
Another subi ect that I wish to deal with
is divorce.
Han. Mr. Haig: There will be plenty of
interest in what you have to say now.
Hon. Mr. Aseltîne: I ar nfot going into the
matter very deeply at this time. As honourable senators know, I have been a member
of the Divorce Committee of the Senate for
the last fifleen sessions. The work is getting
to be quite onerous. For a time we thought
there would be a considerable reduction in
the number of petitions this year; but this is
not so, and it appears that the committee
wiil have to hear and dispose of approximately 350 cases. However, that is not the
point that I wish to discuss.
When speaking in this debate the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) referred to a statemnent that I

MARCH 16. 1949
made in a speech on divorce a couple of
years ago. That statement was to the effect
that on account of the fact that the only
ground for divorce in Canada was adultery,
many people whose marriages had broken Up
were compelled to commit the off ence of
adultery in order ta obtain a divorce. The
honourable gentleman said, or at least I
understood him to say, that in his opinion if
our laws were modernized it wauld not be
necessary for people to do that and there
would be less adultery.
Then, having
modernized the law of divorce, he would
make adultery a criminal offence. I regret
that I must disagree with the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw).
I do, however, agree that there should be
some modernization of our divorce laws, and
I arn satisfied that it could be accomplished.
If someone had the courage ta take up the
problemn and see that the proper legislation
ta modernize the present law was passed
through parliament, there would be less
adultery, less perjury and less collusion and
connivance. I think that such a measure
should properly be presented at the opening
session of a new parliament.
Before concluding I should like ta tell
honourable senators what Sweden has done
in the way of developing the most modern of
divorce laws. I was able ta secure a digest
of her divorce laws in the current copy of
the Magazine Digest, taken from the Swedish
Review. In that country there are no public
hearings of divorce cases; the husband and
wif e have only ta consent ta a decree. I arn
flot willing ta go so f ar as ta advacate that
such a measure should be introduced in
Canada; I merely wish to show haw the
question is handled in that country. After
the giving of consent by the husband and
wif e, the dissolution of the marriage is
deferred for a year, during which time a
public officer, such as was suggested by the
honourable senator frorn Medicine Hat, takes
the case in hand and does his best ta effect
a reconciliation. If he fails, the divorce then
goes through, but neither party can rnarry
for a year. The laws of that country further
pravide that final divorce may be granted
immediately for wilful desertion for a periad
of twa years, for adultery, incurable insanity,
three years' imprisonmient on the part of
either spouse, assault and battery, cruelty
and other offences of that type. In Sweden a
husband may even secure alimony if bis wife
bias all the property. That is a measure we
might introduce -in this country.
Hon.,Mr. Haig: That is a good idea.
Mon. Mr. David: Daes the offenoe of cruelty
include mnental cruelty?

Hon. Mr. Aseltmne: From the report before
me I cannot answer that question. The
off ences include assault and battery and
cruelty. I have no doubt that we could
obtain fromn the Swedish Legation here f ull
details of the divorce laws in that country.
Unfartunately, I did nat have time ta inquire.
When the marriage is dissolved there is. a
property settlement, and the wife receives
haif of anything the husband bas made during their marriage; but each party may
retain possession of all praperty received by
way of gift or inheritance. I put this information on the record ta show what another
country is doing concerning the question of
divorce. It may be that in time sornething
will be done here.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I ask a
question, in an effort ta be helpful? Has my
honourable f riend the details of the amendments ta the British divorce law?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have not gat them here,
but I have a copy of the divorce bull which
we passed ini 1938, which. substantially cavers
the arnendrnents made to the divorce laws of
England just prior ta that time. If my honourable friend would like ta read it, I can
let hirn have it. I thaught it was quite a good
piece of legisiatian, but after passing through
this house it went ta the other place, of which
rny honourable friend was then a member,
and it neyer received second reading.
Hon. Athanase David: Honourable senators,
it is nat only a duty but a real pleasure ta
congratulate bath the mover and seconder of
the Address, on which I arn about ta speak.
While listenîng ta the speech by my hanourable f riend frorn Clare (Han. Mr. Corneau),
many memories were brought ta my mmnd.
He expressed pride, as he had a right ta do,
in being an Acadian. My mother was an
Acadian, and for that reason rny honourable
friend revived some old mernories.
One
ancestor of my mother, Pierre Chenet was.
one of those put on an English boat at Grand
Pré, and for a year was out on the ocean..
Before he left his cauntry he was engaged
ta a young Acadian girl. The parish priest
at Grand Pré had told his parishioners that
they had a right ta marry wherever they
met, provided they made their vows in the
presence of witnesses. Eventually this man,
Pierre Chenet, was put ashare in the woods
near Boston, and after six months' travel
right and left, south and. narth, he finally
came upon a small group of Acadians who
had been deported at the same time as he
Among themn he found the young
was.
woman ta whomn he was engaged, and he
married ber there in the presence of witnesses.
Some -six or seven years later, after he had
earned a little money, be came back to

SENATE
establish himself in the province of Quebec.
A group of deported Acadians had by that
time made their way through the woods and
taken refuge in a littie town by the name of
L'Assomption near Montreal, and well-known
to ail living in that district. There he and
lis wife went before the parish priest and
had their marriage regularized. I arn told
that on the same day the registry acknowledges the birth of three chiidren.
I would be remiss if 1 did not acknowledge
the kind words which have been said today
by the honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Davis). It is always a great pleasure for us who are of French descent, and
who, despite what you will admit were at
times great difficulties, have kept our French
language, to listen to one of our English
Canadian friends speaking our own tongue so
admirably as did our colleague thîs afternoon.
1 must recognize that others in this house
are similarly accomplished; and in saying
this I cannot but regard my good friend the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), who from tîme to time is audacious
enough not to speak English, and whose
French is so elegant and perfect that it is a
pleasure to listen to him.
About a year ago-and thîs I state without
a trace of chauvinism or fanaticism, but
factualiy, as such matters should always be
communicated to this house-French Canada
was proudly celebrating the centenary of the
re-estabiishment of French as an officiai
language in this country. But we could flot
express our prîde and satisfaction without
remembering the enormous difficulties which
confronted Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine in
trying to re-establish our language after its
use had been abrogated by the statute of
1840, at the tîrne of the union of Upper and
Lower Canada.
I certainiy arn not going to be frivolous
enough of thought to assume that everyone
in this house does not know how it occurred
that that repeai was brought about after
s0 many years during which the French
language had been spoken freeiy. It was the
resuit of a visit to Canada of an envoy extraordinary of Great Britain, the Eari of Durham.
Lord Durham was a great radical-more
radical, perhaps, than Liberai, if one may
judge from the way he envisaged this question. When he arrived he had taken great
precautions to try to impress the public of
Canada. The boat in which he saiied had
been compietely refurnjshed: there were new
carpets, new chairs, new beds; everything
was splendid and gorgeous. He came in
1838, shortly after what has been called the
Rebellion of 1837, and evidently he thought
that the mentality of French Canada was
flot entirely sympathetic to, certain officiais of

the then administration. In his report to the
British Government he made the recommendation that Canada should be an Engiish
country and that Engiish shouid be the
officiai language.
After the consequential statute was passed
by the Imperial Parliament, it was received
by the people of Québec, needless to say,
with, 1 will not say anger, but sorrow. Every
one of you wili recognize this as it is a
perfectiy human feeling. Hippolyte Lafontaine
had been elected in the first Canadian election for the county of Terrebonne. At the
opening of the house in 1842, despite the fact
that he had no right to speak French in the
house, he made his speech entirely in that
language. Some three years later, addressing
the house, he presented a resolution asking
the Imperial Government to restore to the
then mai ority of the country their own
language; and by a statute of 11-12 Victoria,
1848, French again became an officiai language
in Canada.
I have said this, as 1 took the precaution
to say at the beginning of these remarks,
without reproach, without biame, and without fanaticism. Wherever you go, human
nature is always the same; and for reasons
that appeared to some to be good, it was
assumed that the French language was useless, because s0 many did not speak it.
Evidently at that time there were many who
did not share the sentiments of the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Davis),
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), the honourable senator from
Victoria (Hon. Mr. Hushion), and other good
friends whom I wouid also mention if I had
heard them speaking French, which 1 have
not 50 far had the opportunîty to do. At
that time the prevaiiing mentaiity was not
what it is now. Naturaliy we must expect
from time to time in future what has been
experienced before, and is occasionaiiy met
with today, evidences of irritation, even
attacks. But I sincereiy believe that our
Canadian mentaiity has acquired s0 much
strength that we on both sides wili in future
successfuliy resist appeais to prejudice.
One may liken the situation of the French
language in Canada to that of France among
the nations of the worid. I know that at times
France has been exposed to criticism and
that its politics have not been up to our
expectations. We condemned, aithough with
sorrow, the politîcs of France, especially in
1940; but is there any person in this house
wîth the siightest knowiedge of worid culture who would like to see the light of France
disappear from the surface of the earth, or
the French ianguage from Canada? The
French language is one of the strongest

MARCH 16. 1949
elements of cultural development a country
can have. You, honourable senators who are
in the mai ority, may be very proud of your
Shakespeare; I admit that the world has
neyer seen a greater genius than Shakespeare;
but do not forget Racine, Corneille, Boileau,
Bossuet. and many others so numerous that
I would flot attempt to naine them, so long
would be the list. From these ancestors of
ours we have retained, flot the whole light
perhaps, but a spark which I arn satisfied is
reflected at times on the whole mind and
intelligence of this country.
Same Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David: Winston Churchill in his
second volume, "Their Finest Hour", after
referring to France in the bad days when
Reynaud could not conduct his cabinet in
the way he wanted, after being a littie satinical about the French situation, suddenly
wrote, following a visit by airpiane to
Bordeaux:
In ail this miserable discussion it must be borne In
mind that I was haunted and undermlned by the
grief I feit that Britain, with her 46 million population, had not been able ta make a greater contribution to the land war agalnst Germany, and that
so far nine-tenths of the slaughter and ninety-ninehundredths of the suffening had failen upon France
and upon France alone. I have wnltten lightly of
the happenings of these days. but here to ail of
us was real agony of mind and soul.

Honourable senators of the mai ority, if at
times you see Canadians o! French origin
moved by sorrow or pride about something
that affects France and that is French, please
do not forget that in your hearts and souls
you too possess a similar sentiment about
England. When England suiffers you suifer;
when England is glorlous you are glorious.
So it is with us as to France; we too are
human.
Sortie Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David: Excellent evidence of a
better understanding between you and ushonourable senators know who I mean by
"you" and 'eus',-is to be found in an article
written by Abbe Maheux which appears in
the Montreal Star every Saturday, in one
colurnn in English and the other in French.
I believe this man has done more than anybody else in the last twenty-five years for
rapprochement-not for unity; I do not
believe in it; but for union of mind and union
of patriotism in Canadians. As a. resuit of
his column forty young men from the University of Montreal were invited to pay a visit
to the University of Toronto. I should not
like to be indiscreet, but I arn told that the
Toronto students know how to enjoy 111e just
as well as do the students in Montreal or
Quebec City.

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Question!
Hon. Mr. David: Some time later forty
young maie students from the University of
Toronto paid a return visit to the 'University
of Montreal. This is evidence of what one
man can do. How splendid it would be if
each of us would follow his example and
try to promote this good will among our own
people with whom we corne into contact.
Honourable senators, I arn now going to
deal with a more delicate subjeet and one
which is perhaps more difficult to treat. For
some time now a rumour concerning the
possibility of the abolition of the French
language has found its way into Canada,
particulanly into the province of Quebec. The
best interpreters of the British North Amnerica
Act, the Canadian Constitution, are in my
opinion-I may be wrong-the Fathers of
Confederation. If you want to combine the
spirit of the law and the letter of the law,
surely their speeches, commentaries and
declarations are the source to which you must
go to get the truth. That is the source to
which I went. I found first of ail that when,
in 1865, the Parliament of Upper and Lower
Canada drafted a constitution for Canada
they did not draft a new law but simpiy
studied and approved, and conveyed to the
Imperial Parliament, the resolutions of the
Quebec Conference. With permission of the
Senate I will read two or three of those
resolutions. I hope that my reading of s0
much material will not be tedious to honourable members. I arn making these citations
because I believe it is my duty to present,
not my own opinion but the opinions of the
Fathers of Confederation, who knew more
about the matter than I do.
The first resolution of the Quebec Conference read as follows:
The best interests and present and future prosperity of British North Amerlos wiil be promoted
by a federal union under the Crown of Great
Britain. provlded such union can be effected on
principles just to the several provinces.
Hon. Mr. Loger: Will the honourable
gentleman please state what he is reading
frorn?

Hou. Mr. David: Certainly. I thought I
had already done so. I arn reading from the
Parliarnentary Debates on the subi ect of the
Confederation of the British North American
Provinces, third session, Eighth Provincial
Parliament of Canada, 1865.
Section 43 of the resolutions is the one that
enumerates tlie powers that were, shail I
say, conceded, or at least abandoned, to the
provincial legisiatures, and subsection 6 of
that section deals'with education. That prô-'

SENATE
vides that the local legisiatures shall have
power to make laws respectîng:
Education; saving the rights and privileges which
the Protestant or Cathelic minority in bath Canadas may possess as to their denominational schools
at the time when the union goes into operation.

Now let me read section 46:
Beth the English and French languages may be
employed in the General Parliament and in its proceedings, and in the local legislature of Lower
Canada, and also in the federal courts and in the
courts of Lower Canada.

The two resolutions that 1 have just read
were the ones on which I believe the Fathers
of Confederation pronounced themselves
throughout the discussion with the greatest
strength and the least reservation, as 1 shall
try to show after I endeavour to establish
that they considered the resolutions of the
Quebec Conference were a treaty.
On page 31 of this volume of the Debates
on Confederation, the Attorney Qeneral West
-that was the titie of the Honourable John
A. Macdonald, who was Attorney General
for Upper Canada-is reported as follows:
As I stated in the preliminary discussion. we must
consider this scheme in the light of a trcaty.

And, a little farther down on the same page:
1 trust the scheme will be assented to as a whole.
I arn sure thjs bouse xviii fot seek to alter it in its
unimpertant details; and, if altered in any important
provisions, the result must be that the whole will
be set aside, and we must begin de novo. If any
important changes are made, every one of the
colonies will feel itseif absolved from the implied
obligation to, deal with it as a treaty, each province
will feel itself at liberty to amend it ad libitum s0
as to suit its own vjews and interests; in fact, the
v.'lole of our labours wvi1l have been for nought.

At page
Fortier,

who

of

the same volume Mr'

represented

Yamaska,

is

reported as follows:
It is s treaty frem which no deviation can be
Bloed how is it that the Honourable Mr.
ut
Tiiley of New Brunswick offered te allow the
Opposition in that province to amend this treaty?

If I have to the satisfaction of honourable
senat ors made out at least a prima facie case
that the British North America Act is the
resuit of a treaty, May I now make somne
references to the views held by members of
the Parliament of 1865 on the Quebec Conference resolutions 43 (6) and 46, which I
mentioned a few minutes ago?
Mr. Evanturel, the mernber for Quebec
county, asked the Attorney General for
Upper Canada whether section 46 was "to be
interpreted as placing the use of the two
languages on an equal footing in the federal
parliament."
The Attorney General for
Upper Canada, Honourable John A. Macdonald, made this reply:
I have very great pleasure in answering the question put te me by my honourable friend f rom, the
county of Quebec. I may state that the meaning of
one of the resolutions adopted by the Conferçnce is

this, that the rights of the French-Canadian members as to the statua of their language in the
federal legislature shall be precisely the same as
they now are in the present Legisîsture of Canada
in every possible respect.

We]1, the Honourable Mr. Dorion, the member for Hochelaga, was not satisfied with
Mr. Macdonald's statemnent that the delegates
at the Quebec Conference intended to give
the same guarantees for the use of the
French language in the federal legisiature
as it existed under the then union. Mr. Dorion
said this was no guarantee whatever, for in
the Union Act it was provided that the
English language alone should be used in
parliament. He added:
There is, therefore, ne guarantee for the continuance cf the use of the language of the majority of
the people of Lower Canada, but the wiIl and the
forbearance of the majority.

To this the Honourable
replied:

Mr. Macdonald

I desire to say that I agree with rny honourable
friend that as it stands just now the majority governs; but in order to cure this, it was agreed at the
Conference to embody the provision in the Imperial
Act. This was proposed by the Canadian Government, for fear an accident might arise subsequently,
and it was assented to by the deputation from ecd
province that the use of the French language should
form, one of the principles upon which the confederatien should be established, and that its use,
as at present, sheuld be guaranteed by the Imperial
Act.

The Honourable Georges Etienne Cartier
added this declaration:
I wifl add te what has been stated by the
Honourable Attorney General for Upper Canada, in
reply to the hon. member for the ceunty of Quebec
and the hon. member for Hochelaga, that it was aise
necessary te protect the Englîsh minorities in Lower
Canada with respect to the use cf their language,
because in the local Parliament cf Lower Canada
the majority will be cornposed cf French-Canadians.
The mernbers of the conference were desirous that
it should not be in the power of that majority to,
decree the abolition cf the use cf the ltnglish
language in the local Legislature cf Lower Canada,
any more than it will be in the powver cf the Federal
Legislature te do se wxith respect te the French
language.
I wi]l aIse add that the use of bcth
languages will be secured in the Imperial Act te be
based cn these resolutions.

Rejî,Izîng how tedious it is for honourable
memnbers of this house to listen to citations,
I arn reluctant to, read further; however, I feel
it is my duty to offer one more citation. During the debate in the House of Commons, in
February 1890, concerning the measure, in
which Dalton McCarthy proposed the abolition of the French language in the NorthWest, Sir John A. Macdonald, at page 747,
had this to say:
The reason why I oppose the bill of my honcurable
friend today is the same-because that bill, a smail
bill; I might almost caîl it an insignificant bill in
its enacting clause-is based on the purpese of doing
away with the French language, cf discarding the
French language, at ahl events, and depriving the
French-Canadian people cf the salace of the

MARCH 16, 1949
language and the education of their young
men, would I be thought an extremist if I
said that on the day when Canada gains the
exclusive rîght to amend her charter, it
should be specially provided that the sections
of the British North America Act which
Honourable senators wil find in Article 93 guarantee to the Protestant minority of
of the British North America Act the guaran- Quebec and to the French Canadians their
tees made by Cartier and Macdonald as ta the respective rights as ta education and ianeducation and language of the Protestant gauge shall neyer be amended without the
minorities, and in Article 133 the commit- consent of the Quebec Legislature?
I have taken s0 much of the time of thîs
ments with respect ta the French language.
Now, has the mai ority in Parliament the honourable house this afternoon that I am
right ta abolish the French language? In one reluctant ta turn at this time ta further subspeech 1 found a sentence for which I have jects about which I wish ta speak. I should
searched for years. Is says that parliament particularly lîke ta refer ta the question of

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
Ah)DRESý IN R}A'LY

The Senate resumed frorn yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Qovernor
General's Speech at the opening of the
session,, the motion of Hon. Mr. Farquhar for
an Address in reply therein.
Hon. Athanase David: Honourable senators,
yesterday, in my desire to curtail my remarks
and avoid becoming tedious to this bouse I
ornitted one observation which I believe has
for the other provinces as much importance
as the one 1 made concerning Quebec had
for that province. It is this. When and if
the day cornes that Canada bas the right to
change her own constitution, no specia] constitutional right which bas been conceded or
granted to any province should be altered,

MARCH 17. 1949
changed or abrogated without the express
consent of the province te whom. that right
has been conceded. Such a provision would
do something, I believe, for the good administration, the stability, even the prosperity of
this country. Any right that is taken from a
province, whatever it may be, creates unrest;
and where there is unrest there is no
stability; and where there is no stability there
cannot be any prosperity.
These shall be my last words on the
subject: my dream for Canada may be
exaggerated, but I visualize her in years to
corne as one of the great nations of the
world;Hon. Mr. Roebuck: She is now.
Hon. Mr. David: Well, she is flot always
treated as such, -and I believe that it is the
duty of everyone teday to prepare for this
future, for though we may net see it, we can
have the satisfaction during our ives of knowing that we have prcmoted it, and, in dying,
the consolation cf having assured it for our
children and grandchildren.
I corne new to another topic. No subject,
I believe, has been more discussed in recent
years than Communism. Speaking about it,
I know, gives rise to certain difficulties,' which
I wlll note as I go on. I believe I cannot
better commence these remarks than by
quoting fromn a bock written very recently
by Eisenhower, entitled "Crusade in Europe."
On page 476 the author states:
Volumes have been. and volumes wiil be, written
on the collapse of world co-operation and true significance of the events that accompanied the tragedy.
For us. ail their words will aniplif y one simple truth.
Freedomn from fear and injustice and oppression will
be ours only ini the measure that men who value
such freedom are ready to sustain its possession-to,
defend it against every thrust fromn within or without.
I should like to refer to a real Churchillian
note and cite what Churchill-I do not refer
to him as Wînston Churchill because the
name Churchillis1 sufficient-said in the House
of Commons last year. It is this:
Democratic governiment is the worst fox-m of goveroment except those forms of ail categories that
have been tried from time to time.
We flnd in these remarks one of the best
examples of Churchill's humour.
Honourable senators, how many communists are there in Canada? I believe the
number is of very small importance when it
is realized that Russia, with its six or seven
satellites, and a total population cf 250 or 275
million s, has no more than 25 or 30 million
members of the Soviet party. Commiim
under Stalin is net so much an ldeology or
doctrine as a faith. I will not discuss the
anti-religious campaign carried on in, each cf
Russia's satellite countries under the direction
29091-14-j

o! Moscow. Every member cf this chamber
is familiar with that campaign and it is
unnecessary te review iýt here.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt te ask my
honourable friend a question? Did he use
the word "1faith"l?
Hon. Mr. David: Yes, faith, "une foi". It
is a religion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank ycu.
Hon. Mr. David: Honcurable senators would
be right in asking if it is possible to give a
definition of "communists" and "cemmunism".
I admit that this is pretty difficult. The oniy
explanation given, even in the modern dictionaries, is that a communist is one who is
a co-possessor or co-proprietor, and that coinmunismn is a doctrine that establishes co-proprietorship and cc-possession. Well, we all
know that communism today is not that at
ail. If I might venture an opinion, I would
say that ccmmunismn teday is ne longer what
Marx and Engels contended it was, a littie
more than a century ago. Marx's ideclogy
or doctrine passed threugh many channels
of thought before becoming what Stalin made
it in our times.
There was a time when great French
statesmen declared in the Chamber o!
Deputies that f ree thought and anticlericalism
were not exportable produets. Evidently that
is not the opinion of the Politbureau or of
the Russian dictator, because the chief
exports of Russia today are the communistic
principles that she wishes te spread throughout the whole world. May I add that, in my
own opinion, communismn was formerly a
doctrine that influenced politics, but today
it is politics that influences a doctrine. The
aim of communists is world domination, and
they declare that te establish it they would
go so far as to destroy and ruin our modemn
civilization and all forms cf government that
adhere to principles which are democratic,
and which they consider to be inimical to
their cwn.
If the foregoing can be accepted as a broad
definition cf communismn and ccmmunists,
then I would say that every communist, in
whatever country he lives, is a person who,
notwithstanding any oath cf ahlegiance that
he may have pledged tc that country, still
receives orders fromn Moscow and works day
in and day out for the triumph cf communismn
ail over the world, and who to attain this
objective is ready, first, te help in destroying
ccnstituted autherity, and afterwards, the
governmnent itself in the country of his residence. If that be so, as I henestly and conscientiously believe it is, then every cernmunist living in a democratic country today
is a traîtor te that country..
Sasse Hon. Senators: H-ear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. David: This seems ta have been
the thought of the honourable judges of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia wbo
refused the appeal of Mr. Gardon Martin, an
avowed member of the Labour Progressive
Party, from the decision of the Benchers that,
inasmuch as he cauld flot take the oath of
allegiance required of every lawyer, he was
flot a fit persan ta practise at the Bar. Here
is a man who wanted ta be a lawyer, but
who cannot be admitted ta the Bar because
of his inability ta take an oath of allegiance
and respect it. Some persans mîght ask
whether this was not an attempt ta deprive
a man of freedom. I shall corne ta this later.
It is quite unnecessary for me ta point out
that since the last war unrest, dissatisfaction
and discontent bave prevailed nearly ail over
the world-in countries that were military
victors as well as in thase that were vanquished-and it is ta be feared that some considerable time must elapse before the necessary equilibrium is re-established in social,
political and ecanamnic domains. Evidently
there are many reasons for this; but I may
point out that economics are dominated by
politics, and that econamic prosperity is an
essential condition ta political strength and
stability. That is mare important now than
ever before, because in this txventieth century
nations are so interdependent that palitical
instability in any one country is feit nat only
by ail classes of its awn saciety, but probably
by ail classes in every other country. This I
believe explains in part wby clasbes between
classes have rapidly superseded international
rivairies. This unrest and instability, together
with perhaps a certain lack of orientation and
a fearful hesitancy an the part of statesmen,
makes ail the easier the work of demagogues
in persuading the warking classes that they
are stili being exploited.
The "equality of man" is the enticing bait
that the demagogues bave used in the past,
are using today, and will continue to use in
the future among tbe millions who are dissatisfied with their lot in if e. Envy is one
of the last characteristics of humanity to die.
The preacbings and teachings of the doctrine
o! the equality of man, allied witb envy and
a desire ta improve one's lot in if e, account
in certain measure, I seriously believe, for
the risks taken by so many in their activities
in the black market, in speculation, in fiscal
evasion and in civil disobedience. The masses,
claiming that they cannot obtain justice from
others, bave believed themselves justified in
taking the law into their own bands. It is my
opinion that that belief is the greatest
element o! disruption there is, and that it
lies at tbe root of the total, absolute and complete lack of respect for autharity, whether

moral, spiritual or governmental, which
exists in the world today.
If this be true, I affirm without hesitation
that disorders of the mind are even more
serious and more to be feared than material
disorders.
When order, spiritually and
morally. has been destroyed, do flot look for
it in the other domains, for it fia longer
exists. This was well known to Marx,
Lenin and Stalin, and it is the reason why in
every country one finds emissaries trying to
create turmoil and unrest. Is it flot true that
one seldom finds batred among a contented
and satisfied people, but that it may be
instilled into a discontented and dissatisfied
people? This was the pollcy of Marx and
Lenin, and it is now being continued throughout the world by Stalin twenty-four bours
a day.
Honourable senators, I said a moment ago
-though ta you it may seem longer-that
regardless of where the communist finds hlmself today he receives his orders from Moscow. Whatever may be his oath of allegiance
to the country where he lives, the communist
follows orders from Moscow, and cannot
be anything but a traitar to bis country of
residence.
We need flot go very far to find evidence
of this. Durîng the recent war Thorez fled
fram France ta Russia; he did flot want ta
fight; and he bas recently declared tbat if
there is a war the Frencb will flot fight
against the Soviet Republie. A simîlar declaration was made in Italy by Togliatti, who
bas said that if the Russian armies enter
Italiari territory tbe Italians will flot fight
the communists. Similar declarations bave
been made in England and in tbe United
States. Mr. Buck bas flot made such an
announcement, but were he called upon ta
do so could he fail ta follow bis orders fram
Moscow?
Now, wbat is tbe duty of a state or country tbat is exposed ta this danger? Conmmunism is a threat ta everything a Canadiari
citizen cherishes and loves. In the face of
sucb a threat a free citizen of this country
must be just as jealous of bis responsîbility
as he is of bis liberty. We must have the
courage flot only ta speak, but ta act; we
must meet the communistic menace as we
would meet the threat of an epidemie which
might destroy the healtb of the iridividual.
I bave read s0 often of liberty of thought
and freedom of speech, that I doubt if there
is anyone in this bouse more democratic thait
myseif.
But, tbank God! I distinguish
between freedom and licence; between liberty
and slavery uflder the guise of liberty. Any
marn among us who is the father of a family
knows that when his wife or child suffers an

and the rights of the mai ority. I think I can
sa! ely affirma that, should the communist
effort succeed, at least 12,700,000 of the 13
million Canadians would be deprived of their
rights to freedom and liberty. For these
reasons I believe that drastic action of the
appropriate kind, applied without fear and
without hesitation, has become a patriotie
duty that ail citizens have the right to expect
fromn a free government, which must remain
the guardian of the liberties of our country.

Somne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Davîes: When this bill is discussed
here I shall probably vote for it, as no doubt
we ail shall. I do not usually vote against
government measures without some very good
reason. Family allowances are now part of
our economic 111e; but let us take the long
view; do not let us go too far and kili initiative and ambition. How many of those
listening to me today would have been
senators if, when they were young, there had
been family allowances? They learned early
in life to battie for a place in the sun, and
they got here as a result of their achievements, by overcoming obstacles. They know,
as I do, that when we were young a dollar or
two earned after sehool, or in the evenings
and on Saturdays, flot only helped out the
f amily treasury, when necessary, but also
gave a good deal of pride and satisfaction to
the earner. But today no young person in
Canada has to worry about such a thing as
earning a few dollars after school or on Saturdays. Ask employers of labour. Ask men who
want boys or girls for occasional work after
school. Listen to some of the remarks of
mothers who are in receipt of family allowances: they will tell you quite frankly that
their children do not have to work after
school. Yet those children always seem to
have money to admit them to the movies.
Honouiable senators, I seriously wonder
just what effect ail this government generosity
is going to have on the rising generation. It
seems to me that this is something we have
got to consider. Will the boys and girls of
today have the same ambition and desire to,
achieve that was developed in people of past
generatlons-such as the great adventurers
who came from France during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, or the pioneers of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who
blazed a trail through the forests and pushed
cîvilization farther and farther up our rivers?
Let us neyer forget, honourable senators, that
character is built, not by sliding down the
mountain side to the green and pleasant
valleys, but by dlimbing up over crag after
crag to the heights. True, as Lloyd George
said when he became Prime Minister of England, "It's awfully cold at the top." But
where would this glorious country be today
if it had not had men willing to endure privations and hardships--or, to put it metaphorically, the coldness of the mountain top-in
their efforts to build a strong and united
Canada?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Dayi.s: In the Speech from the
Throne a paragraph that interests me very
much is the one relating to the proposed
appointment of a royal commission to investigate our cultural 111e. 1 arn deeply concerned

about our cultural 111e, as I am sure every
honourable senator is. It has been well said
that man cannot live by bread alone. Cicero
told us many long years ago that cultivation
of the mind is as necessary as food for the
body. Great writers and thinkers ail down
through the ages have expressed the same idea
in different words.
But let me read you the paragraph:
It Is the view of my ministers that there should

be an examnination of the activities of agencies of

research, the preservation of our national records,
a national library. museums, exhibitions, relations

in these fields wtth international organizations, and
activities generally which are designed to enrich
our national if e. and to increase our own consciousness of our national heriage and knowledge of Canada abroad. For this purpose, the government intends at an early date to establish a royal commission.
If 1 were not speaking in the Senate I
would say that was a "doozer"; the first
sentence contains 78 words.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I intend to discuss the
paragraph seriously, but in passîng I may say
that when I first read it I was reminded of an
incident in my young days as a reporter.
I began to learn reporting under a bluff
Scotsman from Glasgow who had a rough
tongue. The honourable leader of the opposition in this house <Hon. Mr. Haig) may have
known him. Hîs naine was Bruce Wallcer,
and I understand that hie later went to live
in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Davies: A good many years ago
Bruce Walker had two regular reporters
working under him, and also he had the assistance of a couple of young fellows who
worked in a printing office by day and did a
little reporting at night. I was one of these.
For this work, I may say, we were not paid
in money, but got words of encouragement or
blasphemous criticism from Mr. Walker,
depending upon what hie thought of any particular piece of reporting we did. One evening my young fellow-reporter was assigned
to write an account of a concert at which his
sister played a piano solo, and hie thought
he would "do hier proud." I shail neyer
forget the verbal explosion that I heard next
morning when Bruce Walker was reading my
colleague's copy and came across this
sentence:

some very strong language the incident
passed over, but I have neyer forgotten it.
Peculiarly, as I have said, this paragraph
in the Speech from the Throne brought that
incident back to mind. The paragraph certainly sets oui a very comprebensive undertaking for the proposed royal commission.
It looks as though the commission wouid
have to gather people from Dan to Beersheba
in uts search for information relative to our
cultural ife.
I arn strongly in favour of the spirit of this
proposai, but to me the proposai itseif seems
mucb too sweeping. It is not specifie enough.
It may be ihat in its tour around the country
the commission will not cali people before
it, but will go out on the highways and
byways and discuss the various matters mentioned in this paragrapb. If the commission
members do that, they may have a journey
sometbing like what G. K. Chesterton had in
mind \vben he wrote these lines:
Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn
strode,
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling
English road.
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round
the shire,
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the
squire.
A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did

That night we went to Birmingham by way of
Beachy Head.

If ibis had been St. A-drew's Day, for
instance, instead of St. Patrick's Day-I wou]d
hav e ended that verse wjtb a different line
fronm the same poern, which 1 amn sure would
have p]eased the senator from Vancouver
Centre (Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie):
That night we wvent to Bannockburn by way of
Brighton pier.
I would suggest that when tbe royal commission is appointed, it sbould first look into
radio and television, and afier that investigaie the possibiliiy of establishing in Ottawa
a national library and building a new art
gallery. There is no hurry about any of the
other items mentioned in that long paragraph.
Honourable senators, I sbould like to take
a few minutes to refer t0 television, which is
now a subject of very wîde interest. Television bas arrived, and I do not tbink
Canada can afford to waii very long for a
royal commission's report before taking some
action in ibis matier. In its development we
do not want to lag too far bebind Great
B riiain and tbe United States. I saw a splendid televîsion broadcasi ai Broadcasting
Flouse in London a dozen years ago, and six
years ago I waiched a broadcast at the
studios of the National Broadcasting Company in New York. Althougb we bave no
television broadcasis in Canada ai present,
1 arn told that in Toronto ihere are nearly

two bundred sets receiving broadcasts fromn

Buffalo. I was under the impression ibat the
General Electric Company in the United
States was turning oui approximaiely five
bundred television receîving sets a day, but
I believe now ibat my estimate was low.
In order that I mighi give bonourable
members some accurate information about
the matter I secured a copy of an address
delivered by Josepb Sedgwick, K.C., to tbe
Advertising and Sales Club of Toronto. As
many bonourable members may know, Mr.
Sedgwick is a prominent lawyer in Toronto.
He is solicitor for the Association of Canadian Broadcasters, and naturally takes a keen
inieresi in television, alibough not alone for
ibat reason, but also because bis brother is
one of the big siockholders and General
Manager of CFRB, one of the mosi powerful
stations ai Toronto. I shail read flot the wbole
of Mr. Sedgwick's address, but only certain
excerpis:
At this moment, television in Canada jr a litile
like the weather-everybody talks about it but
nobody does anything about it. This bowever may
be said in extenuation, the inactivity of the private
radio stations and certain others interested in television is not of their choosing, but is a state of
lethargy enforced by orders fromn above.
In a
wcrd-television like radio operates on channelsin this country the licensing of those channels is
crntrolled by the C.B.C.-the C.B.C. cannot make
up ils mind as to how best to solve ils almost insoluble internai problem-and thus no licences are
issued. But 1949 has every appearance of being the
year of decision, so, a quick look round-here and
abroaci, may he of 'sore service to peo~ple like yourselves who are concerned about ail pub]îcity media.

Now, 1949 is not going to be the year of
decision, unless the commission is appointed
prompily and does a good deal of travelling
in a short time.
Mr. Sedgwick goes on to say:
During the lasi two years television in the United
States, so long experimental and haphazard, really
arrived.
The status of television in the United
States during 1947 changed from that of a demonstrated technical reality to a firmly established
broadcasting service.
Take sets in use as one
measure.

This, bonourable senaturs, is really enflghtening.
Prior to the war (1941) there were 10,000 television
sets built in the United States. Post-war production
started in October, 1946, and in that month 827 sets
were built. Only two years later, in October, 1948,
the monthly production was 95,000 sets. In November, 1948, il was 122,000 sets, and in December 125,000
sets. And as for 1949, il is estimated that the average production will be 160,000 sets a month-or
almost two million sets this year. Putting the figures
a little differently-at the end of 1947 there were
170,900 sets in use in the United States; at the end
of 1948, some 900,000 sets were installed, about
800,000 of themn in bornes and 100,000 in bars, restaurants, clubs and other places of public entertainment.
And the estimates as 10 the future are staggering;
the industry estimates (and 1 arn told conservatively, that by the end of 1952 there will be about
13.709,000 sets in use, and by the end of 1953 something in excess of 18,000,000.

MAIRCH 17. 1949
And we in Canada have done nothing at al
in this field.
If you will place beside that figure-

says Mr. Sedgwick,
-the suggested saturation one of 24,000,000 sets in
use, you will see how rapidly television is likely
to approach econorme saturation ini its field-and
how rapidly it wili dispiace, if flot completely.
largely, A.M. broadcastmng.

Mr. Sedgwick says a good deal more which
I shall fot tire honourable senators by readîng, but I should like to quote something
with particular reference to Canada:
Then of course there is the scarcity of channels,
a problemn even more acute in television than in
A.M. broadcasting. Only 12 channels are available
by international agreement, for television broadcasting in North America, and flot ail of thema are
available in ail parts of Canada; in Toronto. for
instance, close as it is to highly populous parts of
the United States, only three channels are open; in
Hamnilton only one. But neither in television nor in
A.M. can a country just sit on channels.

This information, gentlemen, is startling.
Without doubt Canada lost the right to, make the
fullest possible use of some of its A.M. channels
because for years the C.B.C. power freeze compefled
stations to operate on less power than the maximum
perrnîtted to the channel. occupied. So in television.
U.S. interests are already eyeing enviously our
vacant channels. and are saying, with some justice,
-if you don't want themn or can't make up your
minds, then let us have them who want them and
will use them immediately". Nor is this thinking
confined to station operators or would-be television
broadcasters. In his Maclean's article, Blair Fraser
says:
"In Washington I had a chat with Wayne Coy,
Federal Communications Comrmission chairman. He
dropped a broad hint that if television channels are
bad]y overcrowded the U.S. rnight want to take
over some channels now allotted to Canada. To do
so it would have to negotiate a new agreement and
the Canadian case would be sadly weakened if we
had decided to make no use at all of the channels
we have."

And significantly,
headed:

Mr. Fraser's article is

'We're falling so far behind on television we may
neyer catch up. Ottawa balks the C.B.C. and the
C.B.C balks private showmen."

What are the facts asks Mr. Sedgwick.
Firstly, without any doubt, able and well-financed
Canadian interests are wllling and anxious to enter
the television field. In Toronto, for the three available channels, four appications are before te
C.B.C., from CFRB, CKEY, CHUM, and Farnous
Players Canadian Corporation. In Montreal, CKAC
and Canadian Marconi, operators of CFCF, have
already applied, and without doubt there will be
others.

That is the situation with regard to television, honourable senators, and it is a serious
one. I think it is about time Canada got busy
and looked into the whole question and
decided just what is to be done about it.
There are a limited number of channels, and
unless we dlaim them they wrnl be grabbed
Up by the United States.
I wish to turn for a moment to.radio. This
is a branch of our cultural hf e which is

developing at a tremendous rate. We al
know that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is trying to provide programs which
will suit ail tastes. Some of us prefer the
New York Symphony Orchestra on Sunday
afternoons; others prefer "Amos and Andy
and "Fibber McGee and Moily". These programs corne from south of the border over
C.B.C. networks and are relayed through
networks of private stations. The Canadian,
Broadcasting Corporation is doing a fine work,
particularly in the production of "Stage 49'every Sunday night, and also in its special
Wedriesday-night programs.
There are about 90 private broadcasting.
stations in Canada. Many of them are smal
local stations, but their cultural aspects
should not be discounted. They are spending a
certain amount of their revenue every rnonth
to develop local talent, and it is interesting
to note that this talent seems to be improving
every year. We nîl realîze that in some small
cities there is a dearth of good local talent
which can be put on the air, and the local
stations are doing what they can with it.
The British systemn of broadcasting may
have its advantages, and it may appeal to the
British people, but it is confined to national
interests only. In Canada our local stations.
are part of the community and are always.
willing to help any worthy cause. School
children are often heard over local stations;
likewise, local church services. This is something which would be impossible if we did
not have the small stations scattered from
one end of Canada to the other. A few
weeks ago the Kingston station cleared the.
air of ahl programs and advertising from
8 until 11 o'clock in the evenîng so that the
people of that area could hear Handel's
Messiah performed by the Mendelssohn,
choir and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra,
under Sir Ernest MacMillan. 1 arn sure that
program was enjoyed by all who heard it.
I feel that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is very weil managed, but I am
of the opinion that it might be better if it
did not have the power to regulate its7.
competitors.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: 1 do not think I would
go so far as to say that Canada should al]ow
private networks to develop. I f eel that the.
interest of the state is greater than that of
any individual or group of individuals. I
have not yet persuaded mysel that we
should follow the example of the United
States in permitting private networks. I do.
feel, however, that a commission separate
entirely from the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation might be a better authority to
regulate the private stations. Many private
stations resent being controiled by a body-

SENATE
which competes with them for many forms
of advertising.
But while we are studying radio, television
and films, let us not forget for a moment the
Little Theatre movement. That is an activity
in which I am keenly interested. At the
present time regional festivals are being held
all over Canada. The Dominion Drama Festival was originated by Lord Bessborough, with
the assistance of Colonel Henry Osborne and
other gentlemen here in Ottawa, and groups
were formed in the various provinces. I am
sure Ottawa senators will be interested in
knowing that the Ottawa Little Theatre group
won first prize three years in succession in the
Eastern Ontario Drama Festival. The Edmonton Community Players are another group
that is doing excellent work. Two years ago,
at the finals in London, they produced a play
called "My Heart's in the Highlands", which
was warmly welcomed both by the audience
and the adjudicator. Particularly outstanding
was the acting of eleven-year-old Stewart
Kerby, a school-boy who says he wants to be
a professional actor when he grows up. Mr.
Robert Speaight, who was the adjudicator of
the finals here in Ottawa last year, and this
year is the regional adjudicator, in speaking
the other day of the Alberta Festival said,
"it is the best I have seen across Canada."
During the finals in London I had a chat with
young Stewart Kerby and his mother. They
told me that they belonged to a group which
rehearsed in a basement somewhere in Edmonton, that this group had a great struggle to
get along, and that they paid their own way
down to London for the finals. She and her
little boy travelled second-class, either tourist
:r colonist.
To illustrate the cost today of an enterprise
>f this kind: one of the finest amateur productions of Shakespeare that I have seen was
done at the Eastern Ontario Regional Festival
in Brockville two or three weeks ago by a
group of school teachers from Peterborough.
They played "The Taming of the Shrew". It
was really a magnificent effort, and while it
did not win first prize, it was very highly commended by the adjudicator as a colourful
production most beautifully done. But it cost
$900 to take it from Peterborough to Brockville. The players, a group of school teachers,
wanted to bring it to Ottawa, but found that
they could not afford the expense. There is
no theatre here large enough to allow of sufficient admissions to pay the expenses of the
group-who, I believe, call themselves the
Peterborough Little Theatre group-so they
did not bring the production to Ottawa. This
Little Theatre work is a branch of our culture
which should have some encouragement, and
I say again that a grant of $10,000 a year
would be a Godsend to the Dominion Drama
Festival. It would help little groups out in

the West and in the Maritimes, and even in
Ontario, to move from place to place giving
performances. Not only that; it would enable
them to buy or rent the proper costumes and
do all sorts of things which are necessary to
adequately produce these plays.
This is a branch of our cultural life which,
since Lord Bessborough started it, has spread
across the country. The finals for the current
season will take place in Toronto in the last
week of April, and I am sure that we are
going to see some very fine performances.
Indeed, the work of the Ottawa Little Theatre
group at Brockville was held by Mr. Speaight
to be practically on the professional level.
So I urge, honourable senators, that the
Dominion Drama Festival be supported.
I would also like to see something done
about a National Library. I read the other
day that a committee has been appointed to
bring some records up to date. I was not
quite sure whether the purpose was not to
stop the agitation for a National Library.
If so, it missed the point. This country
should have a National Library, a National
Museum and an Art Gallery, and they should
be situated right here in the capital city, so
that when people come from the United
States or Britain, or from the various parts
of Canada, there will be something for them
to see besides the Parliament Buildings.
Canadians should be able to visit their own
National Library, their own National Gallery,
their own Museum. The National Gallery
that we have today contains dozens, probably hundreds of pictures which have to be
stored, because there is no room to display
them. The project of a National Gallery
should be taken seriously. Surely we are
paying enough taxes and raising enough
money to spend a little on these cultural
agencies. If a socialist government in Britain can set aside one to two million pounds
to build a National Theatre, this Dominion
should be able to make some provision for a
National Gallery and a National Library.
Then, also, we should not forget to
encourage our present-day authors. Recently
Mr. Will R. Bird, of Halifax, president of the
Canadian Authors' Association, has been
making a trip across Canada, and he says
that he is delighted and surprised at the work
which is being done by authors all over this
country. I note that in the estimates there
is an item, amounting I believe to $4,000, for
retired authors, or what is called the Writers
Foundation. The provision is a good one, but
I think there should be some similar encouragement of the active living writers of today.
I did not take part in the debate on the
entry into Confederation of Newfoundland,
because I felt there were many others here
who are better informed about it than I
am. I have never been in Newfoundland;

MARCH 17. 1949
however, one of my sons who was stationed
there about three years during the war has
told me a good deal about the island and
its people. He came back full of enthusiasm,
and has since returned to Newfoundland for
two holidays because he liked it so well. I
only want to say that I join others in welcoming Newfoundland, as the tenth province of
Canada, into our Confederation.
Having opened my remarks by referring to
the last paragraph of the Speech from the
Throne, I will close by discussing very
briefly the flrst paragraph, that relating to
the Atlantic Pact. As a Canadian, I arn proud
that our own Prime Minister played a prominent part in the plans for bringing it about.
I believe that the Canadian and other goverfiments who are subscribing to it are taking
the right course: it is a show of strength.
I listened with great interest to the remarks
about communismn which were made this
afternoon by the honourable senator from
Sorel (Hon. Mr. David), and I agree with
everything he said. Communism today is a
menace to the f ree peoples. My friend George
Drew is no more opposed to Communism
than I am. I have a feeling, however, that
the influence of communism is on the wane in
this country. Nevertheless, it is still with us,
and I believe it should be carefully watched
and kept strictly within the bounds of the
law. We do flot want communism in this
country. I shail go further than that, and
say that we are not going to tolerate communism in thjs country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davîes: We shall make the communists strictly obey the laws. If I had my
way we would tighten Up the law. At the
same time I do flot think we should aid and
abet interference wîth the governments of
other countries. I realize that there are states
in Europe today which are not free; but
honourable senators have ail read historyprobably much more than I have-and know
that the instincts of free peoples will flot
allow them to remain bond slaves. We have
seen it happen time and again. They remain
enslaved for a f ew years; perhaps ten, twenty
or thirty, but they rise up again to become
f ree. The tîde is waning already in Europe.
We know that. We are sorry for some of
the countries and we would like to help them,
but we can do little directly at the moment.
One thing we can do, however, is to build
up our own defence and help those in western
Europe to build Up theirs.
The name of Canada stands high in the
world today. No other country of 12 million
people is as highly regarded. Let us keep
our country strong and f ree, and hope that
it will be rnany long years before we have

to go to war again. But, honourable senators,
let us make quite sure that if we ever do
have to, go to war again we shail be ready.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I had flot intended to address you on the
Speech from the Throne, but during the progress of the excellent address to which you
have just listened, a note was sent to me by
the member from Vancouver Centre (Right
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) in which he asked:
"Why don't you say a word about Ireland
and sing an Irish song?". That is what
prompted me to rise.
To be in order, I must first congratulate
the mover and seconder of the Address. I
did not know the mover of the Address until
he came into this chamber, but the name
of the seconder is a byword in the province
of Nova Scotia.
Some Hon. Sonators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Wihen the name WiIJie
Comeau is mentîoned, ahi know immediately
who he is. We all listened with a great deal
o! interest to the splendid, homely address
which he made. But I amn going to take some
credit for it, because, when he was going
over it the other day with the honourable
member from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan) and myself, he started to tell us
about his ancestry. I then said: "Why don't
you include that in your remarks when you
are making your speech in the house?" He
hesitated, but flnally agreed to do so. That
is why I arn entitled to take some credit for
the speech upon which he has been congratulated so often.
I must off er my congratulations also to the
other senators who have contributed such
excellent addresses to the debate on the
Address, but I want to particularly congratulate the honourable senator from Sorel
(Hon. Mr. David), who spoke so well
yesterday and today.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quînn: While he was making his
reference to communism-something which
we ail regard as a menace-it recalled to my
mind a tirne some years ago when I was a
member of the other house and when the
top communist of this country was incarcerated in the Kingston Penitentiary. The
late Viscount Bennett was then the leader of
our party and Prime Minister of Canada.
The subject o! communism was brought Up
at a Conservative caucus, and at the conclusion o! his remarks the then Prime Minister
said, "WeU, thank God we have one bulwark
against communisrn in this country--Quebec
and the Catholic Church".

Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I have a particular affection for the province of Quebec.
I happen to have studied its history, beginning
wîth the voyagings of Jacques Cartier, who
landed ia this country frorn France in 1554,
aad of Champlain, another French explorer
who weat first to New Brunswick, thea to
Quebec, and afterwards as f ar west as Kingston-and perhaps, as some authorities say,
mucli farther. Then there was de la Verendrye, who reached as far west as what is now
the city of Winnipeg. These aad othersexplorers, pioneers, missionaries and nursiag
sisters-who came here frorn France, settled
this country and gave it government for one
hundred and fifty years.
Then came the great joiniag of forces, in
1759, and today you wil fiad on the plains
of Abraham a twia statue to two great
soldiers, Wolfe and Montcalm, who opposed
each other there. That statue is ernblematic
of the unity that we need in Canada today-

unity between the provinces and between
capital and labour, and especially unity of
ail our people in support of the great movement that is going forward in Canada today
for the maintenance of international peace
in this tempest-tossed world. 1 arn not going
to make any political staternent at ail, but I
should like to pay a tribute to the Prime
Minister of Canada, who is one of the world
leaders in the cause of international peace.
Now, honourable *senators, I wish to do
something which I know is, strictly, not

further development of peaceful and friendly
international relations by strengthening their

in their international economic policies and
will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
AI)DRE'.S 1N REPLY

The Sonate resumed from Thursday, M\/arch
17, consideration cf His Excellcncy the Governor General's speech at the opening cf the
session, and the motion cf Hon. Mr. Farquhar
for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Arthur W. Raebuck: Honourable
se'lators, 1 suppose I should commence in the
usual way by paying my compliments to the
m-nover (Hon. Mr. Farquhar) and the seconder
(Honl. Mr. Comneau) cf the resolution upon
which \VO have the privilege of making these
addresses. In s0 doing I am following a timehonoured-and perhaps toc much honouredcustoni, though in this case it is highly fitting.
May 1 include in my acknowledgrnents at
least one other participant in this debate, the
honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David), to whose eloquent defence cf the
French language and customis we listened
with the greatest cf pleasure a few days ago.
Serne Hom. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May 1 take this opport-unîty of Pssuring the honourable gentleman,
and ail others of the same racial enigin in
this chamber, that we cf British origin are
just as jealous of our liberties as they are,
ai-d that we desire our French Canadian
fellow citizens te feel as secure and comf ortable in their liberties as -we do in ours.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Nor do I differ particularly with the honourable gentleman in his
denunciation of communism. I was recently
in Berlin, and I can assure him that 1 have
no use for the communism of the East, whatever I may think of the landlordism of the
West. 1 merely pause te sound a note of
gentie warning. It is very easy to pay lip
service to liberty while we advocate measures

MARCH 21, 1949
which in their final effect lead to autocracy.
It would be the easiest thing in the world for
us in this chamber unanimously to ban coinmunism. It would be a very easy thing
indeed for the government of tis country to
have passed through both houses of parliament a bill banning communism-and I do
flot doubt that we would be applauded for
supporting that measure. But what should
interest us is final effeet. What would be the
final effect of driving communismn under
ground?
Han. Mr. David: It is under ground already.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is not under
ground. Communists make open addresses
now: we know what they say. But what
would be the effect of driving communismn
under ground and arraying on its side the
generous but sometimes ill-informed impulses
of youth, which is always on the side of the
under dog. As we ail remember, communism
was at one time banned in Russia, and the
ban was enforced with a ruthlessness of which
we are not capable; but it does flot seem to
have been very successful.
At one time the Christian religion was
banned. Let us not forget the saying heard
frorn our childhood, that the blood of the
martyrs is the seed of the church. I have
long since lost confidence in the policeman's
club as a means of meeting an intellectual
error.
I had not intended taking part in this
debate, and I would not have moved the
adjournent on Friday last had it flot been
for-as it appeared to me-the provocative
address delivered by the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) on the
subject of family ailowances. He made an
attack on this humanitarian Liberal legisiation, and I could not allow it to pass without
challenge. He said that he was opposed to
the scheme of family ailowances when it
xvas first discussed, because he f elt that it
would help the thriftless and penalize the
thrifty. Well, in a contest between the thriftless and thrifty we are alI, of course, on the
side of the thrifty; but do you flot think it is
going rather too far to imply that those who
are helped by family allowances are the
thriftless and that the penalized are the
thrifty?
Family allowances are given to ail fathers
and mothers with children under sixteen
years of age. The suggestion that these
parents are the thriftless in our community
is so unworthy that I do not believe the
honourable senator fromn Kingston meant
what he said. It is as untrue to say that all
parents are thriftless as it is to say that al
thriftless are parents-or even, perchance,
that there is a larger proportion of thriftIess among those -who are parents. I note

that my friends across the chamber are smiling. It is quite true that there are those who
are too stingy to have children, but I do not
know why we should dignify such people by
characterizing them as thrifty. It is also true
that, by and large, there is no class in the
community which spends its resources more
frugally, wisely and unselfishly than those
who bear the responsibiity of children. The
honourable gentleman says that family ailowances penalize the thrifty, meaning thereby
that those who have no children, and therefore draw no benefits, are the thrifty.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Horner: He did not mean that
at ail.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is what he said.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend's statement is
not correct. I apologize for interrupting him,
but he is wrong. I shaîl have an opportunity
to speak later, but I just wish to point out
to my friend from Toronto-Trinity that the
fact is this: those whose income is above a
certain level have to pay back the money
received, and much more; and everyone with
children is compelled to take it.
Hon. Mr. Roobuck: This question has been
given a good deal of publicity, otherwise I
would have let the matter pass without challenge. My honourable friend fromn Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) will have an opportunity to
reply, and I have no doubt he wiil take
advantage of it. I say that the honourable
gentleman from Kingston said it would
penalize the thrifty, and that it penalizes
those who have no children and therefore
draw no allowance. I think that was the
meaning that was conveyed to the public at
large, and that is the meaning I drew from
his remarks.
It is just not true that those without minor
cbildren are any more thrifty than those with
them; the very reverse is the fact. We are
told that 84 per cent o! the children in Canada
are dependent on only 19 per cent of the
gainfully employed. Therefore, the burden
of raising the next generation of Canadians
falîs upon one-fifth of our working population. This being so, is it not rather presumptuous for anyone in the f our-fifths class-to
which most of us in this chamber belongand who therefore is not now contributing to,
Canada's future population, to talk of thriftlessness on the part o! those who are contributing? On the other hand, shail we whose
nightly rest is undisturbed begrudge some
financial. assistance to those who are bearing
the entire cost, inconvenience and responsibility of perpetuating the Canadian nation?
The honourable senator said that he was
going to vote for the broadening of the scope

SENATE
of thîs legisiation which. bas been forecast in
the Speech from the Throne; yet hie wants to
know where ail this "paternalism" is going
to end. Wbry vote for a measure which one
disapproves of ta the point of damning it as
"paternalism". The honourable senator has
evidently been keeping bad company, because
the policy of the Conservatives-as was
demonstrated a few moments ago, when the
leader of the Conservative party in this house
rushed ta the support of the honourable
senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)is ta vote for the measure while they do
everything that they dare ta destroy it.
It is quite correct, of course, to say that
family allowances are paternalism, for the
motive springs fromn the paternal solicitude
of the men and women of this generation for
the welfare of that generation which shartly
will succeed us.
The honourable member wanted ta knowI quote his words-"Why talk so much about
social justice in these times of abounding
prosperity"? This is indeed a period of comparative prosperity; but will the honourable
senator assure me that the prosperity of
which hie speaks extends ta everyone in
Canada in the ample measure wbich hie himself has eujoyed? The research department
of the National Liberal Federation informns
me that average real wages in Canada have
advanced since 1939 by only 15 per cent.
Han. Mr. Crerar: That is not right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes; let the honourable senator listen ta my words. 1 said "real
wages". It is true that in Canada today more
money is paîd and more people are working
than ever before. But wbat counts in the
kitchen is wbat the wages will buy; and the
vital truth is that real wages, that is ta say
the buying power of the wages which are
paid, have increased since 1939 by only 15
per cent. I state that on the autharity I have
quoted, and which I believe ta be reliable.
I believe there are same who will deny that
the advance is even that much. In listening
ta the housewife, as I have done in the
immediate past, I have found nothing ta
encourage me ta think that it is any less
difficult taday than it was in 1939 ta supply
a household with the necessaries of 11f e.
But for the paternalism of this goverument in sustaining rent contrai, that meagre
15 per cent advance in wages would long
since have disappeared into the pockets of
the owning classes. Will anyone have the
bardlhood ta tell me that rents and profits
have not advanced much mare than 15 per
cent; very much more than real wages; that
is ta say, wages considered in the light of
what they buy?

I made some attempt ta discover the
approximate level of wages in Canada today.
I admit, of course, that in terms of money
wages are hîgher and are paid ta more people
than ever before iu our history. I learned
from the Bureau of Statistics that, on the
basis of total wages and salaries received by
persans employed in fine leading industrial
groups including manufacturiug, logging,.
mining, communications, construction, maintenance, trade, finance, and such specified
services as hotels and restaurants and laundries and dry cleaning, but exclusive af
domestic service, government service and
some related graups-the per capita wage or
salary for the week ended December 1, 1948,
was $42.11: last year it was $38.25. 0f course,
as we know, wbile there are some who get
mare, there are others wha get less. A weekly
wage of $42 and an annual average of about
$2,000 in these leading industries represents
a pretty fair tribute to aur economy, and one
for which, regardlng the position of many
ather nations, we have no reason ta apalagize.
But what 1 am tryiug ta do is ta survey the
situation in 50 far as this land of ours is
concerned. For everyone who draws $3,000 a
year there is someone who draws anly $1,000;
for everyoue who draws $10,000 there are
eight who draw but $1,000. Sa lu causidering
this general average, do nat forget that there
is the bottom as well as the top. I fouud
that in mauufacturing, wbicb is a very
important industry in Canada, the average
wage on December 1, 1948, was $43.72. Money
is falling, prices have been rising, aud last
year the average wage iu manufacturing was
$39.25. On the other baud in such businesses
as laundry and dry cleaniug, hotels and
restaurants, the average wage for the week
ending December 1, 1948, was $27.23. 0f

numbers lu these businesses.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: Is that a justification?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am stating a fact; it
is far from a justification. I do not think
auyone will deny that lu this country women
are paid less than men in the same jobs.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: In the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not lu tbe Senate. I
think that is a fair summary of the over-ali
wage situation iu Canada. Fortunately there
are the well-paid; unfortuuately there are
the low-paid. I was able ta discover something which those from tbe West well knaw.
A census report of the three prairie provinces made for the year endlng 1946 showsthe figures af the decennial census made iu
1941 are too much out of date to serve as a
guide-that as many as 34,614 persans lu
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta were-

MARCH 21. 1949

82,570 were paid between $450 and $949.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They got by with the
baby bonus.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: I hope so. It helped a
great deal. In these provinces 148,349 persons were paid salaries between $950 and
$1,949. Let me recapitulate.
In the two
divisions that I have mentioned, 117,184
persons received up to $949, while the
remainder recelved between $950 and nearly
$2,000. Honourable senators can thus see the
figures for the underpaid numbers as well as
those for the weil paid.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator a question about the 34,000
receiving an annual wage of something like
$440?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Less than $450.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes. Would they be in
the category of farm labourers? Is there any
particular designation given to the category
inlo which they f ail?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No; I was given no
divisions at ail. The figures include ail those
in the three prairie provinces that were paid
the wages I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Some of them have their
board paid.

ernment under this policy of family allowances will have increased the purchasing
power of Canadian mothers, by $1 billion.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask a question on
that point? It is quite true that a billion
dollars has been paid out in family aliowances. That amount came out of the taxpayers pockets. If, for the sake of argument,
that money had been left in the taxpayers'
pockets, would it not still have constituted
purchasing power?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
cannot make the argument that this creates
a billion dollars of new purchasing power.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It may sound strange
to the ears of my honourable friend, but it
does. It puts into the hands of those who are
expending money on the necessîties of life
other money, which plays its part--or perhaps it does-în ownership, in capital and in
bg business.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1 happen to know a young
man in Winnipeg who has three children
whose ages are seven, five and three. His
income is approximately $6,000 a year. His
wif e draws $15 a month in family allowances. When it comes to his income tax
return, instead of an exemption of $300 for
each child, he is allowed only $100 for each
child. He loses money by accepting family
aflowances. Is that true?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I find it dîfficult to be
sympathetie towards him.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is it true?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is true that he pays

SENATE
cost of administration would be somewhere
around 3 per cent of the amount paid out per
year. But the actual figures have been much
more moderate. The annual report for 1948
shows that the entire administrative costs
of ail the departments involved totalled less
than $4 million, which is approximately one
and a haif per cent of the amount paid out
in family allowances for that year. In other
words, for every $100 which we provided in
family allowance cheques, $98.50 found its
way into the pockets of the intended beneficiaries.
And I submit to you, honourable senators,
that that money-at least the great bulk of
it-was well and faithfully used by those
who received it. During the last ten months,
from April 1948 to January 1949, inclusive,
1,092 complaints were received by the department alleging misuse of family allowance
money. But, as I have said, the total number
of families to whom. family allowances were
paid was 1,724,179, so the average of comnplaints was one for every 1,578 families. One
complaint per thousand familles wouid be
pretty good, but this record is one haif as
good again. Every complaint was investigated and most, though flot ail, were discovered to be unfounded. It was found
necessary to change the payee in 216
instances only, or in one case out of every
8,000. According to the latest figures, at the
end o! January, 1949, out of 1,700,000
monthly payments only 475 were made to
third parties, by which I mean to someone
other than parents concerned in each of these
cases.
According to a report prepared in the
Family Ailowances Branch o! the Department of Heaith and Welf are, the very best
use is being made of this money. Such information can at best be imperfect and sketchy,
but it is much more complete and reliable
than that possessed by the critics. The
department's conclusions are based on three
sources: (a) three research studies-one of
an urban group in Montreal, one o! three
Western farin areas in Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and one of five communities in
Gaspé, Quebec; (b) reports from f amily
allowances field workers, and (c) unsoiicited
letters from payees, schooi officiais and welLare workers.
In the opinion of departmental officiais
this information indicates that the family
ailowance money has been used for the
following purposes:
Firstly, more adequate clothing. Store
managers report increased demand for
chiidren's ciothing immediately following the
monthly issue of family aliowance cheques.
Secondly, a substantiai improvement in
diet, especiaily in the extra consumption of

milk and fruit. This is particulariy noticeable in the low-income group.
Thirdly, an extension o! medical, dental
and opticai services. Parents' statements to
this effect are confirmed by a drop in requests
for such services from public and private
benevolent sources.
Fourthly, extension of educationai and
recreational opportunities. School books,
school transportation, summer camps, youth
organizations and sporting equipment are al
being purchased and used more freely than
before.
Finaliy, it is indicated that among Indians
and Eskimos there has been a marked increase
in the purchase of vitamin-enriched flour,
miik powder, tomatoes and pablum.
Now, to me ail that seems very satisfactory.
It is the best information we have; information that comes from widely separated sources
and from people who should know. But the
senator from Kingston is worried about "Just
what effect ail this government generosity is
going to have on the rising generation'
Hon. Mr. Davies: Honourable senators, may
I interrupt the honourabie gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity? He has been quoting me a
good deal, and I should like to be quoted
correctly. He dlaims that I said family allowances would penalize the thrifty and benefit
the thriftless. Here is what I actually did
say, as found a, page 186 of Hansard:
When farnily allowances were first talked about. I
was opposed to them, not because I begrudged the
help to needy families, but because I feit that they
would help the thriftless and penalize the thrifty.
However, I listened to the debate in the other place
and also in this house, and I was won over to support the measure. 1 arn stili in favour of it. but I
think we have gone f ar enough.

I would ask the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity to keep 10 what I actually did
say and not try to make me out as being
opposed 10 family allowances.
Hon. Mr. ]Raebuck: My honourable friend
said he was won over to vote for family allowances, but he took every whack at them that
was in his bag of tricks, and 1 do not think
I misquoted him in the slightest when I
pointed out that he said he was originally
opposed to them because he feit they would
help the thriftless and penalize the thrifty.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Did my honourable friend
use the word "originally"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I certainiy did use that
word.
My honourable friend's sentiments
were publicized in the printed report of his
speech, and it is probably because of the
publicity given to that speech that I am
taking the trouble o! replying 10 il and
challenging its general effect as well as
some of its particular words. I have said

MARCH 21, 1949
that the honourable senator was worrled.
1
These are his words:
I seriously wonder just what effect au this goverrnent generosity is going te have on the riulng
generation.

He does not refer to the effeet af the
generosity upon those wha pay for it, but I
presume that was in bis mind. The sum af
$264 million per annum coming from 13
million people amounts to, approximately
$19 each; computing this on a monthly basis,
it cornes ta, $1.58 per capita per month. I
do not suppose that we are in any great
danger of becoming a generous bankrupt.
What appears ta concern my frlend is the
demoraiizing effect that the payment ta
mamma af $5.90 per child per manth, is going
ta, have upon the character of littie Johnny
and his sister Sue. My honaurable friend
said that hie did flot want ta kml initiative and
ambition in the rising generation. Neither
do we. He brought the matter home to, us in
this house by asking this question:
How many of those listening to me today would
have been senators i, when they were young. there
had been f amily allowances?

Wel, that question is flot easy ta, answer.
Han. Mr. Howard: That is the $64 question.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: But would it not be
more sensible if I reversed it and asked how
many of our generation are not senators taday
because, when we were young, there were
fia family aliowances? I fancy that question
is just as sensible as the one my friend asked.
But neither hie nor I can give the answer to
such a hypothetical proposition.
I will tell the senatar from Kingston why
the senator from Toronto-Trinity is here
today. In the first place, I owe my appointment ta the former Prime Minister, who took
the responsibiity of recommending my name
ta the Goverrnent of Canada-a gesture for
which I shail be eternally grateful. But that
is a secondnry renson. The primary reason
for my being here as a senator today is that
when I was young my father had the ability
and the wherewithal ta buy a cow, which hie
himself milked for Mis family before and
aiter office haurs. Further, I amn here because
I had a mother who expended hier usua]iy
scanty resources in the purchase of food and
clothing for hier children, with a soicitude
and care ai which only mathers are capable.
Viewing a seat in the senate as a symbol of
success-which may or may not be the f actI take it that the honaurable senator attributes Mis own scaling of the heights ta chfld

fiction may be pleasing ta Mis ego, but let

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Then you would nat

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Margarine is made framn
fats raised on the farmers fields; the main
ingredient is milk.
Mr. Churchil, the great builder af the
Empire in our generation, sald this:
I do nlot agree with those who say that every
man must look after hiroseif and that the intervention by the state will be fatal to his self-reliance,
his foresight and his thrift. The mass of the labouring poor have known that unless they make provision for their old age. they would perish miserably
an the workhouse. Yet they have made na provision.
for they have neyer been able to make such provision. It 18 a great mistake to suppose that thrift
is caused only by fear; It springs from hope»as wefl
as from fear; where there is no hope, be sure there
will be no thrift.

I should Jike ta quote fram the American
author, Mr. Thomas I. Woofter, in an article
entitled "Children and Fnmily Income",
which appeared in a family bulletin af the
United States Government ai January 1945.
Mr. Wooter said:
Since most of these familles have an extremely

thin margin of security there tends to be a viclous
circle In this segment of the population: children in
large familles with low Income lack adequate opportunities for development and grow up to be disadvantaged parents of another disadvantaged
generation.

That is what we in this country have
endeavoured ta avoid by this most beneficial,
humanitarian and patriotic legisiation.
I wish ta quote again from the words of
the senator iromn Kingston-What is the matter wlth the members ai this chamber that
they should smnile at my reply ta, a speech

debating society, or do we have ta accept the

SUSPENSION OF RULES

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
several members of this house have asked
me what our sitting dates are Iikely to be
for the balance of the week. As honourable
senators know, the other place is presently
discussing measures to renew legislation,
most of which will expire at midnight on
Saturday of this week. To become law, these
mensures must be passed by tis house and
receive the Royal Assent. Therefore what
will happen wrnl depend upon what progress
is made on these measures in the other
place, the time of their arrivai here, and
when they will be disposed of in this house.
About a week ago a motion was adopted in
the other place to enable it to sit, if necessary,
on Saturday of this week. Whether it will be
possible to dispose of the pending mensures
in time to permit of Royal Assent before
Friday night, remains to be seen.
I do not think there is anything I can add.
But, as we are hikely to be faced with the
saine situation which sometimes confronts
us at the end of a session, when a supply bil
arrives very shortly before the turne set for
Royal Assent, I arn taking the precaution,
in order that the house may have as rnuch
time as possible to deal with any legislation
which may corne before it, of giving notice of
a motion for Thursday next:
That for the balance of the present month Rules
23. 24 and 63 be suapended in so far as they relate
to public bills.

Hon. John T. Haig: I fully concur in the
announcement 0f the honourable leader and
the reason he has advanced in support of it.
To go a step further: I hope, and shall continue to hope, that within the next two weeks
we can dispose of ail the legisîntion which
needs our attention prior to the Easter recess.
Undoubtedly the legislation whlch has to be
deait with by Saturday, and that portion
which must be disposed of by the 31st, wiil
be concluded within those perlods; and the
indications are that the other place wil
adJourn for practicaily three weeks. In tis
connection I suggest to the leader that the
governinent ask the other place, wlth our
concurrence, to provide intertim supply cover29091-15i

ing, say, the flrst two months of the new fiscal
year. I hope and believe that we shail be
able to take a longer adjournment than the
other place. Undoubtedly the budget debate
will last at least two weeks, during whicb
period this house will have nothing to do.
For that reason and that reason only I would,
ask, particulariy for the sake of those of us
who corne from the Maritimes and from the
western provinces, that consideration be
given to adjourniment for a longer period.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I find it difficuit to
foresee what the situation wrnl be when the
turne for adjournment arrives. My own personal desire and atmn has always been neyer
to ask the Senate to sit only when there has
been some business for it to do. Whether it
will be possible to accede to the opposition
leader's suggestion I cannot say at the
moment. I shall do my best to ascertain
whether what he proposes i.s feasible
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: The honourable
the leader gave notice of motion for the suspension of three rules. I have not these rules
under my hand at the moment. Would he
kindly indicate to the house the effect of the
suspension?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Our rules require 491
hours notice for the second reading of a bill
and 24 hours notice for the third reading.
Under the motion these rules would be
suspended. I think also that the motion
would suspend the rule which provides that
Saturday is not a sitting day. As a practical
instance of the need for suspending these
rules I would refer to the control bils now
before the other house. Suppose that on
Thursday one or both of these bills came over
here. First reading would be given at once,
but under our rules, unless there was unanimous consent, second reading could not be
given for 48 hours.
That would make

24 hours notice, could not be given this wedr.,
Suspension of the rules is desired so that as

perversion of the purpose for which an
authentic scheme of registration of pedigrees
of pure-bred livestock was created.
Subsection 5 of section 6 of the bull provides
speciftcally in relation to registration and
transfer rights that:

credentials or payment of fees,

It also refers to several other matters.
Certain practices have developed in the
departmnent which, whlle they may be sound
and proper, require some legisiative sanction.
For instance, in granting incorporation to an
association, the minister must satisfy hirnself
that the association represents a fair crosssection of the particular breed of animais
throughout Canada. In practice, the head of
the department has been doing that, but the
present Act provides no authority for such
course of action. When a number of persons
make a request for incorporation and satisfy
the formalities laid down in the present Act,
they are entitled to incorporation. There are
a number of other particulars in which,
based upon experience, the new bill seeks to
provide a better set-up in the matter of
incorporation and affiliation of associations,
and in the maintaining of an authentic
original record for use in the registration and
transfer of pure-bred animais.
One point which, perhaps should corne
before the committee is that in order to
re-establish the present Canadian National
Live Stock Records and the Record Board
under the new bill, the associations presently
affiliated in such organization must renew
their affiliation in accordance wîth its
requirements of the new bill within a year
of the date of its passage. No such special
provision is made in relation to the incorporation of associations already in existence,
but 1 understand the intention to be that any
association now in existence, and having been
incorporated under the present Act, or any
earlier Act, shahl have the same standing as
an association incorporated after this bill
becomes haw. That situation may present
some probhems, one of which is taken care of
by the restriction that no matter what an
association may have in its by-iaws, i certain respects its powers are limited. Whether
that provision goes far enough is somethlng
that should be considered in committee.
Shouhd an association have in its hy-laws provisions which in some respects are repugnant
to the requirements o! this bill, the com-

mittee might well consider asklng that
association to file new by-laws i conformity
with the provisions of the new legisiation

senators for consideration when the bill goes

1 -have touched generafly, the hlgh spots i
the bull. It is not a complicated measure,
and i many respects simplifies the provisions of the present Act. For instance, the.
penalties i the present Act are broad and
a little complicated. The bill makes the
penalty provisions simple and direct. The
minimum fine has been reduced in each case,
but the maximum is retained.
The bil provides for the repeal of the

into force. It also makes section 1142 of the
Criminal Code of Canada inapplicable, the
reason being that section 1142 deals with
summary convictions, which requires that the
information be laid within six months of the
offence. One readihy can see that frauds in
connection with the identification and pedigrees of animais might not be detected for
two or three years, and that if prosecution
was barred by the Criminal Code the penal
sections of the legishation before us would be
useless.
It is my intention, when the bill receives
second reading, to move that it be referred to

as a matter of convenience the application
may be filed with that association. The
registration itself is made in one place only,
Ottawa.
Under the proposed bill the minister or his
representative will be a member of the Record
Board, and must sign the certificate even if it
has been vouched for in the regular way by
those in charge of the records. I understand
that each application is checked carefully in
order that the board may be as sure as possible about the breed of the animal. As to
cost, if you are a member of an association
you have to pay your membership fees for the
privilege of belonging to it. Each association
has a number of functions, such as the promotion of exhibitions and a greater interest
in its particular breed of animal, and the
creation of a better market for it. The registration fees are fixed. If you are a member of
an association I do not know just what that
will mean in the matter of registration fees.

The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure
to concur in this motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried!
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: On division.
Hon. Mr. Howard: It cannot be carried on
division.
The Hon. the Speaker: If there is not unanimous agreement, the second reading of the
bill will go over until Friday.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I make a plea for
unanirnous consent?
As I understand it,
consent would arnount to this only, that we
will hear the address made by the leader of
the government in explanation of this bill,
whereupon the honourable leader of the
opposition may adjourn the debate until
tomorrow. The sum total of this will be that
we shahl have whatever information the
leader may give us, for consideration over
nîght, instead o! having it tomorrow and then
immediately proceeding with the debate.
We shall bc setting the rules aside only to
that extent. This course will not be a violation of the standing rules of the house, or a
precedent for the handling of legisiation in
a peremptory manner. Its only purpose is
to get an explanation one day earlier than
we otherwise would get it. There is no substance in this deviation from the rules; it is
a mere matter of convenience. Nobody stands
for the rules more zealously than I do when
they protect the privileges of the house, or
is more ready to corne to the rescue of the
minority than 1 arn. But I think in this
instance we might well give the leader the
opportunity which he asks to make his
address, for it can be made today in no other
way.

The Hon. the. Speaker: Unless there is
unanimous consent, second reading of the bull
will go over until Friday.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would remind the
right honourable senator frorn Vancouver
Centre that if he insists on bis point the effect
will be to disrupt our schedule, which provides for the attendance of the minister to
explain one of these blills, and that will leave
me no alternative but to move adjournrnent
o! the bouse. The consequence will be a
deplorable loss of time. I arn bound by tbe
rules, and o! course I shall abide by thern,
but 1 would ask the right honourable senator
to recognize wbat a serious delay will result.
I amn doing everything I can to provide an
opportunity for the Senate to consider this
subi ect, and I hope my right honourable
friend wili bear this fact in mmnd.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I say a
word? I arn in entire accord with what the
leader of the government has said, but 1 must
express, and as a member of this house I amn
entitled to express, my disappointment that
these measures have corne to this house s0
tardily and so late. One of them is of a
controversial character, and it is only about
five minutes ago that I saw on my desk for
the first time the bill as passed in the other
place. With all deference to the leader, 1 say
that these bills should be on our desks at
11 o'clock in the morning, s0 that we may
have some opportunity to look them over and
dissect, analyse and, if necessary criticize
them.
Honourable senators, I arn speaking on a
question of privilege relating to thîs bouse.
We rnust not forget that we are the senior
branch of parliament. I do not think it is
fair to us that this legisiation should be
thrown at us and that we should be asked at
practically the last moment to act as a rubber stamp for the implementation by March
31 of legislation wbicb was bitterly criticîzed
in this bouse two years by the honourable
senator frorn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
the honourable senator from. Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) and others. We should be
given more time. I shouhd like to have the
Minister of Finance appear before either the
Standing Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce or Committee of the Whole, as honourable senators might decide. We should not
pass an omnibus control bill in this bouse
without first having a complete explanation.
Hon. Mr. Copp: That is why the leader
wants to give second reading to the measure
now; SO that it can go to commjttee.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I amn not taking
any dictation f rom the honourable senator

this house should have the very best possible
information before it when making a decision.
Whon the leader made his presentatian, I
deliberatehy stood up, as is my right, ta speak
on bohalf of this side of the house. I asked
whether, if I wished ta do sa, 1 could adjourn

o! the tweive orders in counicil mentioned by
my hanourable friend, and will not confer any
power ta go beyond the provisions of those
orders.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Nor ta amend; aniy ta
revoke.
Hon. John T. Haig: Hanourabie members, I
do not propose ta speak at iength an tis
subj ect, because it is a prablem we have with
us whether we like it or not. Once a gavernment embarks on a scheme o! contrais it ie
difilcuit; for it ta release them; they build up
like a snowbail and become harder and harder
ta get rid of.
Cancerning the contrai o! citrus fruits and
cimilar praducts, I only wish ta say that the
came recuit could be obtained by tariff regulation. For instance, strawberries are ailowed
ta corne inta tis country until they are produced lacally, and then the import is cut off.
That bas been the practice for rnany yearc,
and I can sc no seriaus dililculty about it.
May I say that we couid deai with these
contrais and regulations much mare easily if
they were set out in separate bills? Tis is
true especially of rentai contrai, about Which
I shall speak specificaily later an. As regards
steel and construction materiais, the question
is not very debatable. I presurne that came
reguintions are necessary. I amn nat; familiar
with the subi ect of timber contrai, but I cee
no reacon why it chauld be cantinued; in fact
there ceerne ta be a surplus of timber on the
market.
I arn doubtfui abaut the need for priorities
contrais. Experience in my province indicates
that contractors abject ta thern very seriausly.
For instance, the government under its
powers has in effect cioced up the cernent
trade in Winnipeg, where we have a big plant
that tis year is operating during the winter
months for the firet time. The srnaii operator
29091-16lJ

has no place ta store cernent, but those who
have priorities buy large amounts for the
construction of runways, for instance, at
Rivers. But just as necessary is the building
of houses, and for that purpose cernent is not;
to be had. However, this le not a subject on
which I arn an authority, and I wiil say no
more about it until we have the minister and
the deputies before us for questioning.
I wish ta deal samnewhat more extensively
with the subject of rentai control. I arn not;
now suggesting the repeal of contrai, aithough
I did sa when it was instituted, and stili think
that was the proper course to pursue. There
should not have been any rentai cantrol at
ail, for, once applied, it is practicaily impossible ta release it.
Consider the situation. The year 1941 was
taken as the year of basic rent. Two years
aga the government permnitted landiords ta
increase rents by 10 per cent, provided they
granted leases for not less than twa years.
It was expected at that time that by the end
of twa years rent contrai wauld have ceased.
The idea was ta permit tenants sufficient time
ta obtain houses of their awn. But the twa
years have expired, and the contrai continues.
Further: the government decided that on
and after January 1, 1947, rent contrais should
not appiy ta new buildings. Thereby they
admitted for the first time that contrais had
affected building. It was ta avaid the effects
of their own policy that the government
agreed ta this release.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: When the honourable
senatar says that it 11affected. building," hoe
means building for rentai, purpaces?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Certainly. For buildings
erected after January 1947 yau can charge
any rents you please.
Han. Mr. Hayden: But the purpose was ta
encourage building for rentai?
Han. Mr. Haig: There is no question about
that. I say the government's action was a
clear admission that the policy of contrais had
prevented building for rental purposes.
Their next move was ta provide that any
house or apartment which became vacant
should be no longer subi ect ta contrais. Let
us see what that involves. The Bryce apartmente ini the city of Winnipeg contain twentytbree suites. Since the change of regulations
came into effect last January, four or five
suites have become vacant, not through any
action of the landiord but because the tenants
had been moved ta Montreal, Vancouver,
Toronto and elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: With the recuit that
rents have doubled in Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They have not doubied in
Winnipeg. As a matter of fact, in this case

SENATE
rentais remained the sanie. Houses ini my
city which are now renting at from. $50 to
$75 a month are worth double that amount.
This type of control does not help the ordinary person; it benefits the man who i 1941
was able to pay $75 to $85 a month for a
house, who could well afford to buy it, and
who meanwhile, for $75 a month occupies a
house which, though formerly worth $9,000,
is now worth $20,000. The tenants will tell
you to your face, "You can't put me out.
I arn paying oniy $75, and if I owned the
house it would represent a rentai cost to me
of $150 a month.' It is this class of tenant,
and not the general public, whom these
regulations benefit. Today the cost of building a house in Winnipeg is exactly twice as
much as it was in 1941. 1 should say that
the samne statement applies to the whoie of
Canada. Yet rents are permltted to advance
only 10 per cent, or, if heat is furnished,
15 per cent, although that extra 5 per cent
will nat begin to pay heating costs. Caretakers' wages have gone up, and the cost of
coal and of central heating in my city has
increased 25 per cent.
I insist that the classes who are getting the
benefit of existing rent cantrols are not those
for whom the controis were originally
designed. The person wbo is paying $45 for
an apartmnent is not getting very luxurious
accommodation; yet, when suites in this category become vacant because the tenant is
moved to some other city, the landiord can
advance the rent to whatever figure hie likes,
and the man who is living in a house for
which be pays a rentai of $75 or $100 a month
can stay there at that figure. 1 have in mind
262 Hartford street, in the city of Winnipeg;
the tenant is paying, I beiieve, $77 per montb;
the house is warth $16,000 or $17,000. Wben
this man first rented the place he had two
chiidren; they are no longer with him, and he
and bis wife are living by themseives in a
bouse which would accommodate five people.
On my street is a house occupied by only
two people; formerly eigbt iived there. I
believe that these regulations have operated
to reduce the number of occupants per bouse
in this country by about 75 per cent. If a
personal reference will be pardoned, I wii
mention my own case. I own a bouse which
my bonourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) knows quite well: there used to
be six children in it; today there are nane,
only myself and my good wif e occupy it. But
I could not get another bouse unless I were
prepared to go out some distance and pay a
very bigh price. I cannot allow other people
to occupy the bouse, because I could not get
tbem out. So there we are, two people, living
in a home wbich would accommodate eight.

There are dozens of similar cases ini every
city in Canada.
The common argument agalnst decontrol is
that landiords would jump the rents. Certainly they would, under existing conditions.
Building costs have doubled, although many
people cannot or do flot want to admit the
fact. I can take you to any city i Canada
and show you that bouses which in 1940 could
be had for $8,000 are selling today for anywbere between $12,000 and $16,000, provided
possession can be given. The other day a man
walked into my office and said, III understand
a client of yours owns sucb and such a bouse".
I said "Yes, be does". He said III arn prepared
to pay $16,000 for it if you can give me possession". I said III can't give you possession.
The bouse is occupied by a man and bis wife,
and they will not get out. Do you want to
buy it subject to occupancy when available?"
He said 'II will give you $12;000 and take
a chance". In other words, the owner must
accept a loss of $4,000 because rentai control
is in force.
Who is helped by that kind of tbing? It
is the men and women wbo are quite capable
of paying mucb more than tbey are now
paying. Tbe returned soldier who did not
bave a bouse when be came back from overseas does not benefit. Since Marcb 1945,
except for a five-month period, practically no
renting occurred because as soon as a place
was rented it came under control and tbe
tenant could nat be put out. I suggest to tbe
government tbat it would bave been much
better to have put rent controls under a
separate bill, setting out rights and privileges,
and a basic rentai above wbicb. the tenants
could be moved out. Wby sbauld a bouse
that is worth over $8,000 be placed under
rent control? This contrai cannot help tbe
ordinary persan wba wants to rent; it can
only heip the wealtby. who want to rent.
Wby nat have some basic provision, and a
time limit? I arn perfectly sure tbat-and I
say this in a palitical sense-if it were nat
that an electian is to be held within the next
six or eigbt montbs, thîs Act would bave
been dropped. Nearly every country in tbe
world that bas tried rent control bas ultimateiy experienced a bousing shortage. Bath
France and Austria, which imposed rental
cantrals, bad to buiid block after block of
apartment buildings in an attempt to accommodate their people, and rentai control is
still in effect in France.
Canadians are wiliing to buy bouses, and it
is a goad tbing for a country, as weli as for
its peaple wben famiiies own their own
homes. My honaurable friend fromn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) taiked about
cbildren the other day. I arn not aware how

MAlaCH -23, 1949
much he knows about children from. practicai
experience, but I myseif know a gaod deal.
A house owned by the parents serves as an
anchorage for the f amily. I have heard my
grandchildren talk about "Dad's home" and
"Mom's home", and that is a gaod thing; but
rent control discourages home ownership.
I have nathing more ta say about rent contrais, but I should like this bil ta be referred ta the appropriate commlttee sa that the
Rentais Administrator can teil us what contrais have been lef t on, and why. I shouid
like him ta explain why contrais could not
be removed on properties vaiued at more
than, say $6,000, $8,000 or $10,000. 1 admit
that the governiment made a tremendous step
last fail when it provided that once a house
became vacant it was freed from contrai. But
that only helped in the case of the iess valuabie
praperties. Why shouid a home owner rent
his house at hall its value? What is the basis
or justification for that?
Hon. Mr. Hushion: Does my honourabie
friend know of any landllord who is getting
only hall value for his house?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I arn sure I do.
Hon. Mr. Hushion: I amn sure you do not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know of dozens of cases.
Hon. Mr. Hushion: I should like ta hear
about them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I may teil my honourabie
friend fram Victoria <Hon. Mr. Hushion) that
a house at 262 Harvard Avenue in Winnipeg
is rented for, I believe, $76 a month. When
it was first rented the selling price of the
bouse was about $9,000. The other day a man
offered $16,000 for it provided he couid get
possession, but his offer was $12,000 if he
couid nat. That is a straight tax on the owner
for the benefit of somneane else. If ail the
people of Canada benefited I wauld have no
objection. But they do not.
Hon. W. J. Hushion: Honourabie senators,
I came from a city where there are many tenants and iandlords, and I cannot quite agree
with the honourabie leader of the apposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) when he says that rentai,
contrais should be reieased entirely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Hushion: Yes, you did.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that. I said
on the expensive houses.
Hon. Mr. Hushion: When you speak about
expensive homes, it is a question of value. I
have a home i Montreal for which I paid
$7,500. 1 could seil it today for that amount
or perhaps a littie more. -There is nothing
extraordinary about that; it is ta be expected.

Taday Caniada is enjoying good times, and
perhaps it is well for the country that people
are anxious to, buy houses, because*iii some
cases landlords have been most unfair. I
should like ta see rent contrais malntained
Sa that tenants can go ta sleep at night wxthout wondering if "Mr. Landiord" wrnl wa]k
in the next morning and raise the rent $5 or
$10. The aniy mistake we made was ta allow
landiords ta inérease the rent or ta make a
lease for two years. Let me say that as far
as Montreal is concerned-and I presurne it is
the same in Winnipeg-tenants are paying
top rents for housing accommodation, and
I do not know of any landiord in Montreal
who needs sympathy in any shape or form.
Landlords are receiving the rent they
expected ta get when they built or bought
their houses, and therefore they are getting
fair value. The landiords are not suffering.
Six months ago the rent of both my sister
and my son was increased by 10 per cent,
and they have ta pay it.
I agree with the leader of the opposition
that rent contrais should have came under
a separate bill, because this is not a question
of steel, iran or other things of that sort.
Humanity enters inta the hausing situation,
and I think that contrais shauid be continued
until more and better hauses are available.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourabie senatars, as
the leader of the gavernment has said, this
is a very short bull. Its purpase is ta extend
the Continuation of Transitianai Measures Act
for one year. As I understand it from the
expianatian given by the leader, the Transitionai Measures Act ariginaiiy covered
appraximateiy fifty arders in council passed
under the War Measures Act. Thase orders
in coundil have now been reduced ta a dazen;
that is ta say, aimost farty of them no langerhave any legisiative effect whatever. This.
bull does not give power ta the Governar inL
Council ta amend any of the existing orders
in coundil.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that they cai
be reduced.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I said amend. Amend
has a different meaning than reduce. I was
gaing ta add that the anly power the Governor
in Council has with respect ta the tweive
orders now outstanding is ta revoke them
aitogether. Some substantial progress is
made here. The remaining arders in cauncil
caver rent contrai, steel contrai, timber contrai, citrus. fruit contrais and severai others.
I think my colleagues i this house are
sufficientiy well acqualnted with my attitude
of mind on thèse matters ta know that I do not
like contrais. During the war It was of course
necessary- for >the purpase of the great job

SENATE
in hand to regiment, control, restrict and
regulate our people; but the war is over, and
we should aim at moving as rapidly as possible out of this area of restrictions and
controls back to the free air that we enjoyed
before the war broke out. At the same time
I do not agree with the strictures of my
honourable friend the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) on rental control. There is
no doubt whatever in my mind that under
the rental control during and following the
war very grave injustice was done to many
individuals. As a matter of fact, if I may be
pardoned a personal reference, I could cite
an experience of my own.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I had a tenant in my
house in Winnipeg, and under the regulations
I could not pry him out. If I had been able
to get him out I could have sold the house
for much more than I ultimately sold it for
to the tenant. But I, like everyone else, have
to acknowledge that a certain measure of
inequity is inevitable in the operation of a
control like this. The control has to be
judged by the general good that it does for
.e people of the country as a whole, not by
whether or not it results in suffering to
,certain individuals. On that basis I think
the reasonable judgment must be that rental
control was necessary. And it may be
necessary yet.
I really do not think there is much to my
honourable friend's point that separate
statutes should have been introduced to cover
each of these orders in council. We have
developed the habit of passing laws very
freely, and the enactments now on the statute
books are almost mountainous.
As to steel control, I am not so sure. It
may be necessary, and timber control may
be necessary; but I quite expect that before
another year goes by the orders in council
authorizing these controls will be revoked.
The control on citrus fruits is necessary for
the time being because, under another measure which we shall be considering after this
one-the Foreign Exchange Control Bill, of
blessed memory-the governor in council
restricted the importation of citrus fruits. If
you restrict the importation of a commodity
and the supply becomes too small to meet
the needs or requirements of the people, the
Iinevitable result will be a rise in price. In
such circumstances there is probably some
justification for the citrus fruits control.
Having said that, I now wish to register
a protest against the sending of this measure
over here within two or three days of the
time that it must become law. Unless we pass
the bill in the meantime, the Continuation

of Transitional Measures Act will, as I understand it, cease to be law at midnight on
Saturday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In that event there would
of course be many dislocations. When such
controls as these are put into effect they
cannot be removed on twenty-four hours'
notice or even forty-eight hours' notice. So,
as I say, I wish to register a protest against
the sending of this measure to us at so late
a time. I wholly agree with the view
expressed by the right honourable gentleman
from Vancouver Centre (Right Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie). I am free to say that I do not
think the government arranged its business
very well for this session. We are required
to consider these measures without having
opportunity to examine them carefully and
obtain full information from officials exercising the controls. If there had been more time
we could have had the Rentals Administrator, the Timber Controller, the Food Controller and others before us in committee to
explain the need for continuation of their
respective controls. That, of course, will be
impossible now.
I hope that when it meets parliament next
year the government-and, honourable senators, I quite anticipate that the same government will meet parliament next yearHon. Mr. Haig: You are not anxious about
that?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I hope that the government in its wisdom will then give serious
thought to letting this statute die, and will not
again be asking us to continue it. By that
time even rentals should be in a much better
position.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The rentals difficulty arose
mainly from the fact that for four or five
years during the war scarcely any houses
were built in Canada. Of course, the necessary materials were not available. During
that period we had a substantial increase in
our population, and that, coupled with the
almost complete suspension of house building,
resulted in a very severe dearth of homes,
and that, in my judgment, was mainly the
justification for the rentals control. I close
by repeating the hope that next year we shall
not be asked to grant a further extension of
this measure.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators, I
should like to say just a word arising out of
a remark by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). He said he
disagrees with the contention that the orderin-council pertaining to rental controls should

SENATE
not, therefore, concerned at the moment with
the question of whether the goverrnent is
entitied from a constitutional standpoint to
do certain things. I arn satisfied to approve
the continuance of these measures on the
ground that it is for a lîrnited time, and,
secondiy, because it appears to be an orderly
retreat frorn controls and from controlrnindedness in governmental thinking. To
that extent I arn prepared to subscribe to this
measure.
Concerning the question of rentai controls,
I was very much interested in the remarks of
the honourable senator from Victoria (Hon.
Mr. Hushion), who spoke earlier this afternoon. Whether the situation throughout
Canada, as it affects the tenant is as serious
as he pictured it to be, 1 arn not in a position
to say. One can aiways find hardships and
inequities if one looks for them. in the administration of sucb legisiation as this. We have
to depend upon the judgrnent of individuais
to determine what is a fair rentai, and in
certain cases there are people who, when
they get a littie power, exercise it in a most
arbitrary manner. Be that as it rnay, I think
that during the war period there was
basically sorne elernent of equity and justice
in having a rentais control measure as part
of our wbole wartime program, and having
adopted such a measure, the question of when
we should step out of the picture then
becomes one of proper timing. If those in
charge of the administration of thîs phase of
the law feel the tirne has flot yet corne for
the complete cutting off of rentai control,
I arn not going to quarrel with them on that
point. I do, however, give this warning, that
rentai contrai is something that should not
be continued indefiniteiy.
If this question affects the lives of SO rnany
of our people that it becomes necessary to
continue the controls indefiniteiy,, then we
sbould recognize it from an econornic point
of view and deai with it in some way other
than by continuing the Transitional Measures Act. One rnust flot overiook tbe problemn of the landiord who, under cornpulsory
rentai controi, cannot get an adequate rentai
for his property. If the problem. is an inherent one affecting those people in our communities wbo are and aiways will be tenants,
then it exists in wartime, in the transitionai
period and in peacetime. If that is true, we
shouid face the issue and not forever continue a system of cantroi which is to the
advantage of some people and to the disadvantage of others. Briefiy, if the problern is
basic we must deai with it as such; but if
this bil represents an orderiy retreat from
a system. of rentai control which must be
continued through an adjustment period, I
arn in favour of it.

I may say in conclusion that at this stage
the principle of the bill does not give me as
much concern as did the continuation of the
Transitionai Measures Act when it was intraduced. We appear ta have moved so far along
the Une of decontrol that I amn prepared to
extend the legisiation in this iimited way,
knowing that within the period of one year
we wiil have another oppartunity to consider
the matter.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Wbat is the position of
the landiord when his expenses go up and
his rentai income is fixed? For instance, thue
tax rate in sornie communities may go up
two or three mills, and the cost of coal and
other commodities increase. Do I understand
that he can appeai the fixation order and
have bis rent increased?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Han. Mr. Davies: It seerns to me that in
our desire to be fair to the tenants, because
there are a great many of thern wbo cannot
buy houses, we sornetirnes overlook tbe landlord, who bas bad bis rent controlled for
five yearsHon. Mr. Haig: For eigbt years.
Hon. Mr. Davies: -and does not get a
sufficient return to carry bis property.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If my bonourabie friend
is asking me a question, I rnay say that I do
flot pose as an autbority on the interpretation of the rentai control regulations wbicb
bave been in force. Witbout answering bis
question fully, I would say tbat I recognize
tbe problim of the landiord wbo is asked ta
pay for services, througb municipal taxes, in
order that a tenant may continue to occupy
a building at a rentai wbicb is fixed without
any regard for the increase in costs. In tbe
interests of our national economy and as part
of tbe wartîme operation, I was prepared to
agree to that sort of tbing for a limited
perîod of tirne; but as a permanent feature
of our national economy, I arn 100 per cent
against it.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It bas lasted eigbt years
now.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If tbere is a condition
to be remedied, we must face it in some otber
way tban by requiring owners of buildings
ta make an ail-time contribution, at steadily
increasing cost to tbemseives, towards maintenance of their tenants.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I understand it, we
considered this measure this afternoon with
tbe definite understanding that it would go
over until tomorrow.

Mon. Mr. Haig: Weil then, let t1e honourable senator move the adjournment.
Hon. Mr. Ro.buck: Yes, I wffi. one of my

reasons for daung so la that some bonourable
senators who are not present may want ta

be beard. The purpose of requfring notice la
ta ensure that ail measures shall be before
the bouse for more tban one day, and that
nobody will be taken by surprise.
Hon. Mr. Robertson:, I take no exception ta
an adjoUrument, and I undertake ta bave this
bill sent ta cornmittee, altbaugb I sbould like

ta give a littie further attention ta the tinietable. As I bave said, I agree ta what my
honourable friend urges, and I arn prepared
ta go ahead witb tbe Foreign Exchange
Control Bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Go abead.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If possible, I should
like ta bave the canimittee commence its
bearings tomaOrrow morning, and somnetbing
should be done with one bill or tbe other in
order ta make the best use of our time. I
have an open mind as ta the best course.
Would it facilitate matters ta bave tbe bouse
meet tomorrow mornlng and the committee
in the afternoon?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is wbat I was going
ta suggest.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If second readings
were not given until the afternoon, the committee could not meet before Friday morning.
However, I amn at the disposal of the bouse.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: As one wbo
raised a preliminary objection ta tbe procedure, may I tbank the banourable leader of
the governrnent for this very fine exposition
and bis conciliatory approacb ta this problem.
What accurs ta me la that the honourable
leader could proceed briefly ta explain tbe
other mensure, without any extension of
debate, and bath bilas could go ta committee
tOMOrrow, thereby expediting the proceedings. I arn simply endeavouring ta be helpfui i tis regard. I bave made, and stili
maintain, a definite objection ta the fact that
the other bouse did not refer these mensures
ta us sooner. However, baving registered
my protest, and bnving been supparted
therein by honourable gentlemen on bath
sides, I arn prepared ta assist the leader
Of the government i every passible way i
order ta rencb a definite and satlsfnctary
conclusion on these matters.
Mon. Mr. Haig: I suggest that the bouse
meet. tomorrow marning at il o'clock. Tis
would alow Us two bours ta deliberate on
these measures, after wich they could be
considered i commnittee hi the alternoon.

Hou. Mr. Roebuck: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -There may be same other
honourable senators who want ta discuss
these bils, and if we met tomarrow
marnlng they would have the opportunlty ta
do sa. There are no committees meeting lni
the morning, and we shall have nothing else
ta do. The other bouse meets at il: with
consent of honaurable senators we can meet
at the saine haur, and by 1 o'clack we will
prabably have finisbed the debate. If somebody wanted ta carry over ta another day
that, toa, cauld be arranged. Meanwhile the
committee couki meet at 2.30 and dispose of
bath bills.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is there any reason wby
discussion of these bills should not proceed
this evening and the committee meet tamorrow?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Some honourable senatars
want time ta study them.
Mon. Mr. Lambert: Not much study is
required.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, that is a matter of
personal opinion.
Han. Mr. Lambert: We have had this
measure up before.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I arn quite willhng
that the debate should be continued tis
evening. I amn only trying ta facilitate
honourable senators in getting the maximum

amaunt of information.
friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
asked me speciflcally if i would agree ta the
adjournxnent. I said I would, and I have no
intention of changing my original statement.
My only abject is ta avoid letting tomorrow
morning go by without anything being done
about these bis.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I support the suggestion
of the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig). I do not like ta see legisiation o! this
importance brought into tis; bouse and
snapped through on the same day. It is not
rigbt. I am quite satisfled ta attend at Il
o'clock tomorrow morning, when I shall have
something ta say about the bull. I have feit
ail the way through tis debate that I was not
going ta speak tis afternoon, that I wauld
speak tamorrow, if at ail. But that is nat
important. What is important la that everyone who has something ta say shail be giv.en
the opportunity ta say it, and that we doý nat
close the debate in is absence-initiate it
and close it and bang the victini the sanie
day that he is charged. It is bad policy for
us ta do that kind o! thing; we should flnd
some better method of' achieving aur purposes. Sa I am ready ta meet at 11 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I agree with everything
that the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity has said as far as giving full opportunity for debate is concerned, but I would
point out that one very important phase of
this discussion will be in committee.
Hon. Mr. Howard: The most important.
Han. Mr. Lambert: I would say the most
important, and 1 think it is essential to determine at what time the Banking and Commerce Committee can meet and have certain
officiais before it to discuss the details, of, at
any rate, Bull 85. 1 do not wish to curtail
debate in this chamber. Personally I think
the work of the Senate in cominittee is more
valuable than its work here, but that is
another question. If we do meet in the
morning at il and continue this debate ail
day, the Banking and Commerce Committee
wouid have to meet Friday morning, and
third reading would come in the afternoon.
Personally I should prefer to have this debate
go on ail day today and let the committee
meet tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It seems to me that
that suggestion is perfectiy reasonable, but I
must not overlook our schedule.
Second
reading can be deferred until tomorrow.
If the house wiii permit, I shall take up
the bill to amend the Foreign Exchange Control Act. The samne procedure could apply:
we might arrange to have the Banking and
Commerce Committee meet tomorrow afternoon, continue tomorrow evening, and resume
if necessary on Friday morning for consideration of the two bis.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Is it intended
that either the Ministers or the Deputy Ministers and some officiais of the departments
concerned shahl attend to give the necessary
expianations?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Anybody that is wanted
that I can get.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
MORNING SITTING
MOTION
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I suggest to the honourable leader of the government that he make
a formai motion that the Senate will meet
at il o'clock tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have no objection
to that. I move, with leave of the Senate,
that when this house adjourns it stand
adjourned until tomorrow morning at il
o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received fromn the House of
Commons with Bill 85, an Act to amend the
Foreign Exchange Control Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson, with heave,
moved the second reading of the bil.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill, as
printed, appears to be a reiativehy short one.
It contemplates extending for a further period
of two years the Foreign Exchange Control
Act which, as in the case of the legisiation
with which. we just deait, expires sixty days
after the opening of parliament. I do not
need to suggest to honourable senators, and
particuiarly to those who were here in 1946,
what this Act implies. Its subi ect matter is
not new. This legisiation was presented to
pariiament in 1946 in response -to a generai
request that there be put into legishative form
the various orders in council affecting foreign
exchange which. had been passed ahmost from
the outbreak of war.
Honourable senators may recali that after
the legisiation was considered in the other
place it was carefuliy considered in this house.
In fact, there was so much discussion on it
and such a great difference of opinion, that
instead of giving the bill second reading and
referrîng it to committee, I remember quite
vividly-because it was the first time I had
deait with contentious legisiation in this bouse
-it
was only possible to have the subi ect
matter of the bill referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My motion carried,
and the bill was sent to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. It was
then returned to this house with the recommendation that second reading be given only
on the understanding that the bill would be
again returned to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce for further consideration.
Honourabie senators wili recahi that both
in the house and in committee long and carefui study was made of the bill before it was
finaliy passed. At that time the committee
recommended that there be a three-year
limitation, and this recommendation was
subsequenthy accepted by this house.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It was for two years.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: From January 1, 1947,
to 1949.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was three years.

MARCH 23. 1949
Mnaz. M4r. Robertson: I think it was for three
years. In any event it was to sixty days
after the opening o! parliament in 1949. I
arn certain o! that point, because I am introducing it at the present moment.
Now the desirability o! continuing in legislative f ormn the exchange control embodied
in the various orders in coundil passed during
the war, was founded largely on the need for
Canada to co-operate with other countries
to achieve an orderly transition from, wartime
conditions towards those o! peace.
Because of our very great interest in international trade, we were among the flrst
countries to co-operate in this international
scheme. I believe the people of Canada
generally thought, as we did at that time,
that it would be wise to co-operate in every
way possible in order to bring about a return
to peacetime conditions as rapidly and
successfully as possible.
There were two major obstacles in the way
of return to normal and more desirable conditions in international trade. These two
obstacles had arisen because of a variety of
circumstances, some o! which had to do with
the war itself and some with conditions which
brought about the war. I refer to the violent
fluctuation of exchange rates between countries, and the systemn of quotas, tariffa, and
various protective customs regulations. These
had grown up from thue to time and no
doubt had o!ten been more injurious to the
free flow of international trade than the
customs barriers themselves.
As regards the first obstacle-with which
this legislation primarily deals-I would
remind honourable senators that the International Monetary Fund was set up in the
closing days o! the war as the result of a
conference held at Bretton Woods. It was
designed to maintain stable international
We joined the International
exchange.
Monetary Fund and agreed to abide by its
regulations-and I presume we shall continue
to abide by its regulations as long as we are
members. Article 14, section 4(a), of the
agreement, states:
Each member undertakes ta collaborate with the
Fund to promote exchange stabllity, to maintain
orderly exchange arrangements with other members.
and ta avoid competitive exchange alterations.

The Foreign Exchange Control legisiation
was mntroduced in the session of 1946 and
passed by parliament. By it we undertook,
in essence, to co-operate with the Internatien Monetary Fund by controfling capital
movements rather than the flow of trade or
anything relating to the flow o! trade. I
remember very well the discussion at the
time. It had to do principally with our position in relation to the United States, because

of the extraordinarily large investments by
citizens of that country in Canada. My recollection is that those investments then
amounted to something like $6 billion. The
primary objective of the control was the
maintenance of stability and the prevention
of a flight of capital, which might have had
disastrous effects on our economy.
1Definite assurances were given at the time
as to the limited fleld of operation under the
Act. Honourable senators will recail that the
Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Control
Board appeared before our Banking and
Commerce Committee, and his evidence was
printed. He said the board was not in any
way concerned with the volume of business
that moved between Canada and the United
States. He considered it was the board's
responsibility and duty to provide bona fie
purchasers of United States goods wlth the
American exchange necessary to pay for
them, and also to provide exchange for
interest on bonds or flxed lnterest-bearlng
securities and for the refunding of such
obligations when they came due. He said,
as 1 remember his evidence, that the board's
concern over imports from the United States
was restricted to transactions that for one
reason or another were not considered to be
bona fide. For instance, if there was a request
to supply American exchange for goods
invoiced at a price which the board believed
to be in excess of their true value, this would
be regarded as an attempt to expert capital,
and the board would be concerned with the
transaction to that extent, but to that extent
only.
In the course o! debate on the bill In the
Senate fears were expressed by some honourable members as to the possible effect o! the
exchange control on our tourist business,
United States investments i Canada and our
experts to the United States, as well as on
our general trade relations with that country.
There was a good deal of discussion about
the fact that shortly before the introduction
of the bull the Canadian dollar, which since
the early days of the war had been subject
to a discount o! 10 per cent in terms of the
American dollar, had been brought back to
parity. This discussion revolved principally
around the point that parlty had been
restored by the goverrnent itsel! rather than
through legislation.
Our available supply of American exchange
was then at an ail-trne high of $1,300 mnillion, and the then honourable senator !rom
Vancouver stated i this house, or asked a
question lmplying the statement, that under
no possible condition would this tremendous
surplus o! foreign exchange be insufficient
for any requirements that mlght arise. That
was o! course only a matter o! judgment, and

SENATE
I fancy that the board itself probably feit
the amount was sufficient. However, i 1947
the government, of which I was a member,
was faced with a condition which certainly
was flot anticipated when the Foreign
Exchange Control Act was passed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt the
honourable leader at this juncture to mention
one point? I arn sure hie wiil recail, as wil
ail other honourable senators who attended
the meetings of the Banking and Commerce
Committee in the summer of 1946, that Mr.
Towers stated that ini his opinion oui fund of
American exchange would faîl much below
$500 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He said that an annual
decrease of about $300 million in our
reserves would be safe.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: 1 think the verbatim
record will show that hie anticipated a very
large drop in our reserves.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Did the honourable leader have me in mind when he referred to the senator from Vancouver?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I had in mmnd the late
Senator MeGeer.
The right honourable
gentleman from Vancouver-Centre (Right
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) was not then a member
of this house.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: But I knew
exactly what the situation was. We were
down $547 million.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My recollection is that
the Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Control Board contemplated a reduction in our
reserves, but not as large a reduction as
actually developed. I only mention this by
way of pointing out how uncertain future
developments are when the country is in the
midst of an nîl-out war, and what a tremendous effect unforeseen circumstances can have
upon the country's economy. Honourable
senators will recaîl that in addition to the
huge losses Britain suffered during the war,
she experienced very severe damage from
the unusually cold winter of 1946 and the
floods of the followîng spring, and that in the
summer of that year Europe had one of the
worst droughts in its history. These conditions created in Britain and on the continent
both a market for Canadian agricultural
products and a demand for assistance from
this country and the United States f ar beyond
what had been contemplated when the first
Foreign Exchange Control Bill was under
consideration in the Senate.
Honourable senators wili recaîl that we had
advanced $1,250 million on a boan which was
expected to extend over a period of five years;
but the extraordinary dernand for credit, plus

the unusual demand for agricultural products
resulted in a depletion of oui foreign
exehange much more rapidly than we had
contemplated. I remember very vividiy the
fail of 1947 when we found ourselves in a
most precarious position in the matter o!
exchange reserves. It was at that time that
the government of the day, of which I was
a member, utiizing powers which were said
to be possessed under this legislation, issued
orders in coundil, which were announced over
the radio. About six weeks later parliament
was summoned and the Emergency Exchange
Conservation Bll was presented, and passed.
This put into statute form. those orders in
counicil passed under the Foreign Exchange
Control Act. In ail fairness to the chairman
and the officials of the board, the utilizing by
the government o! powers which it felt
existed at that time did not constitute in any
way a breach of good faith.
I do not propose at this time to delay the
house long. I do not think that honourable
senators would willingly or carelessly refrain
from passing this bill. I cannot say what consequences would flow from our refusal to
continue this legislation in some form. Certainly we could not live Up to our obligations
in the International Monetary Fund if we
failed to pass the measure. The effect upon
our trade with other countries particularly
the United States, would be serious.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my friend?
I understand that the International Monetary
Fund permits us to drop the rate of our currency ten per cent.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is quite true,
but that is an administrative detail. Honourable senators will see that the question of
setting the currency rate, whether it be fixed
at par or at ten per cent discount, contemplates some control. Without control no
country could depreciate its currency, except
in the market place.
1 amn confident that the general prînciple
of the bull wiil commend itself to an overwhelming mai ority in this house, though there
may be details on which honourable
senators would wish to be informed. If
honourable senators do not see fit to pass the
bll, some forma o! substitute measure of
foreign exchange control will have to be
adopted. Some control is necessary if we are
to remain in the International Monetary Fund
and live up to our agreement. I submit to
honourable senators that the bil now before
the house is a desirabie one.
I would remind honourable senators that
this bill provides for the continuation o! the
controls for a period o! two years. One might
properly ask why the period was not limited

MARCK 23. 1949
to one year. I would not undertake to say
that next year parliament; would not; be asked
for a further extension of part of the TransiI amn neither a
tional Mensures Act.
prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I would
agree with my !riend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) that by next year it is flkely that
there wifl be a substantial reduction in the
twelve orders. As to the question of this
exchange leglslation being continued for a
period of two years, I do not think anything
vital turns on the matter of time. The government favours an extension for that period.
The governinent and its advisers are of
opinion that there is no possible likeiihood
of the need for the legislation dlsappearing.
My honourabie friend f romn Churchill has
said that he does not like controls. I do not
know that I like thema either, but I would
point out that this bill and similar measures
have been part and parcel. of oui general
program, in concert with other countries
whose governments think as we do, to tackie
the difficuit problem. of bringing the world
back from the terrifie impact of total war to
normal conditions. As regards rental controis, I suppose no such measure can be
expected ta be perfect.
I remember weii that in 1945, when I first
became a member of this government, the
war in Europe was just over and hostilities in
the Pacific were about ta cease. At that time
I regarded with concerfi the tremendous problem which this country faced in the transfer
of a million people from war industries ta
ordinary civilian occupations, and the rehabilitation of approximateiy 700,000 men o! the
armed forces. I was aware of the dislocation
that was aJ.rost sure ta f ollow. I recognize
that ail honourable senators may not be wholiy
favourable ta this measure, ,which is piesented in the interest of Canada as a whole
and of Canada's economic stabiiity. Consider what has happened since the end of
the iast war. Shouid I have been believed
at that time if I had stood here and said:
"I promise you that within the next three
years or so, those who are now engaged in
waî industry wiii have been absorbed into
the generai industry of this country, 700,000
men in the armed forces wil have found
other employment, and the nation's activity
wül have reached an ail-time peak level"?
or would you have credited me if I had said:
"I shail then ask you ta consider the necessity of a further continuance of these measuires in a troubied worid, and shall present
ta you these circumstances: an unprecedented prosperity in this country, sound
finances, and incarne tax exemptions restored
ta a pre-war level"?
Reflect, honourabie senators, how littie
inconvenience has been caused ta the great

mass of the people by any of the restrictive
legisiation whjch has been passed. Remember thathad we not co-operated with other
countries to. achieve this desirable goal,
nobody can tell where we would have been
today. The governiment of which I arn a
memnber believes,, as the resuit of the best
advice it can get, that fortunate and enviable
though our position is, it is going to, be
better. Tomorrow there will be untolded in
this house one major prospect of an expenditure in this country of millions of American
capital to develop one of the great resources
of Alberta. Neyer in our history has our
stabiiity, our capacity, our common sense, our
administrative competence paid such dividends. So, because the country is happy and
prosperous, and because its future seems sa
bright, I shail make no apology for asking
that a mechanism which has operated for
the good of ail shailcontinue to function for
a further period of two years. I amn informed
by my colleague the Minister of Finance and
those who advise hlm that, excellent as prospects are, there are contingencies which
might seriousiy affect our economy; and it
is the part o! wisdom to play saf e.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourabie senators,
I had intended to speak at once, aithough flot
at any great iength; but the hour is late, and
I should like ta read what my honourable
friend the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) has said. But before I
adjourn the debate I think it weil ta point
out that, but for the money the United States
has advanced to, Europe in the past two
years, our exchange situation wauid not have
been as rosy as my honourable friend depicts
it.
Hon. Mr. Howard: We admit that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And if that aid is not continued, God help this country. I was in
favour of this bill when it was brought in
during 1946, ta be effective from January 1,
1947. 1 fought strenuously for the two-year
period and, with others, did something to
have it inserted in the legisiation.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Three years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Two years from January 1,
1947. The bill was passed in 1946, but it did
flot corne into effect until the beginning of
the following year, and it continues in force
untîl sixty days after the opening of the
1949 session.
I was less certain of the wisdom of arbitrariiy, by government action, putting oui
currency at par with that o! the United
States, but as my reading aiong this line had
not been sufficient to enabie me to make up
my mind, I was unwiliing to criticize on the
basis of incomplete knowiedge. My mmnd was
troubled at the fixing- of an arbitrary value

SENATE
for our money; and on this point I want to
give credit to my honourable friend from
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). Two years ago
his speech on this question raised very grave
doubts in my mind. Since then I have given
further attention to the subject, and everything I read goes to convince me that the
best prospect of the world getting back on its
feet is through an exchange rate which is
universally recognized and respected. I do
not see the use of decreeing that our dollar
shall be worth 100 cents in relation to the
United States dollar. There are restrictions
on sending money to the United States. If a
man in that country owns a farm in Canada
and sells it, he cannot get payment in United
States currency. The purchaser can send him
Canadian money, which he may sell in New
York at a discount of 7 per cent. So that is
what our money is worth in comparison with
the American money-93 cents on the dollar.
I do not believe that Europe or the world at
large can recover economically unless there
is some stable basis of money value. Trade
cannot effectively develop without it. We
have insurance to protect maufacturers in
other parts of the world; the government
guarantees that if you sell goods to a certain
country you will receive so much money
from the transaction. All these things, as the
senior member from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) said a little while ago, are based on a
war psychology. I am not blaming the government for this state of mind; it is common
to all of us, and the sooner we get away
from it, and agree that there must be some
basis of value upon which we can freely
exchange, the better. Business cannot flourish
otherwise. I cannot see that the British
pound is worth $4, when nobody will give $4
in American currency for it; and from our
standpoint the ability to exchange for
American money is very important. It is
true that the amount of American exchange
in this country has increased. In part, it
consists of money received from cattle sold
from Western Canada to the United States
last year, when the export of our livestock
was permitted.
I intend to speak further on this motion,
but as quite a little legislation remains for
attention this afternoon, with the consent
of the house. I will move adjournment of the
debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts,
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts beg leave to make their
second Report, as follows:Your Committee recommend:1. That the rate of compensation for John F.

effective April 1, 1949.
2. That the rate of compensation for Charles Roch
Lamoureux, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, be
increased to $5,600 per annum, effective April 1,
1949, and that the allowance of $600 in lieu of
quarters be discontinued.
3. That the compensation paid to C. Batterton for
the carriage of mails between the Ottawa Postal
Terminal and the Senate Post Office be increased
from $3 per diem to $5 per diem during the Session
of Parliament, and from $35 per month to $50 per
month during the recess of Parliament, effective
January 26, 1949.
4. That the daily rate of pay for Debates amanuenses be increased to $7.50 per diem, effective January 26, 1949.
5. That the daily rate of pay for John Abbott
Hinds, James Dunnet MacDonald and Alfred Fortier,
temporary Committee Clerks, be increàsed to $9 per
diem, effective April 1, 1949.
6. That the daily rate of pay of W. D. Johnston
and Peter Auger, temporary senior constables, be
increased to $6.70 per diem, effective April 1, 1949.
7. That the daily rate of pay for Senate Charwomen be increased to $2 per diem, effective April
1, 1949.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I should like to make one comment on this
report. It does seem to me that the pay of
$2 per diem for charwomen is too low. I have
no objection to any of the other increases
recommended in the report.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the daily rate for
a charwoman was only $1.50 before.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then it was much too
low. I just wanted to put in a word for the
charwomen.
The motion was agreed to.

CONTINUATION 0F TRANSITIONAL
MEASUIRES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 86,
an Act to amend The Continuation o! Transitional Mensures Act, 1947.
Hon. Arthur W. Ro.buck: Honourabie senators, when I adjourned the debate on this
bill yesterday, I did so largely because I feit
that the debate should not be initiated and
ended in one day. I also wished to protect
the right of any member, not present yesterday, to speak in the debate today and,' by
adjourning the debate, to prevent any possibility of a charge that this house was railroading important legisiation.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourabie senators,
there are one or two comments that I should
like to make on this bill. My instinctive
revulsion from legisiation which institutes
or maintains controls is very much ameliorated or modified by the fact that the controis continued by this bill are but the fagend of many controls which were thought to
be necessary during the war. Rent control
is the most important control to be continued.
I fancy that he would be a boid man who
would argue that during the war and the
period immediately thereafter the extraordinary and vexatious landlord-and-tenant
situation should have been allowed to continue. The greatest factor in bringing about
industrial stagnation is the increase in the
cost of carrying on business that accompanies
advancing land values and rents; and had
the landiord been allowed a free hand during
the time of desperate need of housing and of
accommodation for business, there is no doubt
that he would have «"taken the bide"' o! the
family man, the chap who needed a place in
which to live and to work. It was unthinkabie
that we should have allowed the landiord to
take fufl advantage-he did take some
advantage-of the power he had la his hands

during the .extraordinary period of the war.
And -to my mind that argument exterids,
though with less force, to the situation of the
moment,
But it seems to me to be worthwhile to
point out that at this time rent controi is
not the way to handie the problem o! a shortage o! houses. In our communities houses are
taxed more heavily than anything else. We
hear a good deal of criticisrn of the sales tax.
It is 8 per cent, and, goodness knows, that is
enough. There is fair ground forwcritlcism,
because the tax does a great deal of damage;
but once the 8 per cent is paid the taxpayer
does not have to pay any additional sales tax,
and from then on our governments do not
interfere with his ownership o! the goods on
which he has paid the tax. But if a house is
bullt, as long as the house stands, it is taxed
every year an average of 4 per cent o! its
value. That 1.5the most drastic form of taxation that we have in our communities, and it
has discouraged bouse-building and has
increased the cost of housing for our people.
Obviously, our approach to this probiem of
housing should be through the removal, by
our federai, provincial and municipal governments, o! the taxes upon houses and housebuilding materials. These materiais should
be free of tariffs and excise and ail such taxes,
and bouses should be relieved of the annual
ievy that is now made on them by municipalities.
On the other band, we shouid increase taxes
upon land values and make it more and more
difficuit for anyone ta keep the cold wet
blanket of specuiatively-heid land around our
communities. I say that because the greatest
difficulty encountered by wouid-be bousebuilders today, in this great country of aimost
unlimited area, is that of obtaining ground
upon wbich to build. If we did two thingsif we made it easier to suppiy bouses and
more dîfficuit to withhoid the land needed for
them, we wouid cure the housing problem by
naturai means and not have to resort to
drastic mensures, such as putting a government officiai in control of rentais.
I received tbrough the mails yesterday a
paper from New South Wales, and I noticed
these two sentences which are probabiy
worth readlag:
Taxes in New York are on what we know as
improved value as distinguished fromn the New

South Wales plan on unimproved value. Ail polis in
this state -as ta the incidence of local taxes have
condemnned improved value taxes and have been in
favour of unimnproved value taxes.

In New South Wales no municipal tax is
levied upon bouses, ahi the taxes fali upon
the value of the land. That is the system we
sbould have la this country, and I submnit

SENATE
be done by rentais control, for it would by
natural means encourage people to supply
the houses needed, and at the same time it
would discourage the holding of building
sites for high prices.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May 1 ask one question of
my honourable friend? Was that not advocated
some years ago in New York, by people who
believe in Henry George's theory?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: 0f course that is the
theory of Henry George, one of the greatest
of economjc philosophers; and it has been
advocated in New York. But the mere exemption of improvements from taxation is not
the whole philosophy of Henry George. 0f
course it follows the reasoning to be found
in George's great book Progress and Poverty,
written many years ago. Some people have
been impatient that his theories were flot
adopted immediately; but it sometimes takes
a long while to get a bright idea into a duli
head.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Sometimes they neyer
get in.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true. And the
more fundamental and simple the idea, the
more unlikely people are to grasp it.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The Mon. The Speaker: Honourable senators, the motion is for second reading of Bill
86, an Act to amend the Continuation of
Transitional Measures Act, 1947. Is it your

Somne Hon. Sena±ors: Carried.
The motion was agreed to.

provisions, whereas the bill now before us
is fundamental i its nature.
The question of foreign exchange control is
going to become increasmngly important in
this country as the months pass. In saying
that, I speak from an economic rather than
a political standpoint. The bill itself deals
simply with the extension of the control of
foreign exchange, but one cannot understand
the fundamental issues if he forgets that the
government of this country, in July 1946,
said that our dollar was worth a hundred
cents on the American dollar. With the
placing of our dollar at par, immediate and
drastic measures became necessary to control
the foreign exchange situation.
My reason for offering this criticismn is my
belief that if we leave our dollar alone the
problemn will solve itself. True, during the
war Our money was at a discount of ten per
cent, and we were required to pay $1.10 or
$1 .11 for American dollars. The difference
in exchange just about paid the cost of doing
the business. Whether that wartime policy
was right, I do not know; but today our dollar
is selling in New York at 93 cents, and
whether in the complete absence of foreign
exchange control its value would fluctuate
Up or down is something that nobody can
predict.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me a question? If the
uncertaînty is such, and the dollar value is
now 93 cents, why is the honourable gentleman in favour of fixing its value at a ten
per cent discount?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, but I am not. I am
very much opposed to that policy. I say
that is what the government did during the

The governnient chose to put our money at
par, with what result? The result was as
natural as the setting of the sun. The people,
realizing that they needed new machinery
and other equipment for factories, took
advantage of the revaluation of our money
and rushed to the United States to buy.

decides, immediately upon Canadian money
going to par, that he will take advantage of
the situation and acquire new machinery.
I know of a number of people who purchased
li the United States new equipment worth
as much as $50,000 and $100,000.
Hon. Mr. Hugesuen: That is a strange way
to destroy trade.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a minute, my friend.
We could not afford such punchases in the
United States. The minute such expenditurcs were made our foneign exchange literally flew out the window, and depreciated so
rapidly that drastic curtailment became
neccssary. My argument is that our money
should be left to find its own level. If we are
able to buy a dollars worth o! American
goods with a dollar of our own, well and
good; but why should the Canadian manufacturer buy American machinery when he
has to pay a dollar for ninety cents worth of
cquipment?
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: What would happen
if the dollar were not fixed at par?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It would find its own level.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: But you would get
your machinery for less.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. The Canadian manufacturer would not buy the machinery if he
had to pay the discount.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: But he mlght get the
machinery for less.

Hon. Mr. Haig: He might, but such has
flot been our experience. The minute you
fix the rate, and control, forelgn trade, the
country takes advantage of it.
Everyone knew when the government put
the Canadian dollar up to par in 1946 that
the foreign exchange balance would go "out
the wlndow." That is exactly what it dld, and
we had to have a police force to guard the
vaults and curtafi trade.
What are the governnient doing by means
of this bill? They have reversed their attitude. 0f course, our forelgn exchange position has improved a littie, but the greater
part of our sales of primary products to
Europe is being paid for either through
'United States loans to the importing nations
or by the credits we have advanced to theni.
I predict that by next f ail, unless the 'United
States continues to pour money into Europe,
there will be no customers for our primary
products. Already our sales are dedlining
because of the stagnating effect of controls
in ail these countries: and as far as we are
concerned this bill continues the controls.
Prior to the last war we sold large quantities of natural products to Britain. To pay
for these goods Britain used dollar exchange
malnly obtalned in five ways: first, through
the proceeds of sales to the United States
of products from British. controlled Asiatic
countries; second, through investments li
dollar countries, especiaily the United States;
third, from the earnings of her international
shipping; fourth, from. the insurance business
which she carried on from London; ftfth,
through manipulation of the money markets
in London, where exchange for ail the worlC
was bought and sold. From these sources
Great Brîtain was able to acquire sufficient
American dollar exchange to balance her
purchases on this continent.
But what hs her situation now? She has
lost most of her Asiatic possessions; a great
part of her shipping was destroyed during
the war, although some has since been
replaced; London no longer monopolizes the
international money market; her insurance
earnings have been drastically reduced; and
her overseas investments, such as railroads
in Argentina and hIdustrial securities in
Canada, have been sold to pay for imports of
bec! and grain. As a resuit, she has not the
money to buy our products, and if we buy
from the United States we must get Amnencan money someway or other to pay for oui
purchases. Under these circunistances, the
Canadian goverinnent imposed controls, to
limit purchases from. the United States. Fortunately for us the American governnient
relaxed its restrictions; and owing partly to
the Geneva agreements and partly to cattle

SENATE
disease in Mexico, we sold 400,000 cattle to
the United States at a very high price, which
supplied us with a good deal of American
exchange. At the same time, official curtailment of purchasing from the United States
further improved our currency situation.
But that state of things cannot go on.
Overseas countries are recovering their
domestic supply position. Great Britain no
longer needs to take the same quantities of
bacon, eggs and other commodities from
Canada. Through the international wheat
agreement she has reduced both the prices
and quantities of her wheat purchases from
North America. All these things add up to
the situation wherein Canada, facing difficulties with controlled currencies throughout
the world, is maintaining a similar policy.
An honourable senator has stated that in
virtue of the Bretton Woods agreement we
cannot depreciate our currency more than
10 per cent. I doubt whether the agreement
goes that far, but whether it does or not, we
have to face the fundamental fact that, next
to Great Britain-or perhaps even more than
Great Britain-we are dependent upon international trade, because three-eighths of our
production must be sold on world markets.
A large proportion of this production consists of natural products. But today, in the
sterling area, Poland is producing bacon,
Hungary wheat, and Denmark butter, for
sale to Great Britain in competition with ourselves, although we extended special preferences in connection with these products to
Great Britain during the war. The British
have arrived at agreements with Russia to
exchange tractors and electrical supplies for
Russian wheat.
I foresee a great deal of difficulty in our
economic situation. The first thing we should
do is to begin to free our currency, so that
those who receive ten dollars from us in payment for goods supplied, can be sure of
getting ten dollars anywhere in the world.
We have got to come to a realistic valuation,
not only for our own sake but so that the
rest of the world will follow our example.
Only by this means will the real value of our
goods be reflected in transactions on the
world markets.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Canada cannot
do it alone.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that, but nothing
will be done unless somebody starts to do it.
The United States have a free currency now.
We of all people are the best able to initiate
this reform. I do not argue that we can
do it alone, but we can make the first move.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I think the
policy proposed by the honourable gentleman
is that which was advocated some years ago

by the Winnipeg Free Press: "Let the dollar
ride on the tide of trade."
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. In the minds of some
people gold is 'everything. At one time in
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta we
talked about wheat as if it were gold. We
would say about something, "it is just as
good as the wheat'.
That expression was
commonly heard on the prairies a decade or
two ago, but from 1930 on questions began to
be asked about how good wheat was. Other
factors had to be reckoned with. Germany
and Italy put on heavy duties. France grew
and continues to grow a lot of wheat. Conditions like this must be faced. I say there is
no country which needs more urgently than
Canada does to settle the basic value of its
money. It will be a troublesome and painful
business, but we shall suffer worse consequences if we do not do it.
Unless the policy of the government in
regard to stabilizing the value of our dollar is
changed, this bill is absolutely essential. That
is the situation. And control is the essence of
the legislation. If you want to go to the
United States or to Europe you must justify
to some official the purpose of your trip, or
you will not get the money. If you need
American currency you must explain why;
if you want to send money to the United
States, you are subject to the same regulations. Should an American citizen sell a
farm in Canada which he owns, he cannot
get the proceeds in United States currency:
the Canadian dollars he receives must be sold
in New York at the best price he can get for
them.

In conclusion, I urge upon this house, the
government, and the people of this country,
that we start to stabilize our currency on the
basis of the valuation which the world puts
upon it. This course would help our tourist
trade. If today our dollar was recognized as
being worth 90 cents in United States funds,
or the American dollar were worth $1.10 in
our currency, the numbers of American tourists in this country would greatly increase,
because it is human nature to go where you
can get more value for your money. As
things are, the tourists may be getting the
worth of $1.10 for every dollar spent upon
food and clothing and accommodation, but
the real difference in currency values should
be admitted.
Sales of pulpwood, metals and cattle have
helped keep our respective currencies in some
sort of relation. If it were not for the immense
quantities of pulpwood products, basic minerals and the large numbers of cattle and hogs
that we sell to the United States, our
American currency reserve would not be a
billion dollars. Our exports to the United
States saved us in the past, and they will save

MARCK 24#, 1949
us in the future; but why should our produets
not bring their reai value ini our own country? I arn not sure of the figure, but I think
we seil our pulpwood in New York for $100
or $110 a ton.
Hon. Mr. Davies: $106.
Hou. Mr. Howard: You mean wood pulp,
flot pulpwaod.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I amn referring ta the
product of the puipwood. If there were a
discount of, say 7j per cent, the Canadian
dollar wauid be worth 7j per cent more in
Canada than it is today. Why should we not
benefit by that arnaunt, and not be forced to
accept whatever we can get for aur products
here? Uniess Canadians realize that they are
selling a world product on a world mnarket,
and adjust themseives accordingly, they will
continue ta pay for this policy every day. and
as a resuit any adjustment in the future will
be more difficuit.
Honourable senators, as I said before, I arn
not going ta vote against this measure because
I feel that it is absolutely essential just as
long as the government continues ta stabilize
aur dollar at par with the American dollar.
I arn nat critical of the Foreign Exchange
Contrai Board officiais. They have done the
best they couid under the circumstances, but
I do think the government should change its
policy and return ta a basis of real value for
the Canadian dollar, and let the world price
set itself. This would stabilize world trade ta
our advantage.
Hou. Mr. Aselime: I understand rny honourable friend does not agree with the forfeiture
of Arnerican money by persans returning frarn
the United States.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is a detail which I do
nat intend ta discuss here.
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Hanourable senators,
in the light of several statements made by
the honourable leader of the apposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I should like ta make a few observations on this bill. 1 do nat profess ta be an
ecanornist and prabably cannot challenge, on
any sound economic basis, certain of my
honourable friend's statements, but I would
point out severai facts which I f eel he has
entirely overlooked.
In the first place, rny hanourable friend
spake in f avour of a stabîized world currency. But if we dld have such a thing, It
would be absolutely essential ta have some
sort of foreign exchange contrai in perpetuity.
It is quite impossible ta have a stabilized
world currency wlthaut having an international bank and a contrai functianing in the
various countries.

I think my honourable friend has been a
littie confused in his thinking. He suggested
that we should let aur dollar flnd its natural
level and get on the same free basis as the
United States dollar. We ail know that the
United States taday are in an entireiy different position frarn that of any ather country
in the world. Under present clrcumstances,
if we rernove all contrais and let our dollar
find its naturai level, it la difficuit ta say what
suffering wauld take place in Canada. There
would certainiy be great disruption of business, for several reasans, one being that
Canada is dependent upan the United States
for a great many of its necessities. We buy
aur sugar, tea, caffee, citrus fruits and much
of aur consumnable faodstuffs on the United
States market, and we have ta pay for these
products with United States dollars. If we
were ta let aur dollar find its natural level
it la quite possible that it would be discounted
20 or 25 per cent, as it was after the First
Great War. This would resuit in an inimediate increase in aur cost of living, and in the
cast of imparting variaus American goods into
this country. I arn sure that this is one factor
which the government has considered in
attempting ta maintain some sort of contrai.
My next point is that, in order ta carry
on their operations, every manufacturing
industry in this country is dependent upon
the importation of parts fram the United
States. If, as has been suggested, the dollar
were allowed ta go ta a discaunt-there is no
suggestion that it would go ta a premiuma greater burden wauld be put upon Canadian industry. The cost of production would
be increased and aur industries would be
greatly handicapped in competition on foreign
markets.
Another important and determining factor
la the contrai situation taday is aur inabillty
ta balance-as we always have done in the
past-our foreign trade with the United
States. I arn sure that every honourable
senatar is aware that Canada has neyer been
able ta balance its fareign trade with the
United States, except by affsetting it by a
f avourabie trade balance with other countries.
Theref are it la perfectly certain that if all

SENATE
would be most disastrous to remove ail forms
of foreign exchange control, and let the
chips fail where they may. It must be
realized that until the world is a littie more
settled Canada will not be able to secure
fromn the United Kingdom and the countries
of Europe the exehangeable currency that
she received prior to the war. 1 arn one of
those who feel that some formn of foreign
exchange control is absolutely necessary until
a free-trade basis can be re-established and
an exchangeable currency can be obtained
in order to balance our trade.
I do flot prof ess to know whether our
dollar would go to a discount of 5 or 10 or
20 per cent, but I do know that after the
First Great War the Canadian dollar dropped
to a discount of approximately 27 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What is the Canadian dollar
worth in New York today?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It was at a substantial
discount for some time; I believe as much as
18 per cent. I do know that industry has
been pretty well satisfied with the functioning of the Foreign Exchange Control Board,
and 1 should like to take this opportunity of
saying that, of all the boards that have functioned during and since the war, the Foreign
Exchange Control Board has carried on with
the greatest efficiency and the least criticism.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is true that the board
was established at an early date, when it was
possible ta pick very able men.
Han. Mr. Horner: I do not agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Howard: It is a matter of opinion.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: 1 arn not saying that
every member of the Conservative party
will agree with it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You do not need to bring
parties into the discussion.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Maybe the honourable
gentleman fromn Toronto does not have as
rnuch trouble as the rest of us do in getting
money for a trip to the United States.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I say that industryand, after ahl, it is industry that is chiefly
affected by this law-was pretty well satisfied
with the administration of the f oreign
exchange control during the war.
I would like to refer to one of the arguments of the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). He said that if our
dollar was at a discount of 10 or 1.5 per cent
the people would not spend their money
abroad. I disagree with hlm. It is true that
we would have to pay more for any goods
bought in the United States, but the fact is

that our industries cannot avoid buying such
things as tools, machinery, printing pressesmy honourable friend mentioned these-and
certain other things that are not; manufactured in this country. I say that a discount
of 10 or 15 per cent on our dollar would not
make a particle of difference in the United
States expenditure of Canadian industries.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it would.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The fact is that
throughout the period when our dollar was
subi ected ta a heavy discount we had an
adverse balance of trade. A slackening off
the regulations under the Foreign Exchange
Control Act was accompanied by an increase
in our expenditures in the United States, and
we quickly developed an adverse balance.
The reason is that we depend upon the United
States for a great many things, and it is
natural for Canadians to purchase these
things there as freely as conditions permit.
Our expenditures rose to a point that could
flot be offset by the trade that we were doing
abroad. At the saine time we were extending.
large credits to the United Kingdom and
other countries, and were not receiving from
them any commodities that could be converted into Arnerican dollars.
It is unfortunate, I suggest ta honourable
senators, that this measure extends the
Foreign Exchange Control Act for two
years.
While I believe foreign exchange
control to bc nec'essary at present, 1 feel
that the Act should be subi ect ta review by
parliament every session. I agree with the
suggestion that was made in our Banking
and Commerce Committee, I think by the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), that the Foreign Exchange Control
Act migaht be reviewed by parliament
annually, just as the Army Act is reviewed
annually by the Parliament of the United
Kîngdom. If that were dône we could have
an accounting fromn the officials every year
and keep the law more directhy under the
control of parliament. In my opinion it is
the duty of parliament to make sure that
legislation of this kind does not become
permanent. I do say, however, that the sound
handling of our currency problems during the
war, and since, has had a stabilizing effect
upon industry and has done much ta create
confidence throughout Canada and abroad in
the financial administration of this country's
affairs.
Han. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, at
the outset I wish to apologize to my colleagues for a rather husky condition of voice.
For the hast several weeks I have been under
the disability of laryngitis. No doubt some
of my colleagues in the house may think that.

MARCH 2d. 1949
is not an unfortunate thing. However, I do
flot propose ta speak at length on the bill,
because, while I like the Foreign Exchange
Control Act no better than I did tbree years
ago, I realize that unless we pass this bill
wlthin about 60 hours from now the Act will
expire; and if that should happen there
would undoubtedly be a great deal of terrporary dislocation in the country.
I endeavour ta look at a matter like this,
honourable senators, i a practical way. The
Foreign Exchange Control Act, whose lif e
will be renewed for two years by this simple
bill that we are now considering, stili provides for ail the powers and penalties that it
has provided for throughout the last tbree
years.
Hon. Mr. Asellbne: WhMy not extend the
Act for one year only?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That would suit me.
I wish here ta register a protest, a strong
protest, against the condition under which
we are allowed practicaily only two days in
which ta deal with this ineasure. I do not
wish to be unjust ta the goverrnent, but I do
think that I this instance parliament is not
being treated with the respect and courtesy
that it deserves. 1 arn well aware that the
measure drifted along in the other place for a
considerable time. There was a long debate on
the Address i that place. In passing, I
may say that after the first week littie that
was said there i the debate on the
Address was worth saying. Hawever, we
must face the situation that we find here,
and I do think that we, as members of a parliarnent which still can lay dlaim to a large
measure of freedom, have no other means
of ifluencig the governmnent ta change or
improve this measure than by protesting
agait it.
Honourable senators, 1 was interested i
the speech made a few minutes ago by rny
good friend the senator frorn Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell). He seemed ta me to be arguing i two directions. If these controls were a
good thig during the war, and have been a
good thing since-I admit that they were
necessary during the war, but not that they
were therefare a goad thig-why would it
not be weil ta continue themn permanently?
That is precisely the argument that aur
socialist friends make. Here let me state one
of the reasons why I do not like the controls
as now authorized by aur statutes. The
Export and Import Permits Act is part of the
law of this country. With the passage of this
Bill 85, the Foreign Exchange Contrai Act
will continue i force for the ensuing two
years. I submit that should the C.C.F.-the
socialist party-corne inta power tomorrowHon. Mr. Howard: No danger of that.

Hon. Mr. Czerar: -these two measures
would provide thern with much of the
machinery required ta carry out their socialist theories. I make no bones about the fact
that I amn opposed i principle ta this
measure; but as a supporter of a Liberal
administration--or an administration that
caîls itself Liberal-I arn doubly opposed ta
placing upon aur statute books legislation of
this nature, which provides the machiery
for complete authoritarian control of the
commerce of this country. I do not think it
is desirable, and I arn sure it is flot sound.
Now, whence corne these ideas of controls?
After World War I the controls then in force
were abandoned as rapidly as possible. I
recail that i the Unionist administration of
Sir Robert Borden, I, as Minister of Agriculture, had the supervision of food contrai i
Canada. Sorne of my coileagues at the time
thought that we should nat get rid of the
controls too rapidly. But the day alter the
armistice was signed I called the Food Controiler ta my office-if anyone cares to
examine the powers of the Food Controiler
durig World War I, he wrnl find thern just as
broad as any granted during the recent warand I said ta him, "Prepare now ta get rid of
the controls as rapldly as possible". True, we
could flot let thern go overnight, just as we
cannat get rid of this measure in such a short
time; but within approximately two months
they were taken off and the people were free
ta make their own mistakes, if they wanted
ta do so.
Now, why has the governmnent decided that
we should keep certain cantrols? I cannot
believe otherwise than that that decisian is
due i a large measure ta a new schoal of
ecanarnic thaught which developed between
the twa wars. There can be na daubt that
the econamie theories af the late Lord
Keynes made a pawerful impact upon the
world during the iter-war years. It is now
pretty generaily accepted that the philosophy
af the late President Roosevelt's New Deal i
the United States was based upon the
econornic theories af Keynes. Fallowing the
rise of Hitler ini Germany, a rnuch mare sinister effect upon the world occurred through
the efforts of an eminent banker by the
name of Schacht. He was the man who
worked out the financial schemes by which
Hitler re-armed Gerniany and bufit up the
armaments that she possessed at the outbreak
of the war. Many af the theories we have
today stem back flot only ta Keynes, but ta
the devices which Schacht deveioped. and
employed for the restoration oi Germany.
Personafly, I amrn ot prepared to take my
economie philosophy iran' a German banker

SENATE
Controls have a way of growing and of
fastening themselves upon the publie mind.
We do flot like them at first, but we become
accustomed to them, we accept them, and
finally we think they are good for us. That
has been the sequence of progress in this
direction in recorded history wherever people
have lost their freedom and liberty. It is
because of that challenge that I take my stand
today against the powers conferred by this
bil. For the sake of argument, let us suppose
that after the recent war we had thrown the
exchange controls out of the window. What
would have happened? Our dollar would
have suffered a heavy discountHon. Mr. Howard: You bet it would.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -but would that have
irnperilled the nation? After the First World
War, when exchange control was removed,
our dollar went in a short time to a discount
of 22 per cent, as compared with the Amenican dollar. Immediately that happened the
natural corrective forces commenced to operate in such a way that within a f ew years our
dollar was selling in New York at a premium,
over the American dollar.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my friend a
question? In his comparison of the post-war
period of the Second Wonld War with that of
the First World War, does he overlook the
radically changed position of the pound
sterling?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The radically changed
position of the pound sterling has not, in my
opinion, very rnuch to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It has everything to do
with the problem today.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not agree with you.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Would my
friend permit a further interruption?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, it does rather throw
one off his line of thought; but go ahead.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Two years ago
the balance of exchange as between ourselves
and the United States had gone down to the
sum o! $547 million, and if, for the sake o!
argument, no corrective steps had been taken,
and no drastic measures, including the Foreign Exehange Control Board, had been
adopted, the Dominion of Canada would very
soon have been bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. Aseltîne: That is not a question.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My friend from. Vancouver is labouring under an illusion in that
respect. I asked for the sake of argument, if
we had not been under the necessity of
getting a permit for the export and import of
goods, but rather had commercial freedom,

what would have happened? Our exports to
the United States would have immediately
gone up because the American prices were
higher than Canadian prices. Notwithstanding the fact that we were losing our Amenican dollar balance all through 1947-and I
ask rny good friend frorn Vancouver to, bear
this in mind-the government refused to give
permits for the export to the United States
o! Canadian beef cattle, oats, barley, and
many other commodities as well.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And the export o!
lumber.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, lumber. That policy
was continued throughout 1947, when our
American dollar supply was running out.
Then in November, 1947, the government
adopted the austerity program. I have said
before-and I arn not one to "back water"that the adoption of that program. was a most
unfortunate use of the powers given to the
government.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I hold this view, that if
it were necessary to employ such drastic
measures, parliament should have been called
into session to discuss them.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is a different
matter.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: These prohibitions on the
export of Canadian beef cattle to the United
States were not removed until August, 1948.
Within four or five months our exports of
cattle and beef to the United States amounted
to about $70 million. From that one source
we got 70 million United States dollars, which
helped to correct this "imbalance" in our
trade with the United States. So I say to my
honourable friend from Vancouver Centre
(Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) that I amn not
so sure that we would have reached the
position we did if our trade had been wholly
free. But there was one other disability that
we would have suffered.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if he thinks that the Exchange
Control Board had anything to do with the
lifting of the ban on exports of cattle to the
United States?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They had nothing to do
with it at all.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, I did not attribute
it to the Foreign Exchange Control Board;
but I say to my honourable friend that it was
done under the powers given to the government in the Export and Import Permits Act.
My argument is not directed solely against
the Foreign Exchange Control Board, but

MARCH 24, 1949

against this whole principle and its effects.
If anyone cares to examine the list of statutory orders and regulations issued on Wednesday, March 9, he will find an order in
council which was passed on February 8,
1949, consolidating the regulations which
require permits for exportation. For instance,
I cannot export oats or barley to the United
States. I may be a trader in Winnipeg having
an order from say a Chicago customer for
50,000 bushels of oats, but the transaction
cannot go through until I have applied to the
appropriate authority in Ottawa or Winnipeg
and got permission to make the sale.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is not a policy of
the Foreign Exchange Control Board.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not saying that it is.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It is the trade policy.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I know it is the trade
policy; but what I am trying to point out is
that these things tie in together. In regard
to this whole business of control, it seems
quite clear that there is a very definite
opinion in Washington that there must be a
revision of the valuations of currencies, particularly in Western European countries; and
while it is always dangerous to enter into
the region of prophecy, I for one shall not be
at all astonished if, before this year is outin fact long before it is out-the United
States will be putting pressure on European
countries to place a realistic valuation on
their currency.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And I am not sure that
they will not follow the same course as far
as Canada is concerned.
The honourable government leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), in introducing the bill, stated, quite
correctly, that one of the reasons for foreign
exchange control arose out of our adhesion
to the Bretton Woods agreement and the
international monetary fund. As regards the
conditions of the international monetary
fund, Canada or any other country is free
to let its exchange fluctuate within a margin
of 10 per cent. I am not going to discuss now
the point raised by the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), whether it was wise
or unwise to restore our dollar to parity in
relation to the United States. However, we
adhered to the Bretton Woods agreement. By
this agreement, it was decided to establish
an international monetary fund, which, it
was expected, would be the agency to regulate exchange difficulties between the nations;
and also an international bank for reconstruction and development, to function as an
agency to loan money under banking conditions to European nations for the re-establishment of their economies.
29091-17

Hon. Mr. Robertson: And to other countries.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And to other countries,
for that matter: my honourable friend the
leader of the government is quite right. Now,
it is a fact that the Bretton Woods agreement
has not produced the results expected of it.
No one will deny that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That was the prediction of
the Social Crediters.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The chief reason for its
lack of success was that the task of rebuilding
the world is so much greater than was
envisioned at the time the agreement was
made that it became of very little value.
Hon. Mr. Howard: There was not enough
money in the world.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That agreement has been
superseded by what? By the American and
Canadian loans to Britain; by the loans made
by the United States and ourselves to other
countries that we have financed; by the
so-called Marshall plan, the E.C.A. plan which
has made American dollars available to
Europe for purchases from the dollar areas.
Let me say in passing that had the United
States not inaugurated that wise, far-seeing
policy, the economy of this country today
would be in a pretty difficult position. We
need not disguise the fact that our happy
situation at the moment is due in large
measure to the fact that Marshall dollars,
so-called, were available for purchases in
Canada for Europe.
I have talked at greater length than I
intended. I believe profoundly that the only
sure way for the world is to get back to multilateral trade and remove the barriers that
now impede it. I am delighted to see at
times indications among our good Conservative friends of a return to, shall I say, reality
in these matters.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are becoming the
Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We invite you to join us.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As a matter of fact, my
honourable friends are not placing quite the
importance they formerly did upon protective
measures in fiscal policy.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: The death knell
of protection!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Naturally, being one who
believes in the freest possible trade between
nations, these indications give me hope and
enouragement. But, make no mistake about
it, currents of world trade have changed very
greatly for the time being as a result of the
war. It is not without some reason that

this measure will never come before us again.
My first reason for thinking that the Foreign Exchange Control Board administration
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

MARCH 24, 1949
should be continued for another two years is
that it involves a commitment to an international body. In my opinion, to withdraw
from that body by defeating this bill would
be equivalent to having Canada withdraw
from membership in the United Nations without giving any notice. There is a high moral
commitment in connection with the International Monetary Fund. Whether or not we
agree that this fund has achieved much
towards regulating and stabilizing world currency, it must be remembered that the United
Nations has been unable to attain anything
like the objectives hoped for when the Charter
was signed in San Francisco in 1945. The
fact that Canada is about to approve the
North Atlantic Pact is a pretty good commentary upon the hopeful but unrealistic
view taken of the United Nations Charter in
1945. Therefore, I think this bouse, when
considering this bill, should bear in mind the
international ideal involved, and our commitment to do our share in this particular sphere
to bring the world to a more peaceful and
normal state of living than it has enjoyed for
several years.
Once again I would remind honourable
senators that the fundamental thing to
remember is the distinction between trade
and exchange or monetary problems. In my
opinion one of them, as my honourable friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has so
forcibly emphasized here today, is basic and
fundamental; the other is ancillary and
secondary.
The Exchange Control Board which was
set up in this country when war broke out
was intended as a defensive instrument to
protect this country's financial strength so
as to make our part in the war more effective.
Canada was an active participant in the war
for more than two years while the United
States was still a neutral country, and one
does not require very much imagination to
realize that a flight of capital from this
country during those years would have
greatly hampered our efforts to co-operate
with those nations that then were our military
allies. To my mind the argument that the
Exchange Control Board should be as useful
in peacetime as it was during the war is not
a sound argument, but I believe that until
some of the international economic relations
contemplated in documents such as the
Atlantic Charter can be established all over
the world, so that every nation will have
free access to all sources of food and raw
materials, we shall need defensive instruments by which to gauge the vitality and
strength of our economic and financial life.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Would my
honourable friend permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Certainly.
29091-17j

Righ± Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I have given
some little study to economic problems, and
I know that in the economics of industry
there are three great factors: production,
distribution and exchange. My honourable
friend will pardon me if what I am saying
seems academic. He himself is a very able
economist and I would ask him if he does
not think that exchange is the vital factor in
governing the trade policies of the world?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I agree that the
economic factors of industry are those mentioned by my right honourable friend, but
I do not agree that exchange is the determining or predominant factor. I think that production and distribution are inseparable, and
that our trade policies must be formulated
so as to provide a basis for exchange. I may
be old fashioned in adhering to that classical
view of economics.

The senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) emphasized the disruption and dislocation that have taken place in Europe as
a result of the war, and I think that in so
doing he bas given the main reason why we
must maintain a certain control of our
monetary relations with other countries. It is
easy to picture, for instance, what would
happen to the sterling bloc countries and
France if the pound sterling and the franc
were completely freed from exchange control. Trade with those countries would
immediately become chaotic: there would be
no basis at all for intelligent assessment of
the value of their goods. Until the world in
general is wise enough to recognize that
there have been fundamental shifts in productive areas and in the economic position
of countries that now command most of the
world's purchasing power, we cannot dispense with instruments such as the Foreign
Exchange Control Board.
As to the desirability of freer trade with
the United States and with the world in
general-in other words, the desirability of
carrying out some of the idealism contained
in the Geneva trade agreements and the
Havana charter-I think there would not be
much difference of opinion between my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and me, but I believe it is wrong to
assess our exchange control operations in
terms of present trade restrictions.
The
restrictionist measures that were brought into
effect in the fall of 1947 were the result of a
trade policy, and the Foreign Exchange Control Act was used as a convenient means of
effecting that policy. Surely none of us who
sat around the table during discussions in the
Banking and Commerce Committee in the
summer of 1946 were surprised that our
dollar exchange was running out.
Mr.
Towers made it perfectly clear that that

SENATE
would happen. Some of us tried to emphasize then that as a means of offsetting our
dollar shortage it was better to expand our
exports to the United States than to create
restrictions. I should like to say now that if
that had been done in 1946 it is likely that
the need for further control of exchange and
other restrictionist measures would not have
existed.

that?

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: With reference to the
point raised by my honourable friend, I
should like to make it clear that what I have
just been saying has been by way of emphasizing the distinction between this exchange
control and a trade policy. If we want to
discuss reciprocity with the United States or
questions arising out of international trade
agreements, let us do so, but we must be
careful not to blame the exchange control
administration for something that is really
not its responsibility at all. I agree with my
honourable friend as to the desirability of
greater trade with the United States.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think that question and
the exchange question are bound together.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Exactly. But one is
basic and the other is secondary. That is the
point I am trying to make.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Will my honourable
friend permit a question? Do I understand
him to imply-I do not think he said-that
he disagreed with the government's policy
of 1946 in placing our dollar on a parity with
the United States dollar?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I was not referring to
that, but since my honourable friend has
asked the question I may say that in my view
the placing of our dollar on a parity with
the United States dollar was a wise antiinflationary move. Honourable members will
recall that in those days there was a real
problem. If I might digress still further, I
would submit that the action taken by Mr.
Truman during his presidential election campaign and the measures afterwards proposed
by him confirmed the wisdom of the position
taken by this country with regard to our
dollar in 1946. There is no doubt that Mr.
Truman and those associated with him recognized that decontrol had been put into effect
in the United States too early, and thereby
led to very serious inflation.

In

1946 it was apparent to us that our

American dollars, at the rate at which we
were using them, would soon run out. We
had two alternatives: first, to take certain
steps to increase our export trade to the
United States, and second, to do what was
finally done in the fall of 1947, adopt austerity
measures.
If we are discussing the trade question, I
personally have no hesitation in saying that
I should like to see more positive steps taken
towards developing the export trade of this
country with the United States and other
parts of the world. I should like also to see
Canada clarify her position which, to me,
looks like vacillating between the sterling
bloc on the one hand and the American dollar
on the other.
Sooner or later I think we must choose our
position in relation to the trade question.
Having done that we would then meet the
problems which have arisen through our
bilateral agreements on food and other commodities. We are beginning to question Great
Britain quite severely, I think, concerning
her present policy of making barter deals
and bilateral treaties with countries in the
soft currency areas and, to a certain extent,
thereby delaying world recovery. In the end,
the acid test of our ability, and that of the
world, to recover a peaceful and normal state,
will be the re-establishment of the kind of
commercial intercourse which characterized
international relations in pre-war years. Until
the ground for such a relationship is prepared, I see no escape whatsoever from these
defensive instruments, such as the Exchange
Control Board, which must keep its hand
upon the pulse of our dollar value and currency circulation.
Hon. Arthur Roebuck: Honourable senators, at the outset allow me to call to the
attention of the house the high plane on
which the debate has been maintained this
morning. Honourable members have been
applying their experience, knowledge and
wisdom to the problem at hand without
prejudice, quietly and judicially, and with
very little attention to party lines. The
clock points a warning hand, and for that
reason my remarks will be brief.
Honourable senators will recall that when
the Foreign Exchange Control Bill was first
before this house I opposed it on the matter
of principle as vigorously as I could. I said
at that time that I was opposed lock, stock
and barrel to the measure and that it did not
matter whether it was amended in small
details or not. The senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has just referred to what
are sometimes called "the Heintz 67 varieties"
of amendments made to the bill, and has said

MARCH 24, 1949
that in its final form the bill contained the
original general principles, though ameliorated, perhaps, to some degree, particularly
in the respect to duration. The bill was
returned to this house and, with a great deal
of doubt in the minds of honourable senators,
it was voted upon.
The honourable senator from Ottawa has
just given us a dissertation on the principles
of economics as applied to trade on the one
hand and exchange on the other. I do not
propose to enter into that phase of the discussion, except to say that there is not much
difference between telling a businessman
that he cannot buy goods from his neighbouring country, and saying that he will not be
allowed to pay for them. One is a trade
restriction, the other is a financial restriction,
but the result is exactly the samne. The
Foreign Exchange Control Bill before us is
just another of the manifestations of the
philosophy of protection, with which I
entirely disagree.
I was very pleased with the stand taken by
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). It was
entirely non-partisan, and seemed fraught
with clear thinking.
Honourable gentlemen will remember that
when this measure was last under discussion
I said I was not in favour of the suggestion
generally advocated by those opposing the
government, namely, to fix the rate of
exchange. I was as much opposed to a measure which stated that our dollar was worth
90 cents as I was to the statement that it was
worth 100 cents. What I ask for and believe
in is a free economy, and the quicker we get
back to it the better it will be for the people
of this and other countries.
I agree wholeheartedly with the excellent
and forceful statements made by the senator
for Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I too am
a free-trader, and I believe that our salvation
lies in getting rid of controls and allowing
business interests to pursue their own advantage in their own way.
The question now is whether or not the
board has in the past three years accomplished anything which justifies the renewal
of its powers. It has been pointed out that
our balance of some $500 million of exchange
has been expanded. The honourable senator
from Vancouver (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie)
was impressed by the fact that our exchange
balance, of approximately a billion and a
half dollars at the close of the war, had
decreased to half a billion dollars by the time
the drastic measures were adopted. The
reason for that, in my opinion, is that foreign
exchange was a monopoly, and that men who
were not realists were put in charge of it.
I have no criticism of the officials of the

board, personally; they are courteous and
no doubt well-intentioned men. They have
exercised the drastic powers given to them
with as much moderation and sympathy as,
under the circumstances, one could expect
from any official. Our first great blunder
was the retaining at the close of the war of
a government monopoly of foreign exchange.
We should have allowed natural laws to take
their course at that time. Then our difficulties
arose.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my honourable friend what he means by a "government
monopoly of exchange"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is obvious enough,
is it not?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It is an international
matter.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The government
required that every person in Canada who
came into possession of United States or
other foreign dollars should deposit them
in the bank; the money came to Ottawa and
was made a government monopoly. All
foreign exchange was in the hands of the
government.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Surely there is
a tremendous difference between national
policies on foreign exchange and control
boards, and the international factors which
relate to and affect credit and other economic
conditions between nations.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps so; but the
fact is that we gathered into government
hands all foreign exchange.
I fear that I shall exceed my time if I get
into that discussion. I think we should continue this debate on the motion for third
reading, after we have heard from the
government's advisers, so I shall refrain at
the moment from trying to make all these
points clear as I see them. May I have just
two or three minutes more, and then, if no
one else wishes to speak, we can adjourn
the house.
Our great difficulty in the matter of
exchange-our loss of exchange in factwas due, as has been said, to the ban on the
sale of cattle and grain, the government's
monopoly of gold, and the government's
monopoly of the purchase and sale of wheat.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: When the honourable
gentleman suggests that the adverse trade
balance was due to these prohibitions, does
he not realize that we have never had a
favourable trade balance with the United
States?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true. The
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) modestly said that he was not an

to indicate to the Prime Minister whether or
not Royal Assent will be possible at a
quarter to six.
Honourable senators, with that explanation,
I would move that this bill be now read a
second time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) tell us what
possible excuse there is for asking this house
to rush legislation of this kind? I do not
know anything about it; I have not heard of
it before, and I cannot see what is involved
or what terrible thing will happen should
we decide not to gallop along at such a pace.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The two bills dealt
with yesterday and the one now before us
expire "sixty days after the opening of parliament," which is tomorrow night. The
other two bills are not quite so urgent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It has been known for
a long time that these Acts would expire
sixty days after the opening of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am quite conversant
with that fact, which is something that is
beyond my control. I am simply making the
best explanation that I can of the situation.
What this house sees fit to do is its own
concern.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Pursuant to what
has been said by the honourable gentleman
from Toronto-Trinity (Mr. Roebuck), may I
ask whether this bill makes any drastic alterations in the legislation which we had before
us a year ago?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I could explain the bill
in about two minutes if I were given an
opportunity to do so.
Hon. Mr. Haig:.Honourable senators, I
think it would be to our advantage to allow
the leader of the government to make his
explanation, and then we could say whether
or not we should go on with the bill. I do
not think the bill would make much change.
It does propose one drastic change, which I
do not particularly like, although I do not
see any great harm in it. I refer to the
removal of any time limit to the life of the
corporation. Also, the bill would increase the
amount of money that the corporation may
lend, to $10 million, a sum which seems very
small in comparison with the large amounts
that we have heard mentioned in late years.

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Before I move the
second reading of the bill, may I with leave
of the Senate, explain what I purpose asking the house to do this afternoon? This bill
is one of the measures which will expire
tomorrow night, and which, therefore, I shall
ask the house to consider this afternoon.
In due course His Honour the Speaker
will announce that at least one more billthe Mail Contracts Supplementary Payments
Bill-has been received from the House of
Commons. He will also announce the arrival
of the Agricultural Products Bill, if it reaches
us in time. As these bills do not expire until
the end of the month, I shall not ask that
they be given second reading before next
Monday; I shall, however, ask the house to
proceed this afternoon with the second reading of the Canadian Commercial Corporation Bill, which expires tomorrow night.
After it has had second reading, I propose
to refer it to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, where the Minister
of Trade and Commerce and the Deputy
Minister of Finance will be available for
questioning. The house can then deal with
the reports of the committee on the two bills
that were before it yesterday, and when they
have been disposed of and the bills have
been read the third time, I propose to move
that the Senate adjourn during pleasure so
that we may consider the Commercial Corporation Bill in committee. In due course we
will return to the Senate, and deal with the
bill here.

SENATE

has been said by some honourable members
about matters as to which I am powerlessthat the bill be given second and third readings today, if the Senate sees fit. I might
remark here that I intend to present to the
house later on, when I have more time, a
suggestion which I hope will receive serious
consideration.
However, that is another
matter.
This bill seeks to amend the Canadian
Commercial Corporation Act. The corporation was established in 1946, and part of its
function was to take over the activities of the
Canadian Export Board, which up to that time
had arranged for the procurement in Canada
of various civilian supplies for foreign purchasers. The corporation was also empowered to act as agent for the obtaining in other
countries of goods to be imported into Canada.
This function of the corporation was necessary
because the international allocation of certain
commodities had resulted in a short supply in
Canada, and it was thought that through the
corporation we could be assured of getting
our full share.
In 1947 the powers of the corporation were
further extended, in that it was authorized to
serve as agent to contract for and obtain
supplies on behalf of the Department of
National Defence. This function had originally been exercised by the Minister of Trade
and Commerce, in pursuance of government
policy that a civilian department should
obtain supplies required by the various
branches of the Department of National
Defence, a policy that greatly reduced
administrative expenses.
The bill before us further amends the
Canadian Commercial Corporation Act in
three respects. Section 1 of the bill authorizes borrowings by the corporation. It also
provides that when the corporation's services
are used by a department or agency of the
government, the corporation may recover its
proper out-of-pocket expenses and proportionate overhead from the agency or department concerned. Section 2 extends the life of
the Canadian Commercial Corporation.
In referring to the amendments I intend to
deal with them not in the order in which they
appear in the bill, but by taking first the one
that I consider to be of major interest to the
Senate.
The first point, although it is under section
2 of the bill, is that the life of the corporation is extended. In 1946 when the Act was
introduced, it was recognized that the period
of international disturbance and the conditions which arise from it would continue for
a considerable period, and the measure came
to this house without any limitation as to
time. This honourable body in its wisdom
decided that there should be some limitation

on the life of the corporation, and fixed it
at three years. Now, sixty days after the
opening of parliament, this measure is
expiring.
The government now proposes that the life
of the corporation should be extended
indefinitely, for two reasons. First, it is felt
that the corporation, which will continue to
exercise its function as a purchasing and
contracting agent for the Department of
National Defence, should be in permanent
form. Second, for some considerable time
it has been apparent that international conditions and uncertainties will still affect,
thougli in less degree, the supply of products vital to Canada's economy. For instance,
there bas been an uncertain situation in
Malaya, where tin for Canadian use is
obtained. The Canadian Commercial Corporation was engaged to procure tin from Malaya,
with the result that the maximum amount
available was secured.
Section 8 of the original Act provided that
the corporation should have a certain fund
to carry on its activities. This fund was to
be used for current expenditures only, and
when a purchase was made the corporation
was to be immediately reimbursed by the
department or agency concerned. The corporation now finds that it requires all of this
fund to carry on its day-to-day operations,
and it is proposed under this bill that the
corporation be authorized, with the approval
of the Governor in Council, to borrow $10
million from the Minister of Finance. This
advance is not for the purpose of increasing
the current account, but to ensure, should
the anticipated or actual shortage of any
commodity make stockpiling necessary, that
there will be sufficient funds for that purpose.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Would my
friend permit a question? Does he refer to
subsection 2 of section 1?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I was referring to
section 1, subsection 2 of which deals with
borrowing. I dealt with section 2 of the bill
first, because I felt that it was of greater
interest to the Senate.
Prior to May, 1948, expenses incurred by
the corporation on behalf of other agencies
of the government were paid by the department or agency concerned. The Deputy
Minister of Justice then expressed the opinion
that there was no statutory authorization
for this, and the practice was discontinued.
It is now proposed through this amendment
to legalize the practice for the future.
At this stage I should like to present briefly
a few facts to indicate the extent of the
activities of the corporation. Since its establishment it has made purchases in Canada

MARCH 25, 1949
for foreign governments and other agencies
to a total value of $272 millions, an amount
far in excess of the credits granted by parliament in respect of such purchases. In
other words, purchases made in Canada for
those seeking our products are materially in
excess of the credits extended by the Government for this purpose. As agent for the
Department of National Defence, the corporation has placed more than 113,000 contracts,
to a value of about $200 million. As was
anticipated, it has effected important savings
in costs of administration and has improved
general efficiency. The Minister of Trade and
Commerce has stated that he knows of no
other purchasing agency, governmental or
civilian, which operates as economically as
this corporation. Since 1946, when the bill
was introduced, the activities of the corporation in the field of foreign trade have been
steadily decreasing, and now it only exercises
its powers in that respect under unusual conditions and very much less frequently. Most
of its day-to-day activities consist of exercising its functions on behalf of the Department
of National Defence. As I have said before,
there is some reason to believe that because
of the uncertain international situation a
shortage of certain commodities may occur at
any time. The government wishes to ensure
that Canada shall be able to obtain the
maximum amount of these commodities for
distribution to both small and large users in
this country. It does not intend to, nor will
it, use the corporation in competition with
individual exporters or importers.
I have outlined as briefly and clearly as
I can the principal points of this measure.
From my past experience-because the bill
was before us previously-I am of the opinion
that the item relating to larger borrowing
powers will not be seriously questioned, since
it is well known that the activities of the
corporation as a purchasing agent of the
Department of National Defence may be
materially increased, and that, in respect of
such commodities as tin, some stockpiling
will probably be necessary. That point, I
think is not very important. The statutory
provision that a certain amount of costs and
operating expenses may be charged by the
corporation to the department for which it
will act, seems only reasonable. From what
I know of the background of this measure,
I imagine that any discussion of it will probably revolve principally around the question
whether the corporation should be continued
indefinitely instead of, as was enacted in
1946, for a fixed period; that is, whether conditions have changed to such a degree as to
warrant such continuance. I do not know
that I can be of much assistance in determin29091-18

ing that question; but if, apart from details
such as this, the general principle of the bill
receives the approval of the house, I will
arrange to have it sent as soon as possible
to committee, where I have asked the Minister of Trade and Commerce and officials of
this department to attend in order to amplify
the explanation I have already made.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And answer questions.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Can the honourable
leader tell the house how many persons are
employed by this corporation?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am sorry that I
cannot.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And how much money
they receive in salaries?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have not that information, but I am sure it will be available to
the committee.
Hon. John T. Haig: When the measure
which it is now sought to amend came before
us, Canada was lending money in varying
amounts to certain nations. For example, if
some foreign state proposed to spend $30
million on Canadian goods, we would put up,
say, $15 million, and they would provide the
balance. But they needed some body with
which they could deal, and this is the agency
that was used. I still think that it was an
excellent arrangement.
In the past I was never able to determine
how the government did its buying: apparently a good deal was done by the Department
of Trade and Commerce, and each department
purchased for its own requirements. I think
the present method is a great improvement,
although like everything of this kind, it
depends on the man who is running the show.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: From my knowledge of the
Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce, who
was with us in New York in 1946, I am not
at all uneasy about the way in which the
department is being run under his administration. My only misgiving about an organization of this kind is that it tends to get away
from parliamentary control. I know how an
agency of this kind operates in a much smaller
way, because for the past thirty years Manitoba has had a purchasing agent who purchases for the regular departments and other
branches of the government.
Al must
requisition through him and he is responsible
to the legislature-by whom he is appointed
-not
to the government. This plan has
worked very successfully in our province.
Officials of this commercial corporation
have been drawn from other departments,

SENATE

and the suggestion was made to me that these
men were receiving much higher salaries than
they had been getting in their previous positions. However, it frequently happens that
a man up to the age of 30 or 35 may occupy
some niche which he does not fit into, and
when he gets a position for which he is well
suited he is probably worth a larger salary,
so I make no criticism on that ground.
I am in agreement with the proposal to the
repeal of the time limit. In such a measure
as the Foreign Exchange Control Bill which
was before us yesterday, I strongly favour a
strict time limit. To illustrate my meaning,
if I am not out of order, I would adopt what
the honourable member from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) said of certain measures, that if
they were to be continued indefinitely, a government which wished to pursue the policies
favoured by the present government of Great
Britain, would need no more legislation to
carry its platform into effect. But this is not
the kind of bill to which that argument can
be applied.
Honourable senators, I cannot speak for my
party, because we did not know anything
about this bill until a few minutes ago, but
I am personally in favour of this legislation.
I think it is along the right lines, though
I would not be so strongly in favour of it if
I did not know the man running it. I believe
this legislation will be well administered.
Honourable senators, I think the government should be told that future legislation
of this kind should not come to this house in
the dying hours of a sixty-day period. It is
not fair; it is not fair to the people of Canada,
and although this house will probably pass
the bill, honourable senators will be unable
to give it the consideration it deserves.
My feelings are similar to those of the
member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) a day or so ago when he said he was
so uncertain about a bill that he wanted the
night to think it over. If honourable senators
had a week or ten days to study this legislation I think they could give it much better
consideration. It must be remembered that
the Senate does its best work in committee,
where honourable senators can question
witnesses and fully discuss the measure
before them. In my short experience of
fourteen years in this house the Senate has
made valuable and worthwhile amendments
to legislation, but it cannot do this if it is
hurried.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: This measure was discussed for only one day in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is just as bad. It
must be remembered that there is a difference
between our two houses of parliament.
Members of the other place are elected by

the people, and whether they like it or not
they have to stand for election every four
years. They are always aware of this fact,
and cannot give to legislation the same
detached consideration that it receives in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They talk too much.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When my honourable friend
from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was a
member of the other house he was not so very
quiet. I used to read his speeches, and I
know he was as talkative as the rest.
Honourable senators, I am in favour of
this bill, and under the present circumstances
I do not wish to delay its passage. I am willing that it be sent to committee this afternoon, but I would tell my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that I do not
like such hasty procedure.
Righ± Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not blame my honourable friend for it. I blame the people who
laid out the strategy for this session. They
should have realized that this is an election
year and that there was bound to be a great

deal of talking done.
senators may argue that had parliament met
early in January the legislation would still
have expired sixty days after the opening of
the session. That may be true, but the
Speech from the Throne could have been
postponed and this legislation like the Newfoundland measure could have been put
through. I think parliament would have permitted the government to do that. I criticize
the government for laying this legislation
on our doorstep just when the Governor
General is coming through the front entrance.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, far
be it from me to interfere with the mild
criticism made of this measure by the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig). The so-called analogy he has drawn
with the province of Mantioba is in fact no
analogy at all. It is true that the government of Manitoba has a purchasing agency,
but it is only a purchasing agency for the
supplies of that government. It does not go
beyond that. If this bill were confined to the
matter of purchases for the Department of
National Defence, no reasonable objection
could be made to it; but it goes much farther.
If honourable senators recall the discussion of this measure when it was before
us for the first time, they will realize that
this legislation puts the government into
business in a big way. It may be that the
agency of government performing these functions was useful and helpful immediately
following the war, but I must remind honour-

MARCH 25, 1949
able senators that the war has been over now
for four years. This bill proposes to fasten
on the people of Canada, without limit as to
time, a government agency for doing commercial business in any field it wants to
enter. That is the provision which is being
extended by this bill. I was really amazed
to hear the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) say that he had no
objection to the unlimited time provision in
section 2 of the bill.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
discuss this measure at length, because I
realize that it will probably be passed in its
present form. I do wish, though, to protest
against embedding permanently in our legislation the idea of a government being
empowered to continue indefinitely in ordinary commercial business. The honourable
leader of the opposition has said that he
knows the Deputy Minister of Trade and
Commerce, and that he feels this measure is
quite safe in his hands. What would happen
if a C.C.F. or some other government should
come into power and want the Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce to do something
that he did not want to do? If he refused,
that government would quickly get rid of
him.
This legislation, along with the Foreign
Exchange Control Bill, puts into the hands
of any future government, practically
unlimited power to control the commercial
life of this country. It also will give it power
to pass out favours here and there. I can
imagine that Canada might possibly get a
government that would be quite willing to
pass out favours from which it might reap
some reward. Canada has had such governments-provincial and federal-in the past,
and it may have them again. I object in
principle to giving this power to any government, whether it be a Liberal government,
a Duplessis government, a C.C.F. government
or any other kind of government. It is
unsound and unwise to do this, and I deeply
regret that the government has seen fit to
propose a removal of the time limit from
this legislation. After all, there is some
protection in the fact that every one or two
years a government must come back to
parliament and give an accounting of what
it has done.
Honourable senators, I would like to see
in this bill a limitation of time, similar to
the one contained in the existing Act.
Right Hon. Ian Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, I just want to say that I entirely
support the remarks made by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
and in doing so I would refer honourable
29091-181

senators to section 2 of the bill, the explanatory note of which reads as follows:
The repeal of section 19 of the Act has the effect
of continuing without specific time limit the life
of the corporation.

I say without the slightest hesitation that
that paragraph is a complete negation of
Liberalism and a complete usurpation of the
principles of democracy. We should move
an amendment providing for the review of
this measure by parliament every year. The
people's parliamentary representatives, those
elected to the other house and those appointed
to this chamber, should have the right to
review this legislation annually. Who in the
world conceived this section? Where did it
come from?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I answer my
right honourable friend?
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It was originally the
idea of the government of which my right
honourable friend was a member.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I must deny
that. I was in the government before my
honourable friend, and I never consented to
any legislation of this nature.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It came from that
government. It was government legislation,
introduced in 1946 when my right honourable
friend was the senior member of the government-

Hon. Mr. Howard: And leader of the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, and when I was
the junior member of the government. And
that legislation was brought over here and
amended in the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: At that time
certain things were done that I was not in
accord with-things which I cannot discuss
here now-as my honourable friend knows
very well.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That may be so, but it
is part of our theory of government that if
we do not agree with things that it does we
get out.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: If you believe
in the essential ideas of Liberalism it is a
great thing to assert your own principles,
when you can assert them. I say that this
extension is a negation of Liberalism and a
usurpation of the essential principles of
democracy. The life of the corporation should
be subject to renewal by parliament every
year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the right honourable
gentleman answer a question for my informa-

SENATE

tion? If the Commercial Corporation Act was
not in effect at the present moment, who
would buy supplies for the Department of
National Defence or, say, the Department of
Public Works? Nev'er having been a member
of the government, I am not familiar with
this matter. I always thought that every
department purchased its own supplies. If
the C.C.F. party came into power would each
department buy its own supplies?
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then there would be no
change.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I would like to say a word or two,
first in reference to the functions of the
government purchasing agency. I think we
all understand the distinctive function of such
an agency, and those of us who have had any
practical experience in connection with
government purchasing will agree that the
system of purchasing through the corporation
is a great improvement over departmental
purchasing.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamber±: I do not know whether
the corporation purchases for other departments than National Defence, but I should
like to see a central agency purchasing
supplies for the penitentiaries and every
department of government.
On the question of the corporation's function
in controlling trade, my mind is a bit
confused. I believe that when we go into
committee on the bill we shall find that whatever the corporation does by way of controlling international transactions is done on
a voluntary basis. In other words, my understanding is that no individual enterprise would
be interfered with in the slightest degree, that
the corporation cannot take any compulsory
action with respect to any business, but that
any business may request the corporation's
services. If I am wrong on that I should be
glad to be put right in committee. If I am
right, it seems to me that the corporation is
very different from an autocratic and relentless machine which could be used to make
binding commitments for Canadian business
firms in international transactions.

Parliamentary
becoming a thing of the past, and executive
government is taking its place. Just as in
former times there have been constitutional
changes, resulting in the taking of authority
out of the hands of the King and transferring
it to the hands of parliament, so now there is
a further change-partially necessary because
of our more complicated business and governmental affairs-in the transfer of power
from houses of parliament and deliberate
assemblies to small groups of executives acting behind closed doors.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Dictators.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the progress of
our times. It seems to me it is a progress
which we in parliament should resist to the
limit of our ability, realizing of course the
circumstances that face us.
I look with regret upon the assumption by
the government of the right to engage in
private business, as provided for in this bill.
We are asked to place in the hands of a government-controlled corporation the sum of
$10 million-it is a progressive sum, as further money may be secured-with which the
people who manage the fund may buy and sell
goods in the open market. That seems to me
an extraordinary power to give to a government-controlled corporation, and it is all the
more extraordinary in that we are now asked
to make the corporation a permanent governmental establishment. I do not know a great
deal about the past operations of the corporation and I shall listen with a great deal of
interest to those who feel it their duty to
justify it to us when we meet in committee
this afternoon or tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: This afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not like this legislation. I anticipate that it will lead to difficulty in the future, and I wish that our government would cease this kind of thing.

THIRD READING

The Hon. The Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Now.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
I did not have an opportunity to speak when
this bill was before this house for second
reading, and before it is passed I should
like to make a few observations.
I feel that our foreign trade situation is
very serious, and that those upon whom this
bill confers certain powers must bear their
share of the responsibility for seeing that
anything that can be done to hold our international trade from falling apart will be
done. On a per capita basis, no country in
the world is as dependent on foreign trade as
is Canada. No empire in all history has been
as dependent on her internal and export
trade as the British Empire. I speak from

experience in this regard; for over a quarter
of a century I have been trading throughout
the Empire, and with more than fifty outside
nations. At the present time I do not like
the anti-trade signs that are appearing on
the horizon. They are very similar to those
which began to appear twenty years ago, and
which preceded the depression of the early
thirties.
Foreign trade is vital to this country, and
those who struggle to gather wealth from
land and sea should more often be consulted with regard to that trade. Vital
changes affecting our trade structure should
not be made suddenly by exchange theorists,
without reference to those who do the digging, for it is the real wealth that pays all
our bills, including taxes and the compensation of those who so often direct the course
of trade from this capital city.
I wish to trace briefly the history of foreign
trade. During the past century and up until
the First World War, England played the
role of international banker. The surplus she
accumulated
was loaned
abroad,
and
although many of the loans were repudiated,
this practice kept world trade moving and
in balance.
During World War I England's assets were
dissipated, and after the war she could not
resume her former position as banker to the
world. Her mantle fell on the United States,
which became the nation with the over-all
favourable trade balance. That country failed
to accept imports in full settlement for
exports, and became weary of making bad
loans abroad. England tried, unsuccessfully,
to get back on the gold standard with an
over-valued pound; nations raised tariffs and
established quotas to keep out imports; countries on the gold standard found it extremely
difficult to trade with soft-money countries;
international trade came practically to a
standstill, and we experienced the first worldwide depression. Fundamentally, little was
done to get the world out of the depression
until President Roosevelt came into power in
1933. The President changed the bookkeeping system of his country by lowering the
gold content of the American dollar. This
greatly helped to equalize currencies. Also
he placed the value of gold at $35 per ounce.
As a result, much new gold came on the
market, and international trade was revived.
The depression faded-and then came the
Second World War.
In raising the price of gold, the President
had done nothing unorthodox; in fact, he did
a bold and courageous act. Sir Robert Peel
did the same thing in England after the
Napoleonic Wars. Peel raised the price of
gold to correspond with economic conditions

SENATE
of his time, which is exactly what the late
President did.
By the end of World War I, more credit
paper and I.O.U.'s had been floated by the
nations than in the whole period from the
time of Adam up to 1914. Also, the price
level had risen very greatly, and if gold, as
a storage of value, was to have any relation
to currency and other promises to pay, then
it was very plain that the gold basis had to
be broadened.
With the Second World War, export trade
boomed, much of it paid for by foreign loans
and gifts that were made possible by the
taxation of our own people. That brings us
up to date, with foreign trade still moving
at a fairly high level, but with prospects far
from good.
At the moment our export trade is in a
very insecure position. In fact, all world
trade is unstable, due to the fact that it is
based to a large extent on the policy of a
single nation-a policy which may be altered
to suit internal conditions, with harmful
results to the other exporting nations, and
Canada in particular.
I think it is agreed that if a democratic
world such as ours is to survive and prosper,
we must have greater and freer trade among
the democratic nations. This fact was
recognized after the recent war when the
Bretton Woods agreements, which were supposed to stabilize world currencies, were
signed. Then the Geneva agreements were
signed, lowering tariffs among the United
Nations. With stable currencies and lower
tariffs, the democratic world was all set for
long-range prosperity. But nations which
export must also import. No machinery was
set up by the nations to clear export and
import balances, and it is impossible for all
nations to have export surpluses in any one
year. It is self-evident there must be a
clearing house of some kind.
The United States is acting in a very
restricted way as a clearing house at the
present time, and settlement is demanded in
American dollars. The United States is not
prepared to take imports to cover all her
exports; consequently she has a large net
export balance which other nations are unable
to pay in United States dollars. This is being
financed by giving goods away under the
Marshall plan to the various nations concerned, in lieu of imports. As Canada is
importing from the United States more than
she is exporting to her, a great deal of our
deficit in American dollars is being financed
by the United States, directly or indirectly,
through purchases under the Marshall plan.
Countries, like England, which are doing
business in sterling, realize that the Marshall
plan is not a definite policy, and must come

to an end. Therefore nations-principally
those of the sterling group-are doing everything possible to direct their foreign trade
into such channels that, when aid under the
Marshall plan ends, they will not be called
upon to settle uncontrollable balances in
dollars.
Now although the British representatives
at Bretton Woods and Geneva clearly intimated that British policy was that of multilateral trade, Britain, pleading expediency, is
not carrying out this policy but is making,
and has made, many bilateral trade agreements, most of these with socialist, communist, or dictator countries. Britain has
made private trade deals with Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Argentina, and
Russia; and most of the products supplied by
these countries could be provided by Canada.
Now, bilateral trading is right in line with
communist policy, for the communists do
not want any "truck or trade" with free
enterprise or individual initiative. The
question might well be asked, why does any
part of the British Empire or Commonwealth
of Nations, with practically all the resources
they need within the commonwealth, have to
get in line, at times, with a communistic
policy in world trade? Such a policy in the
end tends to ruin trade, depress standards of
living, and open a path for communist propaganda. Premier Stalin said to the former
Premier of Poland, "There is no middle
course: the countries of the world must be
capitalistic or communistic.' As he means
just what he says, it seems to me that democratic nations should follow democratic principles in world trade. This means multilateral
trading
among democratic nations,
at
least for the present, for no stable world
tracde can be established with communist
countries, their trade policies are based on
politics, not economics, and any agreement is
likely to be broken to further the communistic line. Witness the Russian agreement with England, which was supposed to
be an exchange of grain for machinery and
The Rusother manufactured products.
sians delivered the grain, but used the sterling in Australia to buy up, at high prices,
much of the wool which the Australians
were intending to sell to the United States to
strengthen their dollar reserves. Thus the
Russians were able to further dislocate trade
among the democracies. Canada at the present time has great difficulty in trading with
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India,
the British West Indies or practically any

can be carried on only under government
permit, so we are fast losing out in empire
countries. By their deals the British are
diverting to the sterling area a vast amount
of business formerly done with Canada. The

MARCH 25, 1949
reason for this is that we are tied up to the
dollar sign.
Trade throughout the Empire is steadily
falling apart, and if something constructive
is not done promptly to re-establish it on a
solid basis, this country will become more
and more dependent on the United States. The
British Empire should be the greatest trading
unit of the world, internally and externally,
for it has the potentials of world trade to a
greater extent than any other territorial unit.
What is needed is a system or scheme to
make international trade work on a multilateral basis, rather than a system of barter
such as the communists use.
The London Chamber of Commerce, which
represents one of the most important groups
of business and financial men in the world,
presented a scheme for multilateral operations to the International Payments Committee of the Federated Chamber of Commerce of the British Empire at their 15th
annual congress, held last fall at Johannesburg, South Africa. I have a full copy of the
report, which can be procured by any
honourable senator. It is too long to even
outline here, but some of the most outstanding businessmen of the Empire worked for
over a week upon the recommendations contained in the report, and put into their
efforts the full weight of their brains and
experience, so it is an extremely worthy and
constructive document. The plan which is
set forth to save Empire and world trade,
and to place international trade in a position
to grow and prosper, was not only endorsed
by the full Congress of the Federated Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, but each
nation of the commonwealth was asked to
study the plan carefully with a view to the
early adoption of the recommendations. The
scheme may not be 100 per cent perfect, but
it is by far the best I have been able to discover. If anyone in Canada has a better plan,
let him come forward with it, for we cannot
continue to just drift along. Constrggçive
action is needed and needed promptlyý. i
would like to quote two paragraphs from the
report:
At present, nations have no guarantee that a
willing seller to the world is necessarily a willing
buyer from it. So long as that is so, imports may
resuit in the buying nations finding themselves with
an unpayable debt, since the selling nation may
refuse to take payment in the only possible manner,
namely, in imports, whether directly or through a
third country. Nations which would very readily
exchange goods and services with other nations to
the advantage of both, if called upon to admit
indiscriminately the goods of ail nations, regardless
of whether they are or are not willing to buy in
return, would prefer to admit the goods of none. It
is this threat overhanging the nations which is
resulting, at present, in one market after another
being closed to all but the most vitally essential
imports.
The essential feature of this scheme is that nations
would recognize that exports could only be paid for

by imports: that it was their duty and obligation
to maintain their own external payments with the
world in balance. To give effect to this concept it
would be agreed amongst the nations that if they
did not clear their claims on other nations within a
period of years, e.g., seven years, that claim would
automatically lapse under a statute of limitations.

In other words, external trade would be
treated in the same way as internal trade.
It would be fully recognized-as it should be,
for it is only common sense-that all any
nation has to pay with is its production
and services, and the proposal is that any
nation with an adverse trade balance should
turn over a cheque or claim on its production and services in favour of the creditor
nations. These cheques or claims would be
placed in a pool or clearing house; the creditor
nation could sell or transfer such claims to
other nations, or exercise them itself; but if
it did not choose to do either, after seven
years the statute of limitations would come
into effect. This would relieve debtor nations
from the necessity of continually seeking
foreign currency-a commodity they do not
produce and over which they have no direct
control-to pay their adverse balance.
The Empire Congress, as it is usually called,
which met in South Africa, was composed
solely of practical business men and industrialists, worthy to rank among the best
brains of the Empire. Their hearts are in
the work of promoting prosperity in our
commonwealth trade, so surely their recommendations are worthy of our most careful
consideration. I fear that if we continue
to look to outside agencies such as the World
International Fund, instead of doing something realistic for ourselves within the framework of Empire organizations, commonwealth
trade will continue to disintegrate, world
trade will follow suit, and the economic
repercussions on a nation so dependent on
foreign trade as ourselves will be of the most
serious kind. So, in passing this bill for
another two years we must realize that it
does not lessen our responsibility for seeing
to it that everything possible is done to save
the great trade relations we have so laboriously built up over the years with the
Empire and world at large.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

The Senate met at 8 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the business of the Senate is proceeded with may I explain what I propose
asking the house to do this evening? In a
few minutes His Honour the Speaker will
announce that a message has been received
from the other place with Bill 122, an Act
to amend the Agricultural Products Act. It is
desirable that this bill, together with the
Mail Contracts Supplementary Payments Bill,
be disposed of by Wednesday night. I am
going to request that the house proceed with
the second reading of the Agricultural Products Bill now, but there is no particular
reason why it should be disposed of tonight.
If any honourable senator wishes to speak on
it tomorrow, it could quite well go over till
then, for even if it were given second reading
this evening it would not be convenient to
have a committee meeting tomorrow morning,
inasmuch as the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and the deputy leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) will both be
busily engaged with heavy sittings of the
Divorce Committee at that time.
After I have explained the Agricultural
Products Bill, we shall proceed with other
items as they appear on the order paper.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 126, an Act to amend the
Agricultural Products Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move the second reading of this bill now.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Has the bill been
distributed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. It is on the file.
Honourable senators, the bill before us
proposes to continue in force the Agricultural
Products Act for a further period of one
year. During the war, contracts for the
supply of agricultural products to foreign

countries were made under oraers in council.
The effect of those orders in council was
incorporated in statutory form under the
Agricultural Products Act.
The Act deals with all agricultural products
other than wheat. It gives the Minister of
Agriculture, subject to approval by the Governor in Council, power to make contracts
with governments of other countries or
agencies thereof. He may make contracts in
two ways: one, by selling or exporting agricultural products; two, by negotiating on
behalf of any country the purchase of or
contracts for agricultural products in this
country. These are the same powers that he
had during the war.
There are three boards for the carrying out
of these contracts.
1. The Meat Board, which at the present
time administers our bacon contract with
Great Britain.
2. The Dairy Products Board, which carries
out our cheese contracts.
3. The Special Products Board, which
executes our egg contracts.
It is apparent that these boards still have
an important function to perform, and that
their services may be required for some time.
The contracts for cheese, bacon and eggs have
been continued into the year 1949-50.
Also, under the Agricultural Products Act,
the Minister has the power to make new contracts.
The passage of this bill would
continue that power for one year. The government is not contemplating contracts in new
fields, except possibly with regard to fruit.
It is, however, constantly discussing the continuation of and the possibility of increasing
the present flow of supplies. At the present
time negotiations are going on with respect
to cheese, and it seems possible that some
new contracts will be made. This house is
well aware, however, of our present difficulties in dealing with Great Britain. The
ability to make new contracts guarantees
that our government will be able to co-operate
fully in any discussion.
I am not sufficiently conversant with the
details of the various contracts for the supplying of cheese, bacon and eggs to give a full
explanation. It seems to me that information
could best be obtained in committee, where
the minister concerned and other officials of
the department would be available.
I point out that the powers given to the
government by this legislation do not interfere or compete with those of private traders.
It is impossible to sell the products mentioned
here to the people of Great Britain, except
through their government, and that in turn
requires that the contracts be with the
Canadian government. Great Britain's posi-

MARCH 28. 1949

tion is such that she feels that there must be
only one agency on either side. This raises
the question whether this method is the most
practical one for dealing with the problem.
For the moment, at least, I believe it is. The
details of the contracts for the supply of these
products have been worked out over several
years in co-operation with the British government. It is for this house to say whether
it is desirable to continue the present practice
for another year. It can at least be said that
up to the moment it has proved to be efficient.
This bill, as honourable senators will
observe, deals with a relatively limited range
of agricultural products and I do not know
whether my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has given any indication of whether,
if circumstances permit, there will be a
broadening of the present scope. It seems to
me that one of the most interesting problems
for our attention in the future arises in the
application of the principle which is involved
in this measure. Within the next day or two
we shall be discussing the details of the North
Atlantic Pact, in which is included an agreement for economic co-operation between a
group of countries whose systems vary
widely. Most of the European countries
which adhere to the pact are pursuing their
economic objectives by methods substantially
different from those in operation on this side
of the Atlantic. In more or less degree they
have centralized their external purchasing to
the extent of controlling a very large amount
of their bulk buying if not to the complete
elimination of private and individual trading.
Whether or not some alternative method
eventually will be evolved by them, I do not
know.
Under some circumstances, of course, a
different system of external trading could
be arranged. I have in mind the case of the
lumber industry in the East, with which the
honourable senator from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchil) is better acquainted than
I am. In the Maritime Provinces a number
of small lunber producers, acting through
the Maritime Lumber Bureau, and, I believe,
without government aid, have organized on
behalf of the industry what is in effect a
system of bulk selling to the bulk buyer. For
the time being this arrangement seems to be
working reasonably well. Whether it will
be equally effective under more stringent
economic conditions, when competition has
become more keen, and one buyer on behalf
of the United Kingdom may negotiate with
various individual buyers and try thereby to
reduce prices, I am not so sure. But leaving
aside this problem of individual versus collective trading-the latter of which is an outgrowth of methods adopted during the war,
and seems less formidable than it was--the

fundamental principle that will concern us
in the years that lie ahead, will be the need
of economic co-operation for self -preservation
and defence, and the harmonizing of conflicting economic systems among nations
which in other respects have so much in.
common.
As far as the details involved in this bill
are concerned, I believe honourable senators
will agree that they can best be considered
in committee. The bill need not be passed
this evening; it can be taken up here again
tomorrow afternoon, and when the Senate
rises the bill can be dealt with in committee.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I am not prepared to complete my remarks
this evening, but I wish to state at once that,
on many grounds, I object to the continuation of this legislation for another year. I
hope that certain persons, particularly the
editorial staff of the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix,
will not misunderstand me. I speak for
myself, as I believe it is my duty to do, and
not for any political party. I am not a party
hack, and I do not speak in that capacity at
all. I am a farmer representative speaking
for the farmers of Canada, particularly those
of Saskatchewan. I disagree entirely with
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) when he ties in this legislation
with the North Atlantic Pact. That is ridiculous. The excuse advanced for the continuation
of the Agricultural Products Act, which gives
the Minister of Agriculture power to deal
with almost anything he wishes, is that
Britain can then buy from a government
agency in this country. I doubt if it is the
intention of even the present Canadian
government to aid the socialist government
of Britain in the experiments that it is
carrying on at the present time. One of my
main objections to this bill is that the Minister of Agriculture is using it to interfere
with agricultural prices in Canada. The
statement was made that the object of this
legislation was to secure meat for Britain,
and that this was the reason for the refusal
to remove the embargo on cattle to the
United States. What quantity of beef did
Canada ship to Britain? That country was
getting its beef from the Argentine. The statement was also made-in the press, by members of the government, and by the Minister
of Agriculture-that the purpose of this legislation was to lower the price of beef in
Eastern Canada and keep down the cost of
living in our own country. For at least six
or eight months the farmers of Western
Canada were prevented from securing the
American market and American dollars.
What the bill really means is that one man,
the Minister of Agriculture, will have complete control over Canadian farm products.

SENATE
Although I do not know what bearing it
had, the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) in his speech
the other day brought up the question of
oleomargarine. He stated that it was mostly
milk that went into its manufacture. This
is a very strange thing. The packing companies, without anyone knowing it, must have
bought large quantities of milk, because they
were able to produce oleomargarine almost
as soon as the ban on that product was lifted.
Miracles have been happening! The blood
from the animals has been turned into milk,
and all the fat from the animals killed has
been used in the manufacture of oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Al the fats cannot be
used in the manufacture of oleomargarine.
Only fats with certain melting temperatures
can be utilized.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Does my honourable
friend think so?
Hon. Mr. Howden: I know.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Did the honourable senator know of any particular company buying
milk for the manufacture of oleomargarine?
Hon. Mr. Howden: Milk is not needed for
the manufacture of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Then my honourable
friend and the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) do not
agree. The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity gave this house quite a lecture on
how to raise a family. He said something
to the effect that children should not be
taught to work. I am the very proud father
of nine children. I received a letter recently
from one that, when he was a little beggar,
I worked during every holiday he had. He
said that he would always be grateful to me
for having taught him how to work. He has
his own child now and wants to bring him
up the same way. I understand that my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
raised one child. He reminds me of a hen
that goes off by herself and hatches one
chick. A hen that has hatched fifteen chicks
walks boldly around the farmyard, quite
unconcerned and with plenty of time to rest.
She lets her fifteen chicks take care of themselves. But the hen that bas hatched one
chick is always fussing around, and is continually fighting with the dog and the cat
and everything else around the farm. I
think the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity is the last person who should attempt
to give anyone a lecture on the raising of a
family.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators,
although I should perhaps not be concerned,

I did feel badly about the attack my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity made on
the honourable senator from Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Davies), whose ideas on the matter of
family allowances coincided with mine. However, as my honourable friend frorn Kingston expressed his thoughts much more
eloquently than I did, my honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity ignored me entirely in
his attack.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, the
butter manufacturing industry is one of the
home industries of Canada, and it teaches the
farm children how to work. No one should
take that industry away from the farmers.
The man who produces butter today is working for lower wages than any other person in
this country. Eventually people will find that
they will not even have enough milk to
drink. Such a situation is encouraged by
contracts which take away our milk and
cheese.
Honourable senators, there is another point
I would like to mention. Can anyone tell me
that any country in the world has a system
of hog grading similar to ours? When this
system was first instituted some twelve years
ago, it was thought that it would last for only
a couple of years, and that it would help to
improve the grade of our hogs. In committee
a number of years ago I asked Dr. Barton,
the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, if this
system of grading hogs was designed to aid
the packing companies. He said that it was
supposed to assist the producers. I replied,
"It is possibly so, but it has certainly helped
the packers." The late Senator Burns disagreed with me, and I said to him, "I expected
you would disagree, but I still think the same
thing." Honourable senators, our system of
grading hogs has definitely worked to the
advantage of the packers and nobody else.
As honourable senators know, our government now has a bacon contract with England,
but we will not come anywhere near to filling
it. If the shaving machines which deprive
our men of a decent order for their bacon
were done away with, it would be different.
We do not produce enough bacon to supply
our own people, let alone the people of
England. This results from our system of hog
grading. For instance, if a hog weighs a
pound too much, the farmer is docked $5.
Even today I know of many men in Western
Canada who have raised hogs as grade A and
selects. After taking one or two of them to
the market they have said, "We will not raise
any more hogs." This situation has been
brought about largely by reason of the system
of grading hogs. It bas been to the disadvantage of the farmer and to the benefit of
the packing companies.

MARCH 28, 1949
Honourable senators, there is still another
point in connection with this subject. The
packing companies have had a floor price, but
the farmers have not. Those who have a
knowledge of hog raising know that there are
certain days and seasons of the year when
thousands of hogs go on the market, and that
there are other times when f ew hogs are
available.

It is the packing companies that

fix the price, and they say, "This is the average price." But they do not give the average
price for the over-all quantity purchased. The
farmer often loses his entire profit in raising
hogs, and the same is true of his sheep and
cattle.
As I have said, I wish to adjourn the
debate and continue my remarks tomorrow.
The sum and substance of my point is this: if
we are going to go entirely socialist, and
if we believe in that kind of government, let
us come out frankly and say so, and let us
proclaim that every farmer will be bound
to sell to the government agency because
we are supporting a socialist government in
England which, as the leader of the government says, likes to purchase through such an
agency. But do not let us use that system to
take the cattle or hogs from one part of the
country in order to keep down living costs in
another part. Let us try out the system that
we talk about and say we are in favour of,
the free enterprise system, and let us quit
this other thing. As a f armer I would not be
afraid of free enterprise at all, and I do not
think that the people I represent are afraid
of it. But we certainly object to the continuation of absolute control in the hands of a
minister who made the statement in Western
Canada, as reported in the press, that all you
needed to do for people was give them something they wanted a couple of weeks before
an election.
Now, honourable senators, I would like the
privilege of adjourning the debate and continuing my remarks on another occasion.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, am I out of order in asking the
honourable senator a question about a remark
that he made in the last half minute of his
speech?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would be very pleased
to answer.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I may have
misunderstood my honourable friend, but
I rather thought he said the Minister of
Agriculture had stated that the only thing
that mattered was to promise the people
something two months before an election.

Hon. Mr. Horner: It was reported in the
press of Alberta when he was out there.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: In which paper?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I just forget. I believe
it was the Calgary Herald.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I ask the
honourable senator for the date of the alleged
remarks and the publication in which they
appeared? I know the Minister of Agriculture, and the farmers of Canada have not a
better friend in the world than he.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is a matter of
opinion. I move the adjournment of the
debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
DIVORCE PETITIONS
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I beg to present eight petitions for divorce.
The time for receiving divorce petitions
expired last Friday and these were received
just within the time limit. We hope there
will not be any more.

PIPE LINES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Roberison moved the
second reading of Bill Z-3, an Act respecting
oil or gas pipe lines.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the Honourable the Minister of Transport to
explain this bill.
Hon. Lionel Chevrier (Minister of Transport): Honourable senators, the purpose of
this bill is to provide for the control of interprovincial and international oil and gas pipe
lines. There is, I believe, no doubt that parliament has jurisdiction over interprovincial
and international pipe lines. As a matter of
fact, in order that there could be no doubt
about the point, the bill that I have the
honour and privilege of explaining here this
evening has been submitted to the Department of Justice, which has concurred in it.
At the last session of parliament a bill was
introduced in this chamber to incorporate
Western Pipe Lines. The purpose of that
bill was to incorporate a company with
power to construct and operate a pipe line for
the transmission of natural gas from a point
near Calgary to a point near Winnipeg, and
also certain other branch lines. After considerable discussion, the bill was withdrawn
by its promoters. My officers held the view
that to give private companies powers over
oil and gas pipe lines crossing from one province into another, where no regulatory body
existed to supervise the operations of such
companies, would create chaos and disorder
in this new and growing field. Hence, the
decision to enact enabling legislation. The
government has decided to recommend to
parliament the enactment of a public statute
of general application, regulating the transportation of natural gas and oil by means of
pipe lines connecting two or more provinces,
or extending beyond the limits of a province.
The importance of the oil and natural gas
industries to the economie welfare of Canada
cannot be over-emphasized. Light, heat and
power are essential to our needs, and pipe
lines are built to serve industry and the
public by affording the cheapest and most
convenient form of transportation of oil and
natural gas.
The petroleum industry with its diversified
products is a complicated business.
The
function of the pipe line in the organization
of the oil industry is chiefly to serve large
oil companies as an important part of their
operation in the transformation of crude oil
into finished products ready for the market.
Transportation by pipe line of crude oil to
the refineries, and of refined oil products
from the refineries to the market, is the most

MARCH 28, 1949
economic method of transportation yet
devised. The large refineries and the pipe
lines are integrated, as the pipe lines afford
cheap transportation from the oil fields to
the refineries, and the refineries are necessary to the economic life of the pipe lines.
The pipe lines are essentially one-way carriers and require a large capital investment,
which in turn needs a large and steady volume
of business in order to pay fixed charges,
maintenance and operating costs. The risk
of shifting sources of supply and markets
makes the corporate enterprises engaged in
the oil refining business especially suited to
the undertaking of building and operating
pipe lines.
There are four major oil companies in
Canada-British American, Imperial, McCollFrontenac and Shell. I anticipate that the
construction of pipe lines will be undertaken
by subsidiaries of these companies in the
near future. As the industry is competitive, I
hope that other oil companies also will enter
the field. There are now very few pipe lines
in Canada extending beyond the limits of a
province. There is the Montreal-Portland
pipe line, which was built during the war,
as a war measure. There is also a pipe line
entering Canada at Sarnia, and I understand
that there is a pipe line crossing the international border between Alberta and Montana.
The attention of all Canada is now focused
on the oil discoveries in Alberta, which we
hope will exceed our most optimistic expectations. The industry is spending a lot of
money and effort to find the petroleum supplies of the future. These efforts are getting
results which are most gratifying, and are a
great tribute to the enterprise shown by the
oil industry. The oil companies which are
interested in the Alberta fields are to be
congratulated on the effort, skill and enterprise shown in discovering this new source
of supply. This country is fortunate in having people who are bold enough to risk their
capital in an endeavour to open up these new
sources of weatlh. The potentialities of the
oil industry in Canada are immense.
The new oil fields discovered in Alberta
will require the construction of trunk pipe
lines to carry the crude oil to the refineries
and the finished products from the refineries
to the markets. Nature has also blessed the
province of Alberta with abundant sources
of natural gas that can be readily transmitted
by pipe line to the great benefit of many communities using or desirous of using gas for
light, heat and industrial purposes. I expect
that these projected pipe lines will cross both
provincial and international boundaries. The
regulation of such pipe lines is undoubtedly
within the jurisdiction of parliament, and the

time is opportune for the enactment of a
general Act to regulate interprovincial and
international oil and gas pipe lines.
I am informed that some five companies
have already applied to parliament for private
acts of incorporation. With your permission,
honourable senators, I should like to say
something about these private applications.
The first company is Interprovincial Pipe
This company is sponsored by
Lines.
Imperial Oil Limited and seeks authority to
build pipe lines within or outside of Canada.
The company proposes to build a pipe line
from Edmonton to Regina, as the first stage
of its construction. During 1949, if the anticipated legislation is passed, the Imperial Oil
Company expects to spend between $9 million
and $10 million on the line between Edmonton
and Regina, which will run to a total cost
estimated at from $35 million to $40 million.
As the company's plans develop, other lines
will be built, including a line to a point on
the international boundary for the purpose of
exporting oil to the United States. It is of
public interest to know that the proposed
capitalization of this company is $200 million.
The second is the Queont Pipe Line Company. Three of the larger Canadian oil
companies are contemplating the possibility
of building an interprovincial trunk pipe
line, and have filed a petition to present a
private bill to cover their plans. It is understood that preliminary studies indicate that
the cost of this line might be from $15 million
to $20 million. It is further understood that
the financing of this project would be largely,
if not entirely, done in Canada.
The third company. is Western Pipe Lines.
As I said before, a bill to incorporate Western
Pipe Lines was introduced in this chamber
last year. I am informed that the bill will
be introduced again at this session with some
minor changes. According to the information given by the promoters of this bill at the
last session, it is proposed to build a pipe line
for the transmission of natural gas from a
point in the vicinity of Calgary to the cities
of Winnipeg and St. Boniface. The cost of
the project was estimated last year at approximately $48 million.
The fourth is the Alberta Natural Gas Company. This company proposes to build a gas
pipe line from the Province of Alberta across
the mountains to Seattle, in the State of
Washington, and to Vancouver, B.C. The cost
of building the line is estimated at approximately $100 million, and about one-half of
this amount will be spent in Canada. The
capital required for this project will be in the
main raised in the United States, and I understand that funds are assured. The principals
who are backing this venture are geologists

SENATE
and engineers of long experience with undertakings of this kind, and are well financed.
Fifth, is the West Coast Transmission
Company.
This company also proposes to
build a pipe line for the transmission of
natural gas from Alberta to British Columbia
and the State of Washington. I am advised
that the West Coast Transmission Company
Limited proposes to spend between $50 million and $100 million on the construction of
a gas pipe line from the Alberta gas fields to
Vancouver and Seattle. This money will be
spent mostly in Canada, and will be largely
United States capital.
It follows from what I have said, that if
these bills are approved by parliament it will
mean an expenditure in our country of
between $200 million and $250 million. I am
informed that these subsidiary companies are
ready to proceed with construction immediately.
These five applications for private bills are
dependent upon the passage of the government bill, and it is of the utmost importance
to expedite the passage of this bill so that
these companies may be able to proceed with
their private bills.
Provision is made in the bill now before
honourable senators, for declaring a company
operating an oul pipe line to be a common carrier. In the United States, where they have
had more experience with pipe lines than we
in Canada have had, interstate oul pipe lines
are regarded as public transportation agencies,
and were placed in the category of common
carriers by the Hepburn amendment to the
Interstate Commerce Act for the purpose of
regulating rates and services. This was done
to promote competition in the oul industry by
requiring the major oul companies to permit
other shippers the use of their lines. The
economic superiority of the pipe line as a
means of transporting oul over long distances
by land routes affords great competitive
advantages to an oul company owning a pipe
line, but if independent oul companies can
use the pipe line as a common carrier this
advantage is much lessened. It appears, however, that the regulation in the United States
of oul pipe lines as common carriers has not
been extensive, which may be explained
largely by the fact that the users of pipe lines
are in most cases the owners. The powers of
the Interstate Commerce Commission over
pipe lines under the Hepburn Act have been
exercised less than its powers over any other
type of carrier subject to its jurisdiction.
Natural gas pipe lines do not, by the nature
of the commodity carried and the difficulty
of storing it, lend themselves to the business
of common carriers, and the bill does not provide for declaring companies operating gas
pipe lines to be common carriers. The gas

industry is regarded as being more in the
nature of a public utility than the oil industry, and more subject to price regulation;
but, because of jurisdictional difficulties, the
bill does not impose any control over the price
of gas purchased or sold. The bill gives the
board power to order a company operating a
gas pipe line to extend or improve its transportation facilities and to sell gas to any person or municipality engaged in the local
distribution of gas to the public, and for such
purposes to construct branch lines to communities immediately adjacent to its pipe
lines, if the board finds that no undue burden
will be placed upon the company thereby.
The bill applies to companies having
authority under a special act to construct or
operate a pipe line. The government considers that if a company is to have the benefits
of the Act, including wide powers of expropriation, it should be incorporated by a
special act of parliament or, if already incorporated, that it should obtain from parliament, by special act, authority to construct
or operate a pipe line.
The administration of the Act is given to
the Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada, which now exercises jurisdiction in
respect of Dominion railways, telephones,
telegraph and express companies, international bridges and tunnels, and certain
classes of ships, as well as other miscellaneous
matters. The provisions of the Railway Act
relating to procedure are made applicable to
proceedings under the Pipe Lines Act, and
generally the provisions of the bill bear close
similarity to corresponding provisions of the
Railway Act.
Under the bill a gas or oil pipe line company is given general powers including power
to take and hold land; to construct a pipe
line with all necessary buildings and structures; to construct branch pipe lines; to transport oil or gas by pipe line and regulate the
tolls to be charged therefor; and to do all
acts necessary for the construction, maintenance and operation of the pipe line. These
general powers would supplement the special
powers given to the company by the special
Act. The company shall not, however, without leave of the Board: (a) sell, convey or
lease the pipe line in whole or in part to any
person; (b) purchase or lease any pipe line;
(c) enter into any agreement or amalgamation; or (d) abandon the operation of a pipe
line.
There are four parts to the bill. Part I,
deals with oil and gas lines, and has to do
with their location, construction and operation; Part II, deals with oil pipe line law, in
wx
hich companies may be declared to be
common carriers; Part III, deals exclusively

MARCH 28, 1949
with gas pipe line companies; and Part IV,
deals with accounting.
Referring briefiy to Part I, having to do
with location, construction and operation of
oil and gas pipe lines: the bill stipulates that
both oil and gas pipe lines must proceed in
accordance with a number of sections, beginning with section 7 of the bill, having to do
with the expropriation of Crown and private
lands. It contains provisions relating to the
location of the pipe line, the approval by the
board of the plan, profile and book of reference, land registration procedure, deviations,
branch lines, the taking and using of lands,
crossings, mines and minerals, diversions,
and the operation of the pipe line including
safety provisions. This part gives the company power to appropriate Crown lands and
expropriate private lands. The sections of
the Railway Act respecting expropriation
proceedings and payment of compensation
for lands taken are incorporated by reference
in the bill.
Part II of the bill applies only to oil pipe
lines companies. The board may by order
declare a company to be a common carrier,
and if so declared the company is bound
to carry according to its powers, all oil
offered for transportation. The carrier shall
file a tariff of tolls with the board. All tolls
charged shall be just and reasonable, and
under substantially similar circumstances
charged equally to all persons at the same
rate. The board may disallow or suspend
any tariff that it considers to be contrary to
any of the provisions of the Act and may fix
just and reasonable rates. There is an absolute prohibition against unjust discrimination
in rates, service or facilities against any
person or locality.
Part III of the bill applies only to companies
operating pipe lines for the transportation of
gas. This part empowers the board, whenever it finds such action necessary or desirable in the public interest, to direct the
company to extend or improve its transportation facilities, to provide facilities for
the junction of its pipe line with a pipe line
of any person or municipality engaged in
the local distribution of gas, to sell gas to
such person or municipality, and for such
purposes to construct branch lines to communities immediately adjacent to its pipe line,
if no undue burden is placed on the company.
The board is not empowered to compel the
company to sell gas to additional customers
if to do so would impair its ability to render
adequate service to its existing customers.
Part IV of the bill deals with methods of
accounting, depreciation procedures and
uniformity of accounting systems. All gas
and oil pipe line companies are required to
make returns to the board of their capital,

traffic, revenues, expenses, and all other
information required by the board.
In recommending this bill for your consideration, I trust that members of this house
will bear in mind that at least five pipe line
projects are awaiting the passage of this
measure, and that there is some urgency to
have it passed in order that these projects,
which mean a great deal to the development
of Canada, may proceed. At the same time,
parliament is breaking new ground in the
matter of general pipe line legislation, and
you have before you what is considered by
the government a most important bill having
to do with general pipe line legislation. I am
sure that honourable senators will give this
bill the careful consideration it deserves.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Honourable
senators, is it permissible to ask one question
of the Honourable Minister? As one who
comes from the far West, I am wondering
if he would be good enough to inform the
house as to what has happened to the pipe
line constructed during the war years, from
Fort Norman to the Pacific Ocean. I understand that it was built through the co-operation of Canada and the United States, and
was to serve mainly for defence purposes.
Has that line been abandoned, or is it still in
operation?
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: Honourable senators, I
believe the line to which the honourable
senator from. Vancouver Centre (Right Hon.
Mr. Mackenzie) has referred, is the Canol
project, which extended from Fort Norman
to Whitehorse. That project would not come
under the purview of this bill, because it
comes within the jurisdiction of the North
West Territories and was purchased along
with other assets frorn the United States. I
am informed that this line has been torn up.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I wonder if this legislation has been submitted to the various provinces for their
consideration? I understand that it is proposed to build a pipe line frorn Montreal to
Toronto, and so on; but I know that in the
West the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia are
vitally interested in this whole matter.
Alberta, being the chief prospective supplier
of a great deal of the oil to be produced in
Canada, is particularly interested. Manitoba
also is concerned, because it is anticipated
that gas will be piped from Alberta to Winnipeg and St. Boniface. This will result in
these two centres having a much cheaper
fuel supply than they now enjoy. Oil is
important for the running of tractors, motor
cars and other machinery, but in our part
of the country fuel is just as important.

SENATE

Last year, when the Western Pipe Lines
Bill was before this house, there was a lively
discussion in committee as to whether the
bill fully protected the rights of Alberta and
Saskatchewan. I understand that this proposed legislation is presumed to protect the
public of Canada, assuming, as the minister
does, that the jurisdiction rests with the
Dominion. Since hearing him speak tonight,
however, I have been wondering if the four
western provinces have been consulted. I
admit the urgency of this legislation, but at
the same time I do not think it is quite as
urgent as the minister suggests. I think the
oil companies would proceed with their pipe
line projects whether or not we passed this
legislation tonight, tomorrow, or a week from
tomorrow. Honourable senators, I want to
see the rights of Alberta fully protected.
Great progress in oil development is being
made in that province, and its people deserve
much credit for the way they have handled
the oil situation.
May I digress for a moment or two? When
introducing an Alberta curling team at a
meeting in Hamilton recently, I mentioned
that a few days beforehand the Alberta government had sold the oil rights in two sections
of land for $5 million, subject to a 12' per
cent tax on the production. When I finished
speaking, a gentleman from Alberta said, "I
think the man who has just spoken has made
a slight error." Everybody thought I had
exaggerated. They probably thought that my
figure was ten times too great, but the
Albertan said, "We did not sell the land for
$5 million; we sold for $7- million." This will
serve to illustrate the tremendous value of
the oil industry. I am doubtful if pipe lines
can be built to carry oil much farther east
than Winnipeg, but I should think the Alberta
oil fields could make great use of pipe lines
to the United States. By selling oil to that
country Canada would receive much of the
American currency it so urgently needs.
Honourable senators, I do not want to see
this legislation rushed through parliament
without consultation with the four western
provinces. I do not know whether the Minister of Transport has had any representations
from those provinces or not, but I do know
that the West is tremendously interested in
its oil and gas development.
I suggest to the honourable leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that when
this bill goes to committee we ask the four
western provinces if they want to be heard.
If so, I think we should hear them. With all
due respect to the Minister of Transport (Hon.
Mr. Chevrier), if these provinces wish to send
representatives to parliament by next Monday
or Tuesday, I for one would be prepared to
hold up this legislation. I feel that the Senate
can perform a service in this matter. I am

sure the government does not want to do in
haste anything that it will regret at leisure,
and while I personally am in favour of the
bill-I think it means much to my city of
Winnipeg-at the same time I want to be sure
that the provinces are fully consulted and
that the bill protects all their rights.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: Honourable senators,
perhaps I may be allowed to answer one or
two of the observations made by the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. ivir. Haig).
With reference to jurisdiction, of course, I
am proceeding on the assumption that we
have it. I do not think there is any doubt
about it.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Nor do I.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: I think it is clearly
covered by both section 91 and section 92 of
the British North America Act. I take it that

the position of a pipe line is pretty much the
same as that of a railway operating from one
province into another, and that therefore
parliament would have jurisdiction.
With reference to the provinces, if the
position is as I have indicated-that is, that
we have jurisdiction-there would, strictly
and legally speaking, be no necessity for consulting the provinces. By that I do not mean
that we should not attempt to find out what
their wishes or their views are. There have
been informal talks, I am told, but no formal
representations,

except perhaps one.

I had

a visit from one provincial representative,
and he was concerned chiefly with the form
of the special Act. He made certain representations to me as to the manner in which
the special Act should be framed, and also
as to the reference in this bill to incorporation by special Act. Those representations
were carefully weighed, but it was found
impossible to accede to them.
With reference to the statement that I
made about haste, I hope the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) did
not take it to mean that there should be
haste without invitation to the provinces, if
this chamber felt that an invitation was
necessary. I do not think that there could be
any objection to an invitation, because it is
a fact that Alberta and the other western
provinces are vitally interested in this bill.
But from the informal representations that
have been made I am led to believe that this
bill meets the position pretty well. A committee of officers of the Department of Transport in conjunction with officers of the Board
of Transport Commissioners worked out the
bill after many talks, and I think they invited
representations from outside. Whether they
went so far as to invite representations from
the provinces, I am unable to say; but I do
know that one or two members of this com-

MARCH 28, 1949
mittee went to Washington and consulted
some members of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which has had a great deal of
experience in connection with similar legislation. The committee was guided, not exclusively or entirely, but to some extent, by the
information obtained there. I hope that anything I have said will not convey the impression that there should be undue haste. On the
contrary, I think this bill is of such importance that the Senate should take all the time
that honourable members feel is requisite
for the proper consideration thereof.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Honourable senators, I
understood the minister to say that oil companies operating under this bill could be
obliged to act as common carriers, but that
gas companies could not be obliged so to act.
I cannot just see the reason why gas companies should not be obliged to operate as
common carriers, and perhaps the minister
would explain this.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: The distinction between
the two is that a gas company, by the nature
of its undertaking, does not lend itself to
being a common carrier, whereas an oil company does. That is the main reason I gave
in outlining the bill to the house. The gas
industry is regarded as being more in the
nature of a public utility than is the oil
industry, and more subject to price regulation. And that of course raised another point
of a jurisdictional nature. The question of
price fixing and price regulation is one of
provincial jurisdiction, and therefore it was
impossible to include anything with regard
to the regulation of prices in that part of the
bill dealing with gas companies.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
as this is a control bill, may I ask the
minister if investigations have been made as
to the quantity of surplus gas available for
export? Industries have grown up using gas,
and we know that the quantity of gas in
wells sometimes diminishes. Can the minister say if investigations have been made?
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: Honourable senators,
I arn not aware of any investigation having
been made; and as I understand this bill it
does not provide for specific investigation,
although the board has very wide powers.
The board's powers of regulation and control
over the pipe lines are very much the same
as those which it has over the railways.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I may say, honourable
senators, that the question of the quantity
of gas available for export, and that kind of
thing, are being investigated by a commission appointed by the Province of Alberta,
but I do not think any report has yet been
made. The chairman of the commission is

Mr. Dinning, President of Burns and Company Limited.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If honourable members
will pardon me for speaking a second time,
I would point out that this bill, as I understand it, does not say whether gas can be
exported or not. That would depend on the
private bills, and protection could be provided for in them.
The Government
of Alberta represented to us last year that it
wanted to be authorized by the private bills
to control the amount of gas that could be
sent out.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: There is a section
dealing with that very point, and it provides
for the construction of a gas or oil Une or
branch line to the international boundary.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
leader whether that committee will be sitting
tomorrow after the house rises or on a later
date?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is some urgency
about the two other bills, and if they go to
committee tomorrow, as I hope they will, we
could probably arrange to have a meeting
of the Transport and Communications Committee on Wednesday morning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is all right.
The motion was agreed to.
MAIL CONTRACTS SUPPLEMENTAL
PAYMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 123, an Act to amend
the Mail Contracts Supplemental Payments
Act.
He said: In 1947 the Post Office Department
realized that owing to rising costs the compensation under a large number of rural mail
contracts then in force was inadequate. The
Mail Contracts Supplemental Payments Act,
1947, gave the Postmaster General power to
pay bonuses to rural mail contractors if he
believed the compensation was inadequate by
reason of changed conditions since the contracts were taken out. These supplemental
payments applied only to contracts which had
been in force for one year. The Act was
limited as to time, and expired in 1948. It
was renewed in that year, and now will
expire on March 31 of this year.

SENATE

Rural mail contracts are made for a fouryear period, after which they may be renewed,
or new tenders may be asked for. The
bonuses that were paid applied only to the
unexpired periods of the contracts. If a contract was renewed, or a new tender was
accepted, the bonus lapsed and a new application had to be made for it. Supplemental
payments were made in respect of 6,485 contracts, or 54 per cent of the number in force.
The total increase in the cost of these contracts was $1,537,108 per annum, or 30.78
per cent. In the same period, the department
made 1,143 new contracts. The amount paid
on the new contracts was $287,254 per annum
more than was paid on the old contracts. This
was an increase of 37-5 per cent as compared with an increase of 30-78 per cent on
the contracts on which bonuses were paid.
Honourable senators will appreciate my
point: that in the case of contracts which had
not expired the department, under this Act,
paid a bonus to bring them up to what was
regarded as a reasonable figure. In those
contracts which expired new tenders were
asked for, presumably on a competitive basis,
and the resulting figures refiected a little
higher percentage than had been allowed
under the bonus contracts.
This Act affects only one type of contract.
In many cases mail carriers have given such
faithful service that the department wishes to
renew their contracts without calling for
tenders. At the present time this is done in
a great many cases. A contract is renewed
on the same terms as those on which it was
originally made. If, in such a case, a bonus
has been paid under the original contract, it
lapses as soon as the contract is renewed,
and then the mail carrier could get his bonus
continued only upon the making of a new
application to the department. However,
after March 31 of this year, such applications
will not be considered. This will mean that
the only way the mail carrier can get the
bonus on his renewed contract will be to
refuse the offer to renew the contract and
to have it put up for tender, when he can
include the increase in his bid. But this situation is exactly what the department wishes to
avoid, because it removes much of the
incentive for good service on the part of those
carriers whose contracts have been renewed
from year to year. The department believes
that certain contracts should still be renewed
without penalty to the mail carrier for such
renewal. That is the sole purpose of this Act.
The department feels that the bonus should
not be continued on contracts for which tenders are called. In these cases the persons
submitting bids have an opportunity to
include increased costs in their bids.
This bill does not extend the operation of
the Mail Carriers Supplemental Payments

Act to any new contracts. After March 31
of this year bonuses will continue to be paid
for the life of the contracts in respect of
which they were granted, but no new applications for bonuses will be considered.
Honourable senators, I do not think that
I can add further to my explanation of this
bill. If this house sees fit to give the bill a
second reading, it is my intention to move
that it be referred to committee. What I said
concerning the Agricultural Products Bill
applies also to this one, namely that there is
no immediate urgency for its passing.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I ask my
honourable leader a question which he does
not need to answer directly if he does not
choose to? Does this measure apply in any
way to railway mail clerks employed on
trains running for instance, between Vancouver and Calgary? My reason for asking
is that four or five weeks ago I met a Legion
delegation in Vancouver, who complained that
the proposed change in service between
Vancouver and Sicamous, and Sicamous and
Calgary, would make it necessary for the
families of eighteen of these mail clerks to
move from Vancouver to Calgary, despite the
difficulty of securing housing accommodation
in that city. The bill may have nothing to
do with this question, but perhaps my
honourable leader would look into the matter
before the bill is considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: This particular piece
of legislation concerns rural mail carriers
who have four-year contracts for which new
tenders are called or which may be carried
on. I doubt that it covers the point which
my honourable friend bas mentioned. However, I shall look into this subject and will
endeavour to secure any information he
requires.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not believe the bill needs to go to committee. This question was fully discussed
a couple of sessions ago. I distinctly remember asking the question: Would everybody
get a bonus?
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The minister replied that
only those who asked for it would get it.
There appeared to be nothing political about
it-just those who asked for it got it. I
gather that after that discussion most of the
carriers asked for the bonus.
I know of no other class of people who give
better service and are poorer paid. I think
the job of the rural mail carriers is a most
difficult one. They get pushed into contracts,
and then somebody persuades them to renew
them, or somebody else without the necessary
equipment puts in a low tender and there

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 126,
an Act to amend the Agricultural Products
Act.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, to
be quite frank, I might have concluded my
remarks on this bill last evening. Some few
days ago I read a newspaper report of what
I thought was a fine speech, delivered by
Mr. J. A. Marsh before the Toronto Chamber
of Commerce. I could not locate the article
before I came into the Senate yesterday, and
I have not yet laid my hand on it. It set out
much more clearly than I can the way in
which Great Britain is acting in the matter
of trade. We producers feel that it is not
logical for us to continue to make further
sacrifices.
Now, four years after the war is ended, this
bill proposes to renew for another year the
full powers of the Minister under the provisions of the Agricultural Products Act. One
of my objections to it is that it enables him
to deal internally, as between one class and
another in Canada.
The question of the
buying and selling of coarse grains in Canada
is bound to come up. Honourable senators
will recall that the senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) dealt fully with this phase
of the question last year. He pointed out
that it was dangerous for any government to
have such powers.
The Minister most closely associated with
this legislation has openly boasted that all
his speeches are political, and that therefore
they are all good. J do not object to his
speeches-they have been political for the
past forty years-but I an opposed to a
measure of this kind being used for political
purposes. Last summer, when the Minister
was visiting Alberta, I was in Calgary. One
of the papers there, either the Albertan or
the Herald quoted him as saying on the
question of the shipment of cattle to the
United States that all a government needs to
do is give the people something a couple of
weeks before an election. Another statement
credited to the Minister was to the effect
that had cattle been allowed to cross the
American border there would have been a
rise in the cost of living in Canada. In other
words, in order to keep down the cost of
living in this country the producers were
penalized. I maintain that the burden should
have been shared equally by all. As you
know, we have our hardships in the West,
and there are times when there are no profits.
Honourable senators may have followed
the recent debates in the United States
Senate concerning the Marshall plan for an

MARCH 29, 1949
expenditure of $5 billion. During those
debates a certain statement made by Harold
Wilson in the British House of Commons
came in for some criticism, and it was asked
whether Britain was exporting to countries
behind the iron curtain goods which were
capable of being used for war purposes. This
statement was that Britain's trade policy
would be guided by economic advantage.
The honourable senator from Southern
New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean), who is
an experienced trader, recently made the
suggestion that we should be concerned about
our future markets. I agree with him on
that, but as a producer in this country I am
opposed to a policy which limits the price
which one class may receive and leaves other
classes free to trade without interference
or control. Canada is about to celebrate the
addition of a great province to the East;
that is fine, but it would be a sad event if
one day we should lose some of our provinces
to the West.
Some Hon. Senalor: Where would they go?
Hon. Mr. Horner: To the United States. It
would be a sad thing to lose those provinces
just because of their inability to make their
voices heard.
Honourable senators, I have always paid
close attention to the movements of live stock.
Approximately a year ago at a time when
Westerners could not sell one head of their
cattle, 100,000 head of Eastern dairy cattle
were sold in the United States for high prices.
I have talked to different buyers around this
part of the country, and I know of one man
who bought eight bulls for slaughter. He
delivered them one at a time in his truck
because he did not want anyone to find out
the purpose for which he was really delivering them. I also know that cows which were
never intended to be dairy cows, because they
could not be milked for more than a month,
have been bought for slaughtering purposes.
I have seen this going on all around here, but
the West has been restricted by regulations.
Perhaps the people in Western Canada have
not been voting as the Minister of Agriculture
would like them to vote. Perhaps he believes
in the theory that the more you kick a dog
around the better friend he will be. That
may be his policy. I think more regard
should be shown to that part of the country
which in the past has done such a valuable
food-producing job, and which can provide
new wealth for Canada in the future. I
refuse to believe for one moment that the purpose of this legislation is to provide cattle for
Britain, because she is able to buy cattle from
the Argentine and other countries. The real
purpose of this measure, as has been stated
in the press and by public men in this country,

is to force western farmers to take lower
prices for their beef in Eastern Canada so that
the cost of living may be kept down.
These, honourable senators, are my objections to the continuation of this legislation
for another year.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I just wish to speak briefly to this bill.
In the first place, I fail to follow the logic of
my honou-rable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) when he accuses the Minister of
Agriculture of dealing, in this measure, in
terms of partisan politics, and at the same
time can see in it nothing but disadvantage to
the producers of Western Canada.
If a great sacrifice is being made by the
rank and file of producers of cattle, hogs
and cheese as a result of a partisan political
measure, then surely the author of that
legislation would meet with the disapproval
of those producers at least. I assume that the
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
has a certain regard for the political ability
of the author of these bills, and therefore it
strikes me that his remarks in that respect
were not sound or logical.
I think the information we require about
the operation of this bill in the coming year
can be given to us in committee. I should
like very much to know, for example, just
what the production of cheese, bacon and
eggs is likely to amount to in relation to the
demand for these commodities. We know
there is a contract for 50 million pounds of
cheese, to be carried out on the basis of 30
cents a pound. I should like some information as to the production of cheese in excess
of 50 million pounds, and the reasons why
permits cannot be granted for the sale of that
excess elsewhere than in the British Isles. I
have in mind the case of a man I know who
is in the cheese business. He had a definite
offer from the United States for a million
pounds of cheese at a price much higher than
30 cents a pound, but was not permitted to
take advantage of that offer because of these
agreements. I mention that purely by way
of example. I have no doubt that in committee we may secure information to explain
such cases as that, which rather suggest the
very thing that we are trying to get away
from, namely, bilateral dealing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Bilateral agreements
are not part of the conception which the
world is trying to encourage today-particularly that part of the world which includes
the United States, Great Britain and other
countries that have been parties to the great

SENATE
objective of the international trade agreements and the Havana charter. It is to be
hoped that by another year the scene will
have cleared very materially, so as to broaden
the scope for the sale of such of our primary
products as cheese, bacon and eggs. In my
own mind I am satisfied that the regulations
accompanying these food contracts might be
relaxed to some degree, so that our producers could get permits for the sale of their
surplus supplies in the United States or elsewhere-possibly at better prices than can be
obtained from Britain-without in any way
interfering with the undertaking to export a
certain quantity to the Old Country. I look
with a good deal of interest to the discussion
in committee, where I hope we shall have
officials and others who can satisfy us on
some of these points.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
think the honourable member from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) clearly set out the
reaction of farmers on the prairies to this
bill. I do not think there is any doubt about
that at all. I am troubled about a speech
made a few days ago by the honourable
gentleman from Southern New Brunswick
(Hon. Mr. McLean). I am not going to discuss it at all; I just wish to call attention to
it. To me it was the most disturbing speech
that I have heard here this session.
There has been a good deal of discussion
about trade between the United Kingdom
and Canada. There is no doubt that the
United Kingdom believes in the control of
its trade by the government, or that the
British people are hard bargainers. A few
days ago the Times of London admitted that
Britain had saved up to that time, on the
wheat alone that she had bought from
Canada, £100 million, which at the current
rate of exchange is roughly $400 million.
But that did not prevent British manufacturers from selling to Russia, or other countries behind the iron curtain, electrical supplies that we would have been glad to get.
Britain sold to those countries, and bought
from them in return because their rates of
exchange were more favourable than ours,
and in the final result she could get a higher
price for her commodities than if she had
sold them to us.
Now, honourable senators, I take second
place to no man or woman in this house in
my admiration of the British people as
defenders of freedom, as leaders of democracy
in the world, and as a great literary nation;
but I repeat that they are hard traders,
desperately hard traders, and I do not see
why Canadian farmers, such as the honourable member from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), should have to subsidize them to
help them maintain a policy that we do not

believe in. That is the issue. This whole
organization that we are concerned with
today stands for the maintenance of that
kind of policy, and that is why I object to it.
We lent the British people millions of
dollars.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Billions.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not objecting to the
millions we gave them. That was part of the
price we paid for helping to defend freedom.
I am agreeable to that. I also am agreeable
to our write-off of $500 million in the adjustment of the air training scheme. I consented
to that with my eyes open, but I do not consent at all to making a deal with Britain for
the sale of our products at prices that mean
a loss to us, when she turns around and does
business with other people instead of with us.
That is what I object to, and that is what we
as Canadians ought to object to. And that is
the issue behind the extension of controls
under these bills.
I am not a preacher of pessimism. I know
as well as any other man or woman in this
chamber the possibilities of our country, and
I have confidence in its future, but I realize
that we are in the midst of a desperate world
situation. If the United States cut off the
supply of dollars to Europe under the Marshall plan we would immediately become
bankrupt; we would have in this country a
depression the like of which we have never
known before. We have got to size up that
situation and be prepared to meet it. We have
heard a great deal about the Bennett agreements of 1932 being no good, but perhaps
before this economic struggle with Europe
is over we shall find that they were better
than we thought.
It is all very well to talk of free trade when
there is a possibility of free trade, but we are
now in a world of controlled trade. I am
afraid that unless we can get Britain to
realize that to the utmost possible extent her
trading should be done with us, we are
going to have a harder struggle with that
country than we have ever had. Hydroelectric power is being extensively developed
in this country. My own province has only
enough electric power to meet expected
requirements up to 1952. After that we may
be "up against it." On the Winnipeg river
we are starting to build a new station, but
it will not be able to produce enough extra
current to carry us along for more than three
or four additional years. Then we shall have
to go up to the Nelson river, where there is
unlimited power, but in order to develop it
we shall need first-class machinery and other
equipment. Now, the British people make
good machinery and equipment of the type
that we need over here, and we would like

MAICH 20, 1949
to get same of it; but instead of it coming
here, it is going to Russia or some other
country.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: May I asic the honourable leader opposite a question? Does he
suggest that the Bri'tish are refusing.ta sel
us this electrical equipment?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, I do. They sel
it to other people because they think they get
a better deal.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: But it is available to
any manufacturer or organization who wishes
to buy it, and it is being shipped inta Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We cannot buy it. It is
priced s0 high that it cannot compete with
the product of other manufacturers.
We in Western Canada have got to have
the European markcet for our goods. I, as
a Westerner, want that market to be secured
for us. The farmers of the Prairie Provinces
have been clamouring ta seil their cattie,
hogs, poultry and lumber to the United
States, but they have been denied that market
by the government. I want the people of
Canada ta appreciate that we in the West
are desirous of free trade with the people
of the world. That is of course not entirely
possible today, but the situation must be
appreciated by ail. We in Western Canada
have sacrificed for years, and we are willing
ta continue ta sacrifice provided the people
in the rest of Canada realize what we are
doing. The very first time Eastern Canada
had an opportunity ta give us a hundred
cents on the dollar for aur product, we were
turned down; and this despite the fact that
in 1946 and 1947 we lost over $500 million
on the grain contract alone. That fact is now
admitted; it cannot be denied. We have
received $1.55 a bushel for wheat ta be used
in the making o! bread when we could have
sold it on the world markcet for at least a
dollar a bushel more. Further, we were
required ta pay aur share o! the 46-cent
subsidy on flour. These are things that
Eastern Canada does not know.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Does my honourable
friend suggest that the millers in Eastern
Canada bought flour ta manufacture inta
bread at $1.55 a bushel?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The price was $1.55 a bushel
until about a year ago.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it was. I have the
figures right from the government bureau.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Well, I should like ta
see those figures. If I may attempt ta explain
the situation, it is this: After the payment of
29091-19

a subsidy, the net price ta the miller' was
brought down ta $1.55.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no. The -price of the
wheat that went inta bread was brought
down to, 77 cents a bushel, and that is the
price that was paid by the people who consumed thé bread. The rest of the people of
Canada paid the difference between that
figure and $1.55. The price was $1.55 a
bushel with a 46-cent subsidy-and the
farmers sold 77 million bushels of grain in
the year 1946, and 78 million bushels In 1947.
I speak from the book, my !riend. I have
the report o! the Canada Farm Board right
on my office desk now, and if my friend
wishes, I shail adjourn the debate until
tomorrow and get the report for him.
As a resuit o! this pollcy the people of
Eastern Canada ate bread made of wheat
that we sold for at least a dollar a bushel
iess than the world price. Further, we were
recjuired, as I said before, ta pay aur share
o! the 46-cent subsidy. The same argument
applies ta cattie. We were kept out o! the
American marketHan. Mr. Howard: When the price was low.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and the price was high
for years. I want the people of Canada ta
give us a chance in the world of free trade,
and not ta restrict us. Under this legisiation
the government seeks ta permit the Minister
of Agriculture ta take charge o! the selling
of aur eggs, bacon and cheese, at a price that
he thinks proper. Af ter aur experience with
the grain legisiation, we do not think much
o! his judgment as ta what is proper.
My hanourabie friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) has suggested that the Minister
o! Agriculture may get a lot o! votes !rom
the western provinces in the next election.
I warn him not ta bank too strongly on that
hope. I think he will find that the C.C.F'ers
wiii be at the top o! the ladder.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Oh, no, my friend! You
are wrong there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are taking advantage
o! what the governiment is doing. In effect
they say, the government has given you so
much, but we can do better for you.
The conditions of world trade today are
very bad. Trade is only maintained by the
strength o! American dollars. Apart from
controls there seems ta be no effort on the
part o! the Canadian government ta overcome
this condition. The government talks a great
deal about the Geneva Agreements. True,
they are very sound in theory-but not In
practice. For instance, they allow another
200,000 head o! cattle ta enter the United
States; but had Mexico been permitted ta

SENATE
ship the cattle to that country, how would
Canada have fared?
.Honourable members, this is a problem that
we i Canada must face within the next year,
with ail the vigour possible. It must be
remembered that France has this year produced a surplus of wheat. In a day or two
we shail have before us the Wheat Agreement,
from Washington, with a request for approval.
Neither Argentina nor Russia is a party to
that agreement. As a small boy my first
business knowledge concerned wheat. That
was a long time ago, and in those days the
Russians were in the market. Russia will be
in the market again; and will do everything
possible I believe to destroy our market and
bring about a depression in this country.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: We want no0 truck
nor trade with the Russians.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is true, but our customers in Europe will trade with them.
This policy of making agreements between
governments can only lead to trouble. I
agreed witb my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) when he asked
about the possibility of a manufacturer seiling say, a million pounds of cheese? People
do not know where they stand. That is the
problem that runs through this whole control
policy. Personally, I am against sucb a policy,
and I have always been against it. As I have
said previously, for the if e of me I cannot
understand bow a Liberal government. or
men who say they are Liberals and liberalminded, can subscribe to such a policy.
Hon. Mr. Copp: Anything for the good of
the people.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought only Conservatives believed in control by tariffs. With a
system. of tariffs one at least knows where he
is-where be starts and where he stops; but
under the control system one neyer knows
where he is. We had before a committee the
other day a certain controller who was typical
of sucb officiais. He thought that the world
iwould come to an end if controls were taken
off. 0f course I think the world would carry
on just the same. It is a strange thing that
for years the Conservative party has been
fighting against controls, for if history means
anything, that is the party which should be
sponsoring such measures. But it is the
Liberals who are fightîng to maintain the control system.
My honourable friend from Churchill <Hon.
Mr. Crerar) wisely suggested the other day
that at the end of the war we should have
thrown out these controls, got down ta, cases
and competed freely in world trade. I brelieve
that as long as we have controls the rest of
the world. will have them. I am definitely

opposed to, this bill and to the idea of controlling trade generally.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I had a question that I
wished to ask my honourable friend, but I
f elt that I should refrain from interrupting
him during his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I agree with you.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But what my honourable
friend saysHon. Mr. Haig: Is this a question or a
speech?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -leads me to ask this
question: "Would my honourable friend support the freest possible trade arrangement we
could 110w make wîth the United States?"
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer that question.
I believe in freer trade and the chance for
freedom of trade, when it does not mean the
wiping out of an industry that has taken
years to establish and which bas proven satisfactory to the wbole country. My bonourable
friend from Churchill may think that Western
Canada complains about tariffs. That is not
so. Wbat Western Canada complains about
is controls. We are opposed to our trade
being controlled, and we want to see controls
abolished.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) will answer my question with pleasure. In the early part of bis
remarks be spoke of Canada going bankrupt.
Now, bankruptcy is a technical term and bas
certain connotations, the chief of wbich is
inability to pay one's debts as they fali due.
I suggest that my bonourable friend explain
what he means when he talks about Canada
going bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What I mean is tbat this
country will experience another depression
sucb as it had before.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: That is not bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, that is not bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You should not use that
term.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no question about
Canada's ability to pay her debts.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, then, would the
bonourable senator witbdraw the word bankrupt?
Han. Mr. Haig: Ail right.
word "depression" instead.

I shall use the

Hon. Mr. Euler: That is better.
Hon Mr. Haig: My dlaim. is that our present
standard of living will disappear unless we
build up our world trade.

MARCK 29, 1949
Hon. T. A. Crerar: During the speech of my
hanaurable friend <Hon. Mr. Haig) I had
strong hapes that he would broaden his aid
views on international trade, but i response
ta my question he got back on good solid
protectionist ground.
I did not; intend ta say anything during
this discussionHou. Mr. Haig: I knew my bonourable
friend would when I got through speaking.
Hon. Mr. Crsiar: -but I wish ta, say that
those criticizing the United Klngdom, which
i the past has been one af aur important
markets fail ta take into consideration the
tremendaus change brought about by the war.
Britain is just as anxious ta trade with
Canada as she is to trade witb any other
country, but she is forced ta do the very thing
that my honourable friend advocates-she
trades today, where, i her difficuit situation,
she can do so ta the best advantage.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I shall give you a chance
when 1 arn finished.
We want the British rnarket and Britain
needs and would welcome aur products. But
how is she ta pay for tbem? She is able ta
pay for same praducts with Marshall dollars,
but when that spring dries Up the situation
may be much more difficuit. I recail that in
the dark thirties the price of wheat drapped
ta the lowest point in 300 years. We were
starmng wheat by the hundreds of millians of
bushels, and at the same time starvatian was
rampant i same parts a! the world. Why
did we not; send aur wheat to these areas?
The meicbanism did not exist for making the
transfer. The countries in which. these areas
existed could not buy our wbeat, and we
refused ta give them credit which we neyer
expected would be repaid.
Hanourable senators, we want a littie cammon sense and realism in the discussion of
these matters. Ever since the war, Britain's
problem bas been ta balance ber payments
with the sa-called sterling areas as well as
the dollar areas af Canada and the United
States. It has only been witbin the last f ew
rnanths that she bas been able to overcame
this difflculty sa far as the sterling areas are
concerned.
During another debate a few days ago I
said that the currents of warld trade were
greatly altered, perhaps permanently, by the
war. The reasan for this is that in the early
years of the war, before tbe United States
entered inta the bostilities, Britain had ta
realize heavily an her averseas securities. In
other words, she said ta ber natianals at
home, "If yau own Canadian bonds, or shares
in the Naranda Mining Company, the Inter29091-191

national Nickel Company or any other campany in Canada or the United States, you
must surrender them ta us. We will take
them and give you British Goveramnent bonds
i exehange."l This was done i a large way.
The gaverament then took these securities
and marketed them i the United States and
Canada ta get the dollars ta buy the wberewitbal ta prasecute the war. Let no one lase
sight o! the !act that in doing this, Britai
sacrificed for ahl time the incarne an these
investments which she sold-an incarne from
which she derived a large measure o! ber
monetary requirements for tbe purchase af
Canadian products.
I would be the last one ta criticize Britain
for trying ta put ber own bouse in order.
After ail, Britain is a country a! 50 million
people, and ber resources are as nathing
compared to ours. We are a people numbering 12 or 13 million, situated in a country
wbose natural resaurces in mJ.nerals, timber,
fish and agricultural possibilities are unsurpassed. Quite !rankly, I bave no sympathy
with those who criticize Britain at this
moment. If the present situation underlines
anything, it is the need for this cauntry to
secure -markets wberever it can find tbem.
That is why I would welcome the braadest
trade arrangement we could negatiate with
the United States.
Hon. Mr. Horner: So would I.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In my judgment a broad
trade arrangement is the ane thing that wil
pull us tbrough ini the end. My judgment
is nat gaing ta be influenced by the consideration of protecting any individual industry in a certain part of Canada. This whole
prablem must be viewed on a braad scale..
I agree largely with the bonourable leadero! the apposition (Han. Mr. Haig) and the
hanourable senatar fram Blaine Lake (Hon.,
Mr. Harner) wben they argue that this;
cauntry could undaubtedly have done better
had we been free sinice the end af the war
ta seil our products where we could get the
best price for them. But it must be remembered that we bave been limited by aur
agreements with Great Britain. I arn glad
that my honaurable frlend from Ottawa <Hon.
Mr. Lambert) tauched upon the effects o!
bilateral trade agreements. My observation
definitely leads me ta the conclusion that
bilateral trade agreements nearly always
work against the exporting country and for
the benefit of the irnparting country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. Crsiar: Wbat happens when we
have a bilateral agreement on wheat? The
traders who formerly searcbed out markets

SENATE
in other parts of the world find their hands
tied. They no longer search for markets for
their wheat; everything is worked out
through one state agency. The same is true
with respect to cheese. The honourable
senator from Ottawa gave an illustration of
that. If Canadians should stand for anything,
it is multilateral trade and the greatest possible removal of the barriers to trade.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is the only way by
which we can ever hope to support the
mountain of debt that now rests on not only
our federal government but also on our provincial and even our municipal governments.
That is the only way by which we are ever
going to be able to carry the heavy burden
of social security in the federal, provincial
and municipal fields-a burden which today
probably accounts for more than 25 per cent
of the total taxes collected in this country.
Canada's resources must be developed, for
by no other means can we reach a position
of security.
This bill extends the life of the Agricultural
~Products Act for only one year. I hope that
twelve months hence we shall not be told
again that contracts have been renewed here,
there and elsewhere, and that consequently
there must be an extension of the powers
under this Act for another year. That, I
think, would be a serious mistake.
Honourable senators, I had not intended
to take part in this discussion at all, but my
good friend the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) stirred me a little bitHon. Mr. Haig: I thought so.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and
pulsion to say something.

I felt the com-

Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, the
question I wished to ask was this: In view
of the complete change in the British Government and the experiment with socialism in
Britain, does the honourable gentleman think
the British people are now as eager to deal
with us as they formerly were?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I understand the
British people aright-and I have had a considerable measure of experience in dealing
with them-they will buy and sell wherever
they can do so to their own best advantage.
It is true that for many of their food imports
they are today paying prices higher than we
would charge for these commodities; but at
the same time, for the products that they
have to export they are getting much higher
prices than we would pay. Besides, much of
their trading is done under bilateral agreements with European countries, where the
pound sterling is not subject to discount, and

we must remember that not many Canadians
or Americans are willing to take in exchange
for goods large sums in pounds sterling which
it will be difficult to convert later into
dollars.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators, I
should like to call the attention of the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) to the fact that the cream of our
commercial securities is still in Europe. Some
of the Canadian National Railways bonds and
certain odds and ends have been repatriated,
but to the amount of $1½ billion the cream of
our securities is still in Europe.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am unable to make any
comment on that statement, but I do know
that in the early days of the war, if my
memory serves me rightly, Canada repatriated
more than three-quarters of a billion dollars'
worth of its securities held in Britain,
including practically all the securities outstanding against the Canadian National Railways. The British have lost their securities
in the Argentine. They owned the Argentine
railways and drew large profits from them,
but the railways were taken over by the
government of that country and the proceeds
used to pay a debt owed by Britain to that
government. The situation with respect to
the United States was similar. I am saying
this on the authority of a statement published
in the London Economist not long ago by
way of illustrating the difficulties that Great
Britain is in at present.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators,
Canada is practically the only Commonwealth
nation that has not taken back most of its
securities.
South Africa and India, for
instance, have done this, but, as I have said,
the cream of our commercial securities
remains in London and Paris, and to some
extent in Holland.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion for second
reading of Bill 216, an Act to amend the
Agricultural Products Act. Is it your pleasure
to adopt this motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons wjth bill 174, an Act for granting
to His.Mai esty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 3lst March, 1950.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, for the benefit of those who are not familiar with procedure of parliament in voting money for the
public service, I may say that at about this
time in each session, after the estimates have
been brought down, but before they have
been considered in detail, it is the practice
of the government to present a bill for the
granting of interim supply, in order that the
business of the country may be carried on
for a specified period. The passage of this
bill does flot prejudice the right of any rnember to discuss and criticize any item in the
estimates later in the session, when, ie circunmstances make it desirable. there xviii be
further measures of interim supply.
This bill, a copy of which, I believe, is on
the desk off each honourable senator, follows
the general practice in asking for certain proportions of that part of the total estîï-nates
\Vbich is flot "otherwise provided for." The
phrase "otherwise provided for," which
will be found in sections 3, 4 and 5 off the
bill, bas to do with amounts which. being
statutory, do flot have to be provided for
specîfically year by year.
The first item that is asked for under this
bill is $230,145,541; this surn being one-sixth
of thc total estîmates to be voted, and constituting approximately txvo months' supply
as calculated on a mathernatical basis. Honourable senators will realize that while there
are some types of expenditures which run
more or less evenly throughout the year,
there are certain others wbich, in the given
period, require more than the one-sixth allocated to them.
These expenditures are indîcated in three
categories, the first of which appears under
schedule A of the bill. On turning to section
3, it xvili be no'ed that in addition to the

one-sixth asked for under section 2, there is
a further sumn of $1,791,333.33, this being onethird o! the amount of each item in the estimates as set forth in scheduie A. Two services
are affected by this provision, namely freight
assistance on western seed grains, and the
Canadian International Trade Fair of 1949.
I assume that in respect o! those two items
the monetary requirements will flot; be evenly
distributed over the year, but will arise within
the next two or three months. For this reason
the additionai one-third is being asked for.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: The same as
last year.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, on the same basis
as hast year. The second classification appears
in sehedule B, pursuant to section 4, in which
the sum of $301,339.50 is asked for. The
additional one-sixth of the amounts set forth
under schedule B relates to Canadian representation at international conferences, and the
general administration of parhiament, including the Senate and the House of Commons,
whose expenditures are concentrated in the
early part of the fiscal year. The third classification appears in schedule C, referred to in
section 5, and amounts to the sum of
$2,168,752.75, which, it will be noted, is onetwelfth off the items set forth in the schedule.
These cover experimental farms, service
representatives abroad, services off the Mines
and Resources Department, including various
activities of the Lands and Developrnent Services Branch, together xvith certain phases off
the actîvities off the Department off Trade and
Commerce. I fancy that the saine argument
that applies to the one-third also applies here,
though perhaps in lesser degree. It is desirable that these various activities be got under
way early in the fiscal year.
Honourable senators, these constitute the
arnount 0f interi'n supply askei for. May I
repeat that at any subsequent date honourable senators may rise and discuss any matter
which properly comes before this house in
connection wilh this legýislation.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I ask the
honourable leader one question? In schedule
B the estimate 0f the Clerk of the bouse o!
Commons is given as $800,730. Is that amount
for increase of salaries? My honourable
friend does flot need to answer the question
now.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should think that is
the total expense for the Senate and the
House 0f Commons. One-sixth o! the total
expenses for the year is being asked for in
addition to the one-sixth that is being asked
for generally under the first item. This is
because the expenses o! parliament are
generally incurred. during the first three or
four months of the session.

MARCH 30. 1S49
Hoa. Mr. Haig: wrnl the honaurable senator
explain the first item in Schedule A? I do
not know why the amount should be sa large.
Hou. Mr. Robertson: Is that the item oi
"Frelght assistance on western feed grains"?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I arn not conversant
with the details, but I imagine It closely
approximates the amaunt provided for last
year. Frankly I cannot say wbether it is
greater or iess.
Hon. Mr. AsolUme: Apparently it is the
intention af the government ta continue ta

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should think sa; but
whether the arnount is greater or less than it
was last year, I cannat say.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: Is this legislatian going ta be referred ta cornmittee?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Not unless it is the
pleasure af the bouse ta ref er it. It is desirable that Royal Assent be given ta this bill

Hon. Mr. Haig: The budget is not bei are us.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: It is before the
whole country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I arn wondering whether
honourable senatars from Ontario, Quebec,
and the Maritime Provinces know what the
item af freight assistance on western feed
grains means. It means that we poar people
ai western Canada have got ta feed aur cattie
on aur own grain at the market price. If we
are perrnitted ta senl aur cattie ta the United
States, well and goad. Otherwise, we ship them
ta the rnarkets in Eastern Canada, and pay
the freight on them. On the other hand we
pay part ai the ireight an feed shipped from
the West ta Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes, and eastern purchasers get it at the
sarne price that we do. What the eastern
f armers save in freight charges on feed they
can deduct from the price ai their cattie. In
that way they can underseil us, and I do not
think it is fair. If Ontario, Quebec and the
Maritimes want cheap feed, let the governments ai thase provinces bonus the farmers,

and for goodness sake let us put an end ta
this business of having the West help -supply
the East with cheap feed.
Hon. Mr. Loger: We have simply been trying to help the western provinces.
Hon. Mr. -Haig: Well, the West does flot
need that kind ai help. If the government
will let us have an open market for our feed
in the United States, we can get f ar more for
it over there.
Hon. Mr. Loger: How much do we pay for
irrigation?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Nothing.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How much do we pay for
prairie i arm assistance?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The cast ai prairie iarm
assistance is taken out of each iarmer's
receipts frarn the sale of his grain.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No, it is taken out of the
taxes ai Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I disagree with my honourable friend. There is a tax ai 1 per cent on
every bushel of grain that gaes ta the mnarket.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Haw rnuch does Manitoba
pay ai the total ai $4,750,000?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It pays its propartionate
share.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Haw much is that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do nat knaw.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: About 3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do nat know what the
percentage is, but we pay aur share.
I want ta speak naw on another item. My
honourable iriend irorn Toronto-Trinity, (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) has aiways given me the impression in this bouse that he is a fighter on
behaif ai the under-dag.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Han. Mr. Haig: I want ta tell him where
there are same under-dogs, and he had better
get busy. If he wîll visit the experirnental
farms across Canada he wili find that casual

allowed thisý bouse for the consideration af
certain legisiation. What I have to say doea
not concern the bill now before the house,
except ta the extent that it is one af fIve
measures as to which the time for consideratian was limited. The remnarks which I amn
about to make would be more applicable ta
certain bils passed last week than to the
one before us.
Speaking generafly, I find na fault with the
criticism that the Senate is flot given sufficient
time for the consideration of important legislat ion. I have flot the slightest doubt; that,
had I possessed the necessary temerity when
I first came ta this house, I would have
expressed the same crlticism when occasion
arase.
I realize that the criticisms off ered by
hanourabie members might well be prefaced
by the form sa familiar ini many recommendations: "Ta wham it may concern". Nevertheless, althaugh the criticisms are flot dlrected
specificafly at me, in my capacity as leader
af the gavernment in this house I feel some
responslbility for the situation which provokes them. However, after reading the
debates af previaus sessions, and discovering
that since confederatian there has nat been
a year when this probiem has nat presented
itseii-certainiy this is in accord with my
experience since 1943-I arn convinced that
it will continue ta face us in the future.
Blame for delay is aiten difficuit ta place.
In the main, the governiment af the day has
the major responsibiiity for the canduct of
the business ai parliament-at least that is
the view af the opposition-but, by the same
taken, 1 arn sure that some members af the
governxnent wauld urge that the biame for
delaying legisiation lies with the members ai
the opposition. Bath sides may be partly
right. On the one hand we have the government, which intraduces legisiation and hapes
that it will be expedited; on the other we
have the opposition, whose purpose it is ta
oppose-which is not very censurablewhether the performance ai that function
takes a long time or a short one.
I wish ta answer specîfically a remark
made a iew moments ago by the honourable
leader opposite cancerning the Appropriation
Bull. In presenting this bill I apened my
remarks by saying that its passage here
wauld not deprive any honourable senator
ai the right ta ask questions and further
investigate any details af the estimates.
Since I have been in this house the final
Appropriation Bill has came dawn about a
hall hour before the prorogation af parliament. The reason for this is that by the time
the debate on the budget is over li the House
of Cammons-assuming that other legisiatian

SENATE
has run concurrently-the business of parliament is practically at an end. True, when the
final Appropriation Bill comes before us, we
in this house have the constitutional right to
delay it for a week or two and cause the
members of the other house to wait around
until we have had ample time to investigate
its details. Generally speaking, however,
that procedure would not be practical,
because, as honourable senators know, at that
late stage of the session many travel reservations have been made and accepted, and there
are few members of the other place present
to witness the prorogation ceremony and not
many honourable senators to participate in it.
So I suggest that even though we protest as
much as we like, this will not cure the
situation.
If one looks at the subject from another
point of view, one will realize the impressive
responsibility, and the right and the opportunity that we have to devise some effective
machinery to deal with such questions as have
been raised by my honourable friend the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). I
suppose that, even if I were a walking
encyclopaedia of information about all government business, which I am not, I could
hardly be expected to give the house a full
explanation of such points as the one which
has been raised. I do not know all the facts:
there may be some extenuating circumstances,
and there may not. But, once the budget is
down in the other place, the estimates are
before parliament, and reports on the interesting and important matters involved are
being received. Surely, even though our rules
do not permit us to consider the budget until
it is formally before us, it is not beyond the
wit of man ta devise some means whereby
any or every detail of government business
can be put before the appropriate committee,
so that honourable senators can address their
questions to someone better equipped to
answer them than a poor lone leader of the
government, who, their own common sense
must tell thern, just does not know the
answers. Surely there is a great opportunity
before us. When honourable senators were
discussing in this house the tremendous problems of Canada's trade, I thought of the
sources of information that we have at hand
in our ministers and their departmental
officials. My impression is that there is not
one of them, but would be only too willing
upon reasonable notice, to give us the benefit
of an experience which is very wide and
valuable.
It has been my fortune to attend two meetings of the United Nations, and after seeing
our permanent service in action, I am convinced that no country in the world is blessed
with civil servants who have a clearer knowl-

edge of these complex questions. Whatever
some honourable senators may think of its
value, the information is to be had; and I
believe we ought to work out a practice
whereby we would be served better than by
waiting until the end of June, or whenever
parliament is about to expire, when I am
placed in the position of having to ask this
house to vote billions of dollars on short
notice.
I have been asked, "What do you mean by
bringing in a bill like this without an opportunity for the Senate to discuss it?" I would
remind my critics that when the Appropriation Bill is through the other place-assuming
there has been reasonable progress with other
legislation-parliament is very close to prorogation, and I ask, even though all of us were
here and ready to go on, how much could we
do in about half an hour? I hope that honourable senators, particularly those who have
rendered a service in bringing this subject to
the attention of the house, will give us the
advantage of their considered opinion as to
what method we could take to provide the
necessary machinery.
Is there any reason why, for instance, the
estimates of the Department of Mines and
Resources, or of the Department of Agriculture, could not be referred to one or other of

objections: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is there anything in the
rules which would definitely prevent such
action?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not know that
there is. But even if there were, it seems
to me that if a change in the rules is advantageous to Senate business, the rules should
be changed.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Surely.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have been greatly
impressed with the possibilities of such
action.
As regards legislation which was rendered
necessary by the deadline of March 31, it
seems to me that in enacting the sixty-day
limit after the opening of parliament we were
a little over-zealous, and that a ninety-day
extension would have been more practicable.
After all, the debate on the Speech from the
Throne usually occupies about six weeks, and
the right of discussion, with its opportunities
for criticism, cannot be denied to the opposition.

SENATE
Right Hon. Zan A. Mackenzie: Honourable
àenators, it is most refreshing to hear the
Words of the honourable leader of the opposition <Hon. Mr. Haig). When I entered this
ehamber 1 found myseif on the edge of a
tide of unpopularity because I suggested the
very things my honourable friend is now suggesting. I want to thank the leader o! the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for what
he has said. But, honourable senators, what
has caused the delay in important legisiation
corning to us? Let us look at the facts. Five
votes of non-confidence have been moved
during the present session by Tories, neoTories and others in the House of Commons.
The action taken by my honourable friend's
(Hon. Mr. Haig) friends in the other house
has resulted in the delay of important
legisiation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: That is true,
but my friends were defeated in the other
house just as they will be when public
opinion is tested within the next few rnonths.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
is out of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: This whole discussion is out of order.
Righi Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: I arn speaking
about waste of time, a point raised by the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig). I arn sure every rnerber of this house
will be only too happy to co-operate in the
orgcanization of a cornrittee to carry out the
suggestion made by the leader of the government. In 1946 the late Senator Gerry McGeer
offered to this house the same suggestion that
the honourable leader has made here this
af ternoon. It is a proposai that is full of
common sense.
Honourable senators, since Confederation
the Senate of Canada has neyer done s0
mucli up-to-date work as it has accornplished
under the present leader of the governrnent
duiig the past two years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomnas Vien: Hlonourable senators,
I rnust apologize for rising to speak, because
I know that in doing s0 I arn out of order;
but rny predecessors in this discussion were
also out of order. When I first carne to the
Senate I was told by His Honour the Speaker,
who was then the leader of the governrnent,
that the rules of this house were not as
strictly enforced as are those of the other
place. Perhaps, therefore, I rnay secure the
consent of honourable senators to say a few
words about the imnportant point raised by
the leader.

Honourable senators, there is nothing to
prevent; us from doing exactly what has been
suggested. There is only one provision under
the B.N.A. Act determining that a money
bill-and the budget is the greatest money bill
brought down during a session-should origmnate in the House of Commons. Section 53
of the B.N.A. Act reads:
Bis for appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or for irnposing any tax or impost, shail
originate ia the House of Commons.
When the governrnent leader is placing
the estirnates on the table there is nothing in
our rules to prevent hirn frorn rnoving that
they be referred to the Committee of the
Whole, or to any special or standing comrnittee. I agree with the honourable leader
o! the opposition that we are flot rnaking full
use of the rnachinery provided for under our
rules. If certain legislation were referred to
the Committee of the Whole, ail honourable
members would be able to participate in the
debate, and the general public would have a
better idea of the interest that is being taken
by honourable senators in the legislation that
cornes before them.
There is another thing that we should not
overlook. The Senate is often a target for
accusations, and now we are hearing reference to the criticisrn that the Senate is not
paying sufficient attention to the expenditure
of public rnoney. Well, the same criticisrn
has for long been mnade of another place. I
first entered the other house of parliarnent
in 1917, thirty-two years ago, and I do not
recali any session when sorne honourable
member of that place dîd not cornplaîn that
consideration o! the estîrnates was delayed
too long. The estirnates are considered there
in Cornrittee of the Whole, but the time o!
the house is taken up wîth s0 rnany other
rnatters that large surns inevitably have to be
voted in the last few days before prorogation. I do not believe it is possible to devise
any rnachinery to overcorne that condition
there; but in the Senate, where we are not
so presse for tirne, estirnates could be considered in the Cornrittee of the Whole as
soon as they are tabled. If we preferred, we

could of course refer thern to a special coinrnittee, and this would be particularly desirable when witnesses are to be heard.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask rny honourable
friend why hie says that? If the Senate has
authority to do whatever it pleases, within
the confines of the British North Arnerica
Act, why should we not permit deputy ministers and other departrnental representatives
to corne here and answer questions in Comnmittee of the Whole, just as they do in any
other commrittee?

MARCH 30. 1949
Hon. Mir. Vien: I do flot see any fundamental objection to it, but it would be contrary to regular parliamentary practice in
both England and Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That does not matter.
Hoa. Mr. Vien: As honourable members
know, in another place no one but the minister or bis assistant answers questions concerning the department whose estimates are
under consideration at the trne. Technlcal
advisors may sit near the minister for consultation purposes, but they have no rlght to
speak during a sitting of the house or Committee of the Whole. If it is desired to question departmental officers on any matter,
there must be a reference to the standing
or special committee before which they may
be called as witnesses. However, as I say,
I see no fundamental objection to our making
an arrangement whereby departmental officers may be permitted to answer questions
in Committee of the Whole.
Interim supply bis have been presented
to parliament from. time immemorial. At the
end of each fiscal year it becomes necessary
to provide for the requirements of the state
for a short period. The passage of such
interim. supply does flot curtail the right of
discussion when the budget cornes up for
study in detail.
There are many reasons to justify the
practice followed. During this session the
other place has had to consider the very
important question of the admission of Newfoundland and the equally important Atlantic
Pact, both of which required a great deal of
time. I say, therefore, that there is nothing
extraordinary about the manner in which the
Supply Bill has been considered and passed
in this house today.
The fact that this country has fared so well
since confederation indicates that our practice
cannot be as bad as some would suggest.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Mr. Speaker, like my
leader and the leader opposite, I amn out of
order in speaking at this time. But before
the discussion is concluded I wish to say that
I disagree with the remarks of both leaders
in this house. From what has been said, I
gather that they wish to convert the Senate
into a debating society. I do not believe that
this would be in the best interest of ýanyone.
A large portion of the work of this bouse
is done in our committees, which are the
proper places to do it. I arn sure no one
will charge that the committees are not
efficient. Then why should the suggestion
be made that this house be turned into a
Committee of the Whole, where we would
lose valuable time debating matters whlch
could be more carefully considered in other
committees.

Honourable senators are not seeking to
further their own interests; to make themselves known, or to bring their names before
the public o! Canada. Our only concern is
to give the people o! this country good laws
and sound administration. In no other place
can the business of this house be more efficiently discussed than in our committees.
Sorne Hon. Senatoru: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I would agree with my friend the
honourable leader of the government that a
measure of this kind should be considered
and discussed in committee rather than on
the floor of the house. The real virtue in the
plan he advocates is that it would benefit thepublic and give better administration of ourfinances.
When I first went to the House of Commons I was appalled to find that the finances
of this country are managed almost entirely
by civil servants. The estimates are prepared
behind closed doors, fortunately by fullyinformed men of bigh purpose. The estimates then go unrevised to the minister, wbo
usually knows very little about the subi ect of
finance; finaily, be introduces bis legislation
on the floor of the bouse, and bas a couple of
civil servants sitting in front o! him to supply
tbe answers to questions that may be asked.
In ail my experience I cannot recail a single
instance of the House of Commons refusing
to pass an estimate. When the civil servants get the approval of the minister, the
estimates are submitted and parliament acts
as a rubber stamp in approving tbem.
Year after year a great deal of uninformed,
talk on finances takes place in the Commons..
No courity coundil would vote its money iii,
the way that parliament votes federal
expenditures of millions of dollars. I haveoften expressed the tbought tbat Canada
should have committees similar ta theappropriation committees of the Congress of'
the United States, whose members study theestimates rather than make speeches.
The suggestion of the bonourable leader
wbich appealed most favourably to me was
that we in the Senate migbt meet a need for
study which is not being met in tbe House of
Commons. For instance, the varjous items
in the estimates could be referred to coinmittees o! the Senate, which would cail before
them civil servants responsible for the preparation of the estirnates, and ask them to
As an
justify their recommendations.
example, the head of a departrnent who hast.,
year received $1,000 for a certain expenditure
and this year requests $2,0oo would be asked
to explain and justify the increase. The
estimates could thus be deait witb item b.V

SENATE
item. This is a function which. should be
performed by a small committee, seated
around a table in discussion with those who
have the knowledge and are especially interested in the subi ect. 1 believe that such a
practice would do away with the long, uninformed debates which occur in the House of
Commons, usually displaying complete ignorance of the subi ect and often dealing with
points entirely disconnected with the item in
question.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask my friend
a question? Suppose the estimates were
referred to such a committee where civil servants were present to supply the necessary
information, and that the committee decided
that a certain amount requested was entirely
out of reason, where would the matter go
then?
*Hon.Mr. Roebuck: The committee would so
recommend.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: To whom?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To this House. Finally,
when the estimates were formally and legally
Poefore it the house would resolve itself into
a Committee of the Whole.
The point I was about to make was that if
we referred the estimates to standing committees and gained complete knowledge of
the facts, then the debate which followed
would be informed and of some value.
Should we find estimates that were improper,
we could refuse to pass them, or in the
interval between our finding of the facts
and the debate on the floor of this house,
the minister concerned could be advised that
we disagreed xvith certain requests and asked
for a revision. The point is that were we to
have a debate in Committee of the Whole
without previously securing the information
to be gained in small standing committees, we
would be duplicating the farce which. goes on
in the House of Commons at the present time.
1 amrn ot opposed to the practice of discussing measures in Committee of the Whole,
but I believe that a more useful purpose
would be served if we preceded such discussion by a study of the estimates in standing committees.
In reply to the remarks of the leader
copposîte, 1 may say that it does not matter
much whether the newspapers give publicity
to the proceedings of the Senate or comment
,on some senator's speech-though much of
,that is done-because we can be assured, I
believe, that the people of Canada know fairly
well what the members of this chamber are
;doing.
Han. Mr. Haig: No, they do flot.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think they do, in a
general way. They know it fairly well; and

anyway, I have faith to believe that if we give
the service we do not need to care very much
about the advertising. What we do will
become known, and if we deserve credit we
shaîl get it.
1 compliment the leader of the government
on bringing forward this matter, because I see
in it the possibilities of a great public service.
The Han. the Speaker: I do not want to
interfere with any general desire to break the
rules, but this debate could very well have
taken place on the third reading of the Supply
Bill. I do not see that it is applicable to the
measure before us.
The motion is for the third reading of the
bill. Is it your pleasure to concur in the
motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

THE NORTH ATLANTIC PACT
APPROVAL

0F PRINCIPLE

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved that
it be resolved:
1. That this house declares anew its support of the
United Nations as the world organization established
to maintain international peace and security and to
promote the economnic and social advancement of
ail peoples. and reaffirms its faith in the principles
and purposea of the Charter of the United Nations.
2. That this bouse recognizes that the conclusion.
amnong states of the North Atlantic area. of a treaty
within the meaning of Article 51 of the Charter is,
in present circumatances, of vital importance for the
protection of Canada, the preservation of peace, and
the developmnent of political, social and economic
co-operation among North Atlantic democracles.
3. That this bouse agrees that Canada should be
represented at this conference, and that the representatives of Canada at the conference should use
their best endeavour to asslst in the completion of
an acceptable treaty based on the proposed text as
tabled on March 18.
4. That any such treaty should, before ratification.
be submlitted to the Houses of Parliament for
approval.

MARCH 30. 1949
He said: Honourable senators, I cannot
today express the saine hope for world cooperation that was proclaimed to you in this
house on .almost the saine day in 1945. We
were then approving the appointinent of
delegates te the San Francisco Con! erence.
Thtis appointment was made at the invitation
of the United Kingdom, United States, China
and the Union o! Soviet Republics. Fifty
nations were represented at that conference,
and they ail joined in formlng the charter of
the United Nations. That charter was ratified
by each of the fifty nations in the most binding
constitutional procedure in each of their
respective countries.
The first General Assembly of the 'United
Nations met in 1946. The avowed purposes of
its charter were to remove the scourge of war
from the world, guarantee fundamental freedoms and inaugurate a new era of world cooperation. The charter had weaknesses. Many
of us observed that, but we refrained fromn
exaggerating themn in the hope that the underlying spirit of the charter could remove them
in the face o! actual problems. These weaknesses could only be called to the council table
by reason o!* a breach of f aith. They were
called to the council table. At first we treated
the breaches as if they were minor procedural
points and, although with many misgivings,
we continued to look to the main principles
of the charter.
As had been ail too evident in the beginning,
the small subsections and exemptions in the
charter were treated as its main principles.
No person was more reluctant in pointing
this out than our present Prime Minister.
His diplomatic utterances at the sessions of
the United Nations could offend no one, but
he made it crystal clear that he did not
believe the Assembly was working as it
should, and he clearly pointed out the alternative. In September of 1947 the Right
Honourable Mr. St. Laurent said:
Nations In their search for peace and co-operation.
will not and cannot accept Indefinitely an unaltered
council whlch was set up to ensure their security,
and which, so many feel, has become frozen in
futility and divided by dissension. If forced, they
may seek greater safety in an association of democratic and peace-loving states wlling to accept more
speciflc International obligations la return for a
greater measure of national security. Such associations. it has already been pointed out, if consistent
with the principles and purposes of the charter. can
be formed w1thin the United Nations. It la to be
hoped that such a development wifl not; be necessary. If It la unnecessary, it wUll be most undesirable. H,. however. It lu made necessary, ft will have

to take place.
The continuation of this flaunting of the
principles of the United Nations, accoinpanied by refusais ta brlng these offences
before the council, caused grave concern to
Western Europe. The Soviet intended to
spread communism, not in spite of the
United Nations, but by using it as a shield.

On January 22, 1948, Mr. Bevin said that
this Soviet prograrn of hostility and obstruetlonism indicated that the time .had corne for
close political and economic union of -the
States of Western Europe. Pushed on by the
continued seizures of countries and pressure
blocs fromn Moscow, the Western States of
Europe, with despatch and unanimity, entered
into the treaty of Brussels on March 17; 1948.
At the time the treaty was signed, the
President of the United States volced his ful
support of it, and this parliament joined in
the plaudits that were extended to the signatories. The United States pledged help to
this union, but Canada was the first to envisage a similar union of ail those countries that
are the bulwark of democratic freedom in the
areas borderlng on the North Atlantic. Speaking on June 11, 1948, the Right Honourable
Mr. St. Laurent sald:
The best guarantee of peace today is the creation
and -preservation by the nations of the free world.
under the leadership of Great Britain, the United
States and France, of an overwhelming preponderance of force over any adversary or possible combination of adversaries. This force must not be only
military; it must be economie; It must be moral.
On the same day that the Prime Minister
made this statement, the Senate of the United
States was considering a resolution put forward by Senator Vandenberg. It contained
six objectives of United States foreign policy.
Three of these objectives related to the proposais that were later adopted in the
Atlantic Pact.
At the beginning of my remarks I said
I could nlot now express the same hope for
world co-operation that would have been possible on almost this very day in 1945. But on
July 6 of 1948 a new hope of co-operation
was born. Although it was flot worldwide in
its concept, it off ered assurance that the
principles of the United Nations could be
applied in those areas that shared that hope.
On that date representatives of Belgium,
Canada, France, The Netherlands, the United
Kingdom and the United States met in
Washington. At this and subsequent meetings, these countries, joined later by Norway,
framed the pact that has been tabled in this
house. I can say to you today, without f ear
that my words shall contradict the feelings
of my heart, that the basis of this treaty is
not its wording or the constitutional means
by which each nation adopts it, but rather the
moral trust .that we place in each of its
intended signatories. Naturally this treaty
will be adopted by proper constitutional
means in each country.
This marks the beginning and not the end
of each of our obligations. It offers a consolidated plan of action through whlch we
can discharge those obligations for world
peace that we already f eel are morafly ours.
Borne Hoa. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to delay the bouse at any great
length. Honourable members will realize that
this resolution only precedes the final agreement that will be drafted at Washington
next week, and which will be placed before
the Canadian Parliament for consolidation.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: And ratification.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And ratification. This is
the first time that Canada has entered into
an agreement of this kind. I listened attentively to most of the addresses on this resolution in another place, and I think they
sounded a note that should be heard. Like
the members of the other place, I am wholeheartedly behind this agreement. All but
two members in the House of Commons voted
for this resolution, and I believe the vote
in this house will be unanimous. This is as
it should be. At the same time attention
should be drawn to what is actually being
done. By this act, Canada is signing a military
agreement with the United States, five
European countries and any other country
that may join later. Whether we like to call
it a military agreement or not, this is what
it amounts to. I do not wish to say anything
that will lend strength to any feeling of
opposition that may exist in the United
States, especially in the Senate of that country, but I think it should be fully realized
that the moment we ratify this treaty we
have signed a military alliance to be used in
case of an emergency. I do not think there is
any doubt about that. I am not opposed to
the signing of the treaty, but I claim that we
as Canadians ought to recognize the obligation that will be ours.
Honourable senators, I had the great
honour and pleasure of attending the United
Nations Organization. I went with high hopes
but returned dispirited. I came away feeling
that one nation and its satellites were determined to use the United Nations Organization as a propaganda agency to preach their
doctrine ail over the world, and, failing that,
to wreck any body that might be organized
for the purpose of maintaining world peace.
Canadians will never forget the sacrifices
that ber men and women made in the First
and Second World Wars, nor will they forget
how, with utmost abandon, she threw ber
capital and resources into the fight to preserve
world freedom. I may be wrong, but I believe
there would not have been a Second World
War had the United States been a member of
the League of Nations after the First World
War.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In saying that, I am not
criticizing the United States. Perhaps her
policy was right.

Honourable senators, when this resolution
was being discussed in the other place many
speakers indicated that the present world
unrest is not a struggle between nations, but
a struggle between ideologies; one side
believing in the dignity and importance of
man, and the other believing in the dignity
and importance of the state. This last doctrine is contrary to ail our democratic ideals.
It is opposed to our belief in freedom of
religion and our belief in Christianity. The
peoples of the western world are being
challenged by the peoples of another part of
the world.
If, in private life, you have a family, you
try to teach them the principles that will
enable them to live the happiest and most
satisfying life when they reach manhood and
womanhood. What is important is, not that
they should learn how to acquire wealth or
other material possessions, but that they
should realize the value of the good life for
themselves and their families.
We of the western world believe in our
present form of civilization, and when, as
happened recently in France and in Italy,
men declare that in the event of war they
would give the Russian army a welcome to
their country, we are shocked. We cannot
understand that attitude. We think that any
person whose liking for Russia is as strong
as that should go and live in that country.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not say that in an
offensive way at all, but it seems to me that
if I were convinced that the Russian system
of government was the best, I ought to go to
Russia to live. If I did not like life in
Winnipeg, for instance,Hon. Mr. Howard: You would move to
Sherbrooke.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I might move to Sherbrooke, but hardly to Montreal or Toronto.
I think the pact offers the best means of
meeting present difficulties. I am glad that
it is brought under the operation of the
United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The United Nations Organization acts as a safety valve by providing a
forum where men can say things that ought
to be said in the interest of world welfare.
The United States is a very important member
of this organization, and no other nation
knows the United States as well as Canada
does. Therefore our responsibility within the
organization is very great. I recall the
occasion in 1946 when the right honourable
gentleman who is now Prime Minister
delivered before the Council of the United
Nations the address to which my honourable

MARCH 30, 1949
friend referred. On the preceding day we
members of the Canadian committee had
diseussed the matter, and when the address
was given we were proud that Canada had
men capable of framing such a policy and of
presenting it so ably to the world. We felt
that the representatives of all other countries
would realize that we had no selfish interests,
and that we were advocating only what we
considered to be for the good of all.
I am going to vote for this motion. I want
our fellow Canadians to know that we are
committing them to the principles underlying
the United Nations Charter, the principles
for which this country stands, and which in
essence are freedom and world peace. If
peace cannot be preserved by this agreement
it cannot be preserved at al. That is the
solid truth. We know what the situation Is
now. I am quite frank to admit that the war
of 1914 came as a surprise to me. Perhaps I
was what was known as a Victorian, for in
those days I did not think there would be a
war at all. But nobody was surprised when
war broke out in 1939. Germany had erected
a tariff against the importation of our wheat,
because she wanted to encourage home production of wheat so that her people would not
be starved out as they were in 1918. That
was a clear indication that she was preparing
for war. And regardless of what Russia may
say, there is no use denying that she is getting ready for war. She might not go to war.
She will not go to war if she knows that the
nations opposed to her are able to stop her.
That is why I am so strongly in favour of
this pact. It is the one ground for hope of
peace in the world, the one ground for hope
that our grandchildren wil not have to go
through the kind of thing that we and our
children went through from 1939 to 1945. I
ani wholeheartedly in favour of this agreement, as I trust that our people in all parts of
the country will be.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the adjournment
of the debate.

The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On Routine Proceedings:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have been advised that in another place it
is not intended to proceed with the motion for
the approval of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and the motion for approval
of the convention of the World Meteorological
Organization until after the Easter recess.
While of course that need have no effect upon
what we do here, I would prefer not to proceed with these motions until after they have
been taken up in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.

THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right
Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief Justice
of Canada, acting as Deputy of His Excellency
the Governor General, would proceed to the
Senate chamber this day at 5.45 p.m., for the
purpose of giving the Royal Assent to certain
bills.
PERSONAL CORPORATIONS TAX
INQUIRY

On the orders of the day:
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
would like to direct the attention of the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) to a
question which I asked when speaking in the
debate on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne two weeks ago today. I
stated that when the new Income Tax Act
was passed last session the law with regard
to taxation of personal corporations was
completely changed. Many of us did not
discover the change until later on. We had
asked officials whether there was a change
and were assured that there was not.
Hon. Mr. Howard- That is right.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Towards the end of the
year, however, many people had practically
to wind up personal corporations in order to
avoid heavy taxation.
At that time the
Minister of Finance announced that there
had been no deliberate intention to change
the law, and that he would recommend the
bringing in of an amendment to rectify the
matter at the next session of parliament. The
question I asked two weeks ago was whether
such an amendment would be brought down
this session. As I pointed out, I did not
want the matter to be forgotten.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I must apologize to
the honourable deputy leader of the opposition.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I believe my honourable
friend was absent from the house when I
referred to the matter.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not recall that it
was brought to my attention. I would suggest that when an honourable member has
any particular matter on which he requires
information he would do well to state his
inquiry in a memorandum, with a brief
explanation, which can be passed on to the
minister or department concerned.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I referred to this question in my speech, but I shall be glad to give
my honourable friend a memorandum.

INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
in response to an inquiry of March 22, made
by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) with respect to, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I am
tabling an order in counicil passed under the
authority of section 43 of the Customs Act,
as enacted by section 4 of chapter 2 of the
Statutes of 1930 (second session), as amended.
This order in council authorizes the Minister
of National Revenue to fix the value for duty
of knitted wool gloves and mitts, not entitled
to entry under the British preferential tariff.
I arn tabling also the minister's fixation of
value for duty made under this order in
council.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
also asked if there were any other price-fixings for tariff purposes. At the present time
there is just one other fixation o! value in
force. It affects the value for duty of onions,
n.o.p.-not otherwise provided for. This, however, will cease to be effective on April 1,
1949.
I have handed to the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity a copy of these documents.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, 1
thank the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) for this information. I understand
that Order No. 1, deals with the general agreement, and wml stand until after the recess.
The information acquired is ta be used in
the debate on tariffs and trade when that subject comes before us.

-world of western demacracy. And in the
miiddle is a world composed of many millions
-af men, largely ini Asia and Africa, wha have
not yet been directly exposed ta the canfl.icts
between the first two worlds, and who have
flot yet aligned themselves with the one or
the other.
Honourable senators, we live i a dangerous
world--dangerous because af the continued
attempts af Soviet Russia ta subvert and
undermine, bath from wlthin and without, the
.democracies of western Europe. Look at the
-autstanding example ai Czechaslovakia, a iew
months ago. If Russia should succeed in
.subverting and undermining the demacracies
-of western Europe one by one, be very sure
that this continent wiil be next an the list.
That, basically, is the reason for the pact
which we are asked today ta approve. It is
an agreement between cauntries, an bath
sides af the North Atlantic, who believe in
democratic freedom, ta stand tagether for
their mutual deience against a cammon
-danger.
No hanest man, reviewing the terms ai
this prapased treaty, could read into it one
single word which implies attack or aggressian. It is purely and salely defensive; and
-as has been pointed out, it is strictly in confarmity with article 51 ai the United Nations
Charter. When I say that no honest man
caulci read a word ai aggression into this
treaty, I do flot include in my definition ai an
honest man the occasional communist or
fellow-traveiler an this cantinent, ta whom
truth or lies are ail the same so long as they
serve the party line; nar do I include such
addle-headed and frustrated idealists as Mr.
Henry Wallace.
This, I say, is solely and entirely a defensive
pact. But let us not deceive aurselves. It
cantains seriaus, castly, and passibly dangerous obligations, ta which the people af
Canada will bind themselves when aur representatives sign this treaty, as I hope they
will, in Washington a few weeks hence. Let
me emptiasize what I say by reading the flrst
paragraph ai Article 5 ai the treaty, which
I think cantains the nub ai the whole matter:
The Parties agree that an armed attack against
one or mare of themn in Eurape or North Arnerica
,shail be considered an attack against them all; and
consequently they agree that, If such an armed
attack occurs. each af themn in exercise of the right
of individual or callective seif-defence recognized
by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,
will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
farthwith, Individually and in concert with the ather
Parties. such action as it deemis necessary, Including
the use af armned farce, ta, restore and maintain the
security of the North Atlantic area.
Bluntly, what do these words mean? The
European cauntries which are ta be parties
ta this pact are: Great Britain, France, Italy,

31. 1940
Belgiuni, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Norway, Denmark, and-as we heard only
this marning-Iceland and Portugal. Article
5 means that an armed attack by the Soviet
Union against any one ai these countries is
an attack against Canada, and that we are
pledged ta resist it. I knaw that the article
leaves it ta us ta take such action as we
may deem necessary in the circumstances,
and that it wrnl be for this parliament ta
decide the nature and extent of that action.
But, honourable senatars, that does nat
afford me a very great measure ai satisfaction. As canditions are taday, when
nations go ta war yau cannot be in a hall
war or a partial war or a limited-liability
war; it is all or nathing.
Hon. Mr. Haîg: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the present so-called
cold war should ever become a hot warwhich God lin His infinite mercy farbidCanada wrn be in it up ta the hilt.
There are, of course, short af war
between nations, circumstances in which
Canada rnight be called upon ta take some
military or other action under this treaty.
Honaurable senatars will observe that while
Articles 3, 5 and 6 refer ta "armed attack"
against one ai the parties ta the treaty, those
articles are careful not ta limit such armed
attack ta an armed attack from autside the
threatened
country. Further, Article
4
declares that the parties will consult tagether
"whenever, in the opinion ai any af them,
the territorial integrity, palitical independence or security ai any af the Parties is
threatened."
Let me emphasize the wards "palitical
independence". Those wards, and the broad
sense in which the wards "armed attack" are
used in Articles 3, 5 and 6, are abviously
designed ta meet the case ai a cammunist
uprising, actual or threatened, within any
of the member countries, withaut any avert
intervention iram outside. That, let me point
out, is a tactic which the cammunists sometimes use when they see that it offers them
a prospect af success. It was a tactic which
they used successfully in Czechaslovakia; it
is a tactic which they tried ta use-sa far
unsuccessfully-in Greece. Mare than once
they have threatened ta emplay the same
methad in Italy, and I believe also in France.
Sa it may well be that under this treaty,
when it is signed, Canada will be called upon
ta help in thwarting, even in putting down,
a rebellion lin one ai the member cauntries,a rebellion which, depend upon it, will have
been provaked and helped by the Cominform,
but with which, afficially, the Soviet Union
will have no connection whatever. In such

SENATE
a case, of course, the danger of an international war will always be present, but war
itself will not necessarily be the result.
I said a few moments ago, and I now
repeat, that in signing this treaty Canada
will be undertaking serious and perhaps
dangerous obligations. That there may be
danger, nobody will be so foolhardy as to
deny. But I invite honourable senators to
reflect on the alternative, and to consider
our position if we refused to sign this treaty
or if there were no such treaty as this for us
to sign. Would that not involve far greater
dangers, and would it not be likely in the
long run to bring us to inevitable catastrophe?
Surely we of the western democracies
are today in the same position as that which
faced Benjamin Franklin and his fellowmembers of the Continental Congress just
before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when he used the famous phrase:
"We must, indeed, all hang together, or most
assuredly we shall all hang separately." I
submit that the western democracies must
now hang together, and make it abundantly
clear to the only possible aggressor that an
attack upon one of them is an attack upon all.
We do not need to look very far into the
past for an example of the alternative to this
policy of hanging together. Surely it was the
policy, or rather the lack of policy, with
which the democracies faced the menace of
Hitler's Germany a short ten years ago.
There was no common purpose and no common defence. We know the result. Austria
and Czechoslovakia were picked off and
destroyed one by one while the other
democracies looked on apathetically. Yes:
and the apotheosis of democracy in those days
was the futile and rather pathetic figure of
Mr. Neville Chamberlain with the umbrella,
scuttling off to Munich and coming home to
mumble meaningless words about "peace in
our time". Peace in our time, within a few
months of the outbreak of the greatest war
that the world has ever seen! It is interesting
to speculate whether, had there been an
Atlantic Pact in those days, the Second
World War would have broken out at all.
One may safely say that if it had, it would
have started under conditions far more
favourable to the democracies than those
which in fact faced Britain and France when
finally they had to take up arms in defence
of Poland.
So I say that while this policy to which
Canada commits herself when she signs this
treaty is, perhaps, a dangerous policy, it is
far less dangerous than the only alternative.
The western democracies have learned their
lesson; they are going to hang together, and
by hanging together they stand a very good
chance of averting the perils which face them

individually. I sincerely believe that this pact
will lessen whatever chances of war there
may now be. Think of it, honourable senators!
Three hundred million free men, banded
together in their own defence, with the
resources of the North American continent
and of Western Europe at their disposal, are
a formidable force; so formidable, indeed,
that the prospect of their being attacked
seems rather remote, so long as they remain
united. For that reason, I welcome this
treaty as a step towards ultimate peace.
I may be wrong. No one can tell today
what the future will bring forth; but whatever the future may bring I say that as of
today, and under the conditions of today, it is
as much in the interest of Canada as it is the
duty of Canada to become a party to the
treaty which we are now invited to consider.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I have listened to
his excellent address, and I should like him
to elucidate a certain point, if he can. If the
Atlantic Pact had been in existence in 1837,
would the United States, in Great Britain's
interest, have been required to intervene in
the rebellion of that year in this country?
Hon. Mr. Moraud: That is a $64 question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It has a real sting. It
is not a futile or frivolous question at all.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am sure that the
question is by no means a frivolous one, but
it is so new to me and so entirely outside the
line of thought of most of us that I am quite
unable to answer it without reasonable time
for reflection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am somewhat concerned about the obligation placed upon
Canada to intervene in the internal troubles
of other countries. This is perhaps the danger
point in the Pact. There is no question about
our concern in the external difficulties of
another country, but as to intervening in the
internal troubles of another nation, our
obligations will be vexatious and difficult to
meet.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
wish to sincerely congratulate the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
for his illuminating remarks. I hope that his
address will receive the wide publicity which
it fully deserves, so that our public may
realize more completely the consequences of
the proposed treaty which we are now discussing. Like the honourable senator who
has just spoken, I believe that it is in the
interests of Canada, and that it is the duty of
Canada, to enter the defensive alliance which
is now being formed.

MARCN Si. 1949
We are now being called upon ta sanction
the principles of the proposed North Atlantic
Treaty. In the ather.place, except for twa
members of the Bloc Populaire-and I respect
their convictions-the whole apposition joined
with the governrnent in approving this treaty.
Thus ail aur various political parties have
given ta the Atlantic Pact an alxnost unanimous approval.
This is indeed a most
encouraging and inspiring example of national
unity.
Yes,*aur elected representatives from eight
provinces agreed completely--except for twa
dissenters from Quebec. One of the dissenters
is my personal friend, the leader of the Bloc
Populaire, and the ather is bis follower and
my good confrere, Mr. René Hamel. While
I do not share the views of these two outstanding natîonalists, I recagnize that bath of
them are perfectly sincere, and that they have
the courage of their convictions. It is true
that their opposition took at first the f orm of
a motion ta adjourn, but nevertheless, they
did in fact vote against the principle of the
Atlantic Pact, and they have been praised for
their action by the official of the Nationalist
party, Le Devoir.
On this point 1 wish ta raise a question of
privilege which affects this bouse as well as
the other place. In Le Devoir of March 30
some camments were published on the almost
unanimous approval which the other house
gave ta the resolutian naw before us. The
article is entitled "Bloc-Notes," which ini
English means a memo pad or writing pad,
and it is signed by "Andre L." Under this
transparent nom-de-plume the brilliant yaung
nationalist chieftain refers ta last Manday's
debate in the other house in ternis that I
consider it my duty ta lay before this house.
In daing so, my first abject is ta protect aur
hanour, in advance, against similar attacks.
My second abject is ta convince honaurable
senatars that suitable steps should be taken
at once ta properly infarmi aur Canadian
people at large and-in my own province
particularly-to dispel the propaganda which
certain jaurnalists are already carrying on
against the Atlantic Pact.
In his article, under the sub-title "Courageux", Andre L. flrst states that the vote was
almost unanimous. In the next paragraph
this very talented young writer adds-and I
translate:
A debate in which almnost everybody agrees creates

an atmosphere of over-enthusiasm.
The French word is "emballement", and it
applies ta a runaway horse. As we say in
French, "Prendre le mors aux dents." I shal
repeat the sentence:
A debate in whlch almost everybody agrees creates
an atmosphere of over-enthusiasm; a state of collective hysterla is sometimes reached.

It is not necessary for me to qualify an
expression so, degrading as "collective
hysteria" when it is applied to the representatives of our Canadian democracy.
I translate again:
Those who dare stand against the immnense
mai orlty from, ail parties seem provisionally to be
wrong. This is particularly true on a question
where the moat diverse and most delirious passions
are aroused.
I have every reason to hope that in this
house there will be absolutely unanimous
approval of the principle of the Atlantic
Treaty. I arn convinced, honourable senators, that none of us intends ta stand idie' if,
after we give such a vote, we are described
as voting under the influence of the "most
diverse and mast deliriaus passions".
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: But I corne now ta the
most offensive extract from the article which
I arn discussing. In a paragraph in which.
Andre L. seeks ta praise the two nationalist
dissenters, he states:
Two members had this courage the day before
yesterday: Mr. Maxime Raymond, representing
Beauharnois-Laprairie, and Mr. René Hamel, representing St. Maurice-Lafieche.
It is not of littie
ment; it consoles us for the cowardice of the others
and honour is saved.
Honourable senators, I deeply resent this
allegation of cowardice against those who,
like myseif, favour the defensive alliance of
the North Atlantic Pact as a pact for peace.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: My excellent friend the
nationalist leader in another place represents a canstituency which forms part of my
I
own senatorial district, de Salaberry.
respect himi as a perfect gentleman, and I do
flot contest his right ta advocate palicies
which for a decade I myself have opposed.
I do not in any way hold my life-long friend
responsible for the article published in Le
Devoir. I direct my criticîsm. against Andre L.,
and I consider that I have the right ta protest against his assumption that natianalists
like himself have a manopoly of courage.
As a senatar representing the same section
of aur Canadian carnmunity that is represented by the nationalist leader in another
place, I have the right ta vote in this hause
accarding ta the dictates of my conscience.
No pressure was ever brought ta bear upon
me whenever during the last war I supported
the policy of the Liberal goverament, and
no pressure is being exerted in the present
case. I wish to assure my nationallst friends
from my own native province that it is not
necessary for my leader ta try ta influence
me. As a Liberal and a true Canadian 1 amn
able ta think for myself, and once I have

SENATE
reached a conclusion I act accordingly,
whether it pleases the nationalists or not.
I do not pretend to be any kind of a hero,
but those who were with me in the air force
and in the army know me, and they say that
there is no "yellow streak" in me. I do not
write as well as Andre L., nor am I as eloquent as he is. I am a plain, blunt man, and
in my case deeds, humble though they may
be, count more than my speeches or my writings. After all, I served overseas, and I
shared some hardships and a few dangers.
I do not need lessons of courage from anyone,
and I cannot tolerate being branded directly
or indirectly as a coward. My record can
surely be compared to that of those who
believe that isolationism is the only form of
patriotism suitable for the consumption of
my French-speaking fellow countrymen.
The nationalists may call us again "followers"-"suiveux", in their French slangbut we French-speaking Liberals will continue
to follow the path-suivre le sentier-shown
to us first by Laurier, then by Lapointe and
now by St. Laurent.
Those who are now opposing the Atlantic
Pact, and who on this issue are opposing our
distinguished Prime Minister, Mr. St. Laurent,
are the heirs of persons who opposed Laurier
and Lapointe, and who always refused to
accept the patriotic creed of those great
leaders, from whom we learned that the first
duty of a true patriot is to provide for the
security and defence of his native land and to
keep the aggressor away from his shores and
his territory. Laurier and Lapointe already
belong to our national history. I trust that
their broad and really Canadian patriotism is
now accepted and professed by the overwhelming majority of my French-speaking
fellow countrymen.
Yes, the spiritual legacy of a sincere and
effective love for our only motherland,
Canada, and the inspiring faith which we
have inherited from Laurier and Lapointethis sacred doctrine, of which our present
leader is the living incarnation-we are fully
determined to defend courageously and to
apply without cowardice and at any costsans couardise et coûte que coûte. We have
not forgotten the teaching of those who are
no more with us physically, but whose
generous thoughts live for ever deep in our
hearts and souls. After having followed
them to the grave we are still their followers
-suiveux,
if you wish-and because we
follow in the footsteps of our glorious leaders
we are anxious to secure for our beloved
country without further delay an adequate
system of defence against any eventual
aggression.

The nationalists know as well as we do
that the peace of the world is now at stake,
that a threat of tragedy has been hanging
over us for months and months. They are as
much opposed as we are to atheistic communism, but they do not propose any practical
means for resisting and confining the spread
of communistic domination.
The very gifted writers of Le Devoir appear
to believe that force can be resisted by other
means than force. For instance, André L.
deplores the fact that the Atlantic alliance
is an adventure which divides the world into
two hostile camps: Une aventure qui consomme la division de monde en deux camps
hostiles. But can the nationalists deny that
countries within the red orbit already form
an armed camp with a most powerful army
available for any military operation? The
Atlantic defensive pact is simply an application of the old maxim of Julius Caesar:
If you want peace, be prepared for war.
Le Devoir expresses the belief that in the
past defensive military alliances have failed
to prevent wars. Its editors assert that we
will go to war because, though we speak of
peace, we enter the race for armaments.
They pretend not to favour appeasement,
which is a capitulation always to be renewed
until the triumph of communism, but they
denounce the race for armaments as leading
to war and to the suicide of mankind. They
conclude that there should still be time to
get out of the rut of war, and that a more
Christian and civilized solution than suicide
should be found.
For thirty years-and I know what I am

talking about in this respect-the nationalists
have criticized and denounced so-called
imperialism and militarism, but they have
never offered a constructive suggestion for
the preservation of peace or the defence of
our country. Do they believe that the use
of force is wrong, even when resorted to in
self-defence? They do not question the good
faith of the framers of the Atlantic Pact, but
their so-called reservations amount to a
destructive criticism of this plan-the only
one that we have been able to find-for the
preservation of peace through collective
security. Countries which have a wellestablished policy of neutrality, such as
Belgium and Portugal, will sign the pact and
adhere to its provisions. These peace-loving
countries do not believe in automatic wara favoured expression of the nationalist
writers-but they know that pacifism invites
aggression. Should one of the twelve states
subscribing to this defensive alliance be
attacked, under the provisions of the treaty,
each of the other eleven states would also
consider itself to be the victim of aggression.

MARCH 31, 1949
United we stand; divided we fail. Such
solidarity, for defence purposes only, is the
best safeguard which the leaders of our
democracies have been able ta devise for the
protection of aur Christian civilizatian. Our
own Prime Minister is a jurist of international repute, and I believe that ta hlm is
due the credit for having conceived this
defensive pact. As the peaceful leader of
the Canadian people, this great FrenchCanadian statesman and patriot urges us ta
approve the principle of the Atlantic Treaty.
He is supported by the members of ail political parties, except two nationalists. On this
vital question-a question of 11f e or death
for Canada-practicaily the whale population
of Canada will accept with calm and resolute
determinatian the principle of collective
security as the best means of preventing war.
We are as anxiaus as we have ever been
ta secure a just and fair peace, a Christian
peace. But peace is indivisible. It does not
depend only on the actions af those wrho, like
ourselves, believe in the divine teachings of

APRIL 1,~ 1949
NORTH ATLANTIC PACT
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

on the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable seridiors,
during yesterday's debate on the Nortn j.dlantic Pact rny honourable friend frorn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) asked of me a
hypothetical question which at the lime I was
unable to answer. Rlis question was to this
effect: Had the United States, Great Britain
and Canada been members of the Atlantic
Pact in 1837, would the United States have
been obliged to intervene on behalf of the
Canadian government of that day to help
quel the rebellion in Upper and Lower
Canada?
I arn quite sure that what my honourable
friend wanted to know was the extent of
Canada's obligations under the Atlantic Pact
to intervene in the internai aiffairs of other
countries which are signatories of the pact.
That, of course, was a question I could not
answer on my own responsibility. But since
yesterday I have learned that it was answered
by a good authority, Mr. Dean Acheson,
Secretary of State of the United States, during
a press conference in Washington last week.
I refer now to the report of that conference,
which appears in Time Magazine of March 28.
It reads:
Another newsman asked: "Would aggression
against a country, by infiltration within the country,
13e an armned attack?' If it were purely an internal
revolutionary activity, said Acheson. that would
not be an armed attack. But if it were a revolution
inspired, arrned and directed from the outside. that
would 13e a different matter. The pact, hie sald,
didn't spell it out and shouldn't-when you corne to
real situations you ought to 13e able to have some
latitude in deciding them.

Honourable senators will note that Mr. Dean
Acheson drew a distinguishing line between
internai revolutions, which relate purely to
the internai aiffairs of a country, and internai
revolutions which are provoked from outside.
To refer back to my honourable friend's
example, I think anyone will realize that the
revoîts which took place in Upper and Lower
Canada in 1837 were purely matters of internai
polities, and had no connection with anything
outside the country. That is the best answer
1 can give my frîend.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: As a matter of
personal priviiege, 1 wish to thank the senator
from Inkerman for his explanation, and say
that he was much too modest in the way he
gave his answer today. I think I owe hirn an
apoiogy for asking a hypothetical question,
and for falling to phrase it fuliy. When I
put my inquiry to him yesterday I thought

his mind would at once jurnp to the staternent
which he had aiready made, narnely:
.. Articles 3, 5 and 6, are obviously designed to
meet the case of a comrnunist uprising, actual or
threatened. within any of the mnember countries,
without any overt intervention frorn outside.
* So i may well be that under this treaty.
whe'n*it Is signed, Canada will 13e cafled upon to
help in thwarting, even in putting down. a rebelon
in one of the mnember countries,--a rebellion which,
depend upon it. wifl have been provoked and helped
by the Cominform. but with which. officiafly. the
Soviet Union wiil have no connection whatever.

I was referring to that staternent.
Hon. Mr. Hugossen: 1 arn afraid I was not
quick enough on the uptake.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I add one sentence?
When I regard the situation today i China,
where a revolution said to have been instigated by Russia and about which I know
nothing, except that it is an agrarian revoit
against serious abuses, is going on; when my
mind reverts to the Spanish rebellion, in
which Russia played some part, and to other
like events; and when I try to project my
mind into the future, it seerns to me obvious
that the one feature of this pact which may
cause us real concern in limes to corne is the
tacit implication in the passage about which I
have just read-an implication which Mr.
Acheson .has noted, which I saw in the agreement, and which newspapers generally have
discussed. I repeat that it may cause us difficulties and troubles in the years ahead. On the
other hand, one rnust take a certain amount of
risk in entering into an agreement of this kind,
especially when it is a military agreernent,
and I voted for this pact because I supposed
that in years to, corne our successors, or maybe
we ourselves, will exercise some common
sense as to obligations under the treaty to
intervene in the internai aif airs of other
nations.
NEWFOUNDLAND-CANADA

UNION

INAUGURAL CEREMONIES

Hon. Mr. Robertson: As honourable senators know, this is the day upon which Newf oundland becomes part of Canada, and il
seems to me, that, in view of the very historic and impressive ceremony which took
place this morning, it would be both wise and
appropriate that a record of those proceedings,
including the addresses made both here and
in St. ,John's, should be incorporated in and
becorne part of the records of the Senate of
Canada, and that those charged with the
responsibility of recording our proceedings
should collaborate for this purpose with those
who are similarly engaged in the other branch
of parliament.

Hon. Mr. Haig: We on this side heartily

done by the Senate to date. Those who are

would be delighted if this work were taken
out of the hands of the Senate. We do this
work because we deemn it a service to the
public that we must perform. AUl I want is to
have parliament decide one way or the other
on this matter. If we are to do this work,
which involves considerable expense to the
petitioners and much labour by the Divorce
Committee, members in the other place
should flot vote against these bis after the
Senate has passed them.
Those of us who serve on the Divorce
Committee do flot want to do this work. I
can understand a person whose religious
persuasion is different fromn mine objecting
to having to do it, and I have every respect
for his views. However, that leaves the work
to be done by the rest of us. I arn not objecting to doing it, but I say that the leaders
of parliament, if they want us to continue
this work, ought to say so; if they do flot,
they should so inform us. So far this session
we have heard the evidence in 185 cases.
In order to do this the committee has had
to split into two sections and sit four days
a week-Monday, 'tuesday, Friday and Saturday-commencing at 10.30 in the morning
and sometimes continuing welI into the afternoon. That in itself is nearly a week's work,
to say nothing of ail the other sessional
duties that we have to attend to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.

SECOND READING

The Hon. th. Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
H-onourable senators will observe that this
is a further request for interim supply, and
covers the probable additional requirements
consequent upon the entry into confederation
of the new province of Newfoundland. The
bil takes much the same f ormn as the one
relating to interim supply which was presented to the house a few days ago. It asks
for one-slxth, or two months' supply, and certain specified additional amounts to cover
special immediate requirements which have
arisen.
Section 2 of the bill makes provision for
the sum of $5,227,302, which represents onesixth of the amount of the items to be voted
for the fiscal year; section 3 provides for
being sevenamrounts of $5,411,631.17,
twelfths of the total figure of $9,277,082 set
fofth in schedule A. This is an unusually
large proportion.
The first item in schedule A is:
To authorize and provide for payment in such
amount as may be necessary in respect to, those
matters supplementary to the Terms of Union of
Newfoundland with Canada, specified in paragraph
XXIII of the note dated December 11, 1948. of the

In recognition of your entry into our confederation I have much pleasure in presenting

coming within the relevant provisions of the
Canadian Citizenship Act adds to his status
as a British subject that of being a Canadian
citizen, and that he or she is entitled to ail
rights, powers and privileges, and subject to
ail obligations, duties and liabilities to which
a natural-born Canadian citizen is entitled
or subject.
I can assure you, sir, that ail the people of
Canada join with me in extending to the

Canadian family.
Sir Albert Walsh (Lieutenant Governor of
the Province of Newfoundland): Hon. Mr.
Gibson, on behalf of the people of Newfoundland I am happy to welcome you on the
occasion of your visit to Newfoundland to
take part in this ceremony as the representative of the Prime Minister and the people of
Canada.
The certificate of citizenship which you
have presented to the people of Newfoundland, through me, shows that ail of us now
have a new status, that of Canadian citizens,
which entitles us to rank equally with ail
other Canadian citizens throughout ail
Canada. This new citizenship is in addition
to the status which we have enjoyed in common, the status of British subjects. I am glad

SENATE

The union we celebrate today was flot
concluded without the most careful consideration by representatives of both Canada and
Newfoundland.
In 1947, when the delegation from your
national convention came to Ottawa to sec if
a satisfactory basis could be found for the
politîcal union, we were pleased. We had no
hesitation in making it clear that we would
welcome union. But we recognized that the
decision was one for you to make yourselves.
We were happy when you, the people of
Newfoundland, decided by a free vote that
you favoured union. And we are happy
today to have the union completed.
In welcoming you as partners in the Canadian nation, we of the rest of Canada feel
that you are joining a good country, a country
of which you will corne to be as proud as we
are. Canada is a country with a distinctive
character and distinctive qualities.
Our
nation in its origin was a union of two great
races that have joined their talents without
rnerging their identities. The union includes
peoples of many other national origins. Our
country covers a vast area between two oceans
with great differences of soul and climate and
industry. But from end to end of Canada
there is an ever-deepening sense of community of interest and of purpose. We have
a common pride in being Canadians. We are
picud of Canada's past and of the record of
cur rmen and women in peace and in war. We
aire co-nfident of our country's future. We
leel *hat our nation can hold its head high
among the nations of the world.
With the pleasure we have in welcorning
you of Newfoundland as Canadians there is
mingled a feeling that you could have joined
no better nation. The formai union is cornpleted today. But the real union-the union
of hearts and minds-took place in the recent
terrible war in which Canadians and Newfoundianders were so closely joined.
It is not only in war that we have corne to
know and appreciate the qualities of the
people of Newfoundland. During the centuries since the original settiement of Newfoundland the people of your island have
met the forces of nature, on sea and on land.
ln adversity

and

in prosperity

they

have

developed qualities of heart and spirit for
which they are renowed.
Some of those qualities are referred to by
your native son E. J. Pratt, who has written:
This is their culture, this-their master passion
0f giving shelter and of sharing bread,
0f answering rocket signais in the fashion
Of losing if e to save it. In the spread
0f time-the GiIbert-Grenfell-Bartlett spantThe headlines cannot dim their daily story,
Nor calls like London! Gander! Teheran!
Outplay the draina of the sled and dory.

The fact that Newfoundland has hecome a
province of Canada will not cause you to lose
your identîty, of which you are ail so justly
proud.
A Canadian province is not a mere administrative unit 0f the central government. Each
of our provinces has its own distinctive political existence and political traditions. Within
its field of jurisdiction the provincial legislature is as sovereign as the parliament of
Canada is within its field. The provincial
legislature has jurisdiction over education;
property and civil rights; charitable, local
and municipal institutions. To the province
also falîs the primary responsibility for public
health and social welfare.
In entrusting such jurisdiction to the province, the Fathers, in their wisdom, left to the
province the primary responsibility for the
protection of the family, the school, the
church. the very foundations of our society.
Our constitution thus assures to each province the preservation of its ancient traditions,
its own culture and aIl those distinctive characteristics which add variety and colour to
our national if e.
Newfoundland today enters confederation
as a full and equal partner with the older
provinces. It is my hope and belief that in
the future the advantages 0f the union will
be increasingly recognized hy the great
majority of the people of Newfoundlland and
of ai] Canada.
We are completing, our union at a trcubled
time for ail peuple xvho believe ln freedom
and democracy and -,ho hope for peace. The
free and peace-loving- countries of the north
Atlantic community are at the present
moment taking steps, within the charter of
the United 'N!ations;, to band themselves
togelher for greater security against any
would-be aggressor.
Newfoundland is in the very centre 0f the
north Atlantic community. Canada as a whole
occupies a large part 0f the north Atlantic
area. The nations of that whole area will be
more secure in the new north Atlantic association. In the same way, Canada and Newfoundland will have greater security in being
bound together in federal union. From today
ail Canadians, old and new, will work as one

to preserve peace and to win security.

And

in a world where free people can work in
security and peace, the opportunities for the
enlari.ed Canada, with its ten provinces, are
immense.
Among our people there are some who still
do not have that standard of life we think ail
Canadians should have.
There are some

We shail flot cease to work

APRIL 1, 1949
for a larger measure of p-rosperity and
security for ail oui' people in ail parts of
Canada.
1But while there is yet room for improvement, there is no country in the worid where
that improvement is more possible, or, indeed,
more certain. The wealth of Canada is the
Weaith of half a continent. The talents and
the energies of our people are those of free
men who work together for the benefit of ail.
Our wealth, our talents, our energy, and our
co-operation constitute the promise of our
country.
The people of Newfoundland, who have
today become citizens of Canada, will share
with the people of the rest of Canada in the
work and in the wealth of our nation.
Together we shall strive, under God's guidance and with confidence in oui' future, to
build a greater and a better land.
In conclusion I welcome as a colleague in
the goverament of Canada the Honourable
Gordon Bradley, of Newfoundland, who this
morning was sworn to the privy coundcil and
becomes Secretary of State of Canada.
(Translation):
Let the Newfoundlanders of yesterday,
Canadians of today, be formally assured, that
when I welcome thema in English, I express
the feelings of their new compatriots whose
maternal tongue is French, as much as of
those whose maternai tongue is English.
They now belong to a nation whose two
main elements both hold dear the traditions,
culture and language of their ancestors, and
that should stand as a guarantee that by joining a new nation, they will lose nothing of
their own ancestral heritage, whose assets on
the contrary, will be added to the commonwealth, for the common benefit of al
Canadians.
(Text):
Mr. Bradley will now address his feilow
Canadians in ail the ten provinces.
Hou. F. G. Bradley (Secretary of Sie):
This is a day which will live long in North
American history. It is a day of fulfilmentfulfilment of a vision of great men who planned the nation of Canada more than eîghty
years ago; and as we stand here on this day
of destiny our thoughts fly back through the
years to those far-seeing men of the pastMacdonald, Brown, and Cartier in Canada,
and Carter and Shea in Newfoundlandwhose vision was broader and deeper than
their times, and whose conception of a united
British North America has just become a
reality. In fancy we can see them now, bending over this scene in silent and profound
approval.
That they were right is not now open to
question. The history of the Canada they
29091-21J

began in 1867 leaves no room for doubt upon
that point; and the logic of these eighty years
indicates that a stiil greater and better
Canada for us ail lies in the future.
For me this day transforms a dream of
long ago into an accomplished fact. For many
years I have felt that our similar independence was unsound; that the close proximity of
my native island to the mainland constituted
a clear caîl for union with Canada; that the
allegiance to one crown, which we have
always shared with Canada, beckoned us
westward; that the identity of our principles
and traditions pointed in the same direction.
Ail these considerations led irrevocably to
but one conclusion-that Macdonald, Brown
and Cartier, and Carter and Shea, were right;
and I arn happy that this day bas come in
my time.

I suppose that this union will make hardly
any appreciable impression upon the lives of
the citizens of Canada of yesterday, but to
the people of the new province the changes
will be deep and abiding.,
In some matters they will lose that
exclusiveness of control of their own destinies
which they have heretofore enjoyed, and in
return they acquire a share in the councils of
a great nation-the new Canada-of which
they have become a part; they must accustom
themselves to a new system of governmentthe federal system-which links them wîth
ail Canadians and yet assures them of a continuance of that identity of which they have,
always been so proud. They will experience
new channelings of trade, new standards of
social legislation, new methods of taxation,
and a new measure of responsibility as citi-zens of the new Canada.1

The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second

reading of Bill Y-7, an Act respecting a certain patent application of Walter Oliver
Beyer.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to remedy a difficulty which bas
developed with respect to an application for
a patent filed in the Canadian Patent Office
on July 17, 1947. Because of the disruption
which occurred during the war years, persons
who had filed applications in the United
States and in England were not able to file
in Canada within the time limit prescribed
by the Patent Act, and it became necessary, in
1947, to amend that Act. The new section
28A extended the time for filing applications
for patents to November 15, 1947, provided
that a request for such extension was made
before May 15, 1948.
A patent was granted in the United States
to the petitioner in the bill before us, and
through his Canadian agents he filed an application in the Canadian Patent Office within
the time specified in the amended Act.
Through some inadvertence, however, the

agents who filed the application failed to
include in it a request for an extension of
time, as required by section 28A. Because of
the large number of applications filed in the
patent office, it was not until after May 15,
1948, that this particular application came to
the attention of the Commissioner of Patents.
The application was in order in every other
respect, but the commissioner-who is not
opposing this bill-is bound to comply with
the provisions of the Act.
The amending legislation passed in 1947
was based on an understanding between
Canada and the United States and Great
Britain that similar legislation for the same
purpose and under the same circumstances
would be passed by all three countries. By
this means people would not lose their rights
because of war conditions.
I may point out that the extension of time
for late filing does not extend a patent
monopoly. The period of time which elapses
between the original date of filing and the
extended date is deducted from the term of
the patent. That is to say, the life of the
patent will be shortened by that period,
whatever it may be. As a result, when this
bill is passed the life of the patent will be for
only thirteen years instead of the usual
seventeen years. There is nothing further
I can add.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are there any other
bills in like case?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know whether
there are any others or not. I may say that
when the bill reaches committee the Commissioner of Patents will be in attendance
and will indicate that be is not opposing the
measure.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Hayden moved that the bill be

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As honourable senators
kmow, the supplementary estimates have.not
yet been pmssed in the other place. Some
hope is expressed, however, that the legisiation will reach us today. Two alternatives
are now open to us: we can adjourn forthwith until 10.15 this eveming; or we can
adjourn during pleasure to reassemble at the
caîl of the bell at approximately 4.45. 1
believe it is the wish of the house that we
adjourn during pleasure. Accordingly, I move
that this house do now adjourn durimg pleasure to reassemble at the cali of the bell at
approximately 4.45 this afternoom.
The Senate mdjourned durimg pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson. Homourable senators,
as there seems no likelihood that the bull
which we are awaitimg will reach us in time
for us to deal with it and to have Royal
Assent this mfternoon, I have no choice but
to move that the Semate adjourn now to
reassemble at 8 o'clock this evening.
The Senate adjourned until 8 p.m.

At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
fromn information I have received it seems
highly unlikely that sufficient progress will
be made in the other place to enable us to,
have the supplementary estimates before us
in time for Royal Assent tonight. Under the
circumstances I have no option but to ask
the house to adjourn until tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m. I shaUl not be in the house
tomorrow as I have to fulfil an engagement
of long standing.
A few days ago I announced that it did not
seem likely that anything of importance
would corne before the Senate until a week
after the House of Commons resumed sitting
on April 25. Since making that announcement my attention has been drawn to the fact
that an adjournment to that date would delay
the introduction of certain pipe line bills.
In fact, the advertising for one of these bills
will already have been completed. While 1 do
not like to ask the Senate to sit when there
is no public business before it, I think the
representations made to me are sufficiently
urgent to j ustify me in asking honourable
senators to return on the same date as the
House of Commons. Therefore, tomorrow or
whenever the Senate adjourns, if I am mot
here myseif, the Deputy Leader (Hon. Mr.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 232, an Act for granting
to His Mai esty certain sumns of money for the
public ser-vice of the financial year ending the
3lst March, 1949.
The bill was read. the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Wîshart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, under the
circumstances, and at this late hour, I do flot;
intend to give a detailed explanation of this
bill, which covers supplementary estimates for
the past year. I should like, however, to refer
to some of the items involving expenditures of
$1,000,000 or more. I would remind honourable senators that I am quite willing that these
items be discussed at any future time.
The total of the estimates is $100,898,573.87,
an amount which does not exactly agree with
the estimates as printed in the bill. The item
of $5,500 for old age pensions has been withdrawn, reducing the original figure of $100,904,073.87 to the total I have already given.
Last year's estimates, which were brought
dowin at approximately this stage of the session
of parliament, amounted to slightly less than
$80 million.
The largest individual amount in the estimates before us is $33,532,741.12, which is to
cuver the deficit o! the Canadian National
Railways. This figure is materially higher
than the $16 million o! hast year. A further
item o! $2,933,240.38 covers the deficit in the
operation o! the Trans-Canada Air Lines.
The item o! $3,250,000 covers a boan to the
Department of Trade and Commerce to provide for the purchase and placing in storage
o! strategic reserves of materials.
An amount of $2,500,000 is set aside to provide for advances to Canadian Arsenals
Limited, to increase the working capital fund
for the operations of the company. As honourable senators know, the Canadian Arsenals
Limited is engaged principally in the manufacture of munitions for the armed forces.
The sum, of $3,894,493 is set aside as the
government's contribution to the permanent
forces pension fund. I am advised that a
further amount is required for this purpose
because o! the additional sum that must be
contributed by the government as a resuit o!.
increased salaries for -those in the armed.
forces.
There are items amounting to $19,622,583
for demobilization and conversion, to provide
for additionah expenditures against the
authorized commitment program in connection with the orderly establishment of the
defence forces, navy, army and air services,

SENATE
on a peacetime basis and to authorize further
commitments for future years of $11,708,000.
An amnount of $1,218,833.10 is required ta
reimburse the Canadian Wheat Board in
respect of carrying charges and other incidentai expenses incurred by the board in
connection with wheat sold for domestic
requirements pursuant ta order in council
P.C. 3222, of July 30, 1946.
An item amounting ta $17,200,000 is
to reimburse the Canadian Wheat Board in
connection with flour or food containing
wheat for human consumption in Canada. As
honourable senators know, until recently
there wvas in effect a provision whereby
the difference between the price at which the
Wheat Board bougbt wheat and the price at
which the wheat was sold ta millers was paid
by the government. That practice has been
discontinued, and this item covers the
amount payable by the government for the
past year.
An amount of $4,454,250.44 is provided ta
reimburse the Canadian Wheat Board for the
deficit incurred through the operations of
the board on the 1947 crop account, flax
division, for the period from August 1, 1947
ta July 31, 1948.
Then there is an item of $3,103,000, being a
I urther amount required ta meet the governrnent's contribution ta the Unemployment
Insurance Fund. There having been an
increase in the contributions by individuals,
this amount is ta caver the proportianate
increase in the government's contribution.
For removal of apple trees in the Annapolis
Valley there is the sum o! $1 million. Honourable senators will realize that this bas
te do with the accelerated programt that was
tenbarked upon some time ago for the
removal of apple trees in the valley, the
purpose being ta change over ta production
cf a ty pe of apples more likely ta be suitable
tc market requirements in the future.
These items that I have mentioned amount
te $92,709,141.
The balance is made Up of a large number
of small items as to which I do not intend ta
detain the bouse tonight. I assure honourable
senators that should any questions arise, they
mnay be discussed wben further supply bis
are before us.
The motion was agreed 10 and the bill was

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
in response to the reasonable request of the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
bills should be printed before they are considered by this House, I would state that
three of the bills relating to the pipe lines are
before us, and I am advised that the others
will be received in due course. I should like
to commend the employees of the Printing
Bureau, who spent a good deal of time and
effort last night in order to have these bills
ready for honourable senators this morning.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading
,of Bill G-8, an Act to incorporate Western
Pipe Lines.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
not a stranger to this house. It will be recalled that it was introduced a year ago in a
somewhat different form, and received second
reading. The present modification of the
forn of the bill arises from the fact that
general pipe line legislation has been passed
in this house and is now before the other
branch of parliament.
Consequently, the
powers asked for in the bill now before us
are limited compared with those asked for in
the measure introduced last year. The general
pipe line bill follows the pattern of the Railway Act; therefore it is unnecessary for me
to deal with it on this occasion.
Hon. Mr. Leger: My honourable friend
would be out of order if he did so.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No. I shall say to my
honourable friend, who is an experienced
parliamentarian, that I think I could find
ways to refer to the other bill and still remain
within the rules of procedure.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I doubt it too.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am quite sure that the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) will agree that the incorporators under
this bill are well-known and reputable citizens of Winnipeg. They seek authority to
build an interprovincial pipe line, and while
the place of commencement and the termini
of the pipe line are not mentioned in the bill,

they will be shown in the application that will
have to be made to the Transport Board when
this measure becomes law.
The head office of the company is to be
located in the city of Winnipeg.
The company seeks the right to operate
aircraft and airdromes for use in its undertaking, this right being restricted entirely to
the needs which may arise in the operation of
the proposed pipe line. The company also
seeks power to establish and maintain an
inter-station communication system of telephone, teletype, telegraph and radio, for use
between various points along the proposed
pipe line. The company also seeks power to
aid in the construction of dwellings for its
employees, a power which is customarily
given. Certain provisions of the Companies
Act are made to apply. As will be more fully
explained when the bill gets to committee,
these powers are necessary in the undertaking.
The other provisions of the bill are quite
in keeping with the powers that are needed
by the company for the carrying out of its
operations.
I do not think it is necessary to give a more
detailed explanation at this stage. The bill
will undoubtedly be sent to committee, where
the sponsors will be able to give whatever
additional information is required by honourable senators.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
in speaking on this bill I find myself in a
rather awkward position. As leader of the
opposition, it is my duty to examine bills
carefully and thoroughly, and to require proof
of what are said to be facts. At the same
time, as a senator from Manitoba, I am
anxious that this bill should be passed; just
as anxious, indeed, as is the honourable
gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
I know the promoters of the bill, and while
I presume that there are as fine men in other
parts of Canada, I do not think there are any
more genuine people to be found anywhereeven in Toronto or Montreal.
As I say, I am in an awkward position,
because I have to look upon the bill from two
sides. I think the best thing for me to do at
the present time is to say nothing about it
one way or the other, but to wait till the bill
gets to committee and then see how it appears
to me after we have more detailed information about it.
I think honourable senators, that three of
the western provinces, probably four-and
maybe western Ontario as well-are very
desirous that this bill and the other pipe line
bills that are to come before us should be
passed. This is the first time that our western part of the country has had an opportunity to develop an industry on an economic-

APRIL 26, 1949
ally sound basis; that is to say, where we have
not only the natural production but the
organizatron and everything else required to
make an economic success of the venture.
We have an opportunity to develop cheap
gasoline and oil, and various by-products.
Personally, I am very enthusiastic about the
future of Alberta, by reason of the oil discoveries there. I believe that the undeveloped
oil resources of AIberta are just being tapped
now, and that in time it will prove to be one
of the richest, if not the very richest, of the
provinces of the Dominion.
However, as in all new developments, certain problems arise. Oil production in the
West will mean stiffer competition for the
coal produced there. If oil is allowed to flow
by pipe line from Alberta to Fort William, as
I believe it will, there must naturally be a
reduction in the consumption of western coal.
In the city where I have the honour to live
there are three or four central heating plants
whose principal fuel is the cheap lignite coal
of the West. If oil can be brought in from
Alberta at the price that I think will obtain,
the coal consumption in my city will of course
be cut very considerably.
I want to congratulate the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon his
decision to have the Senate called back from
the Easter recess a week earlier than had at
first been intended. He put the blame on
me. All I did was announce on February 7
that there would be a Dominion election on
June 27.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have been accused of getting information from the leader of the
government, but he did not know whether
June 27 was a Sunday or a Monday.
Hon. Mr. Howard: You did not tell us
where you got the information.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was quite willing to come
back to Ottawa yesterday to do my part in
putting through the bills now before the
house. The people of western Canada have
asked us to do everything possible to see that
the bills are fully discussed in this house and
receive proper consideration in committee,
and that they reach the other place in time
to be passed before Parliament dissolves.
We in this country will face some difficulty
in the future in the marketing of our products.
No matter what government comes into
power after June 27, its biggest problem will
be the marketing of our grain and other
products of that nature. By the passage of
the measures now before this house there will
be established an industry which will give
employment to thousands of people. It matters not what world conditions exist, there

will always be a market for the products
which this industry will produce. I am not
one of those who fear a depression, but I do
think we are going to face a buyers' market.
I am, therefore, strongly in favour of an
industry which will provide considerable
employment.
My honourable friends on this side of the
house who come from the Maritimes, Quebec
and Ontario, perhaps do not appreciate the
full significance of this legislation, but the
four western provinces are heartily behind
it, and I am sure my friend from Thunder
Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson), who, will benefit
by it, realizes what it means. If we give the
people of the West the representation they
deserve, these bills will be carefully considered here, and will be sent to the other
place in time to become law before the dissolution of parliament.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I was rather disturbed to hear my
honourable friend the leader opposite say that
there was a conflict in his mind between his
duty as leader of the opposition in this house
and his desire for the passage of this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As a western senator.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I see no reason for such
a conflict. As a judge has a right to rely upon
counsel to produce evidence, cite law, and
present argument, so has the government the
right to depend upon the opposition to scrutinize and analyze legislation, and to point out
weaknesses in it, if there be any. The duty
of the leader opposite is to inquire; not to
oppose when opposition is not justified. I
think we should be able to rely on the opposition in this house to inquire carefully into
these and all other measures, and if approval
is justified, to approve of them; if not, to
oppose them. I see no reason, therefore, for
conflict in the mind of my friend, or why
he should withdraw any of the scrutiny
which is expected of him.
I should like to make one point in connection with the particular bill now before
us, and it will apply also to similar measures
to follow. The leader opposite has just said
that he hoped the prices to be charged for
the gas and oil products would be reasonable,
or words to that effect. It seems to me that
when legislative power is sought to enable
companies to construct works of this kind,
which are monopolistic in character, some
inquiry should be made as to the price at
which the commodity is to be sold. Pipe
line companies are given special privileges,
such as the right to cross roads and expropriate lands. They are in their nature public
utility corporations, and it may be that some

SENATE
provision should be made with regard to the
use-or perhaps the abuse-of powers
that we confer on them. I know that a corporation of this kind has not the last word
by any means; considerable authority in connection with these matters is in the hands of
the provincial governments. But when parliament incorporates a railroad, the company
is subject to a careful and complete supervision of its rates by a government board. Is
any such protection provided for the public
in the case of these oil companies? They
secure a monopoly of a particular source of
oil. Thereby they become private owners of
natural resources, gifts of the Creator, which
they themselves have not created but have
only discovered or bought from the discoverer: they exercise exclusive rights and
powers: they are not subject to competition in
the sense to which the ordinary producer or
trader of any commodity is exposed to it: and
I wonder whether the requisite and proper
steps are being taken for the protection of
the public in relation to the sale of the
product.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: It had not been my
intention to say anything on this particular
measure, which is similar to a number of
others that will come before the Senate this
morning, but as the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has referred to the potential
effect in providing employment, I think I
should mention that in my province, at any
rale, there is great concern amongst the coal
miners about unemployment. They fear that
if gas is carried to Saskatchewan and Manitoba, particularly to the larger centres, they
will be deprived of markets for coal, in which
they have done considerable business over
many years. I am not arguing that progress
along this line can be retarded simply
because of that feeling of apprehension; the
government of Alberta has to decide how
much gas shall leave the province; but my
suggestion is that the federal government,
in association with the provincial government, should urge the National Research
Council to make a study of the purposes for
which coal can be used. We know that in
Europe coal is utilized in many other ways
than as fuel. If there is a threat of unemployment in the coal mining industry in
the province of Alberta, which possesses
great coal resources, and is, I believe, the
greatest coal-producing province in the
Dominion-the two governments
should
endeavour to find other means of using that
coal, so as to continue the employment of the
men who are now working in the mines of
the province.
As I have said, my remarks are prompted
by the suggestion that these developments
Nviil provide considerable employment,

because I can see where they are likely to
create also a very considerable amount of
unemployment.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If there is no further
discussion, I should like to say a word about
the point raised by the honourable member
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Under the general pipe lines bill the Board
of Transport Commissioners will have the
same authority over the rates chargeable for
the transmission of oil and the services rendered by an oil transmission company as
they have in respect of railway rates. Part
III of the general bill deals with gas lines.
It is true that in respect of gas lines similar
supervision is not exercisable by the Board
of Transport Commissioners, but that omission, I understand, is for a very good reason.
The distribution of gas in a city like Winnipeg, for instance, the rates to be charged
for it, and the conditions of distribution will
be effectively under the control of the
Public Utilities Board of Manitoba, and the
company will have to justify its rates and
its services to that board, which holds public
hearings.
In regard to the other end of the operations, which is the gathering end, I am
informed that the conditions of purchase of
gas will be subject to the laws of Alberta,
whose very wise and necessary conservation
laws will apply to this company when il
gets into operation and begins to buy gas in
any part of the province. So the point
raised in this connection, which is very
important and very pertinent, is, I think,
adequately covered.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
SUSPENSION OF RULE

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lamberi moved the second
reading of Bill B-8, an Act to incorporate
Interprovincial Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I should
like to point out at once that this bill relates
to oil and not to gas. It concerns a surplus of
Alberta oil that is ready to satisfy the
domestic Canadian market and the economic

APRIL 26, 1949
needs of this country in its search for foreign
markets. I feel it is a distinct honour to be
associated with a bill that may be regarded
as pioneer legislation in the development of
natural resources that have already attracted
the attention of the world to the great
province of Alberta.
While we rejoice with Albertans in the
splendid future that has been opened up to
them by the rich discovery of oil in the
northern part of their province, we are also
conscious of the great national value of that
oil. Oil is now being discovered in Alberta
in quantities that far exceed the requirements of the western provinces, and there
is the prospect that it will even exceed the
requirements of the whole of Canada. Therefore this natural product becomes a very
important factor in estimating Canada's international trade, particularly in its relation to
the financial exchange considerations that
exist between this country and the United
States.
This legislation is based upon three bills,
one of which is the Pipe Lines Bill that was
passed by this house just before the Easter
recess, and which is now being considered in
committee in the other place. As honourable
senators know, the Pipe Lines Bill was based
upon the Railway Act, therefore the first part
of this present bill must be read in conjunction with that Act. The last part of the
bill must be read in conjunction with the
Companies Act, which bas to do with the
incorporation of a company, its financing,
and its borrowing power.
I do not intend to take up the time of the
house with any detailed consideration of
sections 7 to 11 of this bill, which relate
particularly to the financing of this corporation. Certain sections of Part III of the Companies Act have been eliminated and other
sections of Part I have been applied. The
object bas been to make the financing of the
capital structure of this company more
flexible and to facilitate its borrowing power.
Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the bill are formal.
Section 3, which deals with the capital stock
of the company, should be of particular interest to this house, because it indicates the
potentiality of the undertaking that is represented in this legislation.
The principal concerned with this legislation is the Imperial Oil Company. This
company bas been more closely associated
with the development of oil in Alberta than
any other agency. It has secured a much
larger area of leaseholdings and has discovered more oil than its competitors.
Parliament has been given an estimate of
the future possibilities of the pipe line
company. As honourable senators will notice,
the capital stock of the company wih be $200

million divided into four million shares
having a par value of $50 each.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will my honourable friend
permit a question? I do not know all the
people mentioned in paragraph one of the
bill. Are they al officers or directors of the
Imperial Oil Company.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think I am correct
in saying that al the people whose names
appear in section 1 are definitely connected
with the Imperial Oil Company.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I see that all the officials
are from the city of Toronto, and that section
4 provides that the company may, by bylaw,
change the place where its head office is to
be situated. The honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) bas
referred to the jurisdiction of the provincial
governments in connection with pipe line
legislation. If this bill becomes law, would
the Government of Alberta be able to do anything to nullify it?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think this is the first
bill to come under the provisions of the pipe
lines measure that we passed earlier this
session. The interprovincial distribution of
oil, like the interprovincial distribution of
any other natural product in this country,
is a matter of federal jurisdiction. I suppose
it would be possible for the province of
Alberta, through control of its own natural
resources, and under that section of the
British North America Act which deals with
property rights, to place restrictions upon
the distribution of oil elsewhere. However,
I think it stands to reason that the province
does not want a great surplus of oil lying
around ready to be burnt, as happened in the
case of the Atlantic-Pacific wild well at
Leduc. That danger always exists where
there is a surplus of inflammable products.
I think the economic reasons involved are
also obvious. I have no reason to believe
that anybody in Alberta would not encourage
to the utmost the construction of a pipe line
that will give a free outlet for this product
that is being found in increasingly large
quantities in the northern and southern parts
of the province.
In placing the capitalization of this company at $200 million, the present estimate
of the possible cost of the future construction
and extension of this pipe line bas been taken
into consideration. The first and immediate
need in connection with this work will be a
line from Edmonton to Regina, and after that
to Winnipeg. The estimated cost of the line
from Edmonton to Regina is $30 million to
$35 million. Costs of constructing the line
farther will depend upon factors relating to
available markets, and particularly to the
eompetitive factor in those markets. Pro-

SENATE
jection of the line to Winnipeg is necessary
because of refining facilities there. Of course,
if oil production is to proceed apace in those
wonderful areas of northern Alberta, it is
necessary to reach refining centres.
The estimated daily usage of oil in western
Canada at present is 60,000 barrels, and the
daily refining capacity of the refineries there
is roughly 55,000 barrels. It is conservatively
estimated that before the end of this year the
production in the Alberta field alone will be
100,000 barrels a day, so Alberta will have
a daily surplus of 40,000 barrels available for
distribution through this pipe line.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the honourable senator a question? When he spoke of
the consumption being 60,000 barrels a day,
what area did he have in mind?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I was speaking of the
western provinces, from Manitoba to British
Columbia. Their present daily consumption
is 60,000 barrels.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Is that the three prairie
provinces?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The three prairie provinces and British Columbia. The daily consumption in the whole of Canada at present
is approximately 290,000 barrels. From
present indications it is not at all extravagant
to say that this field has every promise of
producing eventually more than enough oil
to supply all the needs of Canada. That is
three times as much as the productive
capacity that is definitely indicated for this
year. I am not saying that Alberta oil will
flow eastward within the boundaries of
Canada to supply the needs of the central
and eastern provinces. In order to be economically produced and distributed, Alberta oil
will have to find its most economic markets.
It is no secret that the surplus production
will find a market in the western and central
parts of the United States. At present the
exact point at which the pipe line will cross
the international border is not known, but it
will probably be either at the head of the
Great Lakes or in the vicinity of Minneapolis,
at the head of the Mississippi River.
In any event, the factors in connection
with this development are so fundamental
and simple that they really need no elaboration to members of this house. It should be
pointed out, however, that the benefits which
will come to local consumers in middle western Canada are also important, for of course,
as the quantity of oil and gas distributed
through the pipe line is increased, competitive
factors will come into play and local consumers will be able to purchase these products
at lower prices.
The whole project of producing crude oil
in Alberta and finding wider distribution for

it through this pipe line can be simply
described as, first, a means of permitting the
movement of Alberta oil into new markets,
at the same time maintaining a fair value to
the producer and providing incentive for further exploration and, in the second place, as
a means of opening up such additional markets that the consumer in the areas tributary
to the producing field will benefit by the
lower competitive price. All the surplus oil
from Alberta may eventually find its way into
the central and western areas of the United
States, and if this happens the quantity of
oil that is now being shipped to Western
Canada frorn the east would be more economically distributed along the Atlantic coast and
in Eastern Canada. As the general supply
would be larger, consumers of oil throughout the country would stand to benefit.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask if there is any
arrangement whereby the reflning of this
crude oil will be done entirely in Canada?
And if so, where would the refining plants
be located?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The gasoline consumed
in Canada is being refined here now, and
this would continue to be done. Surplus crude
oil would of course be sent outside the country. At the present time there are refining
plants in western Canada at Edmonton, Calgary, Regina and Winnipeg. What the refining capacity of these plants may be in the
future I cannot predict, for that will depend
upon factors relating to the business.
I think I have said all that it is necessary
for me to say just now. I have made no
reference to the sections of the Companies
Act incorporated in the bill, as I think an
examination of those sections would be more
appropriately made in committee.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
the bill now before us and other similar bills
are very important. We all are aware of the
circumstances which make these bills necessary, and it seems to me that it might be
well at this time to ventilate certain ideas.
For instance, can anyone conceive of a government-controlled industry having the initiative to carry on exploration and do all the
other preliminary work required to bring
about the success of a great development such
as is now under way in Alberta? What is
happening in this country is similar to what
bas taken place in the great republic to the
south of us during the past several decades.
On this continent, where the standard of living is high and the development of resources
extensive, I think we can be assured that
free industry is creative and desirable.
There is perhaps some concern because of
the threat of big business. I never was
opposed to big business as such, but I like to

APRIL 26, 1949
see a distribution of industry. There are
times, however, when we should be most
thankful for big industry with resources to
explore and do things that otherwise could
not be accomplished. As you know, healthy
big industry is made possible by many people
all over the country with confidence enough
to put their money into development projects.
To that extent I think the Imperial Oil Company should be congratulated for its successfuI developments in the province of Alberta.
The senator who proposed this bill has said
that it is pioneer legislation. That is of
course true, but it is also progressive legislation. The measures now before this house
are for the purpose of making these natural
products of gas and oil available and thus
more saleable to the people of Canada and,
I hope, to the world at large. In considering
the piping of these products to the head of
the lakes, the importance of the development
of the St. Lawrence waterways to the industrial life of the country flashes across my
mind. Because of the far-reaching effect of
these measures we should attempt to make
them models of legislation, giving proper
privileges to those who are risking capital,
and who with technical skill are doing the
things that should be done for the development of our natural resources. At the same
time the legislation should be such as to
properly serve the people of Canada, in keeping with present-day ideas and methods.
True, the establishment of these pipe lines
is monopolistic, in the same way that the
tramways system of the city of Ottawa is
monopolistic. For instance, two roads cannot
parallel each other too closely, because it is
not economic for them to do so. But with
this monopoly should go control, so that while
the investors are assured of fair returns, no
unfair advantage is taken or undue privilege
given.
I have been connected with legislative
activities since I first entered the legislature
of Nova Scotia, thirty-five years ago. I took
part in the discussion of the British Empire
steel legislation and many measures affecting
the production of coal in that province, and
I know how careful we must be not to give
too much power to promoters. Companies will
always ask for more than they should get.
Rarely have I seen a company come to a
legislative body and not ask for everything
possible. It is very important, therefore, that
in a moment of enthusiasm we should not go
too far. I remember that in the Nova Scotia
legislature, when the British Empire Steel
Company was being formed, it was pointed
out to us that we were on tidal waters and
that the company could trade with South
Africa and the world at large; but I do not
know of much export trade having resulted
as time went on.

Few of us know very much about the bills
now before us, and we should not take too
much for granted. These bills are being
introduced in the Senate, and will go to the
other house. Let us give the lead to that
body in a way that is not narrow or parochial,
but let us see that the public interest is protected. We must appreciate that this oil
industry is for the most part located in one
province. It is important that that province
shall not over-tax the industry in such a way
that the rest of the people of Canada will be
penalized. We know that Alberta has received
millions of dollars from royalties, and will
receive millions more, and we must ask her
not to try to get too much from the rest of
Canada: we must be assured of a good article
at a fair price, and a proper distribution of
prosperity throughout Canada.
When I was visiting the West Indies
recently I spent a few days at Trinidad. My
combustion
internal
manufactures

engines. While in Trinidad I learned that
there was no market for my product there for
two reasons: first, the exchange situation. It
is very difficult to get Canadian dollars from
the West Indies for any product except food
-and second, the price of gasoline. I learned
that gasoline was selling in this producing
area at from 55 to 60 cents a gallon. I believe
that the same interests that produce gasoline
in Canada are operating in Trinidad. Why in
the world should gasoline sell there at from
55 to 60 cents a gallon? The price of crude
oil also is high. The reason for the high cost
of gasoline is largely due to taxation. But the
price there affects my associates and myself
operating in Canada, because we cannot sell
our products to the fishermen and the marine
interests in that country. Instead of using
gasoline engines the boatmen use big sweeps,
or oars, as they did years ago. With such
examples before us, I think we should be
most careful in our consideration of this legislation. We want legislation that is useful and
progressive, and that will be of benefit to all.
The very fact that it is of a pioneer nature
should suggest caution on our part.
Recently, on a ship on which I was sailing
I met an Imperial Oil man who was receiving
frequent reports about the developments in
Alberta. He was very enthusiastic about it,
and said that it was the greatest oil development that had yet taken place on the American continent, with perhaps one exception. He
said that it would mean that Canada would
be selling exchange to the United States,
instead of requiring an austerity program to
maintain her balance of trade.
I read an editorial in this morning's Ottawa
Journal to the effect that the supply of oil in
Alberta indicated that we were a fortunate
people. Americans I have met tell me that

SENATE
by reason of the iron of Labrador and the oil
of Alberta they look upon Canada as an ideal
place to invest their money, and they are sure
that a large investment of American capital
will be made in this country. Ail of these
things are very hopeful and pleasant at this
time.
We look back to the day when for transport
purposes we used horses, which required feed
from the farms. It presented a healthy financia] picture. Later the buying of automobiles
and of gasoline was a drain on our financial,
resources; we were con cerned about our
rnoney going to the United States for such
purposes, but now we have reached the time
when we may well produce iron and oùi for
our own industrial development. My deskmate said to me, "Until something happens to
gasoline we ought to be in pretty good shape".
I said, "The only thing that could happen is
the development of atomic power, and if
atomic power takes the place of gasoline we
shall stili be in a good position, because we
are wefl in the foreground in the development
of atomic energy". So at this morning session, with this legisiation going forward, we
can feel that as a country we are in a fortunate position, and can truly say, paraphrasing the words of the psalmist: we have a
goodly heritage, and our Uines have fallen in
pleasant places.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
-nay I congratulate the honourable member
from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) on
a safe return from his Marco Polo expedition,
and add that hie is very welcome back in this
cham ber.
In response to some of his remarks, I suggest that what is important is, not the powers
that are given to the company, but the use
that is made of the powers. There are those
who continually advocate the control of coinpanies through their corporate powers. It is
scarcely possible to do that. You do not control the speed of an automobile by limiting
the amount of its power; you permit power
to be supplied and expect the owner to exercise it lawfully, moderately and in the interests of himself and the public generally. So
it is with the incorporation of companies;
it is impossible to control their operations
through their field of incorporation. Later on,
no doubt, such legislation as is necessary
will be passed to provide for the points my
honourable friend has mentioned.
Many matters related to this bill might be
inquired into, but at the moment the only
Dbj ectionable thing I see is the naine Interprovincial Pipe Line Company. This naine
îs descriptive, but it is not distinctive. There
will be many interprovincial pipe lines. The
line fromn Montreal will be interprovincial;
perhaps ail the lines wi]l be interprovincial.

This bill appropriates to one particular coinpany an adjective which applies to ail or
nearly ahl companies of this kind; and
because there are many interprovincial. pipe
lines, the name does flot specificafly indicate this particular organization. I wonder
whether the department approved the name.
Even though it has, I think the committee
should go into the subi ect with care and
insert some word, perhaps between "Interprovincial" and "Pipe Line", which will have
the effect of distinguishing this company
from ail others of a similar type.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like teo ask a question which is of some importance, and the
answer to which I probably should know,
but I have not yet read the bill. I thînk it
is within the competence of the Transportation Commission to order running rights
over any railway in the country. I wonder
whether the saine principie is to be applied
in the case 0f pipe lines, so that other coinpanies which are producing oil in Western
Canada may be given authority to transport
their oil through this particular line.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In the pipe lines bill,
which is now being considered by a coinmittee in the other place, there is incorporated the feature 0f common carrnage, so
that the common carrier provision is applicable to this bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That answers my question.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The answer to the point
raised by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is this.
The bill was prepared with a good deal of
care and thoroughness, and is the resuit of
co-operation between the solicitors of the
company affected, our own lega] adviser,
and the legal advisers of the Department of
Transport and the Department of the Secretary of State, the idea being to make it as
workable as possible. There is something in
what my honourable friend says about having as individualistic a namne as possible;
but as lie knows, although we have tried
hard in another field, that of a Canadian
flag, it has been found difficuit to select a
distinctive emblem.
However, we will give some thought to
the question hie has raised, with a view to
having a name which. will appropriately connote the functions of the company.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DIVORCE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
would ask permission of the house to take up
at this time the last item on the Order Paper,
a motion for second reading of a divorce bill.
It is the last divorce bill that we shall have
before us this session. I went to see the
Chairman of the Private Bills Committee of
another place, and he said that if the bill were
passed by the Senate today it could be dealt
with by that committee at its next meeting,
which will be on Thursday morning. In the
circumstances I should be glad if the honourable leader of the government would consent
to my moving second reading of this bill
now.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig moved the second reading
of Bill A-8, an Act for the relief of Jessie
Kathleen Batiste Latter.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.

have already had here today?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, I believe they
are in the same form.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I think we can proceed with
the second reading.
Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill D-8, an Act to incorporate
Westcoast Transmission Company Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, not having
a copy of the bill before me, I am slightly
handicapped, but I may say that it follows the
form of the other pipe line bills.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will send my copy over
to the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is not possible for
any of these companies to become incorporated by letters patent, as the general Pipe
Lines Bill, which we passed here just before
the Easter recess, requires every pipe line
company seeking Dominion incorporation to
apply for a special Act of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Is this company one of
those whose stock is to have no par value?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes. Section 3 of the
bill provides:
The capital stock of the company shall consist of
five million shares without nominal or par value.

According to section 4, the head office of the
company shall be at the city of Calgary,
Alberta. The general powers sought by the
company are the same as those mentioned in
previous bills, namely, to construct and
operate pipe lines and to acquire lands under
the provisions of the general Act.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Is this to be a pipe
line for gas and oil?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes:
As in other bills, certain provisions of the
Companies Act are incorporated for organizational purposes.
It is also provided that
certain specific sections of the Companies Act

shall not be incorporated. The bill specifically
empowers the company to issue preferred
shares and to redeem such shares.

APRIL 26, 1949
In this bill, as in the other bills, there is
also a provision that the company may pay
a commission to any person subscribing for
stock. Some reference was made to this in
the debate on the other bills. Unless there
were such a provision in the bill the company
would have no power to pass a bylaw authorizing payment of commission.
When the bill is in committee the sponsors
will be present to give any further information required.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) was
explaining his bill, he told us what company
was sponsoring it. Will my honourable
friend give us similar information with respect
to the present bill? The names mentioned in
the bill mean nothing to me.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The sponsors of this
bill are a group of independent operators
who are at present engaged in exploration for
gas and oil in the Province of Alberta.
They are not associated with any of the large
or small oil companies.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: May I ask the honourable
gentleman whether these pipe line companies come under the control of a public
utilities board or commission in any province
and will the rates charged by the companies
and their issues of stock have to be approved
by any such body?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I understand that in
so far as gas is concerned the companies are
under the control of provincial authority, but
the pipe line business will of course come
under the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners. As to rates chargeable
for distribution by pipe line, a provision in
the general Act requires companies to file
their tariffs with the Transport Board.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: In Nova Scotia and, so
far as I know, in all other provinces, a business which is declared to be a public utility
is required to have its stock issues, distribution of profits and so on, approved by a
provincial board. We have been told that
some of the companies sponsoring these bills
distribute gas and oil. What I am more concerned about is water, which does not mix
very well with oil. In fact, the kind of "water"
I am referring to does not mix very well
with anything. My experience shows that one
of the main things we have to see to when
considering legislation of this kind is that it
prevents the introduction of too much "water"
and makes it possible for people to get value
for the money they put into the business.
The time to make sure about that in connection with these pipe line companies is now.
When the prospects of a company are very
rosy there is a great temptation to allow

"water" into its capital structure, and it must
be remernbered that every dollar paid for
stock which does not represent value will
cause the prices that must be paid by consumers of the company's products to be
higher than they should be.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Does that apply also to
products of the liquor commissions?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Certainly it does. As a
matter of fact, the most imprudent people are
the ones who pay a high price for liquor.
If I were giving a temperance lecture to
those who drink, I would say to them, "You
are very foolish, because on this liquor you
pay a heavy tax to the government, which
then spends your money for the benefit of
other people." I do not want parliament to
pass legislation permitting the capital structure of these pipe line companies to contain
watered stock.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I misunderstood the
question of my friend. I thought it was
directed to gas and oil, but since it refers to
"water" I think I can satisfy the honourable
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: "Water" is a result.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: All of the provinces
have certain security laws to which companies incorporated by special Act or by letters
patent are subject, provided of course they
aspire to any public financing.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: There is such a thing as
falling between two stools. Is it possible that
too many may have authority, with the result
that no one has the controlling authority?
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 234, an Act to amend
the Judges Act, 1946.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) to explain this bill.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honnurable senators, the
purpose of this bill is to authorize the Governor in Council to increase by not more than
six the number o! judges of the Superior
Court of Quebec.
Under section 48 o! the Quebec Code of
Civil Procedure, the Superior Court has
original jurisdiction in ail suits or actions
which are not exclusively within the jurisdiction of another court. In fact, as aIl my
confreres from my native province know, the
Quebec Superior Court is the successor of the
Conseil Souverain de la Nouvelle-France, or
Conseil Supérieur.
I believe that at the
beginning of the British regime it was also
cal]ed the Court of Common Pleas. At ail
events, it is our general court o! original
jurisdiction, and before it come the great
majority of ordinary civil cases.
At the present time there are only thirtyvieven judges serving on that court, and as a
resuit very serious delays are occasioned. In
ibe district of Montreal there are somne 5,000
cases waiting to be heard, and a large number
of tbem have been awaiting trial for a year
and a haîf or more. The shortage of judges
was referred to last Monday in the other
place by the Prime Minister himself, and
also by the Mînister of Justice.

In the 1948 session the Quebec Legislature adopted legislation for precisely the
same reason. Section 1 o! chapter 16 o!
the Quebec Statutes of that year authorizes
the Lieutenant Governor in Council to
increase to six the numnber of puisne judges
of the Superior Court o! the province. The
next paragraph in the section reads as
fo]]ows:
Notice of any decree passed under the preceding
paragraph shall be published in the Quebec Officil
Gazette.

The bi]] before us simply authorizes the
Governor in Council to appoint additional
judges, after the provincial legisiation just
re!erred to has been proclaimed, which so,
far has not been done.
Section 96 of the British North Amnerica
Act provides:
The Governor General shall appoint the judges of
the Superior, District and County Courts in each
province. except those of the courts of probate in
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Section 92 o! that Act gives the provincial

legislature exclusive jurisdiction in relation
to varieus matters, including. in particular,
the following, mentioned in subsection 14:
The administration of justice in the province,
including the constitution, maintenance, and organi-

zation of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil
matters in those courts.

From this it follows that the Quebec Legislaturc has authority to increase the nurrber o!
judges in the province.
The Bench and Bar in Quebec are desirous
that appointments should be made at the
earliest possible moment, in order to overcomne the acute shortage of judges
The
situation caused by this shortage is especiahly
bad in Montreal, where thousands o! cases
have been piling up and awaiting trial for
eigýhteen rnonths or more. Our people ai large
are enlitlled te have their legal disputes heard
by the courts without unreasonable delay. If
the present bill is not passed at this session,
the Governor in Council will not be able to
appoint additional judges unlil parliament
meets again. I arn sincerely convinced that
the interests o! justice make it urgently
necessary to have the bill passed at the

present session. By adopting the bill we shail
be doing everything in our power to remedy
the present situation, which speaks for itself
much more eloquently than I can do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable

gentleman a question? I am n ot opposing the
bill, but I have neyer been able to understand why there are so many Superior Court
Judges in the province of Quebec. In Ontario,
for instance, the total number of Supreme

Court Judges, including members of the
Court of Appeal and 0f the High Court o!

APRIL 27, 1949
Justice, is only about twenty-five. The province of Manitoba has five judges on the
Court of Appeal and six in the trial division,
the Court of King's Bench. Saskatchewan
and British Columbia each have, I think, five
judges on the Court of Appeal and seven
trial judges. I know that in the provinces
other than Quebec there are county or district courts as well as the higher courts; but
can the honourable gentleman explain to me
why Quebec has on its Superior Court Bench
three or four times as many judges as any
other province?
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I have not had an opportunity to study the system in other provinces,
but in Quebec even very small cases are
brought before the Superior Court. Some
people have the idea that the tribunal known
as the Superior Court of Quebec is an appeal
court. This is not so; it is a court of original
jurisdiction. Generally speaking, in districts
other than Montreal all cases involving an
amount over $200 come before the Superior
Court. Indeed, when I began to practise law
the Superior Court had jurisdiction over all
cases involving $100 or more. If we had
other courts to deal with claims up to $500
there would be a great reduction in the work
of the Superior Court. The only explanation
I can offer to the honourable leader of the
opposition is that our Superior Court is
required to decide many cases of less importance than those dealt with by corresponding
courts in the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Have you the County
Court system in the province of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Our system in Quebec is
entirely different from that in any of the
other provinces. Minor cases, involving
amounts below $200, come before the District
Magistrate's Court.
Hon. Mr. Leger: In New Brunswick and
the other provinces we have what are known
as County Courts.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: We have no such courts in
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think that a judge
drawing $12,000 a year is required to deal
with cases up to $500. County Court judges,
who are appointed in all the provinces other
than Quebec, are now paid a basic salary of
$6,600 a year, and I have often wondered
why someone in Quebec did not suggest the
appointment of County Court judges for that
province. In Manitoba we have eleven such
judges, with jurisdiction in cases up to $800.
It costs Canada an awful lot of money to have
Superior Court judges doing work that could
be done by judges of lower rank. The County
Court system not only saves money to the
public treasury, but as the courts are scattered
throughout the province litigants do not have

to travel long distances from their homes.
That system is much less expensive and more
satisfactory to litigants. In Manitoba we have
the Magistrate's Court, and what we call the
Small Debts Court, with jurisdiction up to, I
think, $200. Those courts are presided over
by magistrates appointed by the province.
The four western provinces have District
Courts which are close to the people.
As a lawyer, perhaps I should not speak
against this measure, but I do not honestly
believe that a man who hears cases involving
claims of $500 should be paid $12,000 a year.
That is not in keeping with the system in
other provinces. My friend from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. Leger) and the others, will
agree with that. I take this opportunity to
ask why the province of Quebec does not
attempt to remedy conditions and prevent a
jamming of business in its courts. Honourable
senators know that because of witnesses being
sick, and for many other reasons there are
sometimes long delays in getting cases on for
trial in a big city.
In the province of Manitoba we have six
trial judges and five on the Court of Appeal.
We could get along with three appeal judges,
but with five we get better judgments and
prevent many appeals being taken to the
Supreme Court of Canada. Our six trial
judges, while they are busy enough with
divorce cases and other business, are not
overworked. We have about one-fifth the
population of the province of Quebec, which
would mean that in proportion that province
would have thirty trial judges.
I wonder why Quebec cannot adopt the
system of county or district courts. As I have
said, it brings the courts nearer the people,
and is much more satisfactory. My suggestion is made with a view to reform and not
to changing the law. When a poor man has
to travel a long distance to the city to have his
case heard, he is scared out. Under the
system in Manitoba no one is scared out.
We have eleven districts, four in Winnipeg,
and one each in St. Boniface, Brandon, Morden and other places around the province.
Saskatchewan has the same system, but with
eighteen district courts. All of the people
have not the fighting spirit of my friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). The
people in Saskatchewan do not fight very
often, and there are too many courts. That
province could get along very well with nine
districts.

cial authorities, within whose competence it
is to determine the number of judges who
shail have jurisdiction in each district. The
government has decided that it is necessary
to have more judges to serve Montreal; and
ail the surrounding districts, which rely on
Montreal judges to go and sit in their courts,
have been supporting the proposai, because
judges have not been available to them to
render justice and make decisions.
As for the necessity of having more j udges
in Quebec than there are in some other provinces, I quite agree that the number in our
province is larger than in others. But the
reasons are obvious. First, in other provinces the Master does a lot of work in making
decisions in matters of practice, in rendering
justice in ex parte cases, and in drafting
judgments; whereas in Quebec the Master has
littie authority in these respects, because ail
practice work is handled by a judge. In
Quebec one judge is needed to hold practice

certain times of the year, especially in November, practically ahl of them are presiding at

f or the hearing of civil cases.
Under the constitution of Quebec, no judge
has authority, unless appointed by the
Dominion of Canada as a Superior Court
judge, to hear cases involving more than
$200. In 1867, when the constitution was
drafted, it was understood that ail judges of
the Superior Court would be appointed and
paid by the Dominion. As matters stood at
that time, the Superior Court was the court
of original jurisdiction in respect of ail cases
from $100 up. It was not until 1921 or 1922
that jurisdictîon was conferred upon provincial magistrates to hear cases involving $200;
and I believe that if the point ever came
before either the Supreme Court of Canada
or the Privy Council, it would be held that
the conferment of this jurisdiction was a
contravention of the British North America
Act. Some time ago the suggestion was made
that the province enlarge the jurisdiction of
its magistrates to include cases up to $400,
but the suggestion was regarded as so dangerous, constitutionaily speaking, that nobody
has dared to put it into effect.
No doubt the Dominion Government could
appoint what are known as county or district
judges, for whose salaries it wouid be responsible; but what would be the difference? Let
us say that their jurisdiction extended to $800.
This would mean that every month a Superior
Court judge would have to go to a district
to hear cases from $800 up, a County Court
judge would attend to hear cases from $800

down, and a magistrate under provincial
authority would be in the same district hearing cases from. $200 down. The total cost
would be tripled, the arrangement would be
otherwise unsatisfactory, and the amount to
be paid by the Dominion Government wouid
be just as much as it is today.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would the honourable
senator tell me what hours the judges sit?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: They always sit fromn
10 until 12.30 and fromn 2 until half-past four,
and if on reasonable grounds a judge is asked
to sit longer, I have neyer yet known one to
refuse. In that respect I believe the judges of
the province of Quebec set a very good
example.

FAMILY ALLOWANCES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 235, an Act to amend.
the Family Allowances Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators. I bave asked
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
to explain this bill.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, this bill is only a proposed amendment
to the present law, but it 15 of considerable
importance and interest to many Canadians.
Honourable senators will recaîl that the
Family Allowances Act was passed in 1944
and went into effect on July 1, 1945. It provided, on a rising scale, certain payments to,
mothers to assist in the maintenance of their
children. Under the Act parents are entitled
to receive a payment of $5 per month for each
child less than six years of age; $6 per month
for a child of six years or more but less than
ten; $7 a month for a child of ten years or
more but less than thirteen, and $8 per month
for a child of thirteen or more but less than.
sixteen, which is the limit.
I may usefuily refer to some of the wellknown statistics concerning family ailowances. The cost of the Act during last year,
ending March 31, was $264 million. As of
February 28 hast, benefits were extended to.
1,724,179 familles and invoived 3,873,268 children. The average payment to a famfly was.

SENATE
$13.25 per month, and the average payment
per child, $5.90 per month.
Honourable senators, the Family Allowances Act has proved to be one of the most
popular measures ever put on the statute
books of this country, yet I suppose that even
the most popular enactmnent can be improved
as Urne goes by and experience is gained.
The criticism that is rnost frequently made of
the Family Allowances Act is that the payments to larger familles are reduced. The
present law provides that there shall be a
reduction of $1 per month for the fifth
child, $2 per month for the sixth and seventh
children, and $3 per month for the eighth and
ail subsequent children. The various social
organizations interested in this legisiation
have repeatedly suggested that these reduetions be abolished and this is what the bill
proposes to do. It is feit that there is no
justification for them. It was thought at
first that it would cost less to raise the subsequent children in a family; that the unit
cost would decrease as the number of children
increased; that bulk buying and bulk cooking
would have its effect, and that the younger
children would be able to use the cast-off
clothing, school books, and s0 forth of their
older brothers and sisters. However, family
budget studies have proven this argument to
be unsound, and that the savings which I
have mentioned have been offset by the need
for additional accommodation. It has been
found also that family allowances do not pay
the entire cost of raising a child, and that the
parents still pay the major portion of it. The
more children there are, the more diluted the
family resources become. Salaries and wages
are in no way related to the number of
children in a family, and so the largest
familles have the greatest need.
Hlonourable senators, it will not cost a
great deal to correct this fault-which I regard
as an abuse-because, comparatively speaking, large families are not numerous. It is
true that big families seem to be more noticeable than others and are more often dîscussed,
but statistics prove that there are flot rnany
of them in Canada. The number of families
which will be affected by the total abolition
of these reductions is only 150,000, or approximately 16 per cent of those now enjoying the
benefits of family allowances. I think one
of the cogent arguments in favour of this
legislation is that it will remove the stigma
which the Act appears to place upon large
families. I know this was not intended, but
the decrease in the payrnents does make it
appear we have disapproved of large familles.
There is no particular reason why a mother
and father with, say, ten children to look
after, should draw less than two fathers and

mothers who have tèn chîldrern to look after.
But that seems to be the case at the present
time. Is it flot more logical to say that one
father and mother with ten children have
the greater need? I do flot see how that argument can be met. Obviously the more parents
there are the greater their ability to take
care of the children, and the fewer the parents the greater the need. Quite a number
of countries pay family allowances, but no
other country makes this discrimination
against large families.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? He has frequently used the expression "large families,"
and I should be glad if he would tell me what
in his opinion constitutes a large family.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend,
being a medical man, can probably answer
that more authoritatively than I can.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: I beg my honourable
friend's pardon for persisting. The question
was not asked in any jocular way. My honourable frjend has frequently used the expression "large families," and for the purpose of
better understanding his remarks I should
like to know what hie considers to be the
minimum number of children required to
make up a "large family".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What in fact constitutes
a large family is a matter of opinion. To
some people one child is a large family. However. being a Iawyer, I wiII answer my
honourable friend in the terms of the Act,
which describes a large family as one of five
or more children; and it was in that sense
that I was using the expression.
I was saying that no other country discriminates against large families, be they of
five children or more. Indeed, I know of two
countries - France
and Belgium - which
increase the rate of allowance as the number
of children in the family increases. We are
not proposing that at present. What is proposed here is simply that the discrimination
against parents of five or more children be
abolished. That is the effect of this amendment, which I am sure will be highly appreciated by such parents. When the Act was
passed it was not intended that there should
be this discrimination, but that is how it has
worked out.
The other amendment if the bill is to
section 2 of the Act, which makes ail children
in Canada under the age of 16 years eligible
for family allowances (a) if they are native
born Canadians or (b) if they have been resident in Canada for three consecutive years.
That is the general effect, but there are special
provisions relatîng to members of the armed
forces, a malter that I do not need to touch
on just now. At present a great many chul-

APRIL 27, 1949
dren are immigrating to this country. Experience has shown it to be highly desirable to
reduce the number of years during which
these newcomers must wait before entering
fully into the benefits of citizenship, and it
has been proposed to reduce the term of
three years to one year.
The effect on newcomers of making them
feel that they have become beneficiaries under
this Act within one year of their arrival can
hardly be over-estimated. I submit to honourable senators that no kind words that a
government or its spokesmen may utter, no
certificate of citizenship or any other document that may be issued, can be nearly as
effective as a family allowance cheque in
making a newcomer realize that he has
become in fact a Canadian. I should like to
see the residence requirement wiped out
entirely, if that were practical, but of course
it would not be. We do not want to pay
family allowances to summer visitors or other
transients.
In my judgment a minimum
residence of three years is too long, and we
should look upon a child who bas lived here
for one year as a permanent addition to our
population.
May I point out that one of the specifications in the agreement for the union of Newfoundland with Canada was that the Family
Allowances Act should immediately after the
union extend to eligible people within the
new province. I sense that nothing bas so
impressed the people of Newfoundland with
the fact that they are now Canadians, and
part of this great nation, as the receipt of
monthly family allowance cheques from the
government at Ottawa. That is a very substantial and real testimonial to their inclusion
in our citizenship. Some 45,000 Newfoundland
families, with 110,000 children, are now beneficiaries under this Act. The cost of providing family allowances for these children
is about $700,000 a month, and I am sure we
agree that we are getting good value for our
money.
The extra cost resulting from reduction in
the residence requirement from three years
to one year will not be great. The effect of
the amendment will be to enable certain
children to qualify two years sooner than
they otherwise would. From 1927 to 1944,
both years inclusive, we admitted to Canada
only 94,000 children under 16 years of age, an
average of approximately 5,250 per year.
Some of these children passed the age of
16 before having resided in Canada three
years, and in future some who are under 16
when admitted will have exceeded that age
before being here one year. For purposes
of calculation we might take it that there
will be admitted annually about 5,000 children
under 16 years of age, and if we multiply
29091-23

this number by two we see that the number
of such children likely to become eligible
every year because of our reducing the residence requirement by two years is 10,000.
At an average of $6 a month, the total extra
expense would be $60,000 a month, or
$720,000 a year. I chose those eighteen years
because, during that period, immigration was
perhaps normal, and that may be the kind
of period to which we are returning.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It may be, but I hope
not. During the past two years immigration
bas been much heavier, and it is estimated
that the annual extra cost resulting from the
proposed amendment will be about $1,000,000
a year.
In view of the very obvious advantages of
the two amendments in this bill and the relatively small additional cost that will result
therefrom, I have no hesitation in recommending the bill to the favourable consideration of my fellow senators.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I have only a few words to say in answer
to my honourable colleague. I feel peculiarly
qualified to speak on this subject because I
was the fifteenth child in my family.
The family allowance law has been
described by some people as socialism.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is nothing of the kind.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: To my mind it is a
social and economic law. At the bottom of
the prosperity of our country is the organization of the family: if the family is prosperous
the country at large is prosperous. There is
no reason why the children of the Labrador
coast, Newfoundland, the Pacific coast or elsewhere in Canada should have a lower standard
of living than those in the large cities. If we
investigate, we will learn that many of the
big men of our day came from the country
and the small towns. I say the Family Allowances Act is a social and economic law,
because in order to maintain production it is
necessary to maintain consumption, and the
increased family means increased consumption. I have only eight children, but when I
go to the store to outfit them I am obliged to
buy eight pairs of shoes, eight suits of clothes
and so on. We require food in the home for
ten people, and we consume coisiderably
more than a family of two.
Canada's Family Allowances Act is the best
law of its kind in the world. Some twentysix countries adopted similar systems, starting
in 1926 in New Zealand, and later in Belgium,
and then in France. In some countries contributions are made by the government, the
employer, and the employee. I know of certain countries where employers have tried to
employ only labourers without families. One

SENATE
can readily appreciate the effect of such a
policy. True, by this law which was passed
in 1944, the citizens of Canada are paying for
the allowances; but in reality what they are
paying for is the prosperity of the country.
It is the best law that any government has
ever enacted. If we want prosperity in the
country we must have it first in the family.
Fine children mean better men for tomorrow,
and better men mean a finer country.
Hon. Norman Paterson: Honourable senators, I feel that I have some information
pertaining to this bill which will be of interest
to you. As you know, I am president of the
Victorian Order of Nurses. This order has in
Canada 486 nurses, who make a million calls
a year; which for the most part have to do
with the care of children and expectant
mothers.
The honourable member from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) speaks often of the rugged
independence of the people of his generation.
I have a great deal of sympathy with what
he says, for I was brought up in the West and
do not wish to deprive the rugged western
farmer of his independence. But when one
receives reports such as I do of the improvement in the health of children, the amount of
milk they consume, and the dental work which
is going into their mouths-all as the result
of family allowances-one cannot overlook
the great benefit of this law.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, as
an enthusiastic supporter of the family allowance legislation when it was introduced in the
other house, I crave your indulgence while I
say a word or two about the proposed amendment.
The family allowance system had been
working before the bill was passed in parliament. Our income tax scheme accepted the
principle, and income taxpayers received an
allowance for each dependent child. The
inequity under this system was that those
who earned enough to be taxable got the
benefit of the allowance, but those who earned
less received no benefit whatever.
As a member of parliament representing
much of the fishing population in the province
of Nova Scotia, I felt that the children of the
poor families should receive the same consideration as those of more prosperous families. As I travelled through my constituency
and visited the homes of fishermen in the low
income bracket, it seemed to me that the
mother who raised the children was doing a
noble duty to the state. I felt, therefore, that
the principle adopted by the income tax
department should be made to apply to all.
Family allowances are now paid to al citizens of Canada with children, regardless of
income. It costs the country a good deal of
money; but it is not lost, it is only distributed.

The people who get this money need it and
cannot save it, so it goes into circulation.
Those who want to increase their business
will find that, with more money in the pool,
people have more to spend. Men in poor circumstances will be better able to pay the
doctor and the grocer, and to do things which
formerly were beyond their means. Those of
us who have associated with fishermen and
other persons in the low income groups know
how beneficial this legislation has been to the
youth of Canada, who, after all, are perhaps
the country's greatest asset. We are told
today that the northern nations are raising
such small families that they will soon be
overwhelmed by people from more populous
oriental countries.
It was suggested by the honourable member who moved second reading that the
allowance should be the same for every child.
It seems to me that more should be paid for
the second child, than for the first, and more
for the tenth child than for any of the others.
I believe that would be a more reasonable
change than to reduce the allowance because
of numbers. However that may be, the law
as originally passed was largely experimental.
It is now amended in a manner that I think
will be valuable; and probably as time goes
on, family allowances will receive further
consideration from the point of view of an
equitable redistribution of wealth.
I believe that one of the things of which
we can be proud is that Canada-not through
the provinces but by the Dominion government-has established family allowances. Last
fall, when I was in Newfoundland, I was told
that this measure was not without substantial
influence upon the thinking of the people with
respect to confederation. Reflecting on the
circumstances of many of Newfoundland's
people who live along the coast and are in
low income brackets, but who toil hard and
give useful service to the country, one may
suppose that they decided that family allowances would do them a lot of good, and that
as Canadian citizens they would attain a
higher economic standard.
I do not approve of getting something for
nothing; I believe we should merit what we
receive and that we should try to earn our
living by the sweat of our brow. But let us
not forget that the woman who raises a
family, and the man engaged in a useful occupation which may not yield a large return,
deserve that their children shall have a fair
chance. For the privilege of serving them
in this way we are thankful, and I am glad
to support the amendment which is now
before the house.
Hon. Gustave Lacasse: I want to add a
word or two to keep the record absolutely
clear and not invite any misinterpretation. I

APRIL 27, 1949
have first to compliment my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for the clear and persuasive way in
which he has explained the amendment. He
has demonstrated his great admiration for
the children of Canada, and for that I compliment him: he seems to be of much the same
mind as my honourable friend from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt).
I want to make it clear that there was
nothing personal in the question I asked my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity; and
I will add that I expected another reply
which, though it probably would not have
been better, would have expressed exactly
what I had in mind. What is a "large" family?
The definition varies according to circumstances. I thought that was what he was going
to say-that two children may be a very
heavy load for some families and ten
children may be a very light burden for

29091-23à

others. The matter is relative; and although,
as the Act stands, allowances change according to age, I do not think the expression
"large families" occurs anywhere in it.
However, I repeat that my main purpose
in rising at this time is to assure my honourable friend that there was nothing personal
whatever in the question I asked him.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

OLD AGE PENSIONS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 237, an Act to amend the
Old Age Pensions Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: With leave
of the Senate, I move second reading of the
bill now.
This bill is a short one, its purpose being,
as honourable senators probably know, to raise
the over-all amount of old age pensions from
$30 to $40 a month. Honourable senators are
aware of the fact that under the existing law
the federal government contributes 75 per
cent of the total amount paid in old age pensions, and the provinces pay the remaining
25 per cent. The present monthly payment
to pensioners is $30, of which $22.50 is paid
by the federal treasury and $7.50 by the
provinces. I am advised that the estimated
cost of the increase to the federal treasury by
reason of the increase proposed by this
measure will be about $25,000,000.
On a subject so familiar to honourable
senators as old age pensions, I think I need
say no more.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
am all in favour of this bill, but I wish to
make one or two short observations about it.
First, along with the other members of the
Progressive Conservative party, both in and
out of this house, I believe that this reform is
long overdue. I know how urgent it is that
this measure be passed, and I am not criticizing the government for presenting it. I do,
however, wish to suggest that some consideration be given to the possibility of increasing
the amount which old age pensioners may
receive. At present the pensioner is allowed
to have an income of $600 a year from all
sources, including the pension. I feel that this
figure should be increased in proportion to
the monthly payments. As the law stands,
some pensioners will not gain anything by
the higher monthly payments. At present, a
house owned by a pensioner is assessed at
five per cent of its value, and the sum arrived
at in that way is regarded as money earned

by him, and is deducted from his allowance.
For instance, if he owns a $3,000 house his
$600 income allowance will be reduced by
$150, and instead of receiving $480 per year
by way of pension, as he otherwise would do
under the increased rate, he will receive only
$450. True, some old people have sufficient
income from other sources to meet their needs,
but with the present high cost of living these
old age pensioners would enjoy more independence if they were allowed to receive a
higher total income. I would suggest that a
bill be introduced at the next session of
parliament to increase the total income in
proportion to the increase in monthly payments.
On my second point I speak for myself, not
for my party. Though I have no solution for
the problem, I do not like the means test. In
my experience as a lawyer I have met many
deserving people who do not like to go through
the examination and turmoil of that test. The
C.C.F. party advocates no means test at all,
but I do not go that far. I believe there should
be some inquiry into an aged person's circumstances, and that a decision as to what is
proper in individual cases should be made
after investigation.
Thirdly, as a lawyer I know something of
problems which arise on the probating of
estates of old age pensioners. It sometimes
happens when a pensioner dies that his widow
is only sixty years of age and that the government holds a lien against his house. The
province of Manitoba usually releases such
liens, but it does not have to do so. Some
investigation has to be made, but irrespective
of what government is in power the liens are
usually released.
I draw attention to these three points:
first, the need for an increase in the total
yearly income; second, some revision of the
means test; and third, the liability of the
estate of the old age pensioner to the government. I have in mind the case of a man who
had been getting the old age pension and
whose estate, after his death, was found to
be worth $15,000. I think the Government
of Manitoba was right in insisting upon
repayment of about $2,000, the total pension
money paid to him. The general opinion was
that he did not know what he was doing, and
that his action may not have been fraudulent.
The three matters which I have outlined
are uppermost in the minds of a good many
people; and I suggest that if we as senators
do not examine problems of this kind we are
derelict in our duty. We should be willing
to assist the government of the day without
feeling that thereby we are forwarding the
political interests of one party or the other.
I am entirely in favour of this legislations
it is long overdue. In this connection, the
government of my own province of Manitoba

APRIL 28, 1949
has not been too generous. Some provinces
have granted as much as $10 a month to
supplement the $30 paid by the federal
The Manitoba government
government.
offered a payment of $5 per month on condition that the municipalities pay an equal
amount. There was such a row in the legislature as a result that the province was
obliged to give the $5 unconditionally. It is a
coalition government, and I do not criticise it
from partisan motives; but I believe the $5,
which was about all the province could afford,
should have been granted without delay, and
the issue with the municipalities fought out
later.
When the new parliament assembles, the
subject of pensions is one to which we should
give early attention.
Hon. R. B. Horner: When I was home
recently I met a man who told me that he
had had a discussion with an old age pensions inspector. Although this man had been
receiving the pension for about two years,
there was no record in the office that any of
the cheques had been either cashed or
returned. Upon investigation it appeared that
none of the letters had even been opened.
When the inspector asked this man, "Don't
you need the money?" he said no, that he
had two cows and was doing all right and
didn't need anything more. Whether or not
competition from margarine will prevent him
from earning a living in future, I do not
know. The inspector suggested that if he did
not need the cheques he had better return
them, so the old man-he is seventy-four
years of age-opened a little tin box and
handed out the letters and cheques, remarking, "You would take this money from my
estate, and I don't want to give my children
property which is subject to any debt." Honourable senators may regard this man as
somewhat of an oddity, because he always
voted for me, but I think he is a fine type of
citizen.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
DIVORCE STATISTICS, 1948-49
FINAL REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Divorce, I should like to pre-

sent the final report of the Standing Committee on Divorce for the 1948-49 session of
parliament. Perhaps it may be called a progress report, because the divorce work
scheduled for this session has not been completed, and the report is being presented for
the purpose of making the statistics available
to anyone who wishes to inquire into this
problem.
Honourable senators, it is apparent that a
federal election will be held in the near future
and that a new House of Commons will be
elected. I seriously submit that the new
parliament will have to do one of two things:
it will either have to stop haggling about the
work of the Senate Divorce Committee or
suggest some other method of handling Quebec divorces. One possible solution of the
problem would be to add one or more judges
to the Exchequer Court of Canada, with
power to hear divorce evidence. Parliament
could then act upon their reports. There may
be other ways of solving the problem.
I would remind honourable senators that
not one of us who serves on the Divorce
Committee wishes to do this kind of work.
Let this be understood; we do not want to
do it. We have no love for this work, but
after serving on the committee for a number
of years we realize that we cannot throw our
duties overboard until somebody else takes
on the job. It is the practice of the Senate
Divorce Committee, which is made up of
members from the western and eastern provinces, to sit on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays
and Saturdays, when the Ontario and Quebec
members of this chamber have "hiked" for
home. Western and Maritime members have
had to carry the load now for eighty-three
years, and they are getting a little tired of it.
Honourable senators, I move the adoption
of the report.
The report was then read by the Clerk
Assistant as follows:
The Standing Committee on Divorce beg leave to
submit its one hundred and eighty-ninth and Final
Report for the 1949 Session of Parliament, as
follows:Divorce Statistics, 1949
For the present session 341 petitions for Bills of
Divorce were presented to the Senate and dealt

Of the petitions recommended during the present

committee functioned in two sections.
In 36 cases the committee recommended that part
of the parliamentary fees be remitted.

Hon. Wishar

McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, in my capacity as leader of the government in the Senate, I should like to say
a word in appreciation of the untiring and
excellent work done by the Divorce Committee. I have paid tribute to the committee's
work before, and I intend to do so on occasion as long as the committee continues to
render such good service as it has rendered
in the past. I wish my words of appreciation
to extend to all members of the committee,
but in frankness I am bound to say that they
are particularly directed to the Chairman
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the Deputy Chairman
(Hon. Mr. Haig), who carry on in these onerous duties in addition to fulfilling their
responsibilities
as, respectively,
Deputy
Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the
Opposition in this house. I feel sure that all
members of the Senate join with me in
expressing to all members of the Divorce
Committee sincere appreciation of the time
and effort that they devote to their exacting
duties on that committee.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I should like to make a brief statement as to
what I purpose asking the Senate to consider
this afternoon. I shall ask that the motions
appearing on the Order Paper as items No. 1
and No. 2 bo allowed to stand, as it is not
intended to proceed with these at the present
session. I shall, however, move the third
motion, for suspension of certain rules, and
also the fourth motion, for approval of the
North Atlantic Treaty. At first I had thought
it would be well not to move the fourth
motion until the treaty came up for consideration in another place, but there is some uncertainty as to just when this will be, so I shall
ask the Senate to adopt the motion this afternoon. I shall suggest that motion No. 5, for
approval of the International Wheat Agreement, be allowed to stand temporarily while
we pass on to the Orders of the Day.
The first Order is for second reading of

and after we have dealt with this I shall ask
the house to revert to the motion for approval
of the International Wheat Agreement. I
should like to make a brief explanation of
the agreement today, in order that any senator who may require more information than
I am capable of giving at the moment will
have an opportunity of asking for it. I must
frankly admit that my knowledge of the subject is very limited, and if questions are asked
about it this afternoon I shall endeavour to
obtain the required information for tomorrow. I take it that some honourable senators
may wish to discuss the agreement, and there
will be no objection on my part to an adjournment of the debate, if that is desired.
SUSPENSION OF RULES
MOTION
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved:
That for the balance of the present session Rules
23, 24, 63, 119 and 129 be suspended in so far as they
relate to public and private bills.

He said: Honourable senators are aware
that it has long been customary to move such
a motion as this towards the end of the
session. I am frank to say that every time
I have had occasion to do so I have felt
increasing diffidence, because honourable
members have invariably accorded me the
utmost courtesy and consideration whenever
it has been necessary to ask that any measure
be proceeded with more expeditiously than
provided for by the rules. Adoption of the
motion will not place any additional power
in my hands, for the decision as to whether
any measure shall be passed always rests
with a majority of honourable members.
The motion was agreed to.
THE NORTH ATLANTIC PACT
MOTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament
do approve the North Atlantic Treaty signed at
Washington on April 4, 1949, and that this house do
approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators will recall
that less than a month ago I moved, and the
Senate adopted, a resolution of approval of
a draft document known as the North Atlantic Treaty. The object of that resolution was
to have the Houses of Parliament authorize
a representative of the government to proceed to Washington and sign the treaty with
the other participating countries, on the
understanding that in due course the treaty

the Criminal Code Bill, and, as previously

would be referred to each signatory country

intimated, I shall ask that this Order stand.
The only other Order is for second reading
of the Agricultural Products Marketing Bill,

for ratification according to its constitutional
processes. I have obtained a few copies of
the signed document in order that they may

While I agree with what the honourable do not understand our institutions. But this

SENATE

man is saying these things to nations whose
policies we despise.
Peace conferences have been held in our
own country. One was held in the city of
Winnipeg. I guess it is no better than any
other city in that respect. The Red Dean
of Canterbury attended that conference and
made speeches; and while I believe in the
freedom of speech, I was strongly tempted to
make trouble at that meeting.
We remember well the sacrifices made in
World War I. At that time we had enjoyed
a hundred years or more of peace and did
not know the horrors of war. World War II
broke out and our young men and women,
fully aware that they were going to the
worst torment on earth, joined the forces on
behalf of freedom. Freedom of worship is
Canada's basic freedom. It is better
demonstrated here than in any other country, for here two great races, one largely
Protestant and the other Roman Catholic,
have lived together in peace and mutual
respect for eighty-three years.
Ail of us have read about the trials in
Hungary and Bulgaria. I do not know
whether the verdict in the Cardinal's case
was right or wrong, but his trial was a
farce. The same must be said of the proceedings against Protestant clergymen in Bulgaria. The statement that we are guilty of
aggressive intentions against Russia, whether
made by our own people in Canada or by
others elsewhere, is utterly devoid of truth.
We do not want war with Russia or any of
her satellites. We are not anxious for a
recurrence of the dark days of 1940, when we
who were members of this chamber came
here day by day oppressed with the feeling
that we stood on the edge of an abyss in which
the free nations might be engulfed for centures. We went through that struggle and we
do not want another. We may dislike the
ideology which rules in Russia, we may pity
those who suffer under it; but we have nothing
but disgust for Canadians who declare, in
direct contradiction to the facts, that we are
contriving an attack on those people. I take
this opportunity of protesting against propaganda of that kind.
The Progressive Conservative party in this
chamber and in every part of Canada stands
four-square behind the Atlantic Pact. I congratulate the present Prime Minister of
Canada on the distinguished part he played
in initiating action for the making of this
agreement; and whether or not he continues
in his present office after the election, his
advocacy of the Atlantic Pact will be one of
the greatest achievements of his life. Canadian
Liberals and Conservatives join wholeheartedly in acclaiming the pact. I do not deny
that the Dominion leaders of the Co-operative

Commonwealth Federation also are strong
supporters of the agreement, but I regret that
in our western provinces there is an element
that does not believe in it, and I think the
party should rid itself of that element. One
of their representatives in the Manitoba
Legislature-the member, I believe, for East
Kildonan-made a broadcast on C.C.F. time
in which he condemned the pact and American
action in organizing it; but he was not read
out of the party, as he should have been. It is
agitation of this kind in Manitoba and Western
Canada generally that I protest against. As
far as our party is concerned, we shall vote
unanimously for the motion; and I suggest
that the leader of the government invite us to
demonstrate our belief in the North Atlantic
Treaty by a standing vote. We support it,
not as a means of aggression but as an instrument of freedom and peace.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
there will be no difference of opinion in this
chamber as to what course we should take
with respect to the motion that is now before
the house. At the same time we should be
conscious of the obligations which Canada is
assuming under this treaty. There is no other
course for us to follow in the light of conditions as they exist in the world today. But
let us not forget that by adopting this motion
we assume responsibilities for Canada such as
would not have been even contemplated three
years ago. It is a matter of pride to us all
that in the eighty-two years since Confederation was achieved Canada has grown to a
position which enables ber to occupy an important and honoured place in these great
international transactions.
I am not among those who think that the
mere signing of the North Atlantic Treaty
will resolve the differences which exist in the
world today. Those differences have their
roots far down in two different conceptions
of life and of the place of man upon this
planet. No one will differ with me, I am
sure, when I say that the greatest impact
upon the world in all its history was made
by the Christian ethic. The Christian faith,
as taught by its Founder, placed emphasis
upon human personality; it dignified the
human soul; and thereby it was the source
from which has developed down through the
centuries our conceptions of freedom and
liberty and the right of the individual under
the law to live his own life so long as he does
no hurt to his neighbour. I repeat that from
that great conception stemmed all the
humanitarian and liberal ideals- which have
engendered the tremendous progress made by
western civilization in the intervening centuries.
About one hundred years ago that conception was challenged by ideas promulgated by

APRIL 28, 1949
Marx, and generally known as the Marxian
philosophy. Marx was an atheist. He believed
that a human society could be created and
organized by the state upon a wholly materialistic basis so as to diffuse a much greater
measure of happiness and prosperity among
all the people. From that century-old concept have grown present-day ideas about the
regulation of mankind. It is not without
significance that the Marxian philosophy
taught that Christianity was a great barrier
to progress, so that today a large part of the
efforts of those who believe in communism is
directed to the destruction of all the representative symbols of the Christian faith. We
have seen that happen in Eastern Europe and
among other nations where this new ideology
has seized upon the imagination of the people;
we have seen it in a small and miserable
form even in our own country.
Everyone who has lived in a democratic
society will agree that the individual citizen's
richest boon is his personal freedom and
liberty to follow whatever avocation or labour
he desires, to read what he wishes, to speak
his mind where he wishes, and above all,
to worship his Maker in whatever form and
manner he chooses. These are the priceless
privileges of a human democratic society
that are being challenged today. The great
tragedy in Russia and ber satellite countries
today is not that there is a group of dictators
in the Kremlin, but that the youths of these
countries are being indoctrinated in communistic ideals. In every school in Russia
the plastic mind of the youth is being trained,
turned and twisted in a certain direction. If
the sense of freedom and progress is stricken
from the minds of the young people it will
not be long-even twenty-five years passes
quickly-before they will have lost the desire
for anything other than what they were
accustomed to in their growing years. The
great challenge that rests upon western
civilization today is to keep the flame of
freedom and liberty burning in its own countries and, as far as possible, in other countries
as well. We must cherish and develop our
freedom and liberty. This is our surest bulwark for the future.
But this is not going to be an easy struggle.
I myself believe that the world is only on the
eve of this great struggle, and that it will not
be settled in our day. China's teeming millions are now being overrun by the communist philosophy, and while many people
hope that Chinese communists will adopt a
somewhat different philosophy from the
so-called Russian communists, the basic idea
behind both is the same. We delude and
deceive ourselves if we do not realize that
this communist fermentation is rapidly taking
place in the Far East, and that sooner or
29091-24

later we may have to meet it. We must enter
this pact with sober minds, realizing that it
opens the gateway to events that cannot be
foreseen at the moment. Nevertheless, there
is nothing else for Canada to do but support
this treaty.
I am delighted to see the unanimity of
desire of the freedom-loving nations throughout the world to put their houses in order, so
that they can stand up against an armed
attack, if it should come. Above al we must
encourage the spirit of freedom and liberty
in our own country and in other lands, and
be jealous of anything that undermines that
spirit. The chief desire today, whether it be
in the field of economics, politics or otherwise,
is for security. But security without freedom
is an empty shel. When we sign this pact,
which will bring us many responsibilities, let
us not forget that we are possibly at the
beginning of great adventures. Let us not
forget either that the signing of a pact is not
the only way to preserve within our own
country those principles of freedom and
liberty without which life is not worth while,
and upon which our whole Christian western
civilization has been built.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I should like to follow the suggestion of the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), that

who are in Ottawa at the present time.

SENATE
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS MARKETING
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wisharl McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 82, an Act to provide
for the Marketing of Agricultural Products
in Interprovincial and Export Trade.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) to explain this bill.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, most of the provinces have marketing legislation under which producers of
farm products can organize marketing boards
which, with the approval of the majority of
the registered producers, can control the
marketing of the commodities concerned.
Examples of boards of this type are the Nova
Scotia Apple Marketing Board, the British
Columbia Tree Fruit board, the Ontario Bean
Growers Marketing Board and the New
Brunswick Cheese Marketing Board.
Operation of a board set up under provincial legislation is at present limited to its
own province. In some cases this greatly
restricts the ability of the board to control
the sale of the product, because some of the
product may have to be marketed outside
the province or outside the country. This
measure is intended to enable the Governor
in Council to grant to provincial marketing
boards the same powers in relation to interprovincial and export trade that under provincial legislation they enjoy in connection
with trade within their respective provinces.
Such grants of authority may, of course, be
revoked by the Governor in Council.
One advantage which provincial marketing
boards hope to gain from this legislation is
the legal authority to collaborate with one
another in regulating the marketing of commodities-apples, for example-on markets
anywhere in Canada or abroad.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
the party to which I belong is not opposed
to this bill. In fact, a measure of this kind
was one of the planks in the platform adopted
by the national convention of our party in
October last. In Manitoba, as in the other
provinces, I presume there are various agricultural marketing boards, for example, a
honey co-operative. These boards have been
regulating the marketing of their respective
products within the province, and this bill
would enable them to regulate the marketing
throughout Canada and in foreign countries.
I approve of the measure.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: There is a question I
should like to ask, and perhaps the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) may be able
to answer it. Under our constitutional system

is there or has there been anything to prevent
an organization in one province from distributing or selling its products in any other
part of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think that provincial organizations could carry on interprovincial trade, unless authorized by some
such measure as this, for interprovincial
trade is a matter within Dominion jurisdiction. I know that the honey co-operative of
Manitoba is desirous of having the bill passed.
In Manitoba we have had a hot dispute as to
whether oats and barley should be handled
by the Wheat Board or by a producers' board,
and the people of the province are violently
divided on the issue. I am one of those who
favour a producers' board, especially when
the product in question is marketed largely
throughout the whole country.
There is no question that any board which
was given authority under section 2 of this
bill would have power to regulate the marketing of its products anywhere in Canada. I
have not looked into the question raised by
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), and so am unable to give a
direct answer to him, but I would say that if
I were the legal representative of an agricultural marketing board in any province
I would favour this measure.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not wish to detain
the house. My purpose is simply to obtain
information, and I am not sure whether the
bill is to be referred to a committee. Perhaps there will not be time for that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, there will not be time.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I judge that the bill is
a form of enabling legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what it is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It would enable the
Governor in Council to grant authority to
marketing boards set up under provincial
laws. There is nothing new in that idea, and
the problern which the bill is supposed to deal
with was considered at length and handled
decisively some fifteen years ago when
another administration was in office. At that
time marketing boards for all the provinces
were suggested. Some objection was then
taken to that plan by those who are favourable to it now, so it would appear that opinion
does change over the years.
I think there is good ground for analyzing
and examining the purposes of this bill, in
order that we may be satisfied that the
benefits expected to accrue frorn it will have
some prospect of being realized. From year
to year some provinces will have surpluses
of certain products. For instance, the province of Alberta might conceivably have a

APRIL 28, 1949
concoction that is almost poisonous. No one
who knows what good maple syrup is should
allow himself to be imposed upon in this way.
This sort of thing happens in our capital
city, in the very shadow of the Parliament
Buildings. I believe laws are made to be
enforced. Otherwise why put them on our
statute books?
My reason for raising this question is that
I should like the pure foods division of the
Department of National Health to inquire
into the matter and take whatever steps are
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: This bill has nothing necessary to see that the laws are enforced.

government under this law, it can be given
the same powers in interprovincial and
export trade that it has within the province
of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But only for the products of that province?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, that is assumed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Such a regulation does not
affect another province.
Hon. Mr. Crerer: But I believe that in considering such provisions the public interest
is of paramount concern. I do not like to
see laws passed which confer even upon a
marketing board within a province certain
arbitrary powers, for instance, to exploit
consumers in that province or elsewhere.
I recognize that this problem is a difficult
one. Personally I am a hundred per cent
in favour of the development of the co-operative scheme in marketing by producers. The
western provinces have promoted that idea
quite extensively. While I favour the cooperative plan, I dislike the introduction of
compulsion into these measures. For instance,
living in Manitoba, I would not like to be
buying British Columbia fruit and feeling
that the fruit board of that province had
power under this legislation to exploit me as
a consumer. I trust I am making myself
clear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend has just said
something which I do not think is quite
correct. The only means by which be can
be exploited is by the withholding of British
Columbia fruit from the market.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: That board is not a
price-fixing body?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but it can hold fruit off
the market.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The board might say that
British Columbia fruit could be sold only
through a certain agency in the province
of Manitoba, or it might establish its own
wholesale agency in Winnipeg. I have no
objection to such a policy, but I believe the
principle of monopoly must be avoided if at
all possible.
I said a few moments ago that I was in
favour of the co-operative idea, but that I
did not think it wise to impose any compulsory features. I am a native-born rebel when
it comes to someone telling me what I must
do under certain circumstances in relation to
what are my natural rights.
It is quite evident that considerable caution
was taken in the drafting of this bill. For
instance, subsection 2 of section 2 gives the
Governor in Council the power to revoke
certain privileges that have been granted.
The government may say to a provincial
board that they may have certain powers

extra-provincially, but that if they are abused
the privileges may be revoked.
I do not wish to give the impression that
I am opposing the bill, but it is a type of
legislation which must be administered most
carefully. As I said previously, the public
interest is of paramount concern. That principle applies equally to all people, whether
they be wheat growers, live stock raisers,
honey producers, or fruit growers.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Or manufacturers.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, or manufacturers.
In most instances competition is the regulating factor. While I hope this legislation will
work to advantage, should it develop monopolistic tendencies I trust that public opinion
will see that the situation is corrected.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
while listening to the honourable senator
from Churchill I was reminded of a meeting
with the Price Spreads Committee for the
purpose of assisting in the organization of
co-operatives in agriculture. We have plenty
of evidence that, because agricultural production covers so wide an area, the primary
producer needs the help of associations of
this kind, whether known as co-operatives or
otherwise, to enable him to purchase what he
needs at a fair price. These co-operatives are
wel organized; and their penalties, arranged
by themselves, vary with the size of their
organizations and the amount of their business.
A large sum in cash is set aside so that if
their prices are lower than those of fellowproducers elsewhere, the penalty is already
provided for. This is sufficient proof that
agriculturists have obtained the privileges
w hich are theirs, not in order to exploit other
Canadians, but to assure fair and reasonable
prices for their products, whether apples or
meat. These products are disposed of in an
orderly way so that the market will not be
supplied beyond its requirements.
For these reasons, while the compulsory
feature does not appeal to me, I believe
experience shows that legislation on these
lines for the agricultural producer is necessary to enable him to compete with other
businesses, and to have the wherewithal to
purchase the implements he requires for
production.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

HIS HONOUR THE SPEAKER
FELICITATIONS
The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators, before the doors are opened, I should
like to indicate to honourable members of
the Senate, and to the staff of the Senate, my
appreciation of their kindness and courtesy
to me during the time I have occupied the
position of Speaker and "Président" of the
Senate.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I am sure that I am reflecting the
views of honourable members of this house
when I say a word of appreciation of the
very great and distinguished services that
have been rendered to the Senate of Canada
by His Honour the Speaker, who for the
past four years has presided over our
deliberations with such grace and dignity.
It is the tradition and custom of the Senate
that the Speaker shall change with each parliament; consequently this is probably the
last sitting of this chamber over which His
Honour will preside. During His Honour's
tern of office we have not only had the
advantage of his long experience in public
life and his wide knowledge of parliamentary
practice, but we have had occasion to observe
his personal charm and eminent sense of
fairness, all of which have conspired to make
his tenure of office one which I am sure
every member of the Senate has enjoyed. As
he steps down from the high office which
he has held, and again resumes his place
among us as an ordinary member of the
Senate, I am sure that it is the wish of all
that he may long be spared so that for many
years to come we may continue to enjoy the
great privilege of his friendship.
Hon. John T. Haig: In voicing my entire
agreement with the words of the leader of the
government in this house, I want in a very
special way to express my appreciation, as
leader of His Majesty's loyal opposition, of
the unfailing kindness and generosity that
His Honour the Speaker has extended not
only to me but to my supporters during his
tern of office. I appreciate this very much
indeed. Any opposition depends very largely
for its success or failure on the attitude of
the Speaker of the legislative body in which
it functions, and you, Mr. Speaker, have
fulfilled the highest traditions of your office;

sometimes I think you have leaned a little to
our side in making your decisions, which was
only proper in view of the fact that the
majority could always get its own way in the
end.
After fourteen years of service in this
house, under a number of Speakers, I can
say in truth that your fulfilment of the high
office of Speaker of the Senate has been a
joy and pride to all of us. May you be spared
many years, as the leader of the government
has just said, to live with us and among us.
Whatever may happen in the future, we will
never forget your unfailing courtesy and
fair play during the years you have presided
over this house.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, as
an old colleague of His Honour the Speaker
in a government of former days, I gladly join
my voice to those of the leader of the government and the leader of the opposition in the
well-deserved tributes they have paid to His
Honour, who has presided with so much
dignity and fairness over our deliberations
during the last four years. Only today I was
walking with His Honour in the corridor on
the sixth floor, and we were comparing our
political experiences in the years that have
gone. I thought I had a pretty good record
in battling through elections, but I discovered
that His Honour had been through almost
twice as many campaigns, provincial and
federal, as I had seen.
According to the tradition of the House, a
new Speaker may preside over our deliberations after the coming election. It is fitting,
therefore, at this time that we should mark
the occasion by expressing appreciation to
His Honour and in this way let him know the
esteem in which we hold him. May the years
ahead for him be always pleasant and happy
years.
Hon. J. G. Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
take the liberty of joining in the tribute to
His Honour the Speaker as he nears the end
of his tern of office. I am taking this privilege because both he and I are in this
chamber as representatives from British
Columbia and were both born in the Province
of New Brunswick. I have had the honour
and the pleasure of knowing His Honour and
of working intimately with him since before
he became a member of the Canadian Parliament in 1921. The chief thing I wish to say
today does not so much concern the general
success which has attended his efforts for the
public good as it does the fact that in reaching every objective he has always been guided
very definitely by a strong moral sense of
right and wrong.
I know that every senator from British
Columbia would wish to join in this tribute,

OFFICIAL STATEMENT

Hon. Wishar± McL. Roberison: Honourable
senators, I should like to ask the house at this
time to implement the suggestion of the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), that the
statement made by our Prime Minister in
another place on the nionentous conference
of Prime Ministers recently held at London,
be incorporated in our records; and I would
so move. The most difficult constitutional
problem concerning India's relation to the
commonwealth bas been happily solved.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to have the
honour of seconding that motion.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The statement is as
follows:
During the past week the Prime Ministers of the
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs have
met in London to exchange views upon the important constitutional issues arising from India's
decision to adopt a republican form of constitution
and her desire to continue her membership of the
Commonwealth.
The discussions have been concerned with the
effects of such a development upon the existing
structure of the Commonwealth and the constitutional relations between its members. They have
been conducted in an atmosphere of goodwill and
mutual understanding, and have had as their historical background the traditional capacity of the
Commonwealth to strengthen its unity of purpose,
while adapting its organization and procedures to
changing circumstances.
After full discussion the representatives of the
governments of all the Commonwealth countries
have agreed that the conclusions reached should be
placed on record in the following declaration:
"The governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India,
Pakistan and Ceylon, whose countries are united as

COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY
ASSOCIATION
WELCOME TO DELEGATES

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Before the business
of the house is proceeded with, and as having
some relation to the subject we have just
considered, I should like, on behalf of honourable members on this side of the bouse to
extend a very warm welcome to the delegates
to the General Council of the Commonwealth
Association.
Honourable senators will perhaps remember
that in October, 1948, the Empire Parliamentary Association, now the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association, formed a General
Council of the association. At that time it was
arranged that the first meeting would take
place in Canada in April, 1949. The General
Council of the association was formed as a
means of establishing local contact between
the various branches. It meets once a year in
such place as may be determined at its annual
business meeting, and at this very moment a
meeting is being held in this building by
representatives from the United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia-its Commonwealth and
State Branches-the Union of South Africa,
New Zealand, Pakistan, Malta, Bermuda, and
the Gold Coast. The deliberations will continue for the next few days and, although no
particular resolutions will be passed, the
opinions of the various delegates will be
printed and circulated, I presume that following any constitutional changes which are
made, India will soon become a member of
the Association.
While I have always been a member of the
association I have not yet had the opportunity
of attending any of its meetings in the various

APRIL 29, 1949
parts of the commonwealth. However, I do
feel that the commonwealth delegates, representing the various racial origins and viewpoints of peoples widely scattered throughout
the world, will have a profound influence
upon world opinion. I am pleased that the
first meeting of the newly-formed General
Council is taking place in Canada, and I want
to extend to the members of the association
the warmest possible welcome and my best
wishes for the success of their deliberations.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
last year in Bermuda I had the honour and
pleasure of attending a parliamentary conference of world democratic countries, in which
New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, the
United Kingdom, the United States and
Canada were represented. At that time the
wish was expressed that the United States
might have an opportunity to become part of
this organization.
Honourable senators, I join with the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) in welcoming representatives of
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
to our country. Thanks to His Honour the
Speaker, some of us had an opportunity to
meet several of the delegates a few nights ago.
We were delighted with their spirit and
sentiments. They all expressed the same high
regard for their parliamentary institutions
and for the part they play in the freedom,
peace and good will of the world. It is a
great honour to Canada to have the flrst
meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association held here, but I do not think
enough notice has been taken of it. I know
two or three delegates who have stated that
this is their first trip away from home. One
distinguished representative, a member of the
judiciary of the Gold Coast, came here thinking that it would be summertime and that
he would not need an overcoat. I want to
tell a story that he told me-and which I
think he repeated the other night-because it
shows how effective the personal touch can
be in making people from other countries feel
He was staying at the
welcome here.
Chateau Laurier, and in the morning he
boarded the elevator to come down to the
main floor. He had on a hat but no overcoat,
and the young woman operating the elevator
said, "I think, sir, that if you are going out
this morning you will need an overcoat." He
told her that he did not have an overcoat
with him, and she said there was a store
across the street, not far away, where he
could get one. He did not know just where
that was, and she took the trouble to walk
out in front of the hotel, point out the store
to him and call a taxi. Well, he said that
young woman's interest in his welfare was
very much appreciated, and he looked upon
it as indicating a cordial welcome.

I enjoyed my trip to Bermuda last November as a delegate to the Parliamentary Conference. The other night the honourable
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) accused me of not having said much
about the meeting. The fact is that our proceedings were secret. As honourable members who have been to that country know,
all vehicular traffic there keeps to the left,
and I do not mind admitting that for the first
two days of my visit I feared I was going
to be killed. Indeed, the idea occurred to me
that perhaps the leader of the government
had arranged to have me appointed a delegate
in order to get rid of me. After being there
a few days I got used to seeing drivers keep
to the left, so much so that when I returned
home I felt that our own drivers were on
the wrong side of the road.
We were given a very warm welcome in
Bermuda and had a good time. While we
passed no formal resolution, we did perform
what I think was a useful service in demonstrating to the American delegates-five
senators, two members of the House of Representatives and an Assistant Under Secretary
of State-that the nations of the commonwealth are just as anxious as the United
States to preserve freedom for all peoples.
I think also that we made it clear to them
that while we appreciated the great contribution of the United States to world peace,
we nevertheless liked our own institutions.
And I believe that at the end of the conference those influential Americans realized
more fully than before that the commonwealth has shown what free nations can do
when they choose to work together. It is
amazing, when you stop to think of it, that
within the lifetime of one generation there
have been two major world wars, but that
somehow free peoples have by joint effort
managed to rise above those catastrophes.
At the gathering of parliamentary delegates
here the other night one could not help being
impressed by the different races represented.
Black men, brown men and white men were
exchanging ideas, and underlying the whole
discussion was a common love of freedom
and peace.
I have great pleasure in joining with the
leader of the government in extending a
hearty welcome to the delegates at this
Parliamentary Conference.
INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT
MOTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament
do approve the International Wheat Agreement
opened for signature at Washington on March 23,
1949, and that this house do approve the same.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that the proposed International Wheat Agreement was before us for ratification last session, at which time I gave to the house the
best information I had as to the purpose and
scope of the agreement. I think it would not
be in order for me to repeat what I said at
that time; rather, I should bridge the gap
by telling you what has happened since the
last agreement, and what is happening now.
This house ratified an international wheat
agreement last year. Unfortunately, due to
the failure of the United States Senate to
similarly approve by the July i deadline, the
agreement never went into force.
Following the United States elections last
year, President Truman stated that if the
agreement were re-negotiated he would again
submit it to Congress. The Government of
the United States then invited all governments that were interested to send delegates
to a conference in Washington to be held
January 26 to March 23 of this year. All the
countries which participated in the talks this
year are experiencing more normal and balanced conditions of trade than last year. The
old agreement was reviewed in the light of
the change, and the new agreement embodies
all the principles of the old one. For this
reason I shall confine my remarks to the
minor changes in the actual terms of the
agreement.
Thirty-seven countries participated actively
in the negotiations this year, and by April 15,
the closing date for signatures, all but Paraguay had signed.
Last year thirty-three
countries signed. Among the new signatories
are two minor wheat-exporting countries,
France and Uruguay.
The old agreement was for, I think, five
years. The agreement before us is for a
period of four years, which includes and covers
the last four years of the old agreement. The
quantity of wheat involved in the present
agreement is 456 million bushels, as compared with 500 million in last year's agreement. This change is due to the improved
position of France, which is endeavouring to
become a net exporter of wheat. Of this
year's total, Canada's share is 203 million
bushels. Because of Paraguay's failure to sign
and Peru's reservation that her quantity be
reduced by 50,000 tons, there will have to be
a reallocation of 4 million bushels when the
council meets in July.
For the quantities set out in the agreement,
the exporting countries guarantee a maximum price of not more than $1.80 a bushel,
basis No. 1 Northern, in store Fort WilliamPort Arthur. The importing countries guarantee a floor price of $1.50, $1.40, $1.30 and
$1.20 in the first, second, third and fourth
years, respectively. Although this year the

ceiling price is twenty cents lower than it
was last, the floor prices are up ten cents in
each of the respective years.
Argentina and Russia were invited to
attend the talks. They did attend at the
beginning, but it was obvious from the outset that Argentina did not intend to become
a party to the agreement. Russia took an
active part at first, but withdrew toward the
end when it became apparent that her
demands would not be met. The absence of
these two countries does not seriously affect
the operation of the agreement.
I have outlined the main changes in this
agreement as compared with the old one.
Having in mind the changing wheat situation
and all the uncertainties that would face the
Canadian wheat growers without this international agreement, I move that in the interest of the wheat farmers, and of Canada as a
whole, the agreement be approved.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to oppose this motion. My
feelings about the agreement may be
expressed in a very few words: I do not
believe its terms will ever be carried out, and
I do not believe they can be enforced.
There are five countries-actually fourselling wheat, and while the contract may be
enforced against them, there are thirty-two
countries buying large and small amounts of
wheat against which enforcement of the contract is doubtful.
I do not intend to go into the whole history

of wheat agreements. I expressed some personal opinions a year ago, and some of them
have proved sound. The United States did
not sign up. The picture is this: If the supply
of wheat is short, there will be no difficulty in
getting the purchasers to take their quotas.
If it is long there will be plenty of trouble.
I point to the fact that two of the great grainproducing countries, Argentina and Russia,
are being allowed to remain outside the
agreement.
The price per bushel of $1.80 maximum
and $1.20 minimum looks pretty good to our
prairie farmers, and if it could be guaranteed
through the years they would be satisfied;
but we must remember that our share in the
agreement is about 203 million bushels, and
with one country dropping out we probably
will supply an additional million or million
and a half bushels. That quota is all right
in a poor year; but with a crop of say 500
million bushels, if we take out 70 or 80
million for domestic consumption and fill
our contract, we would have about 200
million bushels left. That residue would go
on the world market, but where and at what
price it would sell is difficult to predict.
I have never believed that a world agreement on wheat, or any other product that is

APRIL 29, 1949
produced by practically every country in the
world, is possible. Such agreements deal only
with a small surplus of the total production.
A further problem is how we are going to be
paid for our grain by the purchasing countries. For instance, how is Great Britain
going to pay for her purchases? We have
agreed to sell to her for the coming year
140 million bushels at $2.00. True, in passing
the estimates the United States Senate did
not say that the administration could not buy
wheat; but as I read the newspapers it is
plain that they will not buy Canadian wheat
if there is an American surplus. I do not
see how we can expect them to buy our
wheat, or guarantee the price, which is the
same thing.
On the question of exchange, I have
advocated that world exchange should find
its own level. But both houses of parliament
in Canada have decided otherwise. The real
problem is what kind of currency will certain
of these buying countries use to pay for
wheat. For instance, Great Britain's contract is for about 177 million bushels, but
how are we going to enforce that contract,
say, in the year 1951-52? If that country has
no gold or American currency, and we do not
buy her goods, what good is the contract?
Some people may proudly point to the fact
that certain countries got together and
reached an agreement. That is a fine thing,
but when that type of idealism runs wild it
only leads to bitter disappointment.
I intend to vote for this agreement, because
I do not want it to be said that anyone in
Canada attempted to defeat what looked like
a stabilization of the marketing of wheat.
Farmers in the West, and I assume elsewhere
in Canada, have been calling for stabilization.
Of course in the last four years stabilization
has been easy. You could stabilize the price
of wheat at $1.55 in 1946 when it was selling
on the world market at $2.44, and in 1947,
when the world price was $2.88. There is no
difficulty about establishing a price of $2 this
year, since the world price since the beginning
of the season has been above that figure.
When any commodity is selling on the world
market at the higher price, it is easy to fix
the selling price at a lower figure. But what
happens when the world price is below the
stabilized price? The government is expected
to come through with the necessary cash.
But will any government come through with
the cash? Our House of Commons comprises fifty-three members from the Prairie
Provinces and two hundred and nine from
the rest of Canada. Will the two hundred
and nine consent to vote sufficient money to
stabilize the price to prairie wheat growers,
who are represented by only fifty-three members? They will not if human nature remains

as it is now. It may change some time in
the future, but not in the lifetime of the
present generation.
I am frank to state that if we depend upon
this agreement we shall be very disappointed.
As long as the shortage of grain continues,
importing nations will be willing to take it;
but as soon as a surplus is available, the
moment Russia moves into the market-and
move she will-the position of exporting
countries will be seriously affected. Russia
will enter the exporting market for two,
reasons: first, because she has grain to sell,
and second, principally, because her desire is
to create chaos in the world's markets-and
she may succeed in this. Argentina also will
seek to export, not to upset the general
equilibrium, but on account of necessity. She
cannot go on holding up the world price, as
she has been doing in the last three or four
years, especially against Great Britain.
Australia, too, has been trying to maintain
a high price in the world market, and has
obtained $2.72 per bushel. Of course this
policy will ultimately fail, as ours did, in
1929 and 1930 when Canada tried to sustain
a fixed price on a competitive market and
those who held wheat suffered tremendous
losses.
I am not going to vote against the agreement, but I am voting for it with my eyes
wide open; I do not expect any benefits from
it at all.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Like my honourable
friend the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) I am bound to say that I have a very
slight degree of faith in this agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I apologize to the
house and to my honourable friend for interrupting to ask permission to put on the
records of the Senate the text of the agreement? I forgot to ask the consent of the
government leader, but I think the documents should be so dealt with, and with his
consent I will hand a copy to our reporters
so that those reading Hansard will know
what it is about.
Hon. Mr. Copp: The whole agreement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The entire agreement, as
already published in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons. Is that.
agreed to?
Hon. Mr. Copp: Yes.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(See appendix at end of today's proceedings.)
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Now, honourable senators,
after that interlude-and I concur in the suggestion of the leader of the opposition-may
I repeat that, like him, I have little faith in

350

SENATE

this agreement. I am not going to oppose it;
to do so would be rather a futile gesture;
but there are a few features of it to which I
would like to draw the attention of my
colleagues.
It is now more than fifteen years since an
international wheat agreement was first
mooted. I think I remarked a year ago, in
what I had to say about the agreement when
the motion was before us for ratification, that
sentiment in favour of this kind of action
has, so to speak, surged up and down over
this fifteen year period. It is a fine thing to
talk about international agreements, and in
these times ideas of international co-operation
kindle the sympathies of us all. Let no one
think for a moment that I am deriding this
sentiment; it is highly commendable; but if
it is to have any value, there must be some
practical side to it.
Now what is proposed under the agreement
which is before us for ratification-the second
of its kind-is that thirty-seven importing
countries agree to buy wheat on the terms
outlined by the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), and that five countries
agree to sell certain quantities of wheat.
Included in the number of those agreeing to
buy are several who have undertaken to
purchase less than one million bushels a year.
I notice that in one case, the smallest
importer, the amount involved is only 36,744
bushels. There are individual farmers in
Western Canada who could supply that
quantity from their own acreage.
There is another feature of the agreement
to which attention should be called. I observe,
for instance, that Brazil agrees to import
roughly 134 million bushels, and Paraguay,
another South American country, undertakes
to accept roughly 2,200,000 bushels a year.
One of the anomalies of this agreement lies
in the fact that Argentina an important producing country, has not signed it. The state
of Paraguay adjoins Argentina, and Brazil is
four times as far from the United States, as
she is from Argentina, farther from Canada,
and even farther from Australia. Is it
reasonable to suppose that Paraguay will buy
wheat from the signatories to this agreement
if she can obtain it cheaper from Argentina
at a lower price? Certainly she has contracted to do so in the agreement, but supposing, on the plea that she cannot afford to buy
at the price here fixed, she backs down on
her undertaking, what sanctions shall we
impose to compel her to honour lier signature? The same consideration holds good as
to Brazil.
Then, what will be the attitude of the great
state of Russia, which has not signed the
agreement?
Before the First World War
Russia usually exported annually over 100

million bushels of wheat, and, as the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) is aware, the Danubian countries,
particularly the Hungarian plain, were heavy
exporters of wheat. Hungary lies next door
to Italy, which is listed here as the second
largest purchaser. If things settle down in
Europe, and Hungary wants to sell 50 million
bushels of wheat to Italy at an attractive
price, that country will be strongly tempted
to accept the offer.
Honourable senators, as I stated a year ago,
it is difficult to harmonize the interests of
exporting and importing countries.
The
exporting countries naturally wish to secure
as high a price as possible, while the importing countries naturally desire to purchase as
cheaply as possible. I fear that the importing
countries, faced with the uncertainties of
trade and exchange over the next few years,
will be strongly tempted to buy their wheat
from Russia should that country offer it to
them at lower prices than they can get it
under this agreement. Frankly, I expect,
even though this agreement may persist for
a year or so, that it will not live until the
end of its term. Those who are pressing for
the International Wheat Agreement are not
pursuing a course that will place Canadian
agriculture on its soundest basis. It may be
implied from what I say that I think the
signatory countries will break their word.
That is not altogether the case. Once the
Marshall Plan has come to an end, some
countries may encounter real difficulty in
securing dollars to buy from the United States
and Canada. And let it be understood that
under this agreement the United States and
Canada are the largest contributing countries.
Between them they are to supply more than
370 million of the 456 million bushels provided for in the agreement.
I do not intend to vote against this motion,
but I want to emphasize that I have little
faith that the term of the agreement will be
completed. I am doubtful, too, if the advantages that it is supposed to bring to the
grain producers of this country will be
realized.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Do not the uncertainties
which my honourable friend has mentioned
exist in all businesses? Is this not based on
confidence and ability to pay?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think my honourable
friend from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) is suffering from a misapprehension.
Under this agreement Canada has to hold
out for a certain price; but if the agreement
did not exist, the market would find its own
level and Canada would enter into competition with Russia or Argentina. Brazil, for

APRIL 29, 1949
instance, would be strongly tempted to buy
from Argentina should that country offer to
sell her wheat at, say, 25 cents a bushel less
than it could be bought under the wheat
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: What is the real intention
of the agreement?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
would have to put his question to those who
proposed the agreement. I have never been
able to find any logical reason for it.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Surely my honourable
friend, who is an authority on wheat, knows
the intention of the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have never been a proponent of any international wheat agreement,
because I have never considered that such a
plan would work. Over a span of many
years western Canadian wheat came to
acquire a high reputation for quality. This
reputation made our wheat desirable on
international markets, but I am afraid that
under this agreement we may sacrifice this
advantage.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask my honourable friend what would happen if a new government came into power in one of the signatory countries, and claimed that it were
not responsible for the agreement?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have not had time to
read this new agreement carefully, but my
recollection of the one presented to us a year
ago is that provision was made whereby the
agreement could be abrogated by any of the
However, supposing
signatory countries.
Liberia, which is on the west coast of Africa,
were to announce that she was going to buy
wheat from Argentina instead of buying it
under the agreement, would a fleet or an
army be sent to enforce sanctions? Certainly
not. \What would be done to Brazil if she
were to decide that it was to her advantage
to buy her wheat from Argentina? Would
we send an army or a navy to enforce our
contract? Would we impose trade sanctions
against Brazil? This would be one method
of reprisal, but it would not be done because
it would arouse a storm of protest in this
country that would entirely overshadow the
violation of the agreement. These are some
of the reasons why I have little faith in this
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I hope the honourable
senator from Churchill, whose long association with the wheat trade has made him an
authority on the subject, will permit me to
ask him a question. What is the relation
between this agreement and our present
wheat agreement with Great Britain?

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I understand that this
agreement does not interfere with our contract with Great Britain, which has only one
year to run from August 1 next. The signatories to this international agreement have
recognized the contract between Britain and
Canada, which can normally be discharged,
and then Canada will come under the interThat is my undernational agreement.
standing.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think that is right.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Is it supplementary to
our agreement with Britain?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I understand the position is as stated by the honourable gentleman
from Churchill. Our agreement with Britain
is for another year, and it will be replaced
then by the International Wheat Agreement,
if that is ratified by the various participating
countries. The extent to which $2 happens
to be higher than the prevailing price at any
time during the next crop year will be looked
upon as partial compensation to our producers for the advantages that have accrued
to Britain in recent years by reason of the
lower price at which our wheat was sold to
that country. I believe there is no confiict
between this agreement and our agreement
with Britain. The negotiators of each one had
full knowledge of the terms of the other.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Would this agreement be
effective if the government of the United
States declared a wheat surplus in that
country?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not think such a
declaration would have any bearing upon the
International Wheat Agreement. If a wheat
surplus were declared in the United States,
moneys allocated for the E.C.A. could not be
specifically used for wheat purchased from
Canada. In any event, that has no relation
to this agreement.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I have listened with great
interest to what my honourable friend said
about agreements for international trade,
and it seerns to me that the purpose of any
such agreement is to assure a supply of the
goods in question to the purchasing country,
at a price that can reasonably be paid by the
consumers. When you are doing an export
business it is very important that you do not
allow the price of your goods to go beyond
what the consumers can pay. If they consider your price too high, you will not be able
to continue selling to them.
The people who are making this agreement
with us are undertaking to do certain things,
and we expect them to carry out their undertaking, regardless of how large the world
production in any year may be. In all business you take it that people will stand by

SENATE
their agreements. I certainly would not like
to put the standard of morality in international business on as low a plane as my
honourable friend has put it, for we look to
people to honour their signatures, even
though at times they may find it very difficult
to do so. That is one of the first principles
of business. Although there is at present
no law which could be invoked to compel a
nation to abide by an agreement, it seems to
me that in the face of all the existing
organizations for international co-operation
it is unthinkable that any country would
default on an undertaking of this kind. The
country would lose face, as the saying is,
and that would tell strongly against it whenever thereafter it desired to enter into any
other agreement.
This agreement may not be perfect, but it
is the best that can be made for the time
being. That being so, it seems to me that we
should accept it and trust in the good faith of
the signatory nations.
In recent years, honourable senators, there
have been a number of important international declarations, undertakings and associations. First there was the Atlantic Charter,
which declared the sanctity of the Four Freedoms; a few years later the United Nations
Organization was established, and now we
have the North Atlantic Treaty and a new
set-up for the commonwealth. In the past
there has always been a feeling that no nation
could be forced by law to live up to its undertakings with another nation, and it seems to
me that the time has come when the United
Nations must give serious thought to this.
If international agreements cannot be
enforced by sanctions, we should try to arrive
at a general understanding that it will be a
matter of honour for every nation to carry
out its obligations; and if we can ever reach
that stage we shall have the best possible
guarantee that they will be carried out.
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
senators, it is too bad that we are not going
to have an opportunity to ask a few questions about this agreement in committee, for
I notice that the gentleman who signed the
agreement on behalf of Canada is sitting in
the gallery.
Perhaps it would be of interest to the house
to hear of one Canadian's experience of some
years ago, when the Argentine froze all its
foreign exchange. Canada then had a surplus of wheat, and our Winnipeg merchants
had an open market and were endeavouring
to sell wheat in England in competition with
the Argentine. At that time English investors
owned a preponderance of Argentine railroad stock. The dividends were credited to
their accounts in the Argentine, but the
government there would not permit any of

those funds to be removed from the country.
Argentine wheat was then being sold in
England, and we were not able to meet the
competition. We discovered afterwards that
the railroad dividend credits were being
exchanged in the Argentine for wheat.
It seems to me rather ridiculous for us to
say we are not on the gold standard, when
the only thing we will take in exchange for
goods is gold. We will not accept the paper
money of other countries or their verbal
promises. I feel that we are more on the
gold standard today than we have been at
any time in the history of the world. I think
this agreement is probably the best arrangement we can have under the circumstances,
and we should trust in God that it will work.
On the 1948 crop we have about 140 million
bushels of wheat available. That quantity can
be carried over or it can be exported, whichever it is decided to do. We may be thankful, if we get no rain in the West that it is
available to carry over. At the present time
we have more dust storms than we have had
at any time in ten years. In certain parts
of Saskatchewan the condition is critical.
We happen to be facing the United States,
our big neighbour to the south, which probably has one of the largest surpluses in its
history. That country will have perhaps a
billion and a quarter bushels of wheat to
harvest this year. When the agreement was
first presented to her she did not choose to
sign it, but at the present time her attitude
is much more favourable for the reason that
she has a large exportable surplus. If the
United States declares a wheat surplus, then
the United Kingdom cannot use American
money for the purchase of Canadian wheat.
Further, England may not be able to buy
our wheat unless we purchase some goods
from ber. This is a two-way agreement, that
more or less forces England to buy our wheat
and requires us to purchase ber goods
This agreement is the best we can hope
for and, under the circumstances, we must
trust it to work.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to concur in the
motion for approval of the International
Wheat Agreement?
Some hon. Senators: Carried.
The motion was agreed to.
OLEOMARGARINE
EFFECT ON DAIRY INDUSTRY
On the Orders of the Day.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
should like to make a few remarks on an
important question which seriously affects

APRIL 29, 1949
every part of Canada. I refer to the manufacture and sale of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: We have heard of it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Unf ortunately the government allowed the question of the ban on
margarine to go before the Supreme Court
of Canada. I have before me a newspaper
advertisement offering two pounds of fancy
margarine for 63 cents.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is that in a local paper?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, it appeared in the
Ottawa Journal of last night. I will hand it
to you, so you may purchase the product if
you wish. There appears in the same paper
an appeal to the government to take immediate steps to correct the situation.
Before the judgment of the court was
handed down the Dairy Council approached
the government and suggested that if butter
was in short supply a quantity should be
imported. The government went ahead and
have now imported 10,000,000 pounds from
Denmark, a small quantity from Great
Britain, some from the United States, 2,000,000
pounds from New Zealand and about 1,500,000
pounds from Australia, a total of some
14,379,000 pounds.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: Over what period?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I believe that is within
the past six months, or it may possibly be
a year. I cannot be certain on that point.
But I did get some information from the
Bureau of Statistics before coming into the
chamber today.
During my experience of milking cows,
over a period of fifty years, farmers and producers have not received anything like a fair
price for their product.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must point out
to the honourable gentleman that he is
entirely out of order. If he wishes to make
a speech at this time he should ask for leave
of the house.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Mr. Speaker, this is a
very urgent question. The honourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) spoke
yesterday of the adulteration of maple syrup.
I contend that the removal of the ban on
margarine is of much greater concern to the
country than is poor quality maple syrup. If
I am ruled out of order, I shall move the
adjournment of the house to discuss a matter
of urgent public importance.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think the honourable senator should do so.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Then I so move.
The Hon. the Speaker: It has been moved
by the Honourable Senator Horner that the
Senate adjourn for the purpose of allowing

him to discuss a question of urgent public
importance-the sale of oleomargarine. Is
there.

a

scnderr

to

the motion?

Hon. Mr. Horner: It is seconded by the
honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr.
Jones).
Some Hon. Senalors: Carried!
Hon. Mr. Horner: I shall not detain the
Senate for long.
First, I may point out that there are a great
many people engaged in the dairy industry.
They are a hard working people, and never
have they been fully compensated for their
labour. Theirs is no ordinary job; it is a Sunday, Monday and every-day proposition.
The sale of margarine is causing most
serious alarm in Canada. The dairy producers
will not continue to operate under present
circumstances. For instance, in the province
of Saskatchewan during the month of March
dairy production declined eleven per cent.
That decrease will become greater in spite
of the floor price which the government proposes to pay.
I read in an article in the Ottawa Journal
of last evening that:
J. H. Duplan, President of the Dairy Council,
presented the Council's butter, milk and cheese
troubles in a brief addressed to Prime Minister
St. Laurent and members of his Cabinet.
Mr. Duplan said in his brief: "Failure to announce
administrative policy is having lasting and harmful
effects on all branches of the industry."

People who are discouraged at the prospect
of getting a fair return for their labour and
money are selling their dairy cattle. Dairying, above almost any other vocation, is a
family industry. It is also a great training
ground for youth. In talking to a gentleman
who was raised under similar circumstances
to myself, I said that as a young fellow I
bitterly regretted missing holidays and having to rush home from fairs and spend a part
of Sunday in milking, but, comparing my
own career with that of boys who had nothing
of this kind to do, I felt now that I had no
reason for envying them. He said that the
same held true in his case. The moral is that
boys who had gone through the discipline of
this experience were much better fitted to
succeed in after life than those who had not.
Some provinces have taken action in the
interests of the dairy industry. Born and
raised, as I was, in Quebec, I am pleased and
proud that Premier Duplessis has taken the
stand that margarine shall not be manufactured or sold within that province. This decision is right and proper, and what is taking
place today will show that he has acted even
more wisely than he thought.
I get tired of listening to the protestations
of Liberals about protection and free trade:
to my mind they are just nonsense. They

SENATE

talk free trade at election time, but they
practise protection when in office, and necessarily so. In relation to wheat agreements
or anything else, it is hard to force water to
run uphill. We have had trade agreements
witih the United States, but whether the
commodity is grain, cattle or hogs, just as
soon as it affects adversely the American
farmer we run into difficulties.
Hon. Mr. Lesage: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? What is the existing reserve of surplus butter in the country?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not able to say.
I imagine it is considerable. I was listening
to a discussion in the other chamber when the
Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of
Agriculture stated that the government, on
the basis of this floor-price provision, had
bought about 2,500,000 pounds of butter.
What they propose to do with it I do not
know. When production increases in May
and June, as it will, they will still be buying
-and
buying in competition with 31-cent
margarine.
I was pointing out that when we had
agreements with the United States, as soon
as our sales adversely affected the producers
in that country, they lobbied and persuaded
their government to increase the tariff against
us. The duty on wheat is 45 cents a bushel;
the shipment of cattle is subject to a tariff
and a quota; and, I repeat, just as soon as
concessions made to us have an adverse effect
on their producers, those concessions are
annulled. The same will hold true of any
future agreement.
In Western Canada we have been buying
from eastern Canadian manufacturers for
fifty years. They have had protection in
respect of the goods which farmers had to
purchase; and we believe we are entitled to a
measure of protection for the dairy industry.
I do not know much about the adulteration
of maple syrup; but if margarine is to be
manufactured and sold, a small army of
inspectors will be needed to ensure that it
contains the prescribed elements, such as
vitamins. When you buy a dairy product
you know what you are getting. I think the
government should take immediate steps; for
if they do not, the situation will become very
difficult.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend whether, in making this speech,
he has taken into consideration the judicial
decision which places upon the provinces the
legal responsibility relating to the manufacture and sale of margarine? The federal
authority has nothing to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I know all that very
well. My complaint is that the governnent

ever allowed the matter to go to the court
for decision.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: How could they stop
it?
Hon. Mr. Horner: They could very well
have stopped it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: How?

Hon. Mr. Horner: They need not have
passed the resolution in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair: We passed it in this
house.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I know, but it also had
to pass the other house.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The resolution asking
the government to submit the issue to the
Supreme Court was passed unanimously.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Has it been appealed?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is going to be appealed.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Why don't they do it?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It takes a little time.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Would the honourable
senator have the government carry on under
an illegal statute?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The decision of the court
was not unanimous. The court was divided
as to the legality.
As I say, we have listened to many
speeches by Liberals in opposition to prohibition or restriction. Now, although we
are importing butter from the United States,
we are entirely prohibited from selling it to
that country. A prohibition is worse than a
tariff.
The action to which I have called attention will be regretted from one end of this
country to the other, because of its adverse
effects upon an industry and a class of people
that should be encouraged. Dairying is a
family industry and a valuable training
ground; to discourage it will bring nothing
but trouble in this country. Already we are
importing about $100 million worth of oil,
and the country will be that much poorer for
the transaction.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I recall that this house
passed unanimously a resolution asking the
government to refer to the Supreme Court of
Canada the question of oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It was not passed unanimously.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend,
as one of the members of this house, has to
take some of the blame for that action,
because the motion was adopted without a
dissenting voice.

APRIL 29, 1949
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not taking any
blame.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Under the constitution
of this country jurisdiction is divided between
the Dominion and the provincial legislatures.
The Supreme Court bas found that to prohibit the manufacture of margarine in
Canada is not within the jurisdiction of the
federal government. Therefore it is left to
the provinces to decide what they should do.
I think I am in a f air position to take the
stand I am taking now, because I voted on
two occasions against the oleomargarine bill.
We are living in a period in which the
provinces try to pass the buck to the federal
government when things do not run "according to Hoyle", and I think the Dairy Council
of Canada should make its complaints to the
provinces. The Supreme Court of Canada has
ruled that the federal government has no
jurisdiction to prohibit the manufacture and
sale of oleomargarine, and if the Dairy Council questions that decision it should appeal to
the Privy Council. I think both my honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) and the Dairy Council are unduly
alarmed. A few days ago in another place
the government was asked what quantity of
butter had been bought under the floor price,
and I think the answer was that it was very
litile.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Two and a half million
pounds.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, 21 million
pounds of butter is only about two days'
butter supply for the whole of Canada. If
my honourable friends are telling the truth
about the situation in Saskatchewan, that
province will not have a blade of grass to
produce any butter this coming summer.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We can produce butter
by feeding Russian thistle to our cattle, and
the drier the weather the more Russian
thistle there will be.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If my honourable
friend is going to bring prosperity to Saskatchewan with Russian thistle, he does not
know as much about Russian thistle as I do.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The wise farmers are
going to hang on to their cattle by feeding
them Russian thistle. That is what I mean.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Let the Dairy Council
make their representations to the provinces.
If they do not approve of the decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada, they can appeal
to the Privy Council for final judgment.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The federal government
could prohibit the importation of fats and
oils. They are good at prohibiting.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
knows better than I do that Canada can produce enough fats and oils for the manufacture of oleomargarine. In my part of the
country we grow sunflower seed, rapeseed,
soy-bean and so forth. We can produce
sufficient fats and oils to produce oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Why have we imported
$95 million worth of oils then?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, if
we have to depend on the oils produced in
Canada to manufacture oleomargarine I do
not think we will have to worry. The thing
to be feared is the importation of oils in tank
freighters from countries where half-naked
men run up coconut trees, pull down the
coconuts and extract the oil. I am not in
favour of putting the Canadian farmers in
competition with this kind of labour. The
Dairy Council in good faith should have
appealed the decision of the Supreme Court
of Canada which was divided in its opinion.
My complaint today is that when I go into
eating places I am served with margarine
instead of butter. Eating places charge high
enough prices to be able to afford to furnish
their customers with butter. There is no
protection for the eating public of Canada
against this imposition.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is nobody in this
chamber for whom I have a greater liking
than my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), but I must confess that
I do not know what caused his remarks.
Under the recent decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada -the regulation of the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine lies wholly
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. It
is quite true that the federal government
could restrict imports by raising duties on
imported fats and oils to a prohibitive level.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is done in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I cannot see why my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Horner) has
brought up this question. Perhaps it is
because we are approaching an electionHon. Mr. Horner: Oh, no.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and the old war-horse
is eager to get into action.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Being an old politician
himself, I can understand my honourable
friend thinking so.

Sorne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: All jesting aside, it is
quite beyond my imagination why anyone

SENATE

should think, in the face of the decision made
on a constitutional point by the Supreme
Court of Canada, that the federal government can do anything to control the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in this
country. As to whether the sale of oleomargarine should be permitted in this
country, I need only refer to the views I have
already expressed to this house on other
occasions. There is very substantial and
incontrovertible evidence that oleomargarine
is a healthy food. If that is so, why should
the tens of thousands of families in this
country who find it difficult to make ends
meet be deprived of the opportunity to buy
a spread for their bread which costs less
than butter? I shall repeat what has been said
in former debates in this house: that for
scores of years some of the finest dairy
countries in the world have authorized
the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine.
I think it is a complete misconception to
think that the sale of margarine in Canada
will destroy our dairy industry. I am sure
that my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
will not take offence at my remarks. The
question is one which the federal government
cannot deal with except by restricting
importation through prohobitive customs
tariffs, which it undoubtedly has the power
to do.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It taxes soft drinks. Why
could it not impose a tax on margarine?
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am advised that there is no prospect of our
receiving legislation from another place in

time to have the Royal Assent before 6
o'clock. Therefore I suggest that the house
adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at
8 o'clock this evening.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8 o'clock the sitting was resumed.

determined under Article VI or an exporting
country finds difficulty in exercising its right
to sell its unfulfilled guaranteed quantities at
prices consistent with the minimum prices
so specified or determined, it may have resort

Quantities
1. The Council shall keep records for each
crop-year of those transactions and parts of

transactions in wheat which are part of the
guaranteed quantities in Annexes A and B
to Article III.
2. A transaction or part of a transaction in
wheat grain between an exporting country
and an importing country shall be entered in
the Council's records against the guaranteed
quantities of those countries for a crop-year:
(a) provided that (i) it is at a price not
higher than the maximum nor lower than the
minimum specified in or determined under

SENATE

Article VI for that crop-year, and (ii) the
exporting country and the importing country
have not agreed that it shall not be entered
against their guaranteed quantities; and
(b) to the extent that (i) both the exporting
and the importing country concerned have
unfulfilled guaranteed quantities for that
crop-year, and (ii) the loading period specified
in the transaction falls within that crop-year.
3. If the exporting country and the importing country concerned so agree, a transaction
or part of a transaction made under an agreement for the purchase and sale of wheat
entered into prior to the entry into force of
Part 2 of this Agreement shall, irrespective
of price but subject to the conditions in (b)
of paragraph 2 of this Article, also be entered
in the Council's records against the guaranteed quantities of those countries.
4. If a commercial contract or governmental agreement on the sale and purchase
of wheat-flour contains a statement, or if the
exporting country and the importing country
concerned inform the Council that they are
agreed, that the price of such wheat-flour is
consistent with the prices specified in or
determined under Article VI, the wheat grain
equivalent of such wheat-flour shall, subject
to the conditions prescribed in (a) and (b) of
paragraph 2 of this Article, be entered in the
Council's records against the guaranteed
quantities of those countries. If the commercial contract of governmental agreement does
not contain a statement of the nature referred
to above and the exporting country and the
importing country concerned do not agree
that the price of the wheat-flour is consistent
with the prices specified in or determined
under Article VI, either of those countries
may, unless they have agreed that the wheat
grain equivalent of that wheat-flour shall not
be entered in the Council's records against
their guaranteed quantities, request the Council to decide the issue. Should the Council,
on consideration of such a request, decide that
the price of such wheat-flour is consistent
with the prices specified in or determined
under Article VI, the wheat grain equivalent
of the wheat-flour shall be entered against
the guaranteed quantities of the exporting
and importing countries concerned, subject to
the conditions prescribed in (b) of paragraph
2 of this Article. Should the Council, on
consideration of such a request, decide that
the price of such wheat-flour is inconsistent
with the prices specified in or determined
under Article VI, the wheat grain equivalent
of the wheat-flour shall not be so entered.
5. The Council shall prescribe rules of
procedure, in accordance with the following
provisions, for the reporting and recording
of transactions which are part of the guaranteed quantities:

(a) Any transaction or part of a transaction,
between an exporting country and an importing country, qualifying under paragraph 2, 3,
or 4 of this Article to form part of the
guaranteed quantities of those countries shall
be reported to the Council within such period
and in such detail and by one or both of those
countries as the Council shall lay down in its
rules of procedure.
'b) Any transaction or part of a transaction
reported in accordance with the provisions of
subparagraph (a) shall be entered in the
Council's records against the guaranteed
quantities of the exporting country and tha
importing country between which the transaction is made.
(c) The order in which transactions and
parts of transactions shall be entered in the
Council's records against the guaranteed
quantities shall be prescribed by the Council
in its rules of procedure.
(d) The Council shall, within a time to be
prescribed in its rules of procedure, notify
each exporting country and each importing
country of the entry of any transaction or
part of a transaction in the Council's records
against the guaranteed quantities of that
country.
(e) If, within a period which the Council
shall prescribe in its rules of procedure, the
importing country or the exporting country
concerned objects in any respect to the entry
of a transaction or part of a transaction in the
Council's records against its guaranteed
quantities, the Council shall review the
matter and, if it decides that the objection is
well-founded,
shall amend its records
accordingly.
(f) If any exporting or importing country
considers it probable that the full amount of
wheat already entered in the Council's
records against its guaranteed quantity for
the current crop-year will not be loaded
within that crop-year, that country may
request the Council to make appropriate
reductions in the amounts entered in its
records. The Council shall consider the matter
and, if it decides that the request is justified,
shall amend its records accordingly.
(g) Any wheat purchased by an importing
country from an exporting country and resold
to another importing country may, by agreement of the importing countries concerned,
be entered against the unfulfilled guaranteed
purchases of the importing country to which
the wheat is finally resold provided that a
coresponding reduction is made in the amount
entered against the guaranteed purchases of
the first importing country.
(h) The Council shall send to all exporting
and importing countries, weekly or at such
other interval as the Council may prescribe

4. The Executive Committee may, in consultation with the Advisory Committee on
Price Equivalents, at any date subsequent
to August 1, 1949, designate any description
of wheat other than those specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 above and determine the
minimum and maximum price equivalents
thereof; provided that in the case of any
other description of wheat the price equivalent of which has not yet been determined,
the minimum and maximum prices for the
time being shall be derived from the minimum and maximum prices of the description
of wheat specified in this Article, or subsequently designated by the Executive Committee in consultation with the Advisory
Committee on Price Equivalents, which is
most closely comparable to such other
description, by the addition of an appropriate premium or by the deduction of an
appropriate discount.
5. If any exporting or importing country
represents to the Executive Committee that
any price equivalent established under paragraph 2, 3, or 4 of this Article is, in the light
of current transportation or exchange rates
or market premiums or discounts, no longer
fair, the Executive Committee shall consider
the matter and may, in consultation with the
Advisory Committee on Price Equivalents,
make such adjustment as it considers desirable.
6. If a dispute arises as to what premium
or discount is appropriate for the purposes of
paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article in respect

of any description of wheat specified in paragraph 2 or 3 or designated under paragraph 4
of this Article, the Executive Committee, in
consultation with the Advisory Committee
on Price Equivalents, shall on the request of
the exporting or importing country concerned
decide the issue.
7. All decisions of the Executive Committee under paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of this
Article shall be binding on all exporting and
importing countries, provided that any of
those countries which considers that any
such decision is disadvantageous to it may
ask the Council to review that decision.
8. In order to encourage and expedite the
conclusion of transactions in wheat between
them at prices mutually acceptable in the
light of all the circumstances, the exporting
and importing countries, while reserving to
themselves complete liberty of action in the
determination and administration of their
internal agricultural and price policies, shall
endeavour not to operate those policies in
such a way as to impede the free movement
of prices between the maximum price and
the minimum price in respect of transactions
in wheat into which the exporting and importing countries are prepared to enter. Should any
exporting or importing country consider that
it is suffering hardship as the result of such
policies, it may draw the attention of the
Council to the matter and the Council shall
inquire into and make a report on the
complaint.
ARTICLE VII

Stocks
1. In order to assure supplies of wheat to
importing countries, each exporting country
shall endeavour to maintain stocks of old crop
wheat at the end of its crop-year at a level
adequate to ensure that it will fulfil its guaranteed sales under this Agreement in each
subsequent crop-year.
2. In the event of a short crop being harvested by an exporting country, particular
consideration shall be given by the Council
to the efforts made by that exporting country to maintain adequate stocks as required
by paragraph 1 of this Article before that
country is relieved of any of its obligations
under Article X.
3. In order to avoid disproportionate purchases of wheat at the beginning and end of
a crop-year, which might prejudice the
stabilization of prices under this Agreement
and render difficult the fulfilment of the
obligations of al exporting and importing
countries, importing countries shall endeavour to maintain adequate stocks at all times.

PROROGATION 0F PARLIAMENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a comtmunication from
the Assistant Secretary ai the Governor
General; acquaintlng hlm that the Hon.
Thibaudeau Rinfret, acting as Deputy af His
Excellency the Governor General, would proceed to the Senate Chamber this day at 12

CANADA'S NATIONAL CAPITAL
DOCUMENTS TABLE

Hon. WIshart McL. Robertson: I should like
ta table copies ln Engllsh and in French ai
the preliminary repart by Jacques Greber,
Consultant to the National Capital Planning
Commlttee, on the plan for the National
Capital. I should alsa like to table a memorandum by the National Capital Planning Committee which contains commenta relating ta
the proposed plan.
The present preliminary report by Mr.
Greber has been endorsed by the National
Capital Planning Committee and the Federal
District Commission. It was forwarded by
the commission ta the government only this
week, and as yet the governament has had no
apportunity to study IL. However, ln view ai
the frequent indications by honourable members ai their interest in the report and their
desire to have it made public at as early a
date as possible, it seems best ta table it at
this stage. Certain parts of the plan have
been submitted separately from. time ta time
ta the government and have been appraved
in order that same preliminary arrangements
might ga f orward. Information about these
had been communicated ta the house at
variaus times. The present prelizninary report
will be fallowed at a later date by a final
revised report, which will not differ lu substance but will contain additianal plans and
maps.
The idea of develaplug the capital ai Canada
so as ta take advantage ai its splendid natural
location in the City ai Ottawa, and ta produce
a city apprapriate ta the stature af Canada, has
engaged the attention ai Canadian statesmen
ever since this country became a nation. Even
bei are confederation, a step was taken to make
29091-26j

the best use of this location. Sir John A.
Macdonald had the vision to seize upon the
commanding site of Parliament Hili for the
three central buildings of the capital. Ris
plan to use the entire hill in that way was
attacked at- the time as being excessively
grandiose, costly, and far beyond the needs af
the country. Had bis critics been listened to,
the capital of Canada would not accupy its
Sir Wilfrid
present impressive situation.
Laurier etsablished the Ottawa Improvement
Commission, which subsequently became the
Federal District Commission. In 1913 Sir
Robert Borden set up the Hoit Commission to
prepare plans for the capital, but the advent
of the First World War prevented its execution. Since that time the Right Honourable
W. L. Mackenzie King has been the moving
spirit in the project ta create a better national
capital. He has given generously of bis assistance, counsel and encouragement, and the
present report is the outcome of his initiative.
I mention the interest af these four great
leaders af Canada mn the development af the
National Capital in order to emphasize that
this is not a political. or controversial matter
in any way.
The plan I arn tabllng is not a goverrument
plan, but is a report based upon objective and
expert study ta determine how, in building a
capital of wbich every Canadian will be praud,
we can make the best use of what nature has
provided. Perhaps I should also stress the
iact that the production af the present plan is
a beginning, nat an end; it is a guide to help
in the long-term development af the capital
as it grows with the needs of Canada over
many years. Plans for the National Capital
have been produced before, and the capital has
suflered because those plans were not followed. Each year's unplanned grawth has
made proper development more difficult and
costly. It is ta be hoped that the present plan
will ensure a sound basis for future development. Co-operation from, the provinces, and
especially from the municipalities, wil be
needed. For instance, the proper zaning which
is essential can anly be provided by the
municipalities. With ca-operation and the
foresight ta appreciate the great development that Canada will achieve, we can
undoubtedly produce one af the most beautifui capitals in the world.
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: May I ask my
hanourable friend a question? I da not intend
it ta be embarrassing. Has the government
given any indication ai when, if It is returned
ta power-as I amn sure it will be-i4t expects
to start carrying out the plan which the
honaurable leader has s0 well outlined ta this
chamber?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am unable to give a definite answer to my
right honourable friend's question.
My
impression is that an appropriation for the
National Capital Fund was included in the
estimates of last year, and I fancy there is a
similar item in this year's estimates. Unlike
ordinary votes of money, an appropriation
for this fund does not expire at the end of
the fiscal year in which it is voted, but
remains in effect until utilized; and I think
that the amount standing to the credit of the
fund has reached a considerable size. I believe
the proposed bridge across the Rideau canal
and perhaps other parts of the scheme are in
process of being carried out, or at any rate
that negotiations with respect to them are
going on, but that the report now presented
deals principally with projected undertakings
which have not yet been finally approved and
may in fact be modified after further
consideration.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
wish to make a few remarks from my own
personal point of view, as I do not claim to
be speaking on behalf of any party. I believe
that first things should come first, and that
our primary concern should be to make sure
that we have a population healthy and
wealthy enough to support the kind of
national capital that is proposed. Instead of
spending large sums on tearing down properties that are giving good service to our
present population, it would be wiser to use
the money in irrigating large areas of the
West, and so making it possible for millions
of additional people to live out there. After
they had become established, the federal
treasury would have a larger income to support this proposed costly scheme of beautifying Ottawa.
Perhaps my feeling about this matter is
inspired to some degree by a Bible story
which I remember from my boyhood days,
the parable of a certain rich man. His land
was yielding plentiful crops, so much so that
he felt he did not have sufficient room in
which to store them, and he said "I will pull
down my barns, and build greater;" but just
as he made up his mind to do that his soul
was required of him. I suggest, honourable
senators, that it would be rather unfortunate
if we spent large sums of money on making
our national capital more beautiful, and afterwards lost the capital to an enemy because
our population was not large enough for our
own defence. I suppose the parable also was
intended to stress the superiority of spiritual
things over material wealth. These plans
for beautifying our national capital perhaps
reflect a certain pride in material develop-

ment, and it might be well if we took the
parable to heart, even at this date.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I should like to say just a word
about the report that has been tabled. At
nearly every session the plan for the development of Ottawa as a national capital is
referred to in this chamber without, seemingly, any appreciation of what has already
been done about the plan or what is proposed to be done. The booklet received
through the mail by every member of parliament and the extensive display of the Greber
plan for Ottawa in this morning's paper are
really the culmination of work done during
the past five years.
Five years ago a joint committee of both
houses was formed following the declaration
by the former Prime Minister, Mr. King, that
the capital city of Ottawa should be a fit
memorial to the men who fought in the
Canadian armed forces. After six weeks study
that committee presented a report, which
was unanimously adopted by parliament. It
has formed the basis not only for the establishment of a national capital city worthy of
its name, but also for the general improvement of the area within the jurisdiction of
the Federal District Commission.
This subject would have received much
more practical attention were we considering today the bill which should come up
this year concerning a grant by the federal
government to the city of Ottawa. Such a
bill would have brought into direct focus the
considerations which are at stake in this
whole matter. Without wishing to prolong
the discussion, I would venture to say that
when the election is over and a new session
is called in the fall, the subject of the federal
grant to the city of Ottawa will bring
directly to our attention the problems
involved in the carrying out of this proposed
plan, which is purely projective.
The Greber report is not the first of its
kind; thirty years ago we had the Holt
report, which in the main differed but slightly
from the projected plan now before us. There
are many practical problems affecting the city
of Ottawa, the surrounding municipalities and
the federal government. The remarks of my
honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) represent the natural considerations and the point of view of a person from
a distant province which is at an early stage
of its development and whose needs are still
great. Nevertheless, the establishment in
Ottawa and the surrounding district of a
capital worthy of the national aspirations
and sentiment of this country, is something

APRIL 30. 1949
very worth while; and wml have a far-reaching influence i the making of a Canada
which is i keeping with her pretentiaus
efforts, especially in an international way, to
assume the proportions of natlonhood.
If the members of this house and the other
place give careful consideration to this
report, and realize that it is the culrnination of a great deal of study and work, they
should give it their ready approval. I do
nat propose ta go into the details of the
problems whlch concern the parties ta the
praject, but they are very real. I do not
think that even gradual progress can be
made with the development until there is a
radical and fundamental change in the
relatianshlp between the federal autharities
and the municipalities involved. Whether
the development will require the creation
of a federal district, with a federal commission similar to the one that exists for the
District of Columbia, I arn not prepared ta
say; but a more definite and practical basis
of working out certain very important
problems involving assessment and taxation
li these municipalities wml be needed before
satisfactory progress can be made with this
plan.

many people throughout the country, mostly
farmers, have been unable to complete their
returns because of inability to get in touch
with their agents or accountants i the,
cities. The resulting delay is i no way their
f ault, and it wml work a hardship upon them
ta be required to pay a penalty when they
are not; ta blame.
My second reason for this request is that
in previaus years people have been accommodated-or if yau will, spoiled-by an
extension of one manth. This year the deadline is April 30th, and as it fails on Saturday,
the period for completing the report is still
further shortened by several hours. Moreover, I amn informed, the current farms were
not issued by the department until the end
of January, and it seems ta me that the
government, by way of compensation, might
well extend somewhat the period for the
return of the reports. I knaw that I reflect
the views of a large section of aur people i
making this request at this tirne.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I amn quite willing ta
communicate ta my colleagues the Minister
of Finance and the Minister of National
Revenue the suggestion of the honourable
member from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse).

INCOME TAI
TIME FOR FILING RETURNS
Hon. G. Lacasse: Honourable senators, if
I may be permltted, I should like ta draw
attention ta a matter which, it cannot be
denied, has some of the characteristics o! an
emergency. Today is the dead-line for the
payment a! income tax, and if that is not;
urgent, I do nat know what Is. Today also
is a Saturday, so that the time for Mling
returns does nat extend until xnldnlght; it
wml expire I twenty minutes. Ail the offices
in the country wM close at noon, and aur
people will be deprived of a full hall day,
which may mean a lot ta many of them.
I do nat; speak for myseif, because my
return is in. I worked on it ail nlght and
until 7 o'clock this morning, and although I
may be a "llate senator"' before my death,
my 1948 return is flled. But as I left my
room a !ew moments ago I met my accauntant, who gave me two very arresting facts
in support a! what I arn about ta say, and
i respect!ully appeal ta the representative
a! the gavernment In this chamber ta request
the powers that be, and speciftcaily the
Minister of Finance and the Minuster' o!
National Revenue, ta extend by a week or

The sittlng was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4
FIRST READING
A message was received from. the House of
Cammons with Bill 248, an Act for granting
ta His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the flnancial year ending
the 3lst of March, 1950.
The bill was read the flrst Urne.
SECOND READING
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of the bull.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
in the sarne f ormn as the Interim Supply Bill
passed by this house at the end of last March,
and today's procedure is the same as that
followed in April 1945, when parliament was
dissolved before the main estimates were
passed. Honourable senatars wll recall that
in the Interim Supply Bill that was before
us last March, one-sixth of the total estimates,
or two months' supply, was asked for. In

SENATE
addition, certain other sums were asked for
in order to cover expenditures that were not
evenly distributed throughout the financial
year but were heaviest in the opening months.
This time one-third of all the estimates,
$460,291,082, is asked for, and, as was the case
last March, certain additional sums are
requested.
Section 2 of the bill makes provision for
one-third of all estimates, and section 3 for
$541,666.67.
This additional sum, as is
explained in schedule A of the bill, is required
to provide for repairs and replacements to the
equipment of the Dominion Arsenals plant
of Canadian Arsenals Limited because of a
fire there. A further sum of $6,390,980.33 is
asked under section 4 of the bill. The explanation is contained in schedule B: agriculture
requires immediate moneys for reclamation
and flood prevention in the valley of the
Lillooet River in British Columbia. Other
sums also are required for the marketing of
agricultural products. The Fisheries Department anticipates heavier expenditure in the
items listed during the next few months. The
Department of Mines and Resources can only
carry out its surveys in the summer months,
and therefore, in addition to the one-third,
it is asking for certain sums. The amount
requested is one-sixth of the estimates listed
in schedule B.
Section 5 asks for $4,213,181, which is onetwelfth of the estimates listed in schedule C.
Section 6 does not refer to the main estimates,
but is based on the supplementary estimates
for Newfoundland. It makes provision for
$7,362,243.33, which is one-third of the total
Newfoundland estimates, excepting votes 673
and 721. These two are excepted because the
greater part of them has already been voted.
Section 7 votes one-sixth of the items in
schedule D to the bill. They are additional
amounts required in respect of Newfoundland
expenditures.
Honourable senators, I think it is safe to
say that, regardless of what happens in the
next few months, there will be no interruption
of the long-established practice whereby
honourable senators have full opportunity to
discuss the estimates before the passing of the
main supply bill. I recommend this bill to
the favourable consideration of the house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

After which the Right Honourable the
Deputy of the Governor General was pleased
to close the Fifth Session of the Twentieth
Parliament of Canada with the following
Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:

Members of the House of Commons:
In opening the present session, I stated that the
first concern of government in world affairs is to
ensure peace and security. To this end, the North
Atlantic Treaty was signed at Washington on April
4, after its principles had been overwhelmingly
approved by both houses. I am gratified that you
have given unanimous approval to the treaty which
it is the intention to ratify at an early date.
There has been deep satisfaction throughout the
country at the completion of the original plan of
confederation by the admission of Newfoundland as
the tenth province on March 31.
Provision was made for the continuance of certain
transitional measures, of the Agricultural Products
Act and of the Foreign Exchange Control Act. My
government has welcomed your approval of the
International Wheat Agreement which it la hoped
will be approved by a sufficient number of signatories to bring it into force on July 1, 1949.
As further instalments in the government's policy
to provide a national standard of social security,
you have passed measures designed to broaden the

scope of the Family Allowances Act and to increase
the amount of pension paid by the Federal Government under the Old Age Pensions Act.
Other measures enacted during this session include bills respecting the control and regulation of
interprovincial and international pipe lines, the
Judges Act, the National Parks Act, Mail Contracts
and the Canadian Commercial Corporation.
Members of the House of Commons:

I thank you for making provision for essential
services for the period required for the holding of
a general election and the assembling of a new
Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May

Divine Providence

continue

country with peace and prosperity.
