SENATE
You will be requested to enact measures to
give effect, with modifications, to certain of
the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Publications.
Legislation respecting the Senate will be
introduced.
To ensure that the redistribution of electoral
districts is made objectively and impartially,
you will be asked to approve a bill to establish an independent commission to recommend redistribution.
A measure will be placed before you to
establish an Indian Claims Commission to
investigate claims on the part of various
tribes and bands that certain of their rights
have been restricted or abrogated, and to
make recommendations for the equitable and
final settlement of such claims.
Economic activity in Canada has moved
ahead sharply. This strong advance has
resulted in more than 200,000 new jobs during
the past twelve months. The objective of my
Government is to accelerate this pace of
advance. This would mean the creation over
the next five years of more than one million
new jobs and a corresponding growth in gross
national product and in production for both
the export and domestie market, already at
record levels.
Such high levels of activity have not
prevented the emergence of foreign exchange
difficulties similar to those which confronted
Canada in crisis proportions in 1947, and to
those which have affected other major trading nations more recently. In June my Government found it necessary to put into immediate effect a comprehensive program to
strengthen the country's exchange reserves.
Since that time Canada's exchange reserves
have increased substantially. It is my Government's firm intention to remove the import
surcharges included in this program as soon
as circumstances permit.
My Government will continue to take positive, constructive measures to strengthen
Canada's balance of international payments.
The recently stabilized exchange rate for the
Canadian dollar has greatly helped Canadian
producers in all parts of Canada both in the
domestic and export markets. The new exchange rate is contributing as well to a large
expansion in the Canadian tourist industry,
which bas also been aided by joint efforts of
the federal and provincial governments.
Canada's development will continue to
require imports of capital, and to this end my
Government will maintain a climate in
Canada hospitable to foreign investment.
As one of my Government's measures to
develop the Canadian economy, maintain a
high level of employment and strengthen the
balance of payments, you will be asked to

approve legislation establishing a National
Economic Development Board. This board
would be broadly representative and would
review and report upon the state of the
economy and upon economic policies. It would
also have the duty of recommending to the
Government particular projects or measures
which it considers would be in the interest
of national development, including projects
which may require direct governmental participation by way of financial aid or otherwise.
The objective of my ministers is a balanced
budget. This will require the exercise of restraint in respect of controllable spending and
an increased concentration of available resources on essential national projects designed
to ensure the expansion of the Canadian
economy. Steps will be taken to improve
further the efficiency of government operations. The report of the Royal Commission
on Government Organization will be helpful
in achieving this improvement of administration while maintaining the high status of the
Canadian public service. A program of economies in government expenditures will be
reflected in the revised estimates to be placed
before you.
A royal commission has been established
to review the whole field of federal taxation
and its impact on the Canadian economy,
and to recommend reforms and improvements.
The purposes of the fiscal measures to be
placed before you at this session will be the
creation of better employment opportunities
for the Canadian people, the promotion of a
high rate of economic growth, the strengthening of Canada's balance of international payments and the maintenance of stability in
prices. New budget measures will be introduced to provide further solutions to longterm problems.
My ministers will re-introduce the resolutions submitted in the last budget which had
as its central purpose the encouragement of
economic growth. This will include the production incentive provided to manufacturing
and processing companies by cancelling onehalf of the tax on the first $50,000 of taxable
income arising from increased sales and onequarter of the increased tax on any additional
income arising from increased sales. It will
also include the measure to grant to individuals and companies the right to charge
petroleum drilling and exploration expenses
against income from oil and gas production,
and to permit certain expenditures made to
acquire oil and gas rights to be deductible
for tax purposes. The measure to allow a
special tax credit in respect of provincial
logging taxes will also be re-introduced in
order to remove discrimination in the taxation
of logging operations. Iron mining companies
will be added to the list of companies which

SEPTEMBER 27, 1962
are exempt from the special tax on income
earned in Canada by branches of non-resident
corporations. The measure will also be reintroduced to increase by $50 per year the
income tax deductions allowed for children.
My Government intends to press forward
in co-operation with Canadian industry to
secure a greater and more rapid application
of science to industrial production. You will
be asked to approve the new tax incentive
announced in the last budget for corporations
undertaking increased expenditures on scientific research in Canada. Dramatic evidence
of successful co-operation between Canadian
science and industry has been given this week
in the opening of Canada's first nuclear power
generating station.
Canada's prosperity and growth must ultimately rest in large measure upon its exports.
To achieve adequate export levels it will be
necessary to increase further Canada's capacity to produce competitively and its ability
to sell in export markets. The Government's
industrial programs are directed toward these
ends. Its commercial policy negotiations have
the objective of opening additional markets
to Canadian producers in fair exchange for
opportunities for others to sell in Canada.
The vigorous campaign of export trade promotion will be expanded to enlarge the sales
of Canadian products in foreign markets. You
will be asked to provide the funds necessary
for this increasing trade promotion work.
Amendments to the Export Credits Insurance
Act will also be placed before you, to double
the insurance liability which the corporation
may assume and to improve the arrangements
for long-term financing.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of an Atlantic Development Board to
advise on measures and projects that will
promote the economic development of the
Atlantic region of Canada.
Amendments will be requested in the Industrial Development Bank Act to enlarge
still further this bank's important role in
national development.
The prosperity of agriculture remains essential to the well-being of the entire Canadian
economy. Canada is blessed this year with
very large crops of good quality, and export
markets for Canadian agricultural products
have been greatly enlarged.
My ministers recognize that livestock is
occupying a position of increasing importance
in Canadian agriculture. They propose that a
program be instituted to ensure the availability
of storage facilities and continuity of supplies
of feed grain to match the expanding requirements for livestock production, particularly in
the areas of British Columbia and eastern
Canada where supplies of feed grain are
normally deficient.

The program of rehabilitation and development of agricultural lands is proceeding actively and you will be asked to provide funds
for it.
Legislation will be proposed to enlarge the
funds of the Farm Credit Corporation, and
allow greater flexibility in their use.
The need for training in agriculture and the
present facilities have also been under review
and as a sequel to these studies, a national
conference on agricultural training is to be
convened this fall.
The development and use of Canada's
resources of energy must be a central feature
of the program for national economic growth.
The Twenty-Fourth Parliament has laid the
groundwork for this in the National Energy
Board Act and in other measures.
It is hoped that arrangements will soon be
completed that will make it possible to submit
for your approval the Columbia River Treaty
and the legislation required in Parliament to
implement it.
The national oil policy introduced by the
Government two years ago has brought about
a gratifying increase in the production and
sale of Canadian oil.
Studies will be continued, in co-operation
with the provinces, in relation to the long
distance high voltage transmission of electrical
power and the development of potential
sources of hydro-electric power with a view
to the ultimate establishment of a national
power grid, which will facilitate the orderly
utilization of the hydro-electric potential of
Canada in the interests of expanding Canadian
development and progress. Discussions are in
progress with the Government of Manitoba
in respect to studies of the Nelson River
system.
My ministers have come to the conclusion
that large scale, long-term contracts for the
export of power surplus to Canada's needs,
present and potential, should now be encouraged in order to expedite the development
of major power projects in Canada which
are too large to be supported by the domestic
market. Such exports can also strengthen our
balance of payments.
In recognition of the important role of
transportation in the Canadian economy, you
will be asked to approve measures to give
effect to recommendations of the Royal Commission on Transportation which has now
completed its comprehensive analysis of the
Canadian railway problem. These changes are
intended to remove the need for general
horizontal freight rate increases which have
borne so heavily in the past upon certain
areas and groups of producers. You will also
be asked to provide for an extension of the
Freight Rates Reduction Act and the other
interim railway subsidies provided by appropriation.

SENATE
Amendments will be proposed to the Canada Shipping Act to preserve for Canadian
vessels the coasting trade in the St. Lawrence
and Great Lakes area. Funds will be requested
to implement the program of shipbuilding
subsidies announced some months ago.
You will be asked to provide for the continuation of the winter works program to assist
municipalities in meeting seasonal unemployment.
Far-reaching changes are taking place in
manpower requirements in Canadian industries as a result of automation, other technological developments and world competitive
pressures. A measure will be placed before
you designed to assist employers, workers
and their organizations in meeting the impact
of industrial change.
My Government will also place before you
legislation to provide safeguards against accidents and hazards in works and undertakings
within the federal fields of jurisdiction.
The committee inquiring into matters relating to the Unemployment Insurance Fund
is expected to submit its report this autumn.
Following consideration of this report, appropriate measures will be placed before you.
In order to permit the introduction of a
national system of contributory old age pensions with disability and survivor benefits,
an amendment to the British North America
Act is required. The governments of all provinces except Quebec and Newfoundland have
concurred in such an amendment. My Government is prepared to recommend to you
the approval of an Address to Her Majesty
requesting the amendment when the concurrence of these remaining provinces has been
received.
As pension plans have become ever more
widely extended in Canadian business, it has
been increasingly recognized that measures
are essential to protect the interests of those
affected and in particular to ensure that the
benefits earned are portable when workers
move from job to job. Provincial Legislation
would be required for this purpose in most
cases, and several provinces are considering
proposals of this nature. My Government will
be prepared to place before you complementary legislation to deal with industries under
federal jurisdiction when adequate progress
has been made by provinces.
A measure will be placed before you to
authorize the establishment of a national
council of welfare to make more fully effective the action of both federal and provincial
governments in this field.
You will be asked to approve amendments
to the Food and Drugs Act to provide for
more effective control of the distribution and
sale of drugs in the interests of the public
health.

You will be asked to enact legislation to
provide for the establishment of a National
Medical Research Council.
Legislation will be re-introduced to authorize the payment by federal crown corporations of certain provincial commodity taxes
and fees.
Legislation will be proposed on university
grants which will include authorization of
payment of the higher grants announced some
months ago and will provide alternative arrangements where supplementary provincial
grants are made in lieu of federal grants.
A bill will be introduced to authorize a
revision and codification of all federal statutes.
Bills will be introduced to amend the
Judges Act, the Aeronautics Act, the Bankruptcy Act, the Coal Production Assistance
Act and the Currency, Mint and Exchange
Fund Act, and other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to appropriate the funds
required to carry on the services and payments approved by Parliament.
You will be asked to abolish closure and to
re-establish the special committee on procedure of the House.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the Commons,
I pray that God in His wisdom may enlighten you in the discharge of your duty
towards our country.

THE LATE SENATORS WALL, BOIS
AND BRUNT
TRIBUTES

Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
it is with deep regret that I rise on this sad
occasion, one which marks the opening of
so many sessions of the Senate. I must advise you that since we last sat in this chamber three most esteemed colleagues have
passed to that "undiscover'd country, from
whose bourn no traveller returns". None of
the three senators had been long Her Majesty's servants in this chamber, but all left
behind them a record of distinguished service
on behalf of Canada.
The youngest, a man who indeed was in
the prime of life, and yet the senior of the
three, was Senator William Wall, of Winnipeg. Senator Wall was born in Canada of
Ukrainian parents and was the first Canadian
of Ukrainian descent to be appointed to the
Senate. He himself described his appointment to this body as "a recognition of progress and contributions which had been
made by Canadian Ukrainians in this country
where they have found the freedom and
opportunity to develop economically, politically, socially, and culturally".
Senator Wall was a graduate of the University of Manitoba and studied at Yale and
Harvard. He held the degrees of Bachelor of
Arts, Bachelor of Education, and Master of
Education followed by extensive postgraduate
work in educational administration. He came
to the Senate as a distinguished representative of the educational field of western Canada. He served as a school principal and
school administrator. From 1946 to 1953 he
was President of the Ukrainian Catholic
Council of Canada. He was active in the Canadian army reserve, where he held the rank
of lieutenant-colonel, and in many worthwhile
organizations in his native province of Manitoba.
Since being summoned to the Senate on
July 28, 1955 he had been known to all as one
most energetic and interested in the work
of the Senate. During my short time here I
knew him as one of our most capable, hardworking and respected senators.
I know that this expression joins with
that of the late senator's many friends in all

parts of Canada when I say to his widow
and two children that we mourn with them
in his passing. We assure them that he will
be long remembered here where his contribution over the years stands forth so clearly
in the annals of this house.
We also very deeply regret the passing
of a distinguished son of the province of
Quebec, Senator Henri-Charles Bois, who
passed away at his farm home south of Montreal, only last July. I did not have the honour of knowing Senator Bois well, as he had
been ill much of the time since my appointment to the Senate. However, I knew him
by reputation as a distinguished Canadian
who, while in this chamber and throughout
his lifetime, had made an unexcelled contribution to the life of Canada. He was very
well known, particularly in his own province
of Quebec, where in the field of agronomy
especially he was acknowledged as one of that
province's foremost experts.
The late senator was educated at Lévis
College, held a Bachelor of Arts degree from
Laval University, was a graduate of Oka Agricultural Institute, and of Cornell University.
His pursuit of excellence in his chosen field
took him to Paris, France, where he continued his studies in agronomy. He saw military service in the armies of this nation in
the First World War. He was Professor of
Rural Economy at the Oka Agricultural Institute, Chief of the Rural Economy Service
of the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, and
was an active promoter and supporter of
the co-operative movement in the province
of Quebec. He was also a member of the
Royal Commission on Prices in 1948-49.
In his passing Canada has lost an expert in
the field of agriculture who will be sorely
missed, and we in this chamber have lost
a respected and esteemed friend. To his widow
and children I offer my deepest condolences.
All honourable senators will recall the
deep sense of shock with which we received
the news that our good friend Senator William R. Brunt had been killed in a motor
accident on July 7 near his birthplace at
Hanover, Ontario. We all knew Senator
Brunt as a robust and vigorous man who
warmed his hands before the fire of life.
He was an ardent sporting enthusiast who
loved to golf and was proud of his thoroughbred racing stable. As a lawyer and businessman he was monumentally successful. His
cheerful, frank personality won him many
friends.
Born on October 24, 1902 of Canadian
parents of English and Irish descent, he
received his education at Hanover public and
high schools and studied at St. Andrew's
College, University of Toronto, and Osgoode
Hall. He left his law office and his many

OCTOBER 2, 1962
business interests to corne ta the service of
Canada in the Senate an October 12, 1957.
During bis five years here he was known as
a man wha was neyer faund wanting when
work was ta be doneý. He was active an many
standing cammittees, as were the other departed senators ta, whom 1 have referred, and
everywhere throughout the Senate the resuits of his vigour and energy were ta be
feit.
Ail honourable senators will, I know, jain
me in expressing ta Senatar Brunt's widaw
and twa children aur sincere sympathy in
this loss which we share with tbem. Senatar
Brunt will be remembered always as a
distinguished Canadian and a leader in every
field ta which he turned his boundless energy
and great capabîlîties.
To quate the wards af the late Senatar
Arthur Meighen af some years ago: "The
vision af man is short but the range af events
is long."
H-onourable senatars, as I recalled briefly
the biographies af these three praminent
departed-colleagues of aurs, I could nat help
thinking haw representative of Canada they
were and how appropriate had been their
selectian and appointment ta the Senate of
Canada, one each claiming descent from the
twa great mother countries of Canada, France
and Britain, and the third a representative of the other great ethnic groups who
have done sa much ta assist in extending,
developîng, and building aur beioved country; one an outstanding agriculturist, one an
autstanding educationallst, one an outstanding
prafessional and businessman, each indicating
the great possibîlities with the type of men
we have in this branch of aur Gavernmnent,
the Senate, for wark and service ta Canada.
They will indeed be sadly missed.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Hanourable
senators, when Parliament was praragued in
April littie did we think that we were seeing
Senatar Wall and Senatar Brunt for the last
time. With Senator Bais, it was somewhat
different. He was a sick man when he left
Ottawa and his passing did nat came ta us
with such suddenness. I shall refer first to
the late Senatar Wall, then ta Senatar Brunt,
and then ta Senatar Bois.
Senator Wall, as the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) said, was
the son of Ukrainian parents. He was the
first of his natianality ta be sumimoned ta the
Senate and hie proved himself ta be a wortby
representative of bis people. He was proud
of themn and they were praud of him. Senator
Wall was a schalarly, Christian gentleman
with a keen analytical mind. He was a close
student of national and international affairs
and bad represented Canada abroad on
several important missions.
27511-5-2

The late Senator Wall took an active part
in the work of the Senate, contributing much
ta it bath in the chamber and in committee.
He was mast thoraugh in ahl he did. When
hie spoke we always knew what hie was
talking about. He spake with conviction and
anly after acquiring a complete understanding of bis subi ect. In other words, hie always
did bis homework.
Our immigration pahicy annoyed him. He
was impatient with Parliament's seeming
delay in bringing in certain ameudments of
which he approved ta bath the act and the
regulations. He did not advocate a wide-open
palicy, but he did think that aur selective
palicy was f ar taa narrow for a young,
vigorous, Christian country. He championed
the cause o! those who advocated wbat he
thaugbt ta be a more realistic palicy.
Senator Wall was a devautly religiaus man;
hie was an outspoken and courageous oppanent of communism, about which be neyer
failed ta express bis views wben the occasion
arase.
Honourable senatars, may I naw refer ta
aur late colleague, the Honaurable William
R. Brunt. The news of Senator Brunt's tragic
death came ta us with shocking sadness. Sa
stunned were we that it was days before we
realized he would be no longer with us, or,
shall 1 say, that in future hie would be witb
us in spirit anly.
From the day Senator Brunt entered the
Senate he took a vital part in aur work i
ail its aspects. He was found regularly in
his place, and we shaîl not soan farget his
keen and lively interest in everytbing and
anything that had ta do with the Senate.
He was a close friend and confidant of the
]Prime Minister and was high in the cauncils
o! bis party, but it was his association with
the Senate that brought us close ta hlm,
often with different political views but always as friends.
Senator Brunt, a lawyer by profession, attained the highest bonour which can be bestawed upon a barrister by bis fellow barristers when hie was elected a Bencher of the
Law Society o! Upper Canada. He was promment also, as the honourable Leader o! the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) bas said, i
the business world. He was an ardent advo.
cate of the system of free enterprise. AIthough at all times !aitbful ta the Government which he had done s0 much ta elect,
he did not besitate to support Senate amendments aimed at improving government legislation, especially if its purpose was ta free
private enterprise fram what hie felt ta be too
much government interference.
Honourable senators, these twa Canadian
statesmen, Senatar Wall and Senator Brunt,
wba have been called ta their reward in the

SENATE
prime of life, were continually active in
various aspects of our Canadian life, but their
interests were in different fields of endeavour
and apart from the Senate they had few interests in common. In many respects they
were direct opposites but they had one very
noticeable similarity. Each looked to his wife
for advice and encouragement. Seldom in our
corridors did you see either senator alone.
Each was always in the company of his dear
wife, whose friendship and greetings to her
husband's friends will not soon be forgotten.
In the passing of these two senators Canada
loses two of its most public-spirited citizens,
Parliament loses two of its most faithful senators, and two families suffer irreparable
loss. To Mrs. Wall and to Mrs. Brunt and their
families I join with the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) in extending our
deep and abiding sympathy.
May I now refer to our other distinguished
colleague, Senator Bois. He encouraged me to
speak French, and I feel it would be appreciated if you will bear with me while I pay
my tribute to him in his native tongue.
(Translation):
Senator Bois was an expert in all aspects of
agriculture. He had an extensive knowledge
of the agricultural conditions that prevail
throughout Canada, and he was particularly
familiar with the problems facing the farmers
in Quebec where he was held in great respect
as an agronomist.
He was known for his reserve. He did not
speak often in the Senate but when he did
he showed himself to be a learned man, well
informed, a distinguished university graduate.
His best contribution to the Senate was his
work on the special Land Use Committee, of
which he was an active member. He followed
its deliberations closely and with great interest, and he made an important speech in the
Upper House about the use of lands and
forests. Among other things, he said that in
his opinion there were too many unproductive lands and he recommended radical
reforms to increase production and, at the
same time, to secure for the farmers better
living conditions.
(Text):
Honourable senators, I join with the Leader
of the Government in extending to Madame
Bois and her sons, on the passing of this
distinguished Canadian, my deep sympathy.
Hon. Walter M. Aselline: Honourable senators, I wish to say a few words with respect
to our departed colleagues. I join with the
eloquent remarks which have been made by
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) and by the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald). I agree with all that
they have said.
First, I would like to say a few words
about my old friend, William R. Brunt. I knew

him much better than the other two senators
who departed from this earth and have gone
to their reward above. It was on the Sunday
morning following the death by accident of
Senator Brunt that I received a telephone message from Toronto, from our new senator, the
Honourable Mr. Willis, imparting the sad
news. I had seen Senator Brunt and talked
with him very shortly before in the city of
Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and his passing,
therefore, was a great shock to me. Immediately I made plans to fly to Toronto and
from there I proceeded to Hanover to attend
the funeral on the Tuesday afternoon. I received notice of his death before I heard of
the death of Senator Wall, which I understand took place on the same Saturday evening, July 7.
Although Senator Brunt had been a member
of the Senate only since 1957, I had known
him personally for over thirty years. I knew
him when he was a student-at-law in Toronto.
I had met him through his friendship with
a charming young lady from Rosetown, whom
he married a few years later. My wife and I
were guests at the wedding, which took place
in 1930. We were very closely associated from
that time on.
I have always described Senator Brunt as
the busiest man in Canada. At any rate, he
was one of the busiest men I had ever met.
He belonged to many clubs and societies,
he held several directorates, and was a distinguished lawyer and a keen businessman.
Senator Brunt was so active that I continually
tried to slow him down, but that was an impossibility. He put his whole heart and soul
into everything be attempted, including his
work in the Senate. He was a great believer
in the Senate as an important arm of government in Canada. As honourable senators know,
be was my deskmate in the Senate for four
years. In 1958 I nominated him as Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts. He was a very
capable chairman, and still held that position
at the time of his death.
Senator Brunt was a comparatively young
man when he died and his prospects for the
future were great. I for one mourn his tragic
death. His place in the Senate will be hard
to fill. To his widow, Helen, to his son and
daughter and other relatives, I extend my
deepest sympathy.
Honourable senators, I would like now to
say a few words about the Honourable Senator William Michael Wall, whose death was
also a shock to me, though not as great a
shock as that of the death of Senator Brunt,
for I felt when he left Ottawa after Parliament prorogued that he was not long for this
world; at least, he told me so. I was surprised
that in his condition he took such an active

OCTOBER 2. 1962
part in the election campaign. I fear that
perhaps his activity shortened his if e considerably.
Senator Wall was a man of many attributes,
and a great student, as has been said by the
two honourabie leaders of this house. He graduated from the University of Manitoba, which
was my aima mater, at the early age of 17
years, and he held degrees from Yale and
Harvard universities in the United States.
I gathered from the remarks of the two
leaders of this house that Senator Wall was
an indefatigable worker. He was an able
debater, and spoke on many subjects. He
prepared his speeches with the utmost care,
and we frequently had the pleasure of listening to him for he spoke on quite a number
of subjects.
Senator Wall was particularly active in the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce and in the Standing Committee on
Immigration and Labour. As has been stated,
he was an outstanding educationaiist, and he
took a very prominent part In the educational
life of his native province of Manitoba. He
died a comparativeiy young man who, had
he llved, had a great future ahead of him.
I know we are going to miss hinm very much
and that Mis place will be difficuit to fill.
1 extend my deepest sympathy and regrets
to his widow and sons.
Honourable senators, I was pieased to hear
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald)
speak about Senator Henri
Charles Bois in the native language of the
late senator. I was not neariy so wel
acquainted with Senator Bois as with Senator
Brunt and Senator Wall, but we had many
things in common. For example, we were both
greatly interested in farming; he was interested in the kind of farming done in the
provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and I in
the kind of farming done on the prairies in
western Canada. He had very extensive training, and had the reputation of being an expert
in agricultural matters. On that account he
was a most valuable member of this chamber.
With flot too many farmers in the Senate,
he was one of those whose advice was sought
in agricultural matters of every kind, and in
particular he made a reputation for himself as a member of the Special Committee
on Land Use of which the Honourable Senator Pearson lately has been chairman.
As has been stated by the honourable
Leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Brooks), Senator Bois was for many years before coming
ta the Senate most closely associated with
agricultural matters in the province of Quebec
where he held many important government
positions. He was a senator for only five years,
a comparatively young man when he passed
away. He had the prospect of many useful
27511-5-2j

years ahead of him. His passing is niuch
regretted, and I extend my deepest sympathy
to his widow and children.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourabie
senators, may I join with other honourable
senators in paying a brief tribute to my friend
and colleague of many years, the late Senator
William R. Brunt. As you are ail aware, the
death of Senator Brunt was the first to occur
among that newer group of senators who
began to come into this chamber in the latter
part of 1957. Consequently, this occasion is a
particuiariy sad one for those of us who
dlaim. to belong to that era and who were,
and had been for many years, s0 ciosely associated with him, especiaiiy in the political
field.
Senator Brunt was one of the most active
and hard-working men I have ever known.
Apart from his duties in the Senate, which
were manifold, I was amazed at the variety
of his interests, not only in the political sphere
generally but also in the legal profession in
which hie had been engaged ail his adult life
and in which he had the distinction of being
a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper
Canada; also in various enterprises, business,
athietic, and philanthropic, which occupied
his daily life. Indeed, many of these endeavours were closely related to the grass roots
of rural Ontario.
He was that rare type of person, born and
brought up in the country, mixing in his
eariy life with rural development and then
dividing his later life between rural and
urban aflairs. But above ail else, Senator
Brunt had an amazing capacity for personal
friendships which, once acquired, wbether
eariy or late in life, became permanent and
neyer to be forgotten.
There can be no greater testimony of the
truth of this observation than the funeral
service held in the late senator's home in
Hanover, Ontario. It was attended by a tremendous host of friends from every part of
Canada, and additional tribute was paid ta
hlm by hundreds of residents who iined the
streets of Hanover whiie the funerai procession passed along.
This chamber, and especiaily this side of
it, has suffered a severe ioss in Senator
Brunt's death. May I join in extending to his
widow, son and daughter my sincere regrets
and deepest sympathy.
May I aiso join other honourable senators
in an expression of sincere regret in the
death of Senator Wall and of Senator Bois,
and to express my sympathy to the familles
of these senators who have gone to their last
reward.

SENATE
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Irony of fate
indeed. At the prorogation a few months ago,
there were talks about retiring senators attaining the age of 75 years. In those few short
months, three of our colleagues have died,
all three were much younger than 75.
I mention Senator Brunt first because he was
acting leader on the other side of the house
and was appointed to the Senate on October
12, 1957. Scarcely 55 years old, Senator Brunt
departed in a very tragic way. He was a
distinguished lawyer, a pillar of the Conservative party and one of its main organizers.
I always watched with a keen interest the
reactions mirrored in his countenance when
his own fellow supporters or senators on this
side of the house made certain remarks.
Perhaps he had been told before he joined
us, that the Senate was some kind of a club
for rather old men. He soon realized, however,
that on the contrary the Upper Chamber was
a necessary element in our parliamentary
organization and, later, he became one of its
upholders on the ground that it is an essential
institution to check decisions perhaps prematurely reached sometimes by the other
house.
Another of our colleagues died still quite
young. Senator William H. Wall passed away
at the age of 50.
He was an excellent professor and reflected
on the great economical and social problems
which he explained to us in a very detailed
way. An untiring worker, he was a model of
integrity. If, sometimes according to his colleagues, his speeches were rather long, it was
because he aimed at perfection in all his
undertakings.
Senator Wall was the first representative of
his Ukrainian countrymen in this house and
he did represent them with dignity. Moreover, he was a firm believer, in his private
life as well as in his public life, and he was
always true to himself.
A third colleague, Senator Henri C. Bois,
passed away at the age of 65. I knew him
well, in fact I have always known him
because we went to the same college. I was
in my last year when he was beginning his
studies. Further, he was from Lévis. Later
we met at Oka's Agricultural Institute.
During World War I, Mr. Bois served as a
lieutenant in the Canadian Army in Europe.
Back to civilian life, he was appointed Professor of Rural Economics at the Oka Agricultural College. In 1929 he became head of the
Rural Economies Branch of the Quebec Department of Agriculture. He was one of those
who contributed most to the implementation
of the new agricultural co-operation act of
the province of Quebec. Appointed secretary

to the Royal Commission on the Dairy Industry of Quebec in 1933, he was soon ta become
president of that commission. Promoter and
first president of the Corporation of Agronomists of the Province of Quebec, in 1937, he
was appointed, in 1938, secretary of the Federation of Quebec Co-operatives, then a little
later became general manager of the Federation, and occupied the position until 1957.
The Federation of Quebec Co-operatives is
the great agricultural co-operation organization in our province; if it did not exist, I wonder what would the fate of our farmers be
today. Mr. Bois gave a strong impetus to that
organization. When he assumed the position
of general manager in 1942, sales were of the
order of $11.5 millions, and when he left in
1957 they had reached $80 million. This shows
the great work accomplished by the deceased.
Mr. Bois was a graduate from the Oka Agricultural College, the University of Montreal,
the Institut Agronomique and the Institut
Catholique de Paris.
From 1944 to 1948 he was president of the
Superior Board of Co-operation of Quebec,
and from 1953 to 1955 mayor of St. Bruno.
When Senator Bois passed away, the farmers in Quebec lost a great promoter and
defender; the agricultural community and the
whole agricultural sector of the Canadian
economy lost a most dedicated friend. This is
what inspired the president of the Canadian
agricultural federation to say that Mr. Bois
was generally known as an energetic pioneer
among agricultural and co-operative organizations. And Mr. H. H. Hannam added that
Mr. Bois has left his mark and that he deserved credit for having prominently contributed to the welfare of all the farmers in
Canada.
To the families of our three friends departed, I wish to offer our homage and our
most sincere condolences. Their example will
enable us to have a better appreciation of their
magnificent deeds. We off er most sincere condolences to all.
(Text):
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I know that my saying something about
our three colleagues who have died since
last we met is bound to be somewhat repetitious, but, despite the fact the two leaders
and other honourable senators have spoken
so feelingly and so touchingly, I would like

the opportunity of paying a short tribute to
each of them. I think this is the first time I
have participated in paying tributes, because
I have always considered myself one of the

OCTOBER 2. 1962
very junior senators. However, each of these
three late colleagues came to this chamber
after I was appointed.
I knew Senator Wall better than our other
late colleagues. For him to have died at the
age of 51 years is a great tragedy, flot only
for this chamber but for the country as weil.
He had been in ill health for several years.
Senator Wall was an educator, a very weil
qualified educator, and he understood the
purpose of education. I believe it was because
of his education that the quality of his work
in the Senate was flot only high, but grew in
importance as it developed. He was a useful
member of this chamber and an ornament to
it. The personal research he undertook was
displayed in the kind of speeches he made
and in the kind of work he did in committees
-in particular, if I may say so, the Special
Committee on Manpower and Employment
which sat two years ago.
The honourable leaders on both sides of
this chamber have referred to the fact that
Senator Wall was the first senator of Ukrainian origin to be appointed. He brought here
a deep concern for the welfare of his people,
of the people of his forefathers, and an equally
deep concern for others similarly situated in
the grîp of communism in Europe. 1 believe
that the speeches he made here on these subjects bear re-reading by ail of us.
As the honourable Leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has said, Senator Wall was
a deeply religious man, but he was also very
conscious of the importance of religion in the
history and the life of a people and of nations.
Many of his speeches referred to the condition of peoples behind the Iron Curtain, and
he pointed out that in so many cases very
few of them have littie to fali back upon in
these days other than the religion in which
they believe.
Senator Wall's death is a loss to the Senate; it is also a personal loss to many honourable senators, because both he and his wife
enjoyed a personal popularity in this chamber and in Parliament, one which is enjoyed
perhaps by very few of us.
(Translation):
I should now like to say a few words i
the late Senator Henri Bois' mother tongue.
Senator Bois' stay here was of short duration.
He was appointed to the Senate in 1957. He
had received a fine education in Canadian and
American universities. He served in the
armed forces during World War I. Having
devoted practicaily ail of hMs prof essional
career to agriculture, he was an expert in that
field and that is why the Right Honourable
Louis St. Laurent appointed hlmn to the Senate
when the Committee on Land use ini Canada
was established.

He understood the problems of agriculture,
the problems of farmers throughout Canada
but especially of farmers from the province of
Quebec. He was convinced of the urgency of
industrialization in Mis province but he did
not underestimate the importance of farming
and of farnily values in his native province.
He neyer forgot the tradition which is illustrated by the word habitant.
Unfortunately, he was in poor health and,
as a resuit of his death, the Senate is deprived
of a distinguished, devoted, competent and
sincere statesman.
(Text):
Regarding my friend Bill Brunt-for 1
believe he was a friend of us ali-the shock
that the Honourable Mr. Aseltine described
was, I amn sure, shared by every one of us.
Senator Brunt was a lawyer of eminence
and high standing in this province. He was an
energetic administrator, and we in this chamber saw aIl the evidence of that great quality.
Bill Brunt was a party man, one who worked
with sincerity in the interests of the party
he supported. He was respected as a power
in that party, and with reason. I believe I
can speak out o! some knowledge of his approach when I say that he served his party
with a sense of objectivity, without venom,
neyer with a descent to personalities, and
always with a capacity to appreciate an opponent's position.
In this country, where we have the party
system, Bill Brunt, in his work for his party,
and on this count alone, made a worthy contribution to the welfare of our parliamentary
institutions and our public life. 0f course
he was interested in the work of the Senate,
and he did a great deal-particularly in the
work of the Standing Committee on Internai
Economy, o! which he was chairman-to make
the Senate a more effective, a more useful
instrument in the functioning o! Parliament.
Again, Mis work in the Special Committee
of the Senate on Manpower and Employment
was outstanding, because that committee
could not have been a success had there not
been co-operation from both sides of this
chamber. We have Senator Brunt to thank
for much o! the understanding and co-operation that went into the establishment and
the effective working of that committee.
Hon. Olive L. Irvine: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to share in the tributes
being paid this evening to the memory of
our colleagues and in particular to a native
of my own province 0f Manitoba, the late
Senator Wall.
Senator Wall, as has been said, was of
Ukrainian descent, a graduate o! the University of Manitoba who later took post-graduate
work at bath Yale and Harvard. He was a
keen student in every sense of the word.

SENATE
His career in public affairs was characterized by his integrity, courage and steadfastness of faith. To his intimates he was a
warm and sensitive personality. The page of
this young life is turned forever. May he rest
in peace as he served with honour.
I join with the honourable leaders of both
sides of this house and with other honourable senators in extending our profound sympathy to the members of his family, as well
as to the families of the late Senator Brunt
and Senator Bois.
Hon. M. Wallace McCuicheon: Honourable
senators, it is a matter of great regret to me
that the first occasion on which I should have
the opportunity of addressing this honourable
assembly should be in the sad background
which is surrounding us this evening, but I
felt I could not let the opportunity pass
without joining the two honourable leaders
and other honourable members in paying tribute to your late colleague and my great
friend the Honourable William R. Brunt.
With what the leaders have said and with
what other honourable senators have said
as to Senator Brunt's public, business and
professional activities, I am in complete
agreement and could add nothing to it. I
would like to speak very shortly about some
of his personal qualities.
I knew Senator Brunt for some forty
years. We were at university together; we
were at law school together, and we became
fast friends among a small group of friends.
I have learned, as no doubt many honourable
senators have, that one has very few close
friends, and in that small group Bill Brunt's
passing has left a great gap. He had a profound interest in people, great enthusiasm
and joy for life, coupled with tremendous
vitality. I never saw Bill Brunt depressed.
He never turned back. What had been was,
and he moved on to the next task with that
dynamic energy with which I am sure you
were all familiar. Above all he was a good
friend. He possessed the quality of loyalty
to a degree that few men have. He never
turned his back on an old friend or an associate.
While Senator Brunt made his home in Toronto for nearly forty years, it was a rare
week he did not spend some time in his home
town of Hanover, and it was as the "Senator
from Hanover" he was proud to be designated.
It is difficult even now to realize that he is
not here and it is still a shock to recall the
tragic circumstances which took him from us
so suddenly and unexpectedly.
I could relate many incidents to illustrate
these and the other outstanding qualities to
which I have referred so briefly but, as the
Honourable Senator Thorvaldson has said,
those who were at his funeral observed the

greatest tribute that could possibly be paid to
him. As the cortège moved from the church
along the main street of Hanover toward the
cemetery, the street was lined on both sides
for some blocks with his fellow townsmen.
The whole town of Hanover paused to honour
his memory. There was no sound save the
tolling of the bells, the bells which he had
provided for the church in memory of his
parents.
If there be a group of people who can attest to the true qualities of an individual, it
is surely those who knew him intimately as
boy and man. The judgment of the people of
Hanover was there for everyone to see on
that July afternoon.
It was not my good fortune to know Senator
Wall or Senator Bois, but I would like to
associate myself with other honourable senators in the tributes that have been paid to
them and in sympathy to their families.
Hon. John Hnatyshyn: Honourable senators,
I should like to associate myself with what
has been said by the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) and other honourable senators about our three colleagues who have
passed away.
Of these three I knew the late Senator William Wall the longest because I first met him
in 1929 when he attended the University of
Saskatchewan for a year. From then to the
time of his death I knew him to be a hard
and conscientious worker, always expressing
his viewpoint with great vigor. He showed
the same qualities in his service to the Senate.
I wish to join with all other honourable senators in extending to his widow and to his two
children my sincere sympathy on the loss of a
good husband and father, and a great Canadian.
As has been pointed out, the passing of
the late Senator William R. Brunt came as a
tragic shock to all of us. I had the privilege
of knowing Senator Brunt since 1938, and I
join in all that has been said tonight, that at
all times in his profession, in his community
activities and his activities as a member of
the Senate, he played a very distinguished
and important part. To his widow, who comes
from my native province, and to his two
children I extend my sincerest sympathy.
It was not my pleasure, honourable senators, to know the late Senator Bois for as long
a time as I knew Senator Wall and Senator
Brunt. I met him first when I was appointed
a member of this house, but I knew something of his activities in his own province. He
was held in high regard by his province and
by this bouse. To his family also I extend my
sincerest sympathy.

OCTOBER 2, 1962
Hon. Harry A. Willis: Honourable senators,
as a freshman senator I pray your indulgence.
I would not have risen so early in this present
session had I not been an intimate friend
of the late Senator Brunt. My conscience
would not be clear if I did not, in a chamber
of which I am a member, rise to pay my
tribute to one of my closest friends.
Senator Brunt and I grew up in rural
Ontario. We attended Osgoode Hall together
and we practised law in Toronto. We then
became associated in something that I think
is unknown in this chamber, namely, a
political association. Bill Brunt and I for
the last thirty years were members of a
political association in the province of Ontario, and for the last six years I was the
chairman of a three-man committee of which
he was a member.
On Thursday, July 5, I was here in Ottawa
with Senator Brunt. He showed me some of
the ropes. On the Friday I went to Cornwall
where, as honourable senators know, there
was a pending by-election. The late Senator
Brunt telephoned me long distance twice on
that day. We were to meet on the following
Sunday, but unfortunately at twenty minutes
to one on the Sunday morning I was awakened to learn that my dear friend had died.
Senator Brunt, as all honourable senators
will know through their association with him
for some five or six years, was a man of
energy and ambition. He was clear-eyed and
he knew where he was going. He was a friend
of the Prime Minister of Canada and almost
a member of the Government, yet lie was a
friend of all in this chamber.
Senator Brunt died suddenly in a motor car
collision. I do not know whether honourable
members of this chamber know this, but after
the collision took place Bill Brunt got out
of his car and said, "Get me a doctor. I think
I am dying. Do what you can". That was
typical of Bill Brunt. I think the words of
the poet William Cullen Bryant can be
said of Senator Brunt:
So live, that when thy summons comes
to join
The innumerable caravan which moves
To that mysterious realm, where each
shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at
night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained
and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy
grave,
Like one that wraps the drapery of his
couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant
dreams.
That was the late Senator Brunt.

DIVORCE
PETITIONS

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have the honour to present a number
of petitions for divorce.
At this point may I say that the Divorce
Committee held its first meeting this afternoon at 2 o'clock, as was arranged in the
Senate yesterday, and I had the honour to
receive a vote of confidence for the present
session, a gesture which I highly appreciate.
The Divorce Committee is probably the
hardest working committee in Parliament;
certainly it is in the Senate. So far as I
know, no other committee meets so often
and deals with so large a number of matters,
all of which must be considered carefully,
and accepts responsibilities so continuously
and with such devotion, as does the Divorce
Committee. Under those circumstances, I look

upon it as quite an honour to have the chairmanship of a committee of that calibre. Perhaps on this occasion I might quote the words
of Job to this effect: It is well a man takes
satisfaction in his work, for that is his portion.
We will have no lack of work during this
session for, honourable senators, I now have
the pleasure of presenting 720 petitions in
divorce.
That number, of course, needs some explanation. Of that number, 325 cases were
presented to you at the last session of Parliament, were considered and approved by the
committee for the issuing of bills of divorce,
were recommended to the Senate, passed by
the Senate and sent to the House of Commons.
As you all know, they were not passed by the
Commons. Those bills died on the Order Paper
when Parliament was dissolved. I was in the
gallery of the other place yesterday when
a motion was passed to return the evidence
and papers in connection with these petitions
to the Senate. In fact, they had been returned a long time ago, but that at least regularized the fact that these 325 cases are again
before us.
Actually there were 327 bills which died on
the Order Paper. In one case the respondent
is deceased and, of course, the claim for a
bill of divorce goes with the death of the
respondent; and in another case the parties
have decided not to proceed. All but 19 of
the 325 petitions which I now present on
behalf of that group are ready to proceed.
The petitioners have complied with our
requirements, have notified us they wish to
go on and have filed affidavits negativing
condonation in the interval. We shall proceed
to deal with that great body of cases, 306,
commencing tomorrow morning.
As for the balance, there are 395 new cases.
I have not checked the figures, but my impression is that that is the largest number of cases
I, as chairman of this committee, have ever
presented at an early sitting of the Senate.
We have handled more cases than that, but
never in my memory have we presented so
large a number at the first sittings of a session. So, honourable senators, I now present
720 petitions in divorce.
Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators, may I ask the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) if, with
respect to all of those cases that were heard
during the last session, it is necessary to hear
all the evidence again or can the evidence
already heard be accepted at this session?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is my opinion, honourable senators, that we have every right to
rely upon the evidence heard at the last session, notwithstanding the fact this is a new

OCTOBER 3, 1962
Parliament and our rules provide that the
evidence of the parties shall be heard by the
committee. Nevertheless I shall ask for the
consent of the house to accept the committee's
reports when they are presented. We are
justified, I think, in law, and certainly in
common sense, in not hearing the evidence
over again.
There is only one point on which we have
to be guarded, and that is that the parties
have not lived together in the meantime. That
is to say, we have to ascertain that condonation has not taken place. In each of the cases
that come before you there will be an affidavit to that effect by the parties involved.
Apart from that, I think we are justified
in relying upon the evidence we have already
heard.
All honourable senators will agree with me,
I am sure, that it was through no fault of
the litigants that these bills were not passed
at the last session, and it would be most
unjust were we to ask them to pay a further
parliamentary fee. A resolution will be passed
by the Divorce Committee asking for the remission of the parliamentary fees for those
who paid them at the last session.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
would like to say a few words. In the first
place I am very pleased, and I know al
honourable senators are, that satisfactory
arrangements have been made for dealing
with those divorce bills which were not passed
by Parliament during the last session. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) bas said that this was
not the fault of the litigants. Neither was it
the fault of the Standing Committee on Divorce nor of most members of the House of
Commons.
I have never been a member of the Senate
Standing Committee on Divorce, but having
been a member of the House of Commons for
many years I know of the splendid work
that this committee has done, and I want to
congratulate its chairman (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I am delighted to see that he is in
such robust health, and able to carry on this
same strenuous work that he bas been doing
for many years.
The Divorce Committee performs one of
the most thankless tasks required of any committee of Parliament. But it is a task that
must be performed, and has been performed
well by an excellent committee under the
chairmanship of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I might add, honourable senators, that over
the years I have heard lawyers who have
practised before the Standing Committee on
Divorce of the Senate and also before other
divorce courts in Canada, state that for

courtesy, efficiency and good judgment there
is no court in Canada which excels the divorce
court of the Canadian Senate.
I felt I would like to pay that tribute to
the chairman and to his excellent committee.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have no hesitancy whatsoever in supporting the remarks of the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) and
saying how pleased we on this side of the
house are that the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has once
again assumed the onerous duties of chairman
of this committee.
Members of this committee do more work
than those of us who are not on the committee. Honourable senators will recall that the
Divorce Committee sits on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays when very often the Senate
has been adjourned. They stay here when
those of us who are not on the committee are
able to go away or be engaged in other work
around the building. They must be here on
those days to sit on the court and hear the
divorce proceedings.
Therefore, I wish to commend not only the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity for
the splendid leadership which he has given
but also those who are on the conmittee and
are prepared to stay here and do this very
necessary work.
The members of the committee, headed by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity,
are very able men and women. Many of
them have legal training and all of them have
wide experience. They are more than adequately qualified to serve on this committee
and to hear these divorce petitions, both
from the legal standpoint and from the human
side. I feel that, so long as divorce petitions
must come before Parliament, the people of
Canada are fortunate that we have such a
competent body of men and women to hear
them and to pass fair judgment on them.
I wish to congratulate the chairman and
al the members of the committee.

OCTOBER 3, 1962
There are certain occasions in one's life
which stand out as memorable, and as I stand
before you today making my first speech in
this august chamber I do so with a great deal
of fear and trepidation. Some of the senators
within sound of my voice must have experienced this feeling before and I trust all will
give me their sympathy and understanding.
May I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on
being appointed to guide the aff airs and deliberations of this house, and I know you will
grace the office with dignity.
To the honourable senator from Royal
(Hon. Mr. Brooks), I offer my congratulations
on being selected as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and I know that under
your capable hands the business of this bouse
will be conducted with dispatch.
May I also congratulate Honourable Senator
Aseltine who for many years has occupied
the position of leader of this bouse. I wish
him well, and know he will be relieved of
many of the problems that affect the honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate.
May I also thank the honourable senator
from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson)
who, together with the Government Leader
(Hon. Mr. Brooks), kindly accompanied me
when I was sworn in as a member of this
house. I would also at this time like to thank
him for the valuable help and advice he
bas given me for many years.
May I also congratulate the other honourable members who were sworn in at the same
time as myself, being one more in number
than the ancient mythology.
(Translation):
Mr. Speaker, please accept my sincere congratulations. I know that you will fil this
high office with great dignity.
I thank the honourable senator from Royal
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) for suggesting that I
move the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. To the honourable senator
from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson)
I wish to express my appreciation for the
assistance he has always given me. To al my
other colleagues I humbly say-thank you.
(Text):
May I at this moment thank the many
honourable senators for the kind references
made to me about my father who was a
member of this house for some twenty-six
years. He enjoyed his work here and made
many friends, and I deeply regret that because of advancing age he had to resign.
In discussing the Speech from the Throne,
it is clearly indicated that the Government
bas decided and is going to implement
many acts for the betterment and progress
of our country. There are certain sections
of the speech that I will not deal with as
there will be legislation brought forward at
the appropriate time.

One section of the speech states that the
economic activity of our country has moved
ahead sharply. I would refer for a moment
to Manitoba, which now has the highest
number of people employed in the history
of the province, and the gross value of agriculture, natural resources, manufacturing and
construction is at an all-time high which,
in 1961, totalled $1,580 million.
There is another factor about the province
of Manitoba, namely, that it is still a very
prominent agricultural province but is now
gaining stature as a manufacturing and industrial centre.
One of the factors which will assist the
economic development of Manitoba is a
program of regional development which allows assistance to be given certain localities
to marshal their local resources. As you can
well understand, this regional, manufacturing, development program will have the effect
of stimulating further agricultural processing
and other secondary industries. Community
development corporations have been formed,
or are in the process of being formed, in
some twenty-eight communities, but this is
only the start. This program provides more
jobs for Manitobans, especially outside the
large centres of population. This is a joint
effort between the province and the local
community.
Another factor in the economic growth of
my province is the creation of the Manitoba
Development Fund which allows financing
for the expansion of certain industries and
provides financial assistance to new and existing manufacturing industries, tourist and
recreational facilities and certain local community projects. In the short time that it bas
been in existence, the total amount of extra
capital investment has reached the sum of
$1,580 million.
As a corollary to the fund the province
has created a committee on Manitoba's economic future to help and assist various areas
of economic activity within the province, for
the purpose of increasing employment opportunities for the growing labour force. We hope
that this research program may well be the
forerunner of similar provincial programs
and, as mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne, certain fiscal measures are to be
placed before Parliament to create better
employment opportunities for the Canadian
people. I would think that Manitoba is proceeding apace with this program.
There was also mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne the fact that a national
power grid will be established to utilize the
hydro-electric potential of this country. Mention was made that discussions are in progress
with the Government of Manitoba with respect to studies of the Nelson River system.

SENATE
At the present moment the means of tapping a small portion of this potentially vast
hydro-electric power in Manitoba has been
established at the Kelsey hydro site which
serves the International Nickel Company's
operation at Thompson, Manitoba. The construction of the power plant at Grand Rapids
on the Nelson River wilL create some 4 million
kilowatts of electricity. The first two turbine
generators will be in operation in 1964 and
a third one in 1965. Provision is also to be
made for further expansion, if required.
The Government of Manitoba feels that the
Kelsey and Grand Rapids projects will enable
the sale of power to consumers who are not
now in a position to use it; but with the
expansion of industry and manufacturing,
which I have previously mentioned, we feel
that the sale of electric power to these areas
will greatly expand the potential of Manitoba
and also assist in the further growth and
development of the rest of Canada.
Thank you.
(Translation):
Hon. Edgar Fournier (Madawaska-Resfigouche): Honourable senators, a few hours ago
I was highly honoured when I was accepted
in this august house. Although the emotion I
felt upon my appointment to the Senate has
not completely subsided, I will, however, endevour to carry out, in all humility, the pleasant task of supporting the motion for an
address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
I am reassured by the feeling of friendship
and warmth prevailing in this house, and I
am proud and honoured to tackle this task
which I shall discharge to the best of my
ability on behalf of my fellow citizens of
Madawaska-Restigouche and New Brunswick.
With your permission, honourable senators,
I would like to speak on behalf of my colleagues, the new senators. We are all pleased
with your warm welcome, and it is a great
honour for us to be associated with such a
distinguished group of Canadians.
It also was a special honour for me to be
greeted in the Senate by the senator for
Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks), a great Canadian,
a veteran of two wars who earned a place
amongst the greatest for his valour and his
courage, and who, in peacetime, continues
to work for his people.
On my left is the honourable senator from
St. John-Albert (Hon. Mr. Emerson). He is
everybody's friend, a great Canadian in industry and commerce, and one of the most
prominent citizens of the metropolis of New
Brunswick, the city of Saint John. In spite of
his many commitments, he always finds time
to devote himself to the service of his fellow
citizens.

I would also, at this time, like to thank
very sincerely, on behalf of the new senators
and in my own name, our Prime Minister the
Right Honourable John Diefenbaker, for our
appointment to the Senate. We wish to assure
him that we will conduct ourselves with all
the dignity he expects of us. This honour
which he bestowed upon each of us is reflecting credit upon all our friends and fellow
citizens, regardless of their political creed.
I would like to congratulate you, Mr.
Speaker, on your appointment to the presidency of this house; indeed, thanks to your
long experience, and we are all in agreement
on this I am sure, you will guide the future
of this assembly with the highest distinction.
The honourable senator from River Heights
(Hon. Mr. Haig), mover of the address in
reply, has made such a good review of all the
areas that there is nothing left for me to say.
In his speech, everyone will agree, he has
touched upon nearly every aspect of our
economic life.
May I, honourable senators, say a few
words about my own province, New Brunswick. It goes without saying that we have
there not only the best senators but also
the most handsome. Perhaps that is why New
Brunswick is known as the picture province.
During the fall, when our great mountains,
covered with maple and birch trees, feel the
pinch of early frost, our forests display a
range of colours of breath-taking beauty.
With their gay and tempting colours, our
maple trees are worthy rivals of Senator
Taylor, Senator Emerson, Senator Burchill,
and all my other colleagues.
Now in a more serious vein, I must point
out that New Brunswick has been endowed
with great cultural and natural wealth. Nowadays our population is almost equally divided
between the French and the English and we,
of both ethnic groups, live and work according
to the same convictions, the same principles,
and we admit that we are first and foremost
Canadians. However, we are not immune to
separatist movements which seem to spout
once in a while in our province. We try to
fight them before they spread so as to protect
our freedoms and strengthen our ties within
the Canadian Confederation.
Our vast forests which produce the raw
material for the fabrication of paper constitute one of our natural resources. There are,
in Canada, tremendous possibilities for the
establishment of other forest industries. Indeed, according to recent studies, our present
industries cannot even absorb the yearly
growth of our forests.
The coal deposits of the Minto district play
a great part in the production of electricity
in Canada. There are promising lead, silver

OCTOBER 3, 1962
and zinc deposits in the Bathurst area. The
nickel found in Charlotte county, the huge
oil and shale deposits in Albert county, the
manganese deposits in Carleton and the
Westmorland salt deposits guarantee our economic development.
Honourable senators, a country's natural
resources are lost if it does not have a culture.
In Canada, as elsewhere, much remains to be
done in that field. The friendly relations
that prevail here between the two ethnic
groups, French and English, should be taken
as an example and should inspire those areas
where understanding between the two groups
is sometimes not al that it should be.
Our universities, our schools and all our
educational institutions are doing their best
and we are proud of them.
The borders of our province extend for a
distance of 900 miles, 700 of them along the
Atlantic. That is the basis for a fishing industry
whose operating costs are high. Those products from the sea, such as salmon from Chaleur Bay, lobster from Northumberland Strait,
oysters from Buctouche and Caraquet, sardines from the Bay of Fundy, are processed
in many cold-storage plants. That enables us
to put on the world markets reputable products.
The Saint John river which flows through
our province in a north-south direction over
a distance of more than 250 miles could produce over 500,000 KW of electrical energy.
We have also the strongest tides in the world
which, converted into energy, would produce
more than 5,000,000 KW. Furthermore, I wish
to mention the strong tides of Chignecto and
of the surrounding bays, and the Passamaquoddy tides. These developments are essential to the economic improvement of our
region. They would be most valuable to and
one of the most important factors in the proposed establishment of a national power grid.
I am proud to see that the speech from the
throne mentions the development of sources
of energy in Canada and that our country is
to be in the foreground in regard to measures
for the expansion of our national economy.
Agriculture in New Brunswick is very
highly diversified; all types of mixed farming
are practised. But in a few places can be
found specialized activities such as the growing of potatoes, strawberries and apples,
cattle raising, and dairy farming: all of these
play an important part in our rural areas.
With the mechanization of agriculture, our

farmers are faced with serious problems, for
most of the farms are not large enough to use
fully and profitably the investments required
by mechanization. As a result, the small farmers go bankrupt.
In the industrial and commercial fields, in
spite of all the problems arising from the
transport of our raw manufactured products to the more populated centres, New
Brunswick is still holding an enviable position. We might not produce quantity, but we
give a very special consideration to quality.
New Brunswick has also produced great
Canadians. Let me single out a few: Sir
Andrew Bonar Law, born in New Brunswick,
who became one of the Prime Ministers of
England; Sir James Dunn, magnate of
the steel industry; Lord Beaverbrook, the
great benefactor of New Brunswick. It gives
me pleasure to add to this list K. C. Irving,
an industrialist and a financial genius who is
making an extraordinary contribution to our
province. His numerous industries give day to
day work to several thousand people. His
oil and structural steel industries as well as
his shipbuilding plants are but a few of his
numerous and progressive enterprises. I
should like to give a special mention to the
distinguished citizens of my native village,
who have greatly contributed to our local
economy: the Frasers, the Mathesons, the
Murchies, pioneers in the development of our
area, who have established local industries
such as the Fraser Pulp and Paper Co. with
all its subsidiaries.
In the field of travel, nothing in Canada
equals a tour through our province: it offers
a great variety of attractions likely to please
every member of the family; hundreds of
picnic grounds along our highways are at the
disposal of travellers. Excellent highways lead
through vast forests. Rivers teeming with
different kinds of fish are a real flsherman's
paradise. Our many beaches washed by the
cold salt water of the Atlantic provide our
tourists with all the thrills they can hope for.
Hospitality is the motto in New Brunswick
where four languages are spoken: first, wellpronounced English, then good French, and
also a mixture of English and French which
has its merits and is very popular, and finally
a very poor French. There is no language
problem in our area, because one can always
speak one of the four languages.
Honourable senators, you are now convinced,
I am sure, that New Brunswick is unexcelled
in beauty, from some of its representatives

SENATE
in the Senate-not to mention its abundant
resources and well-known products-to the
McLean sardines. I shall now conclude those
few remarks by dealing with the Speech from
the Throne and the one just delivered by my
newly-appointed colleague, the senator from
River Heights (Hon. Hr. Haig). I take this opportunity to congratulate him on the fine
words he spoke in French.
(Text):
Honourable senators, last Thursday we
heard the Speech from the Throne delivered
by His Excellency the Governor General. I
am sure everyone in this house wil agree
that such a comprehensive address is welcomed by all Canadian citizens.
The speech included a heavy program and
many measures to promote the Canadian
economy. Today Canada must be stronger
than ever, when new parties built on socialist
principles are taking root in our Canadian
soil.
Personally, I am a great believer in the
two-party system built on free enterprise,
freedom and liberty, and I believe that we
in this house should be united solid to face
and oppose strongly any movement contrary
to democratic principles. Let us look back
and let us find what we have not done, or
what we did wrong. Let us find out why
some Canadians are turning away from the
road of democracy to affiliate themselves with
socialists, fly-by-night saviours, or demagogues. I must say that I deplore the situation into which we are drifting.
One has only to focus an eye on what has
happened in the many European countries,
where demagogues have led the people, to
understand what has happened. That should
be a warning that the same thing could happen to others who are being misled by these
formless principles.
Honourable senators, when I hear of a
Canadian citizen, a French Canadian, one of
my own creed, who has said that, if elected
to the legislative assembly, he will refuse
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth,
I feel ashamed. Let us hope that this group
be small indeed. I can assure you, honourable
senators, that that group does not represent
us, the French of New Brunswick and Quebec.
I am glad to read in the speech that an
attempt will be made to bring about agreement on a Canadian flag. Here again, honourable senators, it is unbelievable that a nation
like ours, Canadians who have stood together, walked side by side even to the last

step forward on the battlefield, after 95 years
of confederation, should in peacetime still
be divided over the design of a Canadian
flag. Perhaps it is truc that I cannot have it
all my way, and that others cannot have it all
their way, but together we certainly can have
it the right way. Honourable senators, I hope
that we in this chamber can set an example
and lead the way for an understanding that
will give to the Canadian people the longneeded and long-desired flag.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne covered another subject of great interest, namely, that of promoting and constructing a national electric power grid system
across Canada. With the coal of Nova Scotia,
the tidal power of New Brunswick, the hydro
potential of Quebec, the nuclear power plant
of Ontario, and oil and coal and gas of the
prairies, the great resources of the Fraser and
Columbia, nowhere in the whole world is
there so much power potential. One could talk
at length on this subject, but to end this
matter at least for the moment let us not
forget that "electric power" is the key for
industrial growth in Canada.
I am pleased to say at this time that four
years ago 1, as chairman of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, along with
my colleagues, the chairman of the Nova
Scotia Electric Power Commission and of the
Nova Scotia Light and Power Commission, had
the honour of signing the first electric power
grid agreement in Canada, namely, the agreement between the province of New Brunswick
and the province of Nova Scotia. I am pleased
to report that since this great systern has been
in operation it has saved these two provinces
millions of dollars in the operation, especially
in stand-by and reserve capacity. There are
many obstacles facing us in this development,
but with the co-operation of the provinces they
will all be overcome for the benefit of everyone. At a later date I hope I shall have an
opportunity of expressing myself more fully
on this matter.
I was pleased to hear of the proposal for
the creation of an Atlantic Development
Board to promote the economic growth of our
region, the enlargement of farm credit, and
especially to provide training in agriculture.
Honourable senators, if we have many unemployed today one of the main reasons is
that our young people have lost faith in farming and are moving to the cities. It would be
correct to say that not only the sons but, in
many instances, whole families, have left the
farms to move to industrial centres. But before we condemn these mass movements from
the farms to the cities, it would be well to
explore the reasons. When we do that I am
sure we will find that one important reason
is the lack of proper agricultural training.

OCTOBER 3, 1962
Honourable senators, the honourable mover
of the motion (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas covered
the subi ect well, and deserves to be complimented for bis speech. In closing I wish
to repeat that the Speech from the Throne
is a true Canadian document with one purpose only, that of giving our citizens a
Canada worthy of Canadian citizens. Let this
Canada, honourable senators, be your Canada
and niy Canada, and may God guide its
destiny in unity and peace.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, I wish to, thank you
for the great honour which. you have bestowed

27

upon me today and for the attention which
you have given me. It is, therefore, with
pleasure that I ask leave to second the motion
of the senator from, River Heights <Hon. Mr.
Haig), that we humbly thank His Exceflency,
the Governor General of Canada, for the
gracious speech made in this house on Thursday, the 27th of September.
(Text):
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford) debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

OCTOBER 4. 1962
that bouse and that it will flot be long before
yau become just as faniiliar with the rules of
our bouse.
We were pleased with the way that you
conducted the opening ceremanies of this the
Twenty-Fifth Parliament of Canada, ail of
which augurs well for your happiness and
success in the Chair.
May I say also that we are pleased that
Mrs. Wbite is with yau, and we will look forward to, happy associations with you, Mr.
Speaker, and with Mrs. White during the life
of this Parliament.
I take this opportunity to welcome the retiring Speaker (Hon. Mr. Drouin) who is now
of the Privy Council, to the body of the Senate.
He wiil find bis seat here less comfortable
than the one wbich be occupied in bis more
exalted position; but there wiil be sorne compensation, for instead of baving to listen to
speeches and make occasional interruptions,
be will bave the opportunity of making
speeches himself and of listening ta occasional
interruptions, probably from. this side of the
bouse.
The Honourable Senator ]Jrouin presided
over the proceedings of this assernbly in a
dignified, impartial and pleasant manner, and
at special Senate functions witb a dignity
and cbarm wbicb. brought credit to, the Upper
House. We wisb bim a long and happy life
wbether sitting to the right or to the left
of the Honourable the Speaker.
Honourable senators, for the last four years
we have had as Leader of the Governent
in this house a man learned in tbe law and
also learned in aur procedure, a knowledge
gained fromn bis long parliamentary experience, a man wbo neyer spoke on a subject
unless be was prepared; caurteous at all times,
but whose ire would instantly be aroused if a
statement was unfair, untrue, grossly exaggerated, or inaccurate.
For me it was a great privilege to have
been bis opposite number and I shaîl always
cberish the memory of my happy association
with him.
I refer, of course, ta the Honourable Senator
Aseltine, wbo bad not only the respect but
also the affection of ail our members, and
none o! us was happy to, learn af bis decision
to retire from. bis bigh office.
To bim and to his belpmate, Mrs. Aseltine, wba bas endeared berself to us, we wisb
continued good healtb in our midst, wbere we
are sure they will continue to play an active
raie for years to came.
Honourable senators, having lost one very
good government leader, we are fortunate in
having obtained for aurselves anather. The
new Leader af the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) bas been a good friend ta
mast af us and a very close friend ta many a!

31

us. I sat in the House of Commons with bim
from 1935 until 1953. During that time aur
association developed into a close friendship;
but in spite of that long friendsbip, sa far as
aur palitical inclinations were concerned we
remained as f ar apart as the pales.
The bonourable leader can count an my
co-operatian in tbe carrying out o! bis heavy
duties, which I arn sure will be perfarmed e!fectively and according ta the well-establisbed
rules and principles adopted in bath national
and international spberes. He is well equipped
for the heavy responsibilities he bas assumed.
We congratulate hlm and wish birn well.
Honourable senators, I will not take the
time of the bouse by referring personally ta
ail newly-appointed senators; bowever, I
should say a word o! greeting ta one who is
with us for the first time and bas been sworn in
as a privy councillor. I refer ta tbe honourable
senator from. Gormley (Hon. Mr. McCutcbeon). During the last Parliament we were not
fortunate enough ta bave a member of the
Government in aur midst, and when we
wanted any information about the Government we went ta the leader and he always
obtained it for us. I do not know bow be got
bis information, be neyer told us. From. now
on wben we require such information we
may request the Government Leader ta obtain
it, or if we want to bypass bim we can go
direct ta the member of the Cabinet wbo is
with us. Wben we bave inquiries aur only
problem will be: shail we direct themn ta the
Leader of the Government in this bouse or ta
the member of the Government in this bouse.
The latter is a Minister witbout Portfoalla,
and fromn what I read ini the press I gather
that be is a very busy minister. Persanally, I
arn satisfied that he is a minister of sometbing,
but I just cannot put my finger on what
it is. The nearest I can came ta, describing
bis position is ta say that be is a minister
of intangible affairs.
Honourable senators, I also welcome the
other new senators. I shaîl refer in a moment
ta, tbe mover o! tbe address (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier). Perbaps 1 may be excused for extending a special
greeting ta Senator Grattan O'Leary, because
when I first came ta Parliament I found th-at
my naine appeared often in the Ottawa
Journal, and I felt that tbis was of bis doing.
1 bave been grateful ta hlm ever since, although I must say that during that periad
I would one day be deligbted with wbat I
read and another day I would not. However,
I know we are all pleased ta bave him, in aur
midst, and I arn sure that bis stay bere will
be pleasant ta bimself and profitable ta tbe
nation.
As I said before I shall not refer persanally ta tbe ather newly-summoned. senators.

SENATE
They have all had public service-some directly in their provincial legislature, or in the
Parliament of Canada, or in connection with
political affairs. They have all taken an interest in the public welfare and I am sure
that their appointment to the Senate is in
keeping with the high standards of previous
appointments to this chamber.
I would now like to refer to the Honourable
Senator Haig who moved the address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. He did it in
a most excellent manner. He spoke as his
father spoke here, as I recall, about his beloved province of Manitoba. We know how
dearly he loved his province, and apparently
his son has the same affection for and takes
the same interest in it. We hope it will prosper in the manner he envisaged in his remarks during the Throne Speech debate yesterday. His father is missed in the Senate,
having resigned because of ill health. Another
one of our members has also resigned. I refer to Senator Thomas Farquhar.
Senator John T. Haig had first served his
municipality; he then went into the Legislature of Manitoba, and subsequently came
to the Parliament of Canada.
Senator Farquhar had a similar career. He
had served his municipality; he had been
mayor of Sault Ste. Marie; he had been in
the Legislature of Ontario; and he had served
in the Parliament of Canada as a commoner
before he came to the Senate.
Both these gentlemen served their country
well. We are sorry that ill health prevents
their being with us, and we would like all
members of their families to know how much
we appreciate them. We only trust they will
continue to live in comfort, without pain,
despite their poor health, in the years to
come, and over those years we shall be thinking of them.
I am very glad to see my good friend from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) in his
place.
(Translation):
I congratulate him. His wisdom and his
friendly smile will stand him in good stead no
doubt. I hope he will be deputy leader for
some years without sitting too long on the
Speaker's right.
(Text):
While we are in this happy mood I would
like to refer to an honour which has come to
one of our senators during the recess. I refer
to Honourable Senator Cameron, to whom
the University of Alberta awarded its Golden
Jubilee Award for his contribution to the life
of the province. It was a well-deserved
reward.
I also wish to congratulate the honourable
senator from Madawaska-Restigouche (Hon.
Mr. Fournier) who seconded the motion for

the address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne. He told us about his beautiful
province of New Brunswick and inspired in
us a desire to visit it, just as did Senator
Haig with regard to Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Farris: You will not be disappointed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Senator
Farris says that I will not be disappointed. I
know that he is referring to New Brunswick,
because that is where he was born. However,
I can add that we shall not be disappointed
when we visit Manitoba, as Senator Beaubien
(Provencher) says.
I also wish to congratulate Senator Fournier
for his fluency in both our languages. He is
completely bilingual, and has set a splendid
example for some of us who are struggling
to learn his delightful tongue.
Honourable senators, so far in this debate
there has been very little said about the election which took place during the interval in
which we have been absent fron Ottawa,
and I know that you would all be disappointed if I did not have something to say
about it.
What are the facts about the result of that
election? The most notable is that the Liberals, under the leadership of the Honourable
Lester B. Pearson, achieved the greatest
political comeback in the history of CanadaI do not have to add anything to that statement-whereas, the Progressive Conservatives
suffered the most overwhelming defeat ever
delivered to any political party in the history
of Canada.
Honourable senators, never had a Prime
Minister such a large following in the House
of Commons as Mr. Diefenbaker had in 1958.
But how the mighty did fall! On June 18,
instead of holding 208 seats the Progressive
Conservative candidates were successful in
only 116 constituencies, which is considerably
less than the number required for an overall
majority. Despite this the Prime Minister
presumed to represent Canada at the Commonwealth Conference, without first obtaining
authority from Parliament to do so. Not that
I object to his going to London-I want to
make that clear-but, being the head of a
minority government, the least he could have
donc was call Parliament and receive a vote
of confidence.
You will recall that on June 18 the Prime
Minister and his government were completely
discredited at the polls. The people had
spoken: the electors, in overwhelming numbers, had said that they did not like the way
the Government was conducting the affairs
of the country. Under these circumstances,
had he any respect for the democratic processes of our Constitution, of which we and
he proudly boast, only one course was open

OCTOBER 4. 1962
to him, that of consulting the people's representatives in Parliament before presuming to
represent Canada at this most important conference.
Honourable senators, his actions in this
matter are now history; it is a fait accompli.
You might ask: why bother talking about it?
But, honourable senators, the Prime Minister
has established a precedent. In my humble
opinion-and I am satisfied it is the opinion
of all eminent constitutional authorities-it
is a very bad precedent, and I hope that no
future Prime Minister will follow it.
Now perhaps I should say a few words
about this conference. Did Canada's representatives act at the conference in a manner
which met with the approval of Canadians
from coast to coast? In my opinion the answer
is no; far from it. Most Canadians with
whoa I spoke not only disagreed with what
was being done, but were completely disgusted with the stand which Canada took;
and I hazard the guess that had a poll been
taken at that time the Government would
have found few Canadians in accord with
what was being done.
The press was not happy about it. You
might say: that is the Liberal press and I
am not going to read any extracts from the
Liberal press. However, I think it is fair for
me to read a comment from the Toronto
Globe and Mail of January 10 last, as I do not
think anybody would say that paper leans too
strongly towards the Liberals.
Hon. Mr. McCuicheon: Or towards the
Conservatives.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Perhaps
not. Might I accept the suggestion of the
honourable minister, and say that it is a nonpartisan paper? This is what that non-partisan paper had to say:
The long period during which Canada
behaved like a tearful infant, certain
that Mother's entry into a new sphere
would hurt the baby, merely prevented
this country from exerting its proper
influence on the negotiations and from
developing the necessary attitudes to
profit from new developments.
Officially, Ottawa has now decided to
grow up and face with maturity whatever the Common Market should produce.
It should tell Canada House to put away
its hanky and do the same.
I should also like to read an extract from
the Winnipeg Free Press of May 15 last. That
paper, I will admit, is one that does not lean
too strongly towards the Conservative party.
In it I find these words:
For the privilege of installing itself as
the dog in the international manger
Canada already has paid a high price,
27511-5-3

much of it yet incalculable. The final
cost of its outright quarrel with Britain,
on the issue of the Common Market, and
its fractured friendship with the United
States cannot be reckoned only in economic terms. Under the best of conditions, and under a new governnent, it
will take a long time to repair the recent
damage to Canada's stature, influence and
self-respect.
The Canadian people may well ask
how the Diefenbaker government managed to plunge them into this state of
isolation from their closest and most
important friends abroad.
Honourable senators, the last reference I
shall make is to a few words from the Calgary Herald of April 24. Referring to the
Government it says:
Its incredibly inept approach to the
European Common Market changed
Canada's stature abroad.
Now, honourable senators, I shall not quote
further, but from what I have read-and I
think they were representative statements
of the press throughout the country-it is
clear the Prime Minister did not present to
the conference the views of the great majority
of Canadian people. The citizens of Canada
by and large do not want to put roadblocks
in the path of Britain's entry into the Common Market. Of course we want to retain
our preferences, but if we analyse the remarks of Prime Minister Macmillan, it is
clear that the United Kingdom cannot much
longer maintain ber present state of economy
unless she does join the European Common
Market. It is obvious that unless Britain is
strong our trade preferences will be of little
value. Of course when she joins the Common
Market there will have to be adjustments
in our trading pattern, but it is clear that
in the long run-and it will not be so long
at that-Canada's trade with a strong and
ever-strengthening United Kingdom will be
much more valuable than with a United
Kingdom isolated from the Inner Six and
putting up an unequal struggle to maintain
ber present position.
Honourable senators, there is another reason why Britain-and I shall put it in the
affirmative-should be encouraged to join
the Common Market. The reason to which
I am going to refer far transcends that of
trade. It has to do with the peace of the
world, and nothing is more important. Most
of us have witnessed the agonies, the destruction, the suffering and desolation of
two world wars. Prior to 1914 Britain was
going her own way, as were the nations of
Europe, without regard to and without consultation with the other European countries.

SENATE
There was no common meeting place at which
these nations could iron out their problems
and settle them by free discussions. What
happened? Suddenly one nation attacked another and within a few days the most devastating war in world history to that time
had commenced. Again, in 1939, history was
repeated: the world once again was plunged
into an equally or even more devastating war
than that of 1914-1918.
Honourable senators, far be it frorn me
to say that neither of these wars would
have taken place if there had been an
organization such as the European Common
Market, but I will say that it is far less likely
there will be a war in the future if the
European nations meet in session regularly,
say every month or so, and discuss their
mutual problems. No one nation or group
of nations can absolutely guarantee the peace
of the world, but the prospects for peace will
be much greater, in my opinion, with the
European community of nations than without it.
Now, honourable senators, I want to give
one more reason why I favour Britain's
joining of the Common Market. There is one
very powerful nation which strongly opposes
it: that is the Soviet Union. Mr. Khrushchev
has made it clear over the past few years
that, as one of the aims of his country, he
is intent on economic penetration in terms
of cutting out traditional markets of the free
world. Honourable senators will recall his
memorable phrase some years ago when he
said that he intended to bury us; be meant
to "bury us" commercially. It is elementary
that the formation and support of the Common Market would certainly not assist him
in that process. Consequently, I would say
that if Mr. Khrushchev is against the Common Market there is every reason why we
should be for it, and why Canada should do
all in her power to help Britain enter it
and make it a stronger force than ever.
Let me now say a few words about our
own country, Canada. It seems to me that during the last few months the Government has
been talking too much about other countries
and not giving enough attention to what Canada must do to help herself. In spite of our
$11 billion value in trade and the huge sums
that Canada in the last few years has been
piling up, there has been, and I am afraid
there continues to be, a decline on the part
of Canada. In other words, we are on the
downgrade in regard to our economy, especially in the commercial world. For some
reason other countries have lost confidence in
Canada or, should I say, have lost confidence
in those who are administering Canada's affairs. It may be because over the last five
years we have been piling up deficit after

deficit, amounting to something like $3 billion, and the $2 billion by which the former
Government had reduced the national debt
bas been wiped out. It may be that this confidence was lost because at certain periods during the last two or three years as much as
nine per cent of our employable population
was out of work.
Then, again, it may not be on account of
these deficits and unemployment, but rather
because of the failure of the Government to
take adequate steps to meet these problems.
In spite of the protests which were made
about these growing deficits-and who does
not remember the repeated warnings in this
house of the honourable Senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)-this Government bas
allowed deficit after deficit to be piled up.
Furthermore, in spite of warnings given in
the Senate and in the other house about the
unemployment situation into which Canada
was drifting for years, what was done about
it? It was laughed off and we were merely described as doomsters and gloomsters. That
was the situation for three years: the unemployment figures rose and nothing was done.
Honourable senators, whatever the cause,
we are today faced with the unfortunate situation that we have lost a great deal of the
confidence of those, both at home and abroad,
who in the past have done so much to assist
us in extending and developing our economy.
Honourable senators, I do not think it is any
use trying to delude ourselves into believing
that this confidence bas not been lost. Let
me give you a few examples which prove
that there is some loss, at least, of confidence
by large trust investment companies who are
not only diverting their trust funds to other
countries but are actually selling the stocks
which they have in Canadian companies. One
of the largest trust investment companies
which invests a great deal of money in Canada is the Scudder Fund of Canada, Ltd., a
huge United States-owned company.
In the first quarter of this year that company sold all of the shares it had in nine
Canadian companies; it bought no Canadian
shares whatever, but rather sought investment outside the country. I ask you, honourable senators, if this company had any confidence in Canada and its administration do
you think it would have taken that attitude?
Honourable senators, I hold in my hand
the report of the Loomis-Sayles Canadian
and International Fund Ltd. This is one large
trust investment company which, under its
bylaws, was required to invest 60 per cent
of its funds in Canadian securities, but in June
of this year the bylaws were amended to require it to invest not more than 35 per cent

OCTOBER 4. 1962
of its funds in Canadian securities and the
difference was invested abroad. Does this show
any confidence in Canada?
Also, honourable senators, on the financial
page of the Brantford Expositor I read that
the Supervisor of Pension Funds of a large
Canadian trust company said, in part:
The fall in the stock market has been
accompanied by a decline in bond prices.
These developments portray the general
feeling of concern ...
Not only have the financial interests lost
confidence in Canada, honourable senators,
but so have many of our own people. According to Mr. Pollock, the president of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, as reported
in the Globe and Mail, last year more people
left Canada than actually came into Canada.
The report reads:
Recent figures showed that 70,000 persons had come to Canada in the year to
June 1, 1962, but 73,000 had left the
country.
In commenting on that statement Mr. Pollock
said:
These figures satisfy me that we are
neither making Canada an attractive
place in which to live and work, nor are
we building the large domestic market
we need to consume the goods our manufacturers produce.
Honourable senators, it is not only the national and international investor and the potential immigrant who have shown a lack
of confidence in this country, but it is also
the newspapers. I have extracts here from
such papers as the Calgary Herald which
certainly show a lack of confidence in the
country. In an editorial in that paper referring to the Government, I read the following
words:
It has run the country into alarming
debt, and has placed a mortgage on the
future of every taxpayer.
The editorial concludes with these words:
On the domestic scene, the Government
made a grotesque shambles of the Coyne
affair, with international repercussions.
It is not necessary for me to read any extracts to you, honourable senators, showing
that organized labour has lost confidence in
our Government.
I think from what I have read it is clear
that the Canadian Manufacturers' Association
has lost confidence in our Government. The
president of that association only a few days
ago said:
Canadian borrowing from the International Monetary Fund, the United States
27511-5-S

and the United Kingdom, will not save
Canada from the brink of bankruptcy.
Those are very strong words.
Agriculture has no confidence in this administration, as is revealed by the influential
Family Herald, an independent national farm
magazine. That newspaper said that the record of the present Government
... has been a period of confusion and

contradiction, of expediency and muddle,
of undignified wrangles at home and
abroad.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: What is the date of the
issue in which that appeared?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): June 14.
It is very recent.
As a matter of fact, honourable senators,
there seems to be only one person who has
any confidence in the administration-or, at
least, did have any confidence in the administration-and that is the Prime Minister himself. This is what he had to say on May 14:
You will allow me, I am sure, on this
occasion to take some measure of credit
to the Government I have the honour to
lead for some of the things that have
brought about this new climate of confidence among Canadians.
Then, on June 4 he said:
And it's a decision that is, as I see it,
as one between the positive optimistic
and confident approach to the future...
On June 11 he said, Fellow citizensI asked for your support. I asked for
your confidence. I have told you the
truth and the facts. Let's go forward
together.
And finally, in his concluding television
broadcast on June 14, he said:
The truth has been on our side. We
have given you the facts. We have bared
the record. We have concealed nothing
and shaded nothing.
That was an expression of confidence, expressed a few days before the election, but
within ten days the Prime Minister himself
had lost confidence in his policies. A few weeks
before the Prime Minister had said, with al
the confidence he could muster, that all was
well, and that he unreservedly placed his full
confidence in his administration and in his
economic and financial measures, but when
the election was over he had to admit that
that confidence had been misplaced.
I am not going to discuss the causes that
brought about, nor the purposes of, the socalled austerity measures embarked upon by

SENATE

the Government and announced, not to Parliament but, in a television broadcast. The
Government may have "concealed nothing
and shaded nothing," as the Prime Minister
said on June 14, but if that is so then the
next ten days brought about quite a revelation. It is difficult to believe that the situation
could have deteriorated so rapidly.
I do not accuse anyone of saying anything
that was not true. Probably the Prime Minister had been misinformed, or had failed to
heed the advice of his officials, as he had
frequently failed to heed advice on the
economic situation of the country given to
him in both houses of Parliament, and also
by prominent economists throughout the
country. A few minutes ago I said that the
only person who really had any confidence in
the Government was the Prime Minister himself, but the sole interpretation that one can
put upon his television announcement six
days after the election is that he too had
lost confidence in his administration.
Honourable senators, whether or not you
agree with me on what I have said with
respect to confidence-and I am sure many
honourable senators sitting opposite me do
not agree entirely with what I have saidI think it must be admitted that there are
some grounds for the statements I have made.
I think it is possible that my honourable
colleagues opposite have at times questioned
themselves, and have wondered whether they
had lost confidence in their administration.
Some Hon. Senators: Never.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: I would like to ask the
honourable leader, would he as an individual
lend money to a person in whom he had lost
confidence? I refer to the loans made by the
International Monetary Fund and by the
United States Government, totalling $1,300
million dollars. Does that show loss of confidence?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): That is
a question. I am not at this time saying that
I criticize the Canadian Government for
having gone to the International Monetary
Fund to beg a loan from that fund. That fund
was set up to assist nations which were in
financial distress, and the very fact that the
Government went to this fund is the best
proof that Canada was in financial distress.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: What would you say?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I would
say to my friend that I hope she is getting it.
I am glad he asked me the question.
Honourable senators, whether or not you
agree with me that there was lack of confidence, I think you must agree that very many
people still question it and are hoping that

something might be done to restore that confidence. We hoped that we would find something
in the Speech from the Throne to that end,
but we have looked in vain.
There is one clause in the Speech from the
Throne which probably aims at assuring us
that confidence will be restored. I will
read the clause:
The purposes of the fiscal measures to
be placed before you at this session will
be the creation of better employment opportunities for the Canadian people . . .
the strengthening of Canada's balance of
international payments and the maintenance of stability in prices. New budget
measures will be introduced to provide
further solutions to long-term problems.
Honourable senators, those are fine words-indeed, a worthy endeavour-but what evidence is there of any action on the part
of the Government to give effect to those fine
words?
We look in vain for any encouragement in
the Speech from the Throne. Is the Government at long last recognizing the existence of
these vexing problems of unemployment and
economic instability? I hope so. I repeat, there
is little encouragement one can get from the
Speech from the Throne. One exception to that
may be found in the reference to a national
economic development board. There is some
encouragement there. The reference to such
a board is very hopeful, and I trust it will
be established. If so, I wonder if that board
will be under the direction of the honourable
minister from this house. The Government
could not do better than put the board under
his direction. Probably he will tell us something about that when he addresses the house,
either on the Throne Speech or at some appropriate time.
Of course, the board should have been set
up some time ago. It has been advocated by
us for the last three years, but for some reason
or another you just have to keep on prodding
this Government before you can get any
action.
When it is set up the board will have
heavy responsibilities. One of its functions will
be to create an economic climate and an atmosphere of confidence which will make it
possible to continue the jobs of those who are
now employed, to create jobs for those who
are now unemployed and for those who are
yearly coming on the labour market in everincreasing numbers. I say "in ever-increasing
numbers" because within six or seven years
there will be twice as many young people
coming on the labour market as there are
coming on it today.
To bring about such conditions as will make
it possible to assist these young Canadians
is indeed a very heavy task. I am sure that

OCTOBER 4, 1962
ail honourable senators realize the problem
with which this new board will be faced.
Whatever government is in office, and I
hope it will not be a minority government, I
am confident that all honourable senators,
on both sides of this house, will support any
legislation which is likely to bring about those
very desirable and necessary objectives for
which the board is being constituted.
Honourable senators, I must admit that up
to the present time the greater part of my
speech has been of a critical nature. I feel
that honourable senators would have been
disappointed had that not been so.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It was not serious.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Indeed,
criticism is the main function of the Opposition. That is why we are so named. If we
did not oppose, we would have to change our
name. However, we have another function,
that is, while opposing, to make alternative
proposais wherever possible and to advance
any suggestions which we think will be in
the interests of the people. In other words,
we should be helpful to the Government in a
positive way. I feel that we are helpful to
the Government frorm time to time in a negative way also, but we certainly have that
other responsibility to be helpful in a positive
way. I hope that what I am about to say now
will be taken in that vein and accepted in the
spirit in which I express it.
Over the years, since 1867, one central
theme has dominated the discussions in the
Senate and in the House of Commons, that
is to say, export trade. It is an interesting
fact that one job in every five in Canada is
dependent upon export trade.
All governments, with the possible exception of the governments in office during
time of war, have had to concern themselves
with exports. The question of tariffs is one
which over the years has divided opinion
across this country. There have been heated
debates on the tariff issue.
My party has steadfastly taken the general
position that an orderly removal of trade
barriers is in the interests of this country.
We are confronted today with the Common
Market, to which so much reference has been
made in recent months. The position of Canada as a world trader is affected by the emergence of the new patterns of trade which
the Common Market must inevitably bring
about. Our employment rate is tied directly to
the necessity for keeping the export of our
products at a high level.
It was no less a person than the president
of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Mr. N. R.
Crump, who said in Windsor early this year
that trade expansion and not protectionism
is the key to full employment and a higher
standard of living in Canada. I do not know

what Mr. Crump's politics are; I do not think
he has ever been considered a Liberal, but
that is what he said this year.
Mr. Crump's speech leads me to make
some suggestions which I hope will be helpfui. He made the basic point that the Canadian market is simply not big enough to
absorb the tremendous productive capacity
of our extractive industries, and said that a
retreat into economic isolation would inevitably mean a lower living standard. Will
honourable senators permit me to set out
for their consideration some goals which I
think are all important in the field of trade?
Perhaps not all of these goals can be accomplished, and some will take longer to
achieve than we would like. Nevertheless,
I offer them in the hope that we can, with
all possible speed, put trade in a better
position in our country and thereby give
higher employment and a better standard
of living. My six suggestions are: First, let
us bend every effort toward the expansion
of our exports, not only in our primary
industries, but also in the field of our secondary industries, which are far too low down
on the list of our domestic exports. If my
memory serves me correctly, manufactured
articles of any kind come thirteenth amongst
our exports. This is too far down the list.
We have to find markets for more of our
manufactured exports.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Is not pulp and paper
the first on the list?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Part of
it is.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: There are thousands
employed in the pulp and paper industry.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Pulp and
paper does stand higher than thirteenth on
the list, but it is interesting to note that
heavy industry, as perhaps it should be
called, is thirteenth on the list.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: You said manufactured
goods. Paper is a manufactured article.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Weil, with
the exception of paper.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Oh, there are others, if
you go down the list.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): There
may be some lumber, bu-t I doubt it. Pulp is
partly manufactured; but certainly what are
regarded generally as manufactured goods,
such as agricultural instruments, stand as
the thirteenth item on the list. These are
too low on the list because the building and
developing of the large cities in Canada is

SENATE
being done mostly by manufacturing companies. It is clear that we cannot just manufacture goods for our own people, we must
send them abroad. I repeat that thirteenth
on the list is far too low for this item.
Secondly: Let us recognize the existence
of a European Common Market. It is a fact
of life. Let us devote relentless energy towards the expansion of a Common Market
in an enlarged European Economic Community.
Thirdly: Let us recognize the significant
step forward which was recently taken by the
United States, a most exciting move, and let
us associate ourselves with that move in an
effort to strengthen it by joining with
President Kennedy in a joint declaration that
we and the United States are anxious to take
united action with the European Common
Market in order not to restrict but to expand
trade.
Fourthly: Let us-and this follows from
what I have just said-give serious and
urgent consideration to the institution of an
Atlantic Community. May I interject here
to say that that was originally proposed by
my leader, Hon. Mr. Pearson. This would
bring together Britain, the existing Common
Market, other European countries on this
side of the Iron Curtain, the United States,
Canada and any affected nations who may
care to join us as an expanding community.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: That is not original, I
might say, as far as the honourable leader is
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I do not
say that anything I have said today is original, but these are proposals I am advancing
to the Government. The proposals which are
not original should have received the attention of the Government long before this.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Many of them have.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I am
sorry, but they have not received attention;
the Government should have given them
attention long before this. I leave it to the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
to advance these proposals this time. He says
they have been brought to the attention of
the Government. Well, we are fortunate this
time to have in this house one who has been
a member of the Cabinet and I am sure he
will not hesitate at the earliest opportunity
to bring to the attention of the Government
any of my suggestions with which he agrees.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I was just about to say

to the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that Canada is recognized out of 104 nations as one of the first
five nations which has given help to underdeveloped nations in the world, and that
Canada is one of the nations which has
developed the idea of giving food and assistance to underdeveloped nations probably more

posals I make and to which I trust the GovThe main principles to which I have alluded in the past are four in number. In the
ernment will give some attention.

OCTOBER 4, 1962
first place we ail recognize the overriding
responsibility of the Senate to make the
Constitution of Canada work. We realize that
the Canadian Constitution, like ail constitutions based on the British tradition of parliamentary government, is a finely-tuned and
delicately-balanced instrument. Accordingly,
we do not propose ta assert our legal rights
and prerogatives to the prejudice of common
sense or reason, or to the sacrifice of the
proper functioning of our constitutional machinery. We will not be hidebound by tradition, but neither will we forget or disregard
the importance of tradition in the continuation of our constitutional process. As Sir
Robert Borden has well said, no system of
government cast on the British mould could
long survive if the executive and each house
of Parliament were to exercise their powers
constantly and to the legal limit. The Senate
was expected by the Fathers of Confederation
to act responsibly at ail times, and I am confident that it will continue to do so in the
new Parliament.
We should not-and I am expressing my
own opinion-automatically resist every government measure which comes before us. To
do so purely out of party considerations would
be to hamper any effective government of
our nation.
Secondly, I have asserted in the past, and
I do so again, the right of the Senate ta
amend money bills whenever the amendment
will not increase an appropriation or any
charge upon the people. While maintaining
the prerogatives of the Senate in this regard
I have often expressed the opinion, which
I still hold-and the honourable Leader of the
Government in the Senate last year brought
this forcibly to my attention-that the
Senate should not lightly or without the most
mature refiection seek ta alter the terms of
a money bill in such a way as ta affect substantially the balance of ways and means.
Thirdly-and now I come ta the more difficuit question of mandate. I said these words
in 1957, I repeated them in 1958, and today
I again repeat them:
I think that we would ail do well ta
remember that the Senate bas nat, traditionally, resisted the adoption of any
piece of government legislation for which
a government has received a clear popular mandate, whether as the result of a
general election or otherwise. Nor would
it, in my view, be inclined ta do so in
future in the absence of the most cornpelling reasons for believing that the
issue should be referred once again to
the electorate.
Then I quoted a classic extract from the
speech delivered by the Right Honourable

Arthur Meighen when he was Leader of the
Opposition in this chamber. My views are
substantially the same as his. I will not take
time to read what he said at that time. If
any honourable senators are interested in
what he said I would refer them to the
Debates of the Senate for the 1957-58 session,
page 37 where I quoted his words.
My words and his speak for themselves,
and I stand by them; but now, of course,
they must be read in the context of today.
Honourable senators, arithmetic is an exact though somewhat dismal subject. It is
necessary, however, for me to refer once
again ta the results of the general election
of June 18, 1962. I am not doing this for any
political purpose but in order ta make my
point. Before that election the present administration had in the House of Commons
an overwhelming majority of members who
had been elected by an unprecedented popular vote. Accordingly, I frankly conceded in
1958, and I quote:
It has received a general mandate ta
administer the affairs of the country for
the next five years and has received a
specific mandate in certain matters.
Honourable senators, in consequence of the
recent general election, the statement I have
just quoted no longer stands. The Government
has now elected a substantial minority of
members to the House of Commons and these
were elected by a comparatively small percentage of the popular vote.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Thirty-seven per cent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): In addition it elected only a minority of members
from the two most populous provinces of
Canada. Nor has it indeed been demonstrated
that the Government can command the support of the House of Commons for any appreciable length of time.
Accordingly, I feel that I should be just
as frank now as I was in 1958. The Government remains in office by sufferance of those
members of Parliament who, during the election, opposed the policies and prograrn of the
Government. It has no clear mandate from
the people, either as ta general policy or as
ta specific measures. We must, as a responsible second chamber, take the general attitude that no piece of government legislation
which might come before us in the current
session could be said ta have behind it a
clear popular mandate. Therefore, it will be
necessary for us in each case to give all legislation even more searching investigation than
has been our custorn following a conclusive
popular verdict.
Honourable senators, this leads me ta the
fourth and the most important principle in

SENATE
my view relating ta the canstitutional. responsibilities of the Senate. This principle remains
as applicable today as At ever did. To use the
words of Sir John A. Macdonald, it is Our
duty ta take a "saber second look" at al
governmnent legisiation. I said in 1957 and
1 repeat now:
It is therefore a solemn trust, which
ail senators share alike, to examine with
the utmost care ail legisiation which bas
passed the House of Commons,. This we
must do ta ensure that those basic
principles which ail Canadians hold dear
are flot iightly or carelessly cast aside for
any reason, whether through haste or
impulse on the part of the House of

Cammons, or as a result of palitical, expediency, or compromise, or otherwise.
Honourable senators, xnay 1 conclude by
saying I arn confident that the business of
this session will be considered by us far
beyond the sharp divisions of party politics,
just as in the past, and that we shall at al
times consider what is in the best interests
oniy of Canada as a whole. In this regard
minority governments ýcast an added onus on
the Senate, and we must remain more alert
and consciaus of aur duties than ai aur
prerogatives.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 4, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Haig, seconded by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
allow me to join with those who have spoken
already in this debate, to express my congratulations to our distinguished Speaker. We
have all heard with great pleasure of his appointment to the Chair of this chamber. He
brings to the post great distinction and dignity. I sincerely hope that he enjoys presiding over our deliberations as much as we
enjoy having him do so and that he will
continue as chief custodian of our rules and
privileges for many years to come. To me it
gives a special pleasure to see an old and
distinguished friend and comrade receive such
a high honour.
I welcome the honourable senator from La
Salle (Hon. Mr. Drouin) to the floor of the
Senate. As our honourable Speaker for the past
several sessions he was necessarily confined in
his remarks to that sphere. We look forward
now to his active participation in the debates
of the Senate. The wisdom and insight which
he displayed as Speaker promise us an excellent contribution. Few men are better
qualified.
Again honourable senators, I would like for
a moment to pay tribute to my affable and
capable colleague (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) whose
duties I have assumed as Leader of the Government. I hope that when my turn comes to
lay aside this task, be it early or late, it can
be said of me, as is said now of the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that he has the respect and admiration of
all parties.
Very shortly after I was appointed, I received a letter from Senator Aseltine warmly
congratulating me and offering any assistance
he could give. I was not surprised, and gratefully accepted his offer. I expect to rely
heavily on his long experience, particularly
during this session of Parliament. May I say,
honourable senators, that I feel I am indeed
fortunate to have the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on my left and
the honourable senator from Ottawa East

(Hon. Mr. Choquette) on my right. They will
probably keep me fairly straight.
I am grateful too for the ready help and
advice that many senators have promised me
as a new boy at the desk of the Leader of
the Government. If the addresses we have
heard from the mover (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
the seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier, MadawaskaRestigouche), for an address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne are a fair sample
of what we may expect from the new senators
we have welcomed to this chamber, the
Senate will be indeed enriched by their presence. The quality of Senator Haig's fine
speech on Wednesday last came as no surprise
to those familiar with his success at the
Manitoba Bar and his reputation in the city
of Winnipeg. I offer him my heartiest congratulations, both on his accession to this
body and on his first contribution to our
debates. Honourable senators, I could not
help feeling how proud his distinguished
father, who was a member of the Senate
for so many years, would have been had
he been present to hear his distinguished
son deliver his speech the other day.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The seconder of the
address in reply, the honourable senator from
Madawaska-Restigouche (Hon. Mr. Fournier)
comes frorn my native province and has long
been a personal friend of mine. His service
to the province of New Brunswick and to the
Acadian people he represents is well known
there. He brings to this chamber a wide
experience in public affairs. I congratulate
him, too, upon his splendid maiden speech of
Wednesday last. I might say, honourable
senators, that he had a short time to prepare,
since he became a senator only a few days
before the Senate opened, for which he
deserves all the more credit. I compliment
him for the excellence of his speech, both in
material and delivery.
Again I extend my welcome and hearty
congratulations to our new senators. I can
truthfully say we have one of the most promising and able freshmen classes that ever
entered this chamber. This includes one of
Canada's most able and successful businessmen, the honourable senator from Gormley
(Hon. Mr. McCutcheon). We are proud and
happy that he was chosen a member of Prime
Minister
Diefenbaker's
cabinet. Senator
Grattan O'Leary is one whose reputation as
a journalist and orator is second to none in
Canada. Senators Haig and Willis are outstanding members of the Canadian Bar. We
have an outstanding businessman and organizer in Senator Grosart; we have a former
minister of a provincial house and an expert

OCTOBER 9, 1962
in hydro development, in Senator Edgar
Fournier; a hard working ex-member of
Parliament, in Senator Clement O'Leary; and
an outstanding fruit grower and exporter
from the province of Nova Scotia, in Senator
Welch. These gentlemen are all able and wellequipped to make major contributions to our
work and to our debates.
We miss Senator Thomas Farquhar and
Senator John T. Haig, who resigned a short
time ago because of ill health. You all knew
these two fine gentlemen. We join the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald, Brantford), in the sincere wish,
which he so eloquently expressed in his
speech of the other day, that "they will
continue to live in comfort, without pain,
despite their poor health, in the years to come,
and over those years we shall be thinking of
them."
I join the honourable Leader of the Opposition in congratulating Honourable Senator
Cameron on his receiving the Golden Jubilee
Award from the University of Alberta, which
was certainly well-deserved.
It is appropriate, while we are extending
congratulations, to refer to the great honour
which has come to the honourable senator
from North York (Hon. Mr. Sullivan). He bas
been elected President of the American
Otological Society, the leading ear surgical
society of the world and, in addition, bas been
made an honorary member of the Canadian
Otological Society, an honour which I understand is shared by only three other men in
the world. I believe that to be president of the
American society is looked on as being one
step lower than receiving the Nobel Prize.
We heartily congratulate our genial Senator
Sullivan.
Honourable senators, I am grateful to all of
you for kind remarks and good wishes to me
in this role as Leader of the Government.
Particularly, I am indebted to the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) for his generous words and
for the co-operation and amity he has extended to me to date in the session. I had, of
course, expected nothing else from this most
gracious gentleman, as we all know the
Leader of the Opposition to be, and especially
from an old friend and comrade, from 1935,
when we were in the House of Commons, to
this day.
At this time I wish to join Your Honour in
an expression of sincere sympathy-and I
am sure I speak for all honourable senatorsto Senator Ross Macdonald on the tragedy
which has come to hirn and his family in the
loss of his dear and lovely wife who for many
years has been a kind and a good friend to
all of us.
27511-5-4j

I look forward confidently to a continuance
of the amicable relations that obtained between the Leader of the Opposition and my
predecessor. I think we both appreciate that
the need for cool heads and calm judgment
here is all the greater in a session when
tempers in other forums will be shorter even
than usual.
Honourable senators, I am deeply conscious
that I follow in the footsteps of exceedingly
able men in the post of Leader of the Government. I hope that in some small degree
I can measure up to the standard of excellence
which is the legacy from the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), the Honourable Mr.
Robertson and the Honourable Mr. Aseltine,
who are still my colleagues in the Senate.
I am indeed humble as I cast memory's eye
upon the list of distinguished and able parliamentarians who over the years have
occupied this role. In other days it was the
seat of Arthur Meighen, whose deft imagery
and eloquent phrases still linger in this chamber. Here stood the great Dandurand of
precise logic and honed argument. This old
room was host to many of the chieftains of
our history. It is with pride and humility that
we hold today, in our turn, the customs and
high standards which they have passed to us.
Honourable senators, the first paragraphs
of the Speech from the Throne remind us
how important are the links which bind
together the members of the Commonwealth.
Since the last session of Parliament we have
been host to His Royal Highness, the Duke
of Edinburgh, and to Her Royal Highness, the
Princess Royal. In the past four months we
have welcomed four new self-governing members of the Commonwealth, strengthening one
of the greatest associations of nations that
the world has ever known under a common
spirit and tradition, regardless of race or
creed. Honourable senators, no one knows
better than we do how firm are the bonds
that bind us. We have fought side by side in
war. We have through many generations
walked arm in arm in peace with the older
members of the Commonwealth, and we hope
to do so with the newer ones. Only those who
cannot understand this unusual filial trust
that stretches across vast continents and
every sea and into every clime can make the
mistake of looking upon a family conference
as a family quarrel. We have conducted negotiations in the Commonwealth in other days
much more difficult than any that face us
now and have always emerged from our compromises even stronger than before.
While we look abroad to our friends in this
commonwealth family, and strengthen our
ties with other nations of the world, we shall

SENATE
in this session of Parliament see positive
measures designed to foster and strengthen
our national spirit. In particular, as we
approach our centennial ceremonies, I am
sure all will welcome the Prime Minister's
and the Government's proposals to help search
out for all Canadians an even deeper pride
in our land. The conference of Canada and
the provinces in consultation regarding the
choice of a national flag and other national
symbols forecast in the Speech from the
Throne could well spark a re-dedication to
our national theme.
All Canadians have noted with interest and
agreement that a resolution will be introduced to provide for the repatriation of the
Constitution of Canada and the concurrence
of the provinces to this end. The opening of
Canada's vast north will some day mean the
establishment of new provinces there and it
is surely not too early to improve the constitutional organization of the Northwest Territories and to provide more self-government
for our Canadian citizens north of the sixtieth
parallel.
We also look forward with interest to the
implementation of measures which will encourage the development of Canadian periodical literature. In the hearts of Canadians
today there is an ever-growing desire to knit
together all provinces and regions into a
stronger and more prideful people, ever more
conscious of our history and national purpose.
Under the leadership of the Prime Minister
we are moving most rapidly in this direction.
This is the time to round out Confederation,
in the spirit as well as in the law, to confirm
our nationhood in form as it is in fact.
It was very gratifying to note in the Speech
from the Throne the continued marked
emphasis upon steps to stimulate and boost
the economy. As the Prime Minister expressed
it, the primary goal of the moment and the
distinct feature of the Throne Speech is "to
keep Canada moving economically". I know
all honourable senators will agree that that
objective must at this time override most
other considerations and, in particular, partisan considerations.
Honourable senators, we look out from this
chamber on a rapidly changing world. The
current of events in this decade swirls along
in a headlong rush that waits for no man and
no nation. In its course old buttresses and
monuments are crumbling to be replaced by
the modern, the scientific and the new. This is
as true of national economies as it is of the
satellites careening through the vast voids
of space. Canada bas recently shown it can
take its place in the world of cosmic flight and
investigation. And the Speech from the Throne

indicates that we are also reaching out to new
methods of organizing our economy and planning our future.
One of the most interesting proposals of
the Throne Speech, and one which I suggest
is the beacon of the future, is the establishment of a National Economic Development
Board. The purpose of this board is generally
defined as follows, and I quote from the
Throne Speech:
This board would be broadly representative and would review and report upon
the state of the economy and upon economic policies. It would also have the duty of
recommending to the Government particular projects or measures which it considers would be in the interest of national development, including projects
which may require direct governmental
participation by way of financial aid or
otherwise.
This proposal follows the constitution of
the National Productivity Council in the last
Parliament.
We hear much these days about the success
of the European Economic Community. It is
well to remember that, while an important
reason for this success is due to the reduction
of barriers to trade between the member countries, such as tariff and currency problems,
the formula of European rebirth has involved
very much more than freer continental trade
and convertible funds. One of the reasons for
the remarkable rate of growth of some of
these countries is to be found simply in the
fact of the limitless markets for goods in
Europe in the replacement of a living standard sundered by the war. They grew fast because they had so far to grow. Marshall Plan
aid, and the new factories and ultramodern
machines and tools it provided, also played a
vital part. This is past history and I am sure
it is well known to all our people.
However, clearly more important than any
other factor was the determination of these
European nations, some crushed by the war,
others perforce at a standstill for some ten
years, although not directly at war themselves, to achieve rapid economic gains and
relatively much higher living standards. They
were determined to rebuild their countries,
and Europe, from the rubble of war. For some
countries such as West Germany, it meant
starting from nothing in many phases of industry. They have been very successful. What
was the secret of their success? National Planning and close teamwork among business, labour and governments at all levels.
I have a clipping from the Ottawa Journal
of September 29 which I think honourable
senators will find interesting. It says:

world desolated and dislocated by war,
Canada became one of the great sources
of supply. Everything boomed. Yet a day
was bound to come when those very
nations most broken down by the war
would become the most aggressive competitors, when alternative sources of
supply would be found in the world for
most of the things Canada had to offer
and when other parts of the world would
become at least as attractive to international investors.
All through those lush years the coming of a change was rarely spoken of;
little or no preparation was ever made to
meet it when it would come.
We are definitely on the right track in the
formation of a National Economie Development Board, and I await the legislation with
interest.
Honourable senators, it has been often said
that Canada lives by trade. On a per capita
basis we are the largest trading country in
the world. The high standard of living which
we enjoy is surpassed by only one nation in
the world and that nation bas more than ten
times our population. It is, therefore, with
great satisfaction we note that our total
commodity trade for the first six months of
this year was the largest in our history. The
figures at the end of July, the latest month
for which data is available, showed a remarkable 13.6 per cent increase over July
of 1961. Particularly noteworthy is the fact
that sales to the United States are holding at
20 per cent above last year. The great trade
drive and the devaluation of the dollar have
been an outstanding success. The Minister of
Trade and Commerce deserves our applause
in full measure for his good work.
The Speech from the Throne outlines a
definite continuation of the Government's
policy to expand further our "vigorous
campaign of export trade promotion". The
Export Credits Insurance Act has been the
source of foreign sales which could never
have been possible, particularly in creditconscious southern nations, without it. It has
been the sine qua non of aircraft, locomotive
and steel orders and other commodity sales
in the past few years. In the past twelve
months alone the Export Credits Insurance
Corporation has insured upwards of $110
million worth of Canadian goods marketed
in more than ninety foreign countries. Another $100 million in credit insurance is now
pending. In long-term export financing $50
million in heavy capital equipment sales has
been insured and another $75 million has
been committed. This is good business for
Canada. I venture to say that not a dissenting
voice will be raised when we are asked in this

session to double the corporation's insurance
liability and improve long-term financing
arrangements.
In the field of domestic financing, secondary
industry and business generally rejoice that
the Industrial Development Bank Act will be
amended to further enlarge the bank's role
in national development. The liberalization of
the bank's lending policy in recent years has
been in stark contrast to its attitude prior to
1958. It is now one of the most important
sources of industrial credit in Canada, particularly in regions such as the Atlantic
provinces where private money is not as
readily available as elsewhere. The further
expansion of the bank's facilities and lending
resources is extremely welcome.
I do net have time this evening to deal
at length with all of the items contained in
the Speech from the Throne which together
add up to a realistic blueprint for economic
growth and progress. These will be developed
by some of my very able colleagues who will
follow me in this debate. The budget resolutions, which will be reintroduced, speak for
themselves as direct, positive boosters of
manufacturing and processing sales; of further oil and gas exploration, and of encouragement of our logging and iron mining industries. Moreover, what could be more
indicative of the Government's resolve to
promote a climate in which industry will be
encouraged to modernize and to keep up with
world scientific trends than the tax incentives
designed to foster industrial research and its
application to industry? These are the forward-looking policies of Prime Minister John
Diefenbaker that all commend themselves to
the people of Canada.
Of the same character are the moves to
foster an inland merchant marine and to
stabilize railway freight charges. The former,
combined with last session's mammoth subsidies to refurbish our shipbuilding industry,
will be welcome news, not only on the Great
Lakes but in all our shipyards from the
Atlantic to the Pacific-and I might say that
we have some splendid shipyards in both the
east and the west. The latter, the railway
freight problem, bas too long prejudiced and
discouraged the development of certain areas
and producers. The Prime Minister, whom
we Maritimers salute as the best friend we
ever had, obviously is not slackening his
positive program to extend equality of opportunity to all Canadians everywhere.
Of concern to all industries, both primary
and secondary, are the grievous problems that
arise from automation. On the one hand, new
machines require new skills that are short
in supply. On the other hand, nothing is more
tragic than the plight of the worker whose

OCTOBER 9, 1962
employment has disappeared into the mysterious maw of some electronic or other device
which has come to replace him. This is one of
the great problems of the technological agethis age of rapid and revolutionary change.
This certainly is a field in which all levels of
government must co-operate with management and labour to ease the adjustments and
to provide the training and reorientation that
is needed. Again, this is a sphere where the
leadership of the present Prime Minister is
unmistakably evident. It is to be a further
step in the progress of providing more skills
and better training for Canadian workmen
under which vocational and training schools
are mushrooming from coast to coast. The
federal contribution to these schools alone at
present is $267 million. Over 130,000 old and
young Canadians are reaping the benefits.
All Canada rejoices at the bountiful harvest
of the Prairies. No doubt the good senator to
my left (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) will tell us more
about that later. Combined with the outstanding success of the Minister of Agriculture in
finding unparalleled new markets for grain,
it augurs well for a further highly successful
year for agriculture.
I am very pleased to note that the Government, far from being satisfied with the great
increase in farm cash income, proposes even
further stimuli to the agricultural economy.
The encouragement of our livestock industry
by the building of grain-storage facilities in
both east and west will benefit all Canadians.
The farmers of Canada are eagerly awaiting
the legislation which will be forthcoming in
this session from the vast new program of
agricultural rehabilitation and development.
The expanding of credit sources to the farmer
under the provisions of the Farm Credit Corporation will answer the fair and practical
requests of our farming people over a long
period of time.
Again, we are all most pleased to see that
in the field of agriculture, it is proposed to
develop facilities for training that are proving
so successful at the present time in other
spheres of employment. More and more, Canada requires highly skilled people, and this is
as true of the farm as it is of the modern,
automated industrial complex.
Over the years to come Canada must play
an ever-increasing part in providing food for
a hungry world. We can be very proud of
the leadership shown by the Prime Minister
and the Minister of External Affairs, which
has resulted in the adoption by the United
Nations of a world food program. And, as
honourable senators know, the idea originated
with our Prime Minister. As we meet the new
Asiatic and African peoples now on the march,
nothing could be more obvious than that we

can lead them to the paths of our democratic
faith only if they find that our faith is combined with charity.
Honourable senators, there were some criticisms made by my good friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), on behalf of the Opposition, which I
feel I should answer briefly at this time. One
of the criticisms we heard here, and which
we heard much of from the Opposition in the
other place, was that the Prime Minister had
no right to speak for Canada at the Commonwealth conference.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: My friend says "Hear,
hear". Who else could speak for Canada-the
Leader of the Opposition? The Leader of the
Opposition had 100 seats, the Prime Minister
had 116. Should it be the Leader of the Social
Credit party, or the Leader of the New Democratic party? None of these people had the
right, except the Prime Minister, who spoke
as the constitutional authority for Canada.
Constitutionally, the Prime Minister continues as such until be resigns, or until some
other person wins a sufficient number of
seats so that he would have a prior right to
form the Government. No one else had, in
June, or has now, a more likely prospect of
forming a Canadian Government. Surely,
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) was not
serious in his remark, particularly in view
of the recent votes of confidence in the House
of Commons since Parliament met. There is
another vote to be taken tonight, and I have
not the least doubt, honourable senators, the
result will be an endorsation of the Prime
Minister and his Government.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thanks to the Social
Credit party.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It does not make any
difference. The men who are elected by the
people represent the people; and if the majority of the Members in Parliament, no matter
to what party they belong, support the Government, then the majority of the people in
Canada are supporting the Government. There
can be no doubt about it.
Another criticism was that Canada's attitude was not the proper one and did not
represent the views of the people. How can
the Opposition, or anyone else, know whether
or not the Prime Minister represented the
views of the Canadian people? Who was to
say? Every other commonwealth Prime Minister held the same views as did our Prime
Minister. Are all of these commonwealth
statesmen wrong, and is the Leader of the
Opposition the only one who is right? Prime
Minister Macmillan had reassured the whole

SENATE
Commonwealth that a condition precedent to
Britain's joining the European Economic
Community was the safeguarding of the interests of commonwealth nations. That was
generally understood by all commonwealth
Prime Ministers, who would have betrayed
the trust of their peoples had they not pressed
strongly for as wide-open a window as could
be obtained in the Common Market tariff
wall. Why did the prime ministers from the
four corners of the world gather at London,
except to urge Britain to seek the best possible terms for herself and for the Commonwealth in Common Market negotiations? That
was the purpose of their going to the conference and that is what they did. Any other
course would have been ridiculous.
Now as to the view of the people. This
leads me to refer to press clippings. Canada
is a broad country, and there are many newspapers to choose from, but I shall quote from
only a few of them. First, I shall quote from
the Regina Leader-Post of September 13 last:
What the prime ministers stated left
the impression the feeling was shared
that Britain will join providing that the
final terms are fair and reasonable and
that, as Prime Minister Macmillan declared, there are "satisfactory safeguards
for other Commonwealth countries".
Next I shall quote from the St. Catharine's
Standard of September 19:
To suggest-as certain politicians currently on the election warpath have done
-that Prime Minister Diefenbaker, Mr.
Nehru of India and certain other commonwealth leaders have stabbed Britain
in the back by opposing its E.C.M. plans,
is to confuse the facts, or worse. Mr.
Diefenbaker spoke for what he felt were
the best interests of the commonwealth.
And so did the other commonwealth
prime ministers.
Now I quote from the Winnipeg Tribune,
September 17:
The contention by Mr. Pearson and
other Opposition spokesmen that Canada
has lost its influence and prestige at
international conference tables does not
stand up. If Canada had little influence,
no one would be paying much attention
to Mr. Diefenbaker's views in London.
This is certainly not the case.
The Fredericton Daily Gleaner of September 12, said this:
Prime Minister Diefenbaker has made
many a telling speech in his long career
as politician and statesman. He never did
better than yesterday when, as acknowledged leader of the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers meeting in London, he gave his

views-and Canada's-on the issue of
Britain's proposed merger with the European Common Market.
Diefenbaker is the key man at this
conference. What he said will have a
profound effect.
Another matter which the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford)
mentioned was the World Food Bank. I have
already dealt with that. I was pleased to hear
him endorse the Prime Minister's outstanding work towards making more of our surplus
food available to needy nations. He also criticized our economy, in these words:
... we are on the downgrade in regard
to our economy.
And to substantiate this he went on to say:
I think from what I have read it is
clear that the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association has lost confidence in our
Government.
I would now like to quote from Industry,
a magazine which I note is published by the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association. In the
September issue under the heading "Forging
Ahead" it says:
How fares the Canadian economy as
summer gives way to fall in this year of
1962? The answer is that it is faring very
well indeed.
Does that sound as though the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association did not approve
of the Government's stand? It goes on to say:
Industrial production in the first six
months of this year was up more than
nine per cent on the same period of 1961.
Likewise manufacturers' shipments. Retail sales were higher by more than five
per cent.
Output of passenger cars and passenger
trucks climbed by more than 30 per cent
in the first half of the year, sales by
more than 20 per cent.
The buoyancy of the economy in general and of manufacturing industry in
particular was the reason why there were
a record number of Canadians at work
at the end of July-180,000 more than
a year earlier-and why nearly 50,000
fewer were without employment. Significantly, of those who were looking for a
job--4.5 per cent of the total labour
force-only one in three had been unemployed for more than three months.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
spoke of the unemployment picture. I have
just mentioned how it has changed. At page
34 of Hansard, he commented that the unemployment problem "was laughed off". I am

OCTOBER 9, 1962
sure he could not have been serious in this
remark, for as a very able man he knows
that this is not so.
Never in the history of Canada has there
ever been a more constant drive to create
employment than we have seen in recent
years: the massive winter works program,
the most ambitious housing construction program in our history, money pumped into the
economy through the Industrial Development
Bank, small business loans, and so on. A
crash program for vocational training that
we should have had 20 years ago was undertaken, grants to the provinces were doubled,
large subsidies were provided to shipbuilding,
special help was given to municipalities, to
the Atlantic provinces and the west. It would
take a long time, honourable senators, just to
list the measures taken to prime the economy.
Look at the present picture in employment.
Since the first quarter of 1961 employment
has been rising steadily. Total employment in
1961 averaged 94,000 higher than in 1960.
But in the first eight months of 1962 employment was 197,000 higher on the average than
in the corresponding period of 1961.
During the summer months a record of
268,000 young people entered the labour
market. But in spite of this, total unemployment in August was estimated at 280,000,
some 43,000 lower than a year earlier. In my
opinion these figures speak for themselves.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) supported
our drive to increase our exports. However, I
have wondered if he misunderstood the situation when he stated that "manufactured
articles of any kind come thirteenth among
our exports".
Honourable senators will recall that the
honourable Leader of the Opposition made
the same mistake last January in his address
on the Throne Speech. At that time he
proffered a list of our principal exports in
1960. If he will examine the list closely he
will note that many of the top items are manufactured products. The honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) may not
agree with this. I mentioned pulp and paper
the other day. The biggest item of all, newsprint paper, is, in my opinion, fully manufactured. It is a manufactured article. It has
been Canada's greatest export for a number
of years. I think it amounted to over threequarters of a billion dollars last year and it
is running very close to a billion now.
Lumber is surely a semi-manufactured
product. We do not take lumber and build
houses and factories in Canada and ship them
to other parts of the world. We ship our
product, lumber, which is a manufactured
product. Wood pulp requires only one more

process to become paper. Aluminum is manufactured from bauxite which is imported to
Canada from the West Indies and other parts
of the world. Surely it cannot be called a
non-manufactured article. The reference to
semi-fabricated products such as aluminum,
nickel and copper could be misleading. These
items are exported in a form far from the
ingot stage. In most cases only one step more
is required before they reach the hands of
the final consumer.
All these articles which I have mentioned
supersede farm implements and farm machinery in the list which was produced by
the Leader of the Opposition.
Of course 1961 was a year of further important strides in final manufacturing in
Canada. For example, motor vehicle production rose by 29.8 per cent. This is a trend
that we are all pleased to note and is a
result of continuing efforts by the Prime
Minister and the Government in this regard.
I agree entirely with the Leader of the
Opposition, that we must increase our manufacturing along all lines, and Canada is particularly suited to certain manufactures. We
are suited particularly, of course, to the manufacture of pulp and paper, to the processing
of our minerals, lumber and other products.
This we are doing, while we maintain them
at a high standard. As I say, I agree entirely
with the Leader of the Opposition: let us try
to develop these other industries. I contend
that the Government is doing this in every
way possible, and it has a very good blueprint in the Speech from the Throne for continuing to do so.
The Leader of the Opposition devoted a
large portion of his remarks to the position
of the Senate when the House of Commons
is led by a minority Government. "The
mandate of the Senate", he called it.
I quote fromt his remarks in the Debates
of the Senate, at page 39:
We must, as a responsible second chamber, take the general attitude that no
piece of government legislation which
might come before us in the current
session could be said to have behind it
a clear popular mandate. Therefore, it
will be necessary for us in each case,
to give all legislation ever more searching investigation than has been our
custom following a conclusive popular
verdict.
This is an argument for which the Leader
of the Opposition will find little support either
in this chamber or in the nation. He will no
doubt appreciate that it makes no difference
by whom a bill is Introduced in the other
place. If it receives a majority vote there it
then comes to us as a measure endorsed by
the elected representatives of the people of

SENATE
Canada. The fact that it was sponsored by a
minority government gives no cause to consider it any differently than we would a
measure introduced by the strongest of governments.
The Leader of the Opposition calls the
Right Honourable Arthur Meighen as his
witness in support of this new constitutional
principle he proposes. He quotes a speech of
Mr. Meighen's which I find was delivered in
1937 by that eminent gentleman to the Canadian Club in Montreal. I might say from the
paragraph he mentioned I can find nothing
to support his argument.
If he will read further from that addressI have seen it, and an eloquent address it
was-he will find that Arthur Meighen made
the following convincing argument:
The great mass of legislation has, however, no relation to any special dictum
of the people in an electoral contest at
all. The great mass of legislation springs
from circumstances of the hour. Something has to be done, in the judgment of
the administration, and the administration works out its solution in such a
manner as it deems fit, and submits that
solution to Parliament. There is no question of a mandate at all in the case of
at least 98 per cent of the measures which
come to either house.
Note, "98 per cent"--practically all.
If it is a subject naturally within the
purview of Government, something to do
with administration; if it is a reflection in
a bill of what the Government should be
and feels itself best suited to handle, and
if it does not affect positive principle
going to the root of our institution, then
I would say that even though it was
thought a better way might be devised,
even though it was thought that on a
balance of merits the bill failed, it would
be wiser for the Senate, if it can, after
making such remedial amendments as
will improve the measure, to allow the
Government to have its way.
That is the witness the honourable Leader
of the Opposition mentioned the other day
in support of his argument.
I would also like to refer him to a recent
editorial in the Ottawa Citizen. Similar
editorials have appeared in the press across
the country, but I quote from the Citizen:
Senator Macdonald argues that the
Government bas no clear mandate from
the people, having been rejected by a
majority of the electorate. This is a weak
argument.

I have known the Ottawa Citizen for 25 years,
and it has never been a strong supporter of the
Conservative party. The editorial continues:
And the Senate has no mandate at all.
Whatever the original intention in establishing the second chamber, whatever the
views of the first Prime Minister, Sir
John A. Macdonald, that the Senate had
the duty of taking a sober second look
at government legislation, for all practical
purposes the Senate is not a legislative
body.
The argument that the Government has
no clear mandate holds little force. As
Senator Macdonald is no doubt aware,
under the parliamentary system a Government does not draw its authority from
the people, but from Parliament. As long
as the House of Commons supports a
government it has a mandate.
The Senate should, as Sir John A. Macdonald suggested, take a "sober second look"
at all legislation. That is good advice, no
matter what legislation it is. However, I hope
that in the other place they will take a sober
first look at all legislation and not agree to
defeat it out of hand. If that is done fairly I
think we shall all find that the program as
set out in the Speech from the Throne contains the answer to the many problems we
have at present.
The election campaign is over. The people
of Canada, I am sure, expect us to realize
that and get down to the work of the nation.
That is what the Members of Parliament are
here for at the present time. It is not by
calling for motions of want of confidence that
the affairs of this country are going to be
attended to. If an election must come, let it
come in due time. Until then, let us do the
nation's business that we were sent here to
attend to.
In conclusion, honourable senators, we are
launched upon a decade of change, challenge
and conflict. Every nation in the world, including our own, is faced with difficult adjustments. The prime responsibility of parliaments everywhere is to make citizens
aware of the necessity of adapting to rapidlychanging situations, to provide the leadership
that boldly faces the international facts of
life and accommodates as circumstances require. Flexibility is a vital ingredient of
stability. Realistic perspective, open-minded
appraisal of the untried, bold acceptance of
legitimate risk, readiness to seek out reasonable compromises between yesterday and
tomorrow-these are the touchstones of the
years ahead. I am sure that young, robust
Canada will not falter or hesitate to pick up
this gauntlet. Our nation is healthy, strong,
vital. At its back lie resources of mine, forest,

OCTOBER 9, 1962
sea and farm which are the envy of the world.
Our economy is on the upsurge. The future
bas no limits to its bounty.
We have problems-we always will. Every
nation bas problems. Look at those of some
of the European countries today. We face our
problems with the confidence and energy that
has been of our spirit from the days of
Champlain and Mackenzie, from the days of
Macdonald, Cartier and Laurier. We have
always been ready to struggle for the world's
prizes, as a nation and as a people.
This Speech from the Throne calls us to
the tasks. We need the wages of increased
production, the earnings of export sales. We
need an even stronger economy to provide
ever more employment. We need a balanced
budget, an unceasing attack on our longstanding imbalance of international payments.
We need a universal contributory pension
scheme, portable pensions, and a generally
constantly improving structure of national
welfare and social security. If we address
ourselves to the first tasks with teamwork
and co-operation, the latter will follow in
fullest measure. I support wholeheartedly
the proposals as made in this Speech from
the Throne, and I know if these proposais are
passed into legislation by this Parliament of
Canada they will go a long way toward solving the many problems with which we are
faced.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Lambert,
debate adjourned.

DOCUMENTS TABLED

OCTOBER 10, 1962
Britain, known as Quakers, made the necessary arrangement with the Canadian Government for their settlement in Canada.
Throughout the books reference is made to
the Doukhobors as Russian Quakers. Their
belief has centred on a direct revelation and
guidance which denied the need for a church
organization and, by an extension, included
a denial of government authority or the right
of anyone to use force in human affairs.
They live in communal existence and do
not undertake military service. That was a
condition of their entry into this country.
I think the house will find it interesting to
know that 124 Freedomites served as volunteers during World War Il. The vast majority
of Doukhobors have adapted themselves
to Canada and its way of life. Originally
they settled in what is now the province of
Saskatchewan. You will recall that I said
they came here at the turn of the century.
Saskatchewan became a province in 1905,
and when in that year the provincial government was organized and had some time
to look around they decided to open schools
in these settlements. The extremist minority
then moved on to British Columbia in 1908.
Now, the extremist minority, the Freedomites, have at times refused to pay taxes,
to send their children to school or register
births, marriages or deaths. We have to face
facts-they have been troublesome. Moreover,
as a form of passive resistance they sometimes parade in the nude, and when hard
pressed by the authorities they dynamite
schools and bridges and burn their own
homes. They appear to have about 2,000
adherents of whom 200 or 300 are the unrepentant fanatical minority.
I repeat that the vast majority of Doukhobors have adapted themselves and have
entered into and contributed to the Canadian
stream of life.
In 1958 the Freedomites sought to leave
Canada, and the authorities agreed to help
them, but negotiations for their emigration
broke down. It would appear that Russia
refused to exempt them from military service.
Some negotiations were also carried on with
Brazil, but they seem to have been unproductive.
I said earlier that they are sometimes
referred to as Russian Quakers. Originally
they came here as pacifists, but about forty
years ago they abandoned the original tradition of pacifism and resorted to violenceburning and dynamiting-which was originally directed against the orthodox backsliding Doukhobors but later extended to the
whole community. The authorities have tried
many expedients: prosecution, imprisonment,
exiling to an island, and separating Freedomite children from their parents. A royal

commission investigated the problem in 1912,
and a fruitless attempt was made at conciliation.
In 1952 the province of British Columbia
established a Doukhobor Research Committee, which made a painstaking and
understanding report. Nothing seems to have
come of that. Now, ten years after that report
was made, we are back where we started,
and we must report failure. As recently as
last week, the Attorney-General of British
Columbia made this statement:
The problem is beyond solving by the
provincial government.
The Freedomites are religious fanatics, and
to date have been unmoved by punishment
and pressures; moreover, they are successful
in transmitting their fanaticism to their
children.
From time to time remedies have been
suggested, such as compulsory relocation as
a group in an isolated community or being
scattered across the country, but Canadians
find such solutions repugnant and unacceptable. These people cannot be deported, they
were born here; there is no place for them to
go.
In 1959 there was a ray of hope: the women
took over control of the Freedomites, and
there seemed to be some reason to believe
there was a chance of possible integration
into the community. Then Stefan Sorokin
came from Uruguay to Canada, where he
resided for some time. He is the recognized
head of the Freedomites. After he left
Canada in 1960 the burning and bombings
began again.
Prosecution does not seem effective. In
1932 a special prison was built on Pearse Island near Vancouver, where 600 men were
confined for illegal acts. In the middle forties
there was a further breakout, and 400 were
confined. We recently built a prison at Agassiz, British Columbia, where nearly one
hundred are now confined. But we are back
where we started, building prisons. Certainly
that is not a solution. To jail them is an easy
way out, but solves nothing. As we look at
the Freedomite problem we might very well
also take a look at ourselves and realize that
we have been lax; there has been an inertia
on the part of the Canadian people, a standing-by when we should have been doing
something. There has been indifference where
there should have been concern; there has
been apathy where there should have been
indignation. Yet I must make it quite clear
that this country will not tolerate violence.
Ours is a nation of law. For anyone to defy
the law and the constituted judicial process
is to strike a blow at the very foundation of
our country. In time, people who do so will
break themselves against the law.

SENATE
We must ask ourselves the question: how
do we bring these Freedomites into the Canadian stream or, perhaps, draw them back into
the peaceful fold of their fellow Doukhobors?
I think we must first convince them that we
want to help them, not destroy them. We
need their full co-operation. The Doukhobors
must be treated as human beings. Up to the
present we have failed to persuade them to
abandon their practices which we find objectionable. Brutality will not so persuade
them. Yet we need a solution that is acceptable in a democratic society. It may be difficult to find a reasonable solution, but surely
we cannot accept what we have done to date.
These people are Canadians like the rest of
us. We are stuck with them. Perhaps an
earlier attempt might have been successful
in integrating them into the community, yet
after sixty years the problem is still on our
doorstep. Ideologically, they are not a violent
group; rather, they are followers of Tolstoy
and are pacifists. They look on the world as a
violent place and want their children to have
no part of its violence.
I repeat, we cannot resettle these people;
we cannot deport them; we cannot take community action against them without subscribing to the principles of group guilt. We have
too much to lose to even give consideration
to anything so foreign to our nature and our
system of government.
In the light of what I have indicated, the
Attorney General for the Province of British
Columbia has said that we must try to find
a solution. It is true that the problem belonged
to another age, but it is left over for us to
try to solve. We just cannot pass it on. It
is one of our unresolved problems. It is a
challenge we can no longer ignore. This reminds me of the plaque which used to hang in
President Truman's office, which said: "The
buck stops here". A decision had to be made
there. It could not be passed on to anybody
else. I ask: to whom can the Freedomites
turn?
We have here a minority, an unpopular
minority, with views that appear alien to
ours. But that is no reason for turning our
backs on them. We cannot just throw up our
hands. We have tried social, economic and
remedial pressures, and they have not been
enough. Still there is no reason for us to
give up. They claim they are being discriminated against because of their religious views.
Is that true? Should we not try to find out?
We live in a very much mixed-up world.
To the south of us a great nation is straining all of its forces to bring about the
integration of a minority, and more particularly educational integration. Here we have
the Freedomites who resist educational integration.

I wonder whether the Freedomites constitute our only problem that needs understanding. I read a report this morning in
the Toronto Globe and Mail of an episode
that took place last Saturday at Varsity
Stadium during the football game between
Varsity and Queens. I might say that Queens
students had no part in this-the students
from that university are blameless. It appears that the Varsity students gave a negro
police officer of the city of Toronto a bad
time. The officer in question was a negro
policewoman who was there with other police
officers for the purpose of keeping order. The
students kept chanting anti-negro slogans,
and cheering for the racist governor of Mississippi. It is amazing how a few drinks rub
off the veneer of tolerance, and expose some
people for what they are. These are people
who display neither learning nor understanding, and this is the type of action that reflects on our homes, on our universities and
on all of us. If that is a sample of the
take-over generation of tomorrow then perhaps we have many more problems than that
of the Freedomites in this country.
The Freedomites appear to have a problem.
Should we help solve it? We may yet, by
exerting our efforts and bringing our wisdom
to the table, bring these people back into
the twentieth century.
Honourable senators, I am advocating their
cause in this chamber because they appear
to require some guidance, counsel, assistance
and friendship. They are Canadians like the
rest of us. We in this Senate have a special
duty with respect to minorities. It is all very
well to speak about taking a second sober
look at legislation, but there is something
else that the Senate was specially empowered
to look at and that is minority rights. It must
be remembered that the dominion Government brought these people to Canada under
special circumstances. There is no complaint
about that. We needed immigrants at the
time, and there was also a great humanitarian appeal made by well-meaning people
throughout the world. No one could have
foreseen what would happen.
We have built prisons for these people.
We have had the R.C.M.P. police the areas
in which they reside. The Attorney General
for the Province of British Columbia now
says that he is unable to deal with the situation. Does it not fall upon our shoulders?
Is it not our responsibility?
In this country we have had much experience with minorities. In the last ten years
we have suddenly awakened to the needs of
the Eskimos. We have shown a sincere concern and a human understanding for them,
and we have taken some constructive action
although much more is needed. We have done

OCTOBER 10, 1962
some things for the Indians. We have improved their standard of living, and opened
the doors of opportunity for their integration.
In 1951 we were educating 26,000 Indian
children, and by 1961 the number had risen
to 43,000. That is making progress. We are
attempting to do something for these people
in order to bring them into the Canaclian
stream.
We have integrated immigrants-they have
been a great boon to us, and in my opinion
we can neyer have too many-by "Unity
through Diversity". To ail of our people we
can truthfully say, as we can say to the
Freedomites, we have no cultural imperialism
to impose upon them. We welcome contributions from ail people.
The Freedomites find few people to speak
up for them. In ail my years I recail very
few articles in the press or in magazines that
were in the least way sympathetic to them.
No group can be that bad. The views of these
people cannot be ail bad, nor our views ail
good. It is time for us to find out what makes
them do what they do. Why wili they flot; fit
into the Canadian mosaie?
Pictures of the Freedomite trek have been
sent around the worid. They have issued a
pamphlet which no doubt has currency,
and which needs some reply. It reads as
follows:
We are going where oui destiny lies,
with oui fathers, husbands, brothers and
sons at Buchenwald.
That is the terni they use. They then go
on to say:
Now we, the mothers, wives, children,
the aged are going there to complete the
transplanting. Why we the eidren follow in Uine with our fathers and mothers?
Because we fear we will be taken again
from our parents and will undergo again
the same experience, cold hunger and
separation as we have went through in
the New Denver Dormitory.
The statement continues:
You consider us third-class citizens, not
worthy of having homes or land, of having
a family and our own way of lives, of
having children and bringing them up
satisfactorily according to our religious
convictions. You wish to solve our problem with the complete liquidation of our
group. If that is your true desire, good.
Do with us as you wish. Do with our
bodies as you think necessary-_soap, fertilizer, handbags, lampshades and bind
your books with our hides.
One would think we were taiking about Russia or Nazi Germany. Instead of that, these

peopie are talking about Canada in that extravagant language. When that statement receives a certain amount of publicity, it will
have the effect of blackening our good name.
It is valuable propaganda for our enemies and
may weil be misunderstood in the newiydeveIoping countries. If we do nothing, things
may get much worse. This we should not permit.
I have already said that what I have read
in the papers over the years has flot made
pleasant reading, nor has it been such, I suspect, as to instil in Canadians generally any
sense of self-satisfaction or weil-being. If most
Canadians are lîke myseif, they are, to say
the least, uncomfortable about the situation.
The problem certainiy has federal and provincial, as well as national and international,
implications. So long as there is overt resistance to civil authority, attended by continuing
outbreaks of burnîng, dynamiting and exhibitions of nudity, the attention of the country,
and indeed of the international community,
must be drawn to the fact that our national
house is flot in order or that, at any rate, it
houses some pretty unruiy tenants.
Although the problem appears to be centered for the time being in British Columbia,
and particularly in the Kootenay district, its
manifestations have been felt across Canada.
In no sense can the problem be dismissed
from the minds of the rest of us onl the basis
that it is exclusively the problem of British
Columbia. Indeed, at least in my view, the
problem has been one for ail of Canada from
the day on which the immigration authorities
here in Ottawa granted the Doukhobors entry
into Canada-the promised land!
There has been, it is true, some investigations of the Doukhobor problem at the provincial level: consultative committees, for instance, have been set up from time to time
by the Government of the Province of British
Columbia, which in the recent past has been
the area, most directly affected. I have indicated that there was one such committee in
1952. However, so far as I am aware, the problem of the Doukhobors which, as I have said,
touches and concerns the federal authorities
as well as more than one provincial authority,
has not been investigated by any independent,
quasi-judicial tribunal which. is national in
character, since the royal commission of 1912,
and that was fifty years ago.
Accordingly, if my motion carrnes, the Senate itself will establish a special committee
to investigate and report upon the Doukhobor
problem in Canada.
Honourable senators, in the motion I have
put before you I have deiiberately focussed
attention on the Sons of Freedom, the most
radical sect among the Doukhobors, but I
have not liniited the investigation to the Sons

SENATE
of Freedom. On the contrary, the investigation
extends to "any problem related thereto". I
suggest that it would not be possible or practical to restrict the investigation. The country
is entitled to a study of the problem in its
entirety and within its complete context. We
know, for example, that there has been a
considerable degree of assimilation in so far
as the majority of Doukhobors are concerned.
We should have the fullest information about
this assimilation, particularly with respect
ta the factors which have aided or fostered
the events which have enabled thousands of
Doukhobors to live at peace both with their
neighbours and with constituted authority.
Perhaps there are lessons to be learned, and
perhaps not. We should know whether there
are or are not.
Through an historical approach we could
discover whether the overall problem may
be expected ultimately to resolve itself or,
at any rate, what sort of approach would be
most calculated to expedite such a resolution. We have to ask ourselves quite honestly
and firmly: have we approached the problem
with intelligence and understanding? Have
we dealt harshly or unfairly with the Doukhobors? Have we been treating symptoms or
have we searched, as good diagnosticians
should, for the root cause of the ailment, if
such it be? Or, in a lawyer's phrase, have
we sought out the mischief before applying
the remedy?
The committee would, I should think, have
to seek out the philosophical, spiritual and
religious bases for the continued refusal of
the more radical Doukhobors to obey the law
or, as they might put it, to "accede to the
demands of the secular authority". There
might have to be a massive reappraisal of
what is really meant by "freedom of religion"
or "freedom of worship".
In making this motion, I would hope that
its adoption would be welcomed by all those
immediately concerned: by the federal and
provincial authorities who are faced with
the problem from day to day, by the thousands of Doukhobors who have found safe
and happy havens in Canada, and by those
who have not.
The investigation would indeed be abortive
if it were regarded by the Sons of Freedom
themselves as just another attempt by constituted authority to beat them down. The
object should be, and I am sure it would be,
ta acquire a real understanding of their
problems with a view to helping them to find
a solution.
Honourable senators, it has been well said
that the deeper the cut the longer it takes
to heal. The problems with which the committee must deal go back a long way in

Canadian history, and beyond that into the
Caucasus, and beyond that again into the
Crimea, back to Peter Veregin, the Elder, and
to Tolstoy himself.
It is interesting to note that the novel
Resurrection was written by Tolstoy in defence of the Doukhobors. He assigned part
of the royalties to the Doukhobors, and some
of that money was used to bring them to
this country. There cannot be any glib or
sudden panacea or cure-all for something so
deep-rooted, nor should the Senate committee
be expected to provide one. If it is necessary
for the committee to continue its work beyond
the present session, so be it.
It may be that some honourable senators
will feel that we should have a joint committee with the other place. I would welcome
that. Perhaps some arrangements could be
made to have provincial representatives, as
well as Freedomites and orthodox Doukhobors, as observers and consultants. I welcome your views on this very perplexing
problem. I hope this resolution will be
thoroughly debated and, in the end, accepted.
In the face of all that has happened in the
past sixty years, we are in honour bound to
try our hand at finding a solution. The
problem involves directly only a small portion of the Canadian people, but we are all
involved because the question of liberty is
at stake.
The district of Kent passed an emergency
bylaw that prevents the Freedomites from
entering their area, and the police have put
up a roadblock. I for one do not intend to
put any roadblocks in their way. I am not
going to say any more about that, although
I had some harsh things to say about the
bylaw. The matter is now before the courts,
and I think it would be improper for me to
make any further comment.
Honourable senators, I think the Senate is
well suited to conduct such an inquiry as is
proposed. I say this despite my brief experience in the Senate but knowing something of its long history. There could be no
question of the independence or fairmindedness of such a committee. It would have no
axe to grind. It would not be a committee of
the Government seeking ways and means of
thwarting the legitimate aspirations of a
group of Canadian citizens.
The Senate has a distinguished history in
the field of human rights and fundamental
freedoms. Here I bow to the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
who was responsible for conducting investigations in other years before we had our Bill of
Rights. If this motion passes, the Senate will
have a further opportunity to add distinction
to its long record in this regard.

OCTOBER 10, 1962
I ask honourable members not only to discuss this problem in the interests of Canada,
but also, in the end, to support the motion,
so that we can contribute something constructive to this most perplexing problem.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape
Breton), debate adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, already the lively sound of words from
another corridor of this building is beginning
to resound in our midst, and before its echoes
completely envelop this chamber, I am desirous of taking early advantage of the debate
on the address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne to share at least in some of the
amenities which were so adequately and appropriately expressed in the early days of the
session last week.
I should like, Sir, to address you with
great respect and with warm felicitations
and best wishes on occupying the Chair as
Speaker of the Senate. It is an appointment
of which I am sure we all approve, coming
as it does to one who has given such full
measure of service to this country, both
within and outside the halls of Parliament.
To my friend the new Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) I also proffer
my sincerest congratulations, for he too has
contributed a full measure of service.
To the mover (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier, MadawaskaRestigouche) of the motion for an address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, I should
also like to tender congratulations for their
graceful and appropriate maiden efforts in
this chamber.
Regarding the other recently-appointed
members of the Senate, I should like particularly to refer to those whose designations
are connected with my own province of
Ontario and with this capital city of Ottawa.
As they were presented to us in this chamber
on the first day of the session I was reminded
of another occasion, in 1956, when the circumstances of seating were much different
from what they are today. The late Senator
John Hackett, who was appointed at that
time, took the opportunity while the Speech

from the Throne was being debated to acknowledge the honour that had been conferred upon him in moving the address.
During the course of his remarks he said:
It is not often that the flowers of
sentiment are found to bud and bloorn
in the thorny paths of politics.
It occurred to me that possibly these words
applied to the experience of more than one
member of this chamber in connection with
his appointment. Possibly, too, they apply
to associations which have long antedated
and enveloped the political scene in which
later the role of an actor had become a
reality.
This I can say with all truth has been my
own experience in connection with at least
two of the members whom I have referred
to as coming from the province of Ontario.
One of these originally came from the farflung shores of Quebec but has spent the last
fifty years in the chosen profession which
I had the privilege of sharing at one time,
that of journalism. His distinguished position
in that respect has been characterized, as one
might describe it, the status of a double
first-proficiency and appeal in both written
and spoken word; and I think he has added
to and extended widely the interest of this
nation in the public affairs of the country in
which he has been an active participant for
that length of time.
My associations with another old friend,
the distinguished senator from Gormley (Hon.
Mr. McCutcheon) have not been so intimate,
but because of his earlier background his
career has been a source of real interest and
pride to me. I refer with pleasure to the
fact that his forebear was a distinguished
teacher in the high school in the area where
I was brought up in western Ontario. Not
only was he a good teacher of mathematics,
but he also had a most salutary and wholesome influence upon the teenagers of my
generation who sat under him. For that reason
T feel the new senator comes here, not as a
great financial pundit from Bay street so
much as one whose record already has shown
an authentic desire and impulse to be of
some public use to this country. His achievements in that connection are well known to
those who have had any awareness of his
activities during the past twenty years, and
I fully expect that whatever may be in store
for him as the head of a Department of
Government he will, because of his practical
wisdom and experience, give this country
valuable service.
To those other new senators from my own
province of Ontario, I extend my warmest
good wishes and compliments on their appointments to this chamber.

SENATE

To round out these introductory remarks,
for full measure I should like to draw attention to the fact that this session marks the
beginning of the twenty-fifth year of membership in this Senate for two of my colleagues
on this side of the house. I refer to the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) and to my friend, who is absent
today, the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). Both these gentlemen were presented here and entered this
chamber in 1937. Their contributions to the
Senate debates and the work of our committees, both in form and in substance, have been
a credit to Parliament and comparable, I
submit, to those recorded in any other democratic assembly where good language is
spoken.
The Throne Speech, which is now before
us, is a rather remarkable assortment of
some fifty closed packages in paragraph form.
I will not attempt to review them all at this
time. Whatever legislation may emerge from
them, we shall have the opportunity to examine in due course.
At this time, however, I would like briefly
to say a few words about two features of
the speech. First, there is a reference to a
prospective bill concerning the Senate. That
bill has now come to us in advance of its
presentation in the other place and is on
our files. Its content is the same as that prepared for consideration last session but which
the Government decided to withdraw before
Parliament was dissolved.
During the election campaign the issue of
Senate reform did not seem to receive much
attention from any of the leaders or competing candidates. Certainly, it cannot be said
that the Government which has assumed
office bas any mandate on this question from
the Canadian electorate. Apart from the irregular constitutional procedure which some
people feel quite seriously attaches to this
proposed legislation, I maintain that instead
of a measure of Senate reform being presented
to Parliament this session, there should be
one dealing with parliamentary representation in the House of Commons.
The principle of representation by population, which is supposed to underlie our
system of government, is being flagrantly ignored in many of the growing electoral
districts of this country. This condition is not
new. It has been emphasized periodically over
the years in connection with the redistribution
and adjustment of the electorate in new
areas. Many examples of this condition can be
cited. The one outstanding case which occurs to me is that of the young member of
Parliament for York-Scarborough. This constituency has a population of some 200,000
people and happens to be the most extensive

and most populated constituency in Canada.
One might compare it, for example, with other
areas less extensive and smaller in population, where representation both in the
Senate and the House of Commons is out of
all proportion to the number of electors
involved. I mention this, without invidious
implication of any kind, to emphasize the distorted basis of representation which exists
today in the elective branch of Parliament.
Before I proceed to deal with the Senate in
this connection, I should like to draw attention to a point which has already been
referred to by my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) in his
report of the Divorce Committee. I refer to
the humiliating spectacle which we all witnessed at the end of the last session when
some 325 divorce bills, which had passed
logically and normally through the machinery
of the Senate Divorce Committee, were held
up in the other place in the last three days
in defiance of pleas of the Prime Minister of
Canada to have them passed.
If a reform of some kind in the procedure
of the House of Commons is necessary to
obviate that sort of thing, then I suggest
very strongly that attention be concentrated
in that quarter rather than in idle suggestions of reform concerning things that do not
matter in this house.
In so far as the Senate is concerned, I
submit, an adequate measure of reform should
not be pointedly confined to the provision for
an age limit. Methods of appointment and term
of office-renewal of which might be based,
as it is in Eire for example, upon attendance
and performance in connection with its workshould come within the scope of any reform
measure.
Some enlightening discussion of this subject may be found in Senate Hansard of April
and June 1950, and February 1951. A resolution dealing with proposed reform of the
Senate, introduced early in the session of
1951, was keenly debated here. The opinion
of the Senate expressed at that time did
not approve of the resolution in question,
but held that this subject, which involved
amendment to the B.N.A. Act, should be of
equal concern ta the federal Parliament as
a whole and the governments and legislatures
of the provinces, and that only with the joint
approval of those bodies should any change
be made.
Summarizing this reference ta parliamentary reform, I believe that legislation affecting
the machinery of Parliament, as it applies to
both houses, is overdue. The House of Commons has become a distortion of the principle
of representation by population; and the
original purpose of this upper chamber, to
safeguard provincial rights and the interests

OCTOBER 10, 1962
of minorities, without which Confederation
in 1867 would have been impossible, should
now be amplified and more clearly defined in
the light of experience in the past years and
the needs of the present.
One needs to say little more on this subject at this time, but the importance of doing
all that is possible here to encourage an increasingly active interest and participation
of the Canadian electorate in the operations
of Parliament cannot be stressed too strongly.
In this connection may I quote from a
speech by the late Senator Meighen while he
was the Leader of the Government in this
chamber. These are his words, as embodied
in the Senate records:
Some time ago a prominent and popular Canadian remarked to me: "I am
thankful in these days for the Senate! No
matter what wild and extreme radicalism may sweep the country, the Senate
will stand firm; it will save the ship".
He then continued:
The forces of wild and extreme radicalism must be met right out among the
ranks of our people, in their houses and
meeting places-there the power of reason
and common sense must be applied, the
lesson of long experience must be taught,
or nothing will save the ship. Surely we
have learned from tragedies in other lands
that the tide of a mad, militant and persistent majority never can be stemmed.
It must not become a majority. What the
Senate can do is to devote its energy
within its own sphere to making laws
practical and sensible, to give the best
possible chance to workers and especially
to the humblest workers to encourage the
upward climber and to attach a wholesome penalty to voluntary idleness, to
remember always that there is nothing so
vital to the common weal as security to
life and property, and to offer no countenance to dishonesty and confiscation.
The second selection from the gracious
speech that I had intended to deal with at
some length has to do with references to the
European Common Market and commonwealth
trade. However, I have decided to defer much
of what might be said on this subject until a
definite conclusion is reached to all the discussions that are now going on abroad. Unless
the dark clouds that now hover over Berlin
can be dissipated and the danger of another
war averted, all the official talk and argument about the European Common Market
and a new federation of western Europe
could be wiped out for an indefinite period,
and possibly forever. If that dire development does not intervene, a complete rearrangement of western Europe, including

Great Britain, as envisaged in the Treaty of
Rome adopted some seven years ago, would
seem to be assured.
There are two important aspects to this
Common Market movement: one relates vitally
to the trade of the world; and the other,
which has been sponsored mainly by Mr.
Spaak of Belgium and Mr. van Zeeland of
Holland, has been for a federation of Europe
to secure protection for those countries from
the intervention and approach of Russia from
the east. I think the outcome of these discussions that are now taking place in Brussels will be of vital importance to us all. Their
outcome will affect the economy, not only of
this country and the United States but of
every other part of the world as well. The
economic effects of such a possibility have
only lately seemed to loom up as a threat to
Canada and the United States. But it is
interesting to note that in 1959, in this chamber, the far-reaching competitive aspect of
this development in Europe was discussed in
connection with a resolution introduced by
our honourable colleague, the senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson). I regret that
ill health prevents his being here now, so
that he might have the satisfaction of seeing
that the notice he gave then has materialized
into real concern on the part of the governments of Canada and the United States. I am
not aware that much of what was publicly
stated in this chamber at that time was seriously heeded either in the other house or
outside by the Canadian community as a
whole. The reports of Hansardin March, 1959,
however, do show that members of this body
did explore the subject then.
For the time being I feel that one is justified in awaiting rather than anticipating the
contents of this modern Pandora's box which
has been presented to us in the form of the
Speech from the Throne.
Hon. M. Wallace McCutcheon: Honourable
senators, first may I follow the gracious custom which has been followed by my predecessors in speaking on this address, and
extend to you, Mr. Speaker, my sincere congratulations on your appointment to the high
office which you now hold. I would also extend my congratulations to my leader, the
honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr.
Brooks). Anyone who heard his address last
night on the Throne Speech debate would
have no doubts that he will uphold the traditions of the Leader of the Government in
this chamber.
I would also like to extend my congratulations to the mover and seconder of the address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne and
to compliment them, particularly on their
facility in both languages, a facility which,
unfortunately, I do not possess.

SENATE
I cannot proceed without extending my sincere thanks to my old friend, the senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), for the more
than kindly remarks that he made this afternoon concerning myself and my father. Having said that, I would like to thank all honourable senators on both sides of this chamber
who have been most kind in welcoming me
into this chamber.
I was sorry that I was unable to be here
during the entire address of the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford).
If he were here I would personally apologize
to him. I have read his address with interest.
I also want to thank him for the references
that he made therein to me. I would not want
to feel, however, that the Leader of the Opposition, or any honourable senator opposite,
was going to suffer from any confusion or
worry by having to decide as to whom he
should address questions of the Government
in this house. Such questions will, of course,
be addressed to the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks).
In his opening remarks the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford),
and I assume he spoke for all honourable
senators in opposition, quoted Senator Dandurand:
We stand above the sharp divisions of
party that exist in the other chamber.
He might also have quoted from another
address that Senator Dandurand made in this
chamber. On March 8, 1934, in answer to a
question from a colleague in the cabinet as to
why the Senate was not busy, and upon the
colleague having said, "Why, we have already
sent you half a dozen bills," Senator Dandurand replied:
Yes, but whereas in discussing those
bills in the House of Commons you for
the most part address yourselves to the
electors, we address ourselves to the
question, and it is a much shorter procedure.
Now I must confess that in the speech of
the Leader of the Opposition, and I think in
the speech of the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), there was some
tendency, contrary to Senator Dandurand's
admonition, to direct remarks to the electorate rather than to the question.
This afternoon I propose to deal with some
of the matters that have been raised, and
which I can only assume represent the considered views of the Opposition in this house.
I do not intend to deal with the matters raised
in the Speech from the Throne, except incidentally. The Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks), when he had finished
speaking last evening, left almost no ground

uncovered. I would interject, however, that
the Speech from the Throne, in addition to
referring to legislation respecting the Senate
that will be introduced, goes on to say:
To ensure that the redistribution of
electoral districts is made objectively and
impartially, you will be asked to approve
a bill to establish an independent commission to recommend redistribution.
I would hope if such legislation were passed
that any such commission would have regard
to the important principles which the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) mentioned.
He also referred to reform of the House of
Commons. I do not presume to speak for the
Government in this chamber, but I think I
can assure him that the Prime Minister would
be fully prepared, if the constitutional means
were available, to reform that corner of the
House of Commons which prevented the numerous bills to which he referred from going
through last year.
Now it is not my intention to deal with
any sterile statistics to attempt to determine
how far have the mighty fallen or how high
have the fallen been raised, but if the Government was, as the honourable Leader of
the Opposition suggests, defeated and I draw
to the attention of the Opposition, that it is
still the Government-certainly the Liberal
party was not elected.
Now the Leader of the Opposition, having
referred to the results of the last election, and
having given some statistical details, complains about the conduct of the Prime Minister in going to the Prime Ministers' Conference without authority from Parliament.
He says:
Not that I object to his going to
London-I want to make that clear-but,
being the head of a minority government,
the least he could have done was call
Parliament and receive a vote of confidence.
I suggest that if the Prime Minister had done
that it might have been necessary to postpone the Prime Ministers' Conference in order
to assure his attendance, if what we have
seen during the past week in the other place
is any indication of what might have taken
place somewhat earlier.
The honourable leader then proceeds to
quote some rather stale references from the
press, one of January 10, one of April 24, and
another of May 15, as to the position which
the Prime Minister should have taken at the
conference. I now ask honourable senators

money from the International Monetary Fund

from the Export-Import Bank. This was a

you reach that point, the worst thing that you

I merely ask, at what time in 1947 did Mr.
Abbott and Mr. King determine that there
was a crisis, when our reserves fell by 60
per cent in ten and a half months? Did they
go on the first of October and say to the
people of Canada: "This is a dreadful situation; we are afraid we may have to do
something about it." Then at the end of
October, did they say: "The situation has not
improved. It is getting a little worse; I guess
we will have to do something very soon."
There would have been no foreign exchange
to argue about if they had done that. You
all know what Mr. Abbott did at that time:
he went to the radio-there was no television
available then-and announced the crisis and
the steps which he proposed to take. Those
steps went further in many cases than any
steps which the present Government has
taken.
In referring to the Speech from the Throne
the Leader of the Opposition referred with

of the Opposition continues:
Secondly: Let us recognize the existence of a European Common Market.
Does he suggest that the Government is
ignoring the existence of the European Common Market? Does he suggest that Canadian
businessmen are ignoring its existence? I may
say, without quoting statistics, that our exports to the European Common Market have
been increasing substantially, increasing at
a much faster rate than our exports to commonwealth countries, and at a much faster
rate than to any country except the United
States of America.
The Leader of the Opposition goes on to
say:
Thirdly: Let us recognize the significant step forward which was recently
taken by the United States, ...

The United States, as the leader of the

and development work. Of course, such funds
for that purpose are available in some degree
today. He would extend the provisions of
the Industrial Development Bank to establish
industries in depressed areas, and inducements to develop in depressed areas could be
by way of tax incentives, with government
making capital available in a co-operative
enterprise with industry-whatever that may
mean.
The third point is that he would extend
family allowances to certain classes of children from 16 to 21 years of age. The fourth
point is the provision of medical services
without charge to a substantial body of the
population.
Honourable senators, I think the significant
thing is that none of those points were
touched upon by the Leader of the Opposition in this house, and I wonder whether my
friends opposite are not somewhat disturbed
by what they hear coming from the leader
of their party in the other place.
I have in front of me a clipping from the
Toronto Dailt Star of Tuesday, October 9, and
I shall just paraphrase an editorial on that
page. It is entitled, "Where Will the Money
Come From?" There can be no question that
the program outlined would be extremely expensive. The cost of the Ontario hospital insurance scheme was estimated at $200 million
for the current year, including about $120
million in taxes. A provincial medical plan
would cost as much, and the whole bill could
not be carried by the subscribers' premiums.
Other projects-low-cost housing, free university tuition, assistance to farmers in raising their incomes, help to municipalities with
their transit problems-would likewise cost
the provincial treasury many millions of
dollars. How would the money be raised? By
increasing existing provincial taxes, by imposing new ones, by income from government-operated monopolies, or by some other
method? The platform is completely silent
on this question.
Hon. Mr. Croll: But he was not discussing
the Liberals.
Hon. Mr. McCulcheon: No. I agree he was
not discussing the Liberals, but he was discussing a platforrn like that of the Liberals
in another place; and I suggest the comments
that have been made on this platform-which
was the platform of the N.D.P., as produced
by the Ontario division at its convention last
week, could be made about the platform
that was enunciated by Mr. Pearson in another place a week ago.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why not apply it to the
Prime Minister's proposals as well?
Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: Well, I have not
seen any of the Prime Minister's proposals
that are going to involve the sums of money,
from what source I know not, which are involved by some of the other proposals. In any
event, being the Prime Minister he will have
to put forward his proposals and the cost
will then be assessed; whereas, the Leader of
the Opposition is in the more fortunate position, as of course is the leader of the N.D.P.,
in that he can put forward the proposals
but it remains for someone else to ask where
will the money come from.
The Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) touched on another point yesterday.
I do not want to traverse the same ground,
but I think it is worth underlining. The Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), at the conclusion of his speech said:
To use the words of Sir John A. Macdonald, it is our duty to take a "sober
second look" at all government legislation.
Then the leader quoted from a speech he
made in 1957, and he concluded by making
this, it seemed to me, very remarkable statement:
In this regard minority governments cast
an added onus on the Senate, and we
must remain more alert and conscious of
our duties than of our prerogatives.
Now, if I can take anything from that statement, it means that because the Conservative
party in the House of Commons has not a
majority of members, any legislation that
comes from that house to this chamber must
be looked at more carefully than normally.
The exact words were, "there is an added
onus on the Senate because there is a minority government".
Honourable senators, there are countries
where minority governments have been the
rule rather than the exception. I trust that
this situation will not arise in this country,
but this is not the first time that we have
had a minority government and it may well
not be the last time. The point I want to make
is that there is no such a thing as minority
legislation. The legislation that comes to this
chamber from the House of Commons will be
passed by a majority of the persons voting
on that legislation, and that legislation deserves no more or no less attention coming
from the present Parliament than coming

from. any of the previous twenty-four Parliaments. There is no added onus on the Senate.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, first of all may I join with those who
have preceded me to pay my respects and
compliments to you, Mr. Speaker, and to say
how happy we are that you have been
elevated to this very important position. We
recognize this as a fitting recognition of your
long years of service in the other place and
in this chamber.
May I at the same time express to the new
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
my felicitations on his elevation to that position. We hope that he will enjoy his service
in the new capacity.
I would also like to say a word to our
friend, the senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), who with kindness and understanding over the years was particularly helpful
to those of us who are relatively new in this
chamber. I wish him many more years in the
seat he occupies.
To those who are "new boys" in this house,
may I also say that we welcome them, and
I hope they will enjoy their experience here.
We look forward to working with them.
Finally, may I offer my compliments to the
mover (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Fournier, Madawaska-Restigouche) of the
address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. I would say they have made an
excellent beginning.
Honourable senators, in speaking in this
debate today, I want first to comment on some
of the things that were in the Speech from

the Throne and some that were not. By way
of introduction, may I say that I read in the
Victoria Daily Times of August 28 last a very
thoughtful article, by that well-known Canadian writer, Bruce Hutchison, who was
reviewing some passages from J. W. Dafoe's
Life of Laurier, in which Dafoe referred to
the delayed reaction to certain events as
"subterranean currents in the life of a
democracy." Dafoe had referred to the execution of Louis Riel as one of these, and to the
conscription election of 1917 as "unnoted
watersheds from which the currents flowed
in the most surprising directions." I would
commend this article to anyone who would
take the time to read it because it has some
rather pertinent observations on the current
situation.
Hutchison went on to say that in the life
of our democracy today,
We are on just such a watershed and
the currents escape our eyes-the subterranean currents of a democracy dissatisfied with all parties-as tiny trickles
in the mountains become, a few miles
further on, the Fraser and the Saskatchewan moving to separate oceans.
If we cannot estimate the currents, the
watershed itself is clear enough-the
great issue facing us which the politicians
try to blur.
And this, to their own advantage. This
applies to all kinds of parties.
The article continues:
Is the nation prepared to pay the price,
accept the responsibilities and solve the
problems of nationhood? Or will it follow
the easy downhill grade that our fathers
refused to follow in times much harder
than these? Our party politics, in all their
disorder, are important only as they
reflect or, better still, as they lead us in
the largest decisions of our history.
Using the Dafoe theme of delayed reaction
to important historical events, such as the
execution of Riel and the conscription election of 1917, Hutchison was drawing the
conclusion that the two-party system in Canada might be undergoing some degree of
disintegration, certainly some measure of
fundamental change.
The fact that 1,900,000 electors cast their
votes for the representatives of the New
Democratic Party and the Social Credit Party
lends some credence to the point Hutchison
was making. It is true that the storm warnings are up for the traditional parties, and if
they are to survive and retain their traditional
hold on the allegiance of the Canadian
electorate they must convince the average
voter that they are prepared to seek some

OCTOBER 11, 1962
new directions in the realm of trade, in taxation, in monetary and fiscal policy, and to set
forth in clear and precise language what
should be the goals of the Canadian people,
and to spell out in some detail a number of
alternative ways by which those goals might
be achieved.
As I listened to the Speech from the Throne
I had the uneasy feeling I had heard much of
this before and that while some of the items
listed as part of this session's bill of fare
would be helpful if implemented, nevertheless
here was no definition of objectives or goals
for the nation, here were no new ideas and
directions which would capture the imagination and spur the initiative of the Canadian
nation. It is true there are some interesting
possibilities and I shall select a few at random.
The item that intrigued me most and which
I warmly welcome, is the proposal for
establishing a National Economic Development Board to review and report upon the
state of the economy and to recommend
projects. If this idea is pursued with imagination it could be a significant development in
Canadian history. However, I immediately
wonder what relationship this board will
have to the National Productivity Council, the
Atlantic Development Board, and a number of
others. Surely, the proposed National Economic
Development Board and the National Productivity Council should be, if not amalgamated, at least so constituted as to work in
the closest possible harmony. If these boards
are to be effective I suggest that they will
require long-range planning on a major
scale-and "planning" bas been a naughty
word in some political circles for a long, long
time. However, there are signs that even the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce is beginning
to recognize that our very survival as a successful economic entity will depend on some
degree of planning, that the undirected,
laissez-faire, free enterprise system may not
be able to compete with new industrial powers
which utilize a high degree of planning and
centralization of production and trading
techniques unless we have some co-ordinated
plans of our own.
In case someone jumps to the conclusion
that I favour a highly regimented and
centralized economy, let me say at once,
nothing could be further from the truth. What
I would like to see in the Canadian economy
is the maximum freedom for initiative and
enterprise, consonant with the national
welfare. But in a country as diverse as
Canada, where there is such a diversity of
interests by localities and regions, no program
can be implemented without a careful analysis of all the factors involved and a study of
the way such factors would affect the overall
plan.

Another item in the Throne Speech involves
the enlargement of the Industrial Development Bank. This, again, would seem to be a
sound development and should help the bank
to play a more important role than it bas up
to the present in encouraging industrial
development, particularly in the area of small
business.
The establishment of a national power
grid has intriguing possibilities, and the
export of power represents a new departure
in government policy which I think should be
welcomed.
The assistance for employers in meeting
the impact of automation is another piece of
legislation which is certainly coming not a
moment too soon. We can only hope that the
problem will be tackled with imagination
and courage, because it is certainly one of
the major problems on the horizon today.
Then there were in the Throne Speech less
important considerations, such as a provision
for more self-government for the Northwest
Territories, and the division of the present
territory into two territories. The suggestion
has frequently been made that these two territories should ultimately become Canada's
eleventh and twelfth provinces. Heaven forbid! It is bad enough and costly enough
to have eleven governments in Canada now
without creating the trappings and the overhead of two more. If it is desirable to provide
for inhabitants of these territories a government which is loser to them, then why not
attach these areas to the respective bordering
provinces? But let us not set up any more
provinces, at least not until Canada has a
population of 100 million people. Perhaps
we could afford to do it then.
The speech contained a suggestion about
a Dominion-Provincial conference on "a national flag and other national symbols". While
I would like to see agreement on a national
flag and a national anthem, I think such a
conference would be one more exercise in
futility, with as much likelihood of agreement as we have had before. It is my understanding that there are hundreds of designs
already on file somewhere in Ottawa. I hope
many of them are better and more in keeping with the nation's dignity and aspirations
than many samples I have had sent to me.
As far as I am personally concerned, I do not
see much wrong with the red ensign and the
fleur-de-lis. Maybe the fleur-de-lis could be
mounted on the red ensign in some suitable
manner and thus satisfy the historic aspirations of our two major cultures. Agreement
on a national anthem may be just as difficult
as agreement on a national fiag, but no one is
going to be hurt much if we continue to use
"O Canada" and "God Save the Queen" as we
feel like it in different parts of Canada.

SENATE
The speech also held out some unnamed
promises under the section forecasting a new
budget "to provide further solutions to longterm problems". This is the one we will all
be watching with the greatest of interest, and
we can only hope that the measures will be
adequate for the occasion. Until such time as
these "further solutions" are brought forward,
I would like to make a number of observations on the Canadian economic and political
scene, which I hope are relevant and which
may serve to underline the Canadian position
as I see it today.
At the present time Canada is a nation in
search of itself-in search of an identity. The
sense of unity and identity built up during
the last war has gradually dissipated, until
today we find a dissonance ringing through
the land, with some Canadians unable to
agree on a national flag, a national anthem
or a defence policy; while others, with more
enthusiasm than common sense, are threatening to secede from Confederation and set
up the Republic of Quebec.
It came as a shock to westerners attending
the Canadian Conference on Education in
Montreal recently to hear the Minister of
Youth for the province of Quebec say with
all sincerity that Quebec was "the French
national state, not only for Canada but for
North America". The new wave of French
Canadian nationalism differs from previous
expressions of the same thing, because this
time the people of French Canada are not
blaming the English as much as they have in
the past, but instead are blaming their secondary position in business and industry on
themselves, on their inadequate educational
preparation for participation in an industrial
economy, and they are determined to do
something about it. In the past three years
there has been a revolution in Quebec education and a new, more soundly-based and
vigorous French Canadian nationalism is one
of the most significant facts of the Canadian
political scene. No one takes seriously the
extremists who talk of setting up a separate
state, nor do the French take seriously the
political sops such as bilingual cheques-and
here let me say they should have these-and
similar trivia, as an adequate recognition of
French Canada's legitimate aspirations.
Canada is in a ferment. This is healthy and
good, because for too long Canadians have
suffered from an over-developed bump of
complacency, lulled by the endless repetition
of the theme that this was to be Canada's century. The constantly rising curve of unemployment which has increased from 2 per cent
of the labor force in 1947 to 7 per cent in
1961, plus the decrease in the gross national
product per capita from $1,481 in 1956 to an
estimated $1,435 in 1961, plus an alarming

increase in our national balance of payments
deficit, all indicate that this will not be Canada's century unless we do something more
vigorous about it than we have been doing
in the past ten years.
That Canadians are becoming concerned is
evidenced in many ways. There is more interest and more energetic development in the
arts and humanities than at any time in the
country's history. Five hundred Canadians a
year are enabled, by Canada Council grants,
to continue their studies in the arts and humanities in the finest centres of learning in
the world. This means that in ten years, 5,000
Canadians will be injecting new life and vitality into our cultural bloodstream. This can
be significant.
The appointment of seven royal commissions on education since 1945 is evidence of
the people's discontent with the quality of
Canadian education.
People are concerned with finding new answers and new directions which will enable
Canadians to compete and hold their own as
a nation at a time when the Canadian dream
that this was a land of boundless opportunity
has received some rude jolts, through recurring recessions and growing unemployment,
and through the return of thousands of immigrants, -who came to this country in high
hopes, to the newly-exciting and prosperous
lands of the Common Market and the more
advanced civilizations of a new and revitalized Europe.
In their disillusion with complacency, Canadians have rightly turned their eyes on the
one common denominator that makes them
all akin from Newfoundland to British Columbia, the education of their children. How can
we have a national identity and a sense of
Canadian unity and purpose when we have
not one but ten systems of education? How
can we have a national system of education
when a parochial provincialism says to our
national government that it must have no part
in shaping the foundations of a Canadian
identity by participating with the provinces
in developing a national program? How often
in the field of educational dialectics have sections 91 and 92 of the British North America
Act been used, either as an obstacle to progress or as an excuse for inaction?
Do Canadians want to have a national
identity? Do they want a rich national culture
that is vibrant and distinctive from the dull
and stultifying caricature of Hollywood uniformity? Do they want something that is
indigenous to our country, reflecting its rich
ethnic origins, its diverse and spectacular
regions, its moods and its people? If we do
want this, then there is work to do that will

OCTOBER 11, 1962
call for imagination and daring; it is the kind
of challenge which should inspire Canadians
to their greatest efforts.
Are Canadians adult enough in their thinking to face reality and realize that if we are
to build a nation, not one of a paltry 18
million people but one of 75 to 100 million,
we must have a national concept and a
national program. And we cannot have a
national program in these days of spiralling
costs of education without the national resources of the federal Government being put
behind those of the provinces. Are we so
blind and so politically inept as to permit
either a provincial parochialism or a negative
sectarianism to frustrate and negate the
evolving of a formula of co-operation between
provincial governments who have the legal
responsibility for education, but not the resources to pay for it at the secondary levels,
and the federal Government which has the
responsibility for the nation's progress and
the resources to make it possible?
I am one of those who believe firmly that
the Canadian people will respond magnificently to a challenge if it is put to them
clearly and if, first, they can be made aware
of what our national objectives or goals
should be and if, secondly, they can be given
some practical insight as to how those goals
can be achieved. Let us consider what some
of the national goals might be.
First, we must aim at a sense of nationhood
and national unity. It is essential, if Canada
is to grow to its full potential, that we
develop a sense of nationhood which recognizes and cultivates the diversity of our ethnie, racial, and religious origins, and which
seeks to cultivate the positive qualities of
these in such a manner that our very diversities, once recognized and appreciated, can
become orchestrated into one powerful Canadian symphony in which each plays its part
proudly and contributes to the national unity
on the basis of sympathy and understanding.
Secondly, we must aim at an adequate
economie growth. In this respect Canada has
not been doing too well. If we accept an
average annual growth of the gross national
produet in the neighbourhood of two to three
per cent in constant dollars as being an
adequate rate, our performance over the last
five years has fallen far short of what is
necessary and desirable. According to figures
prepared by Dr. S. H. Deeks of the Industrial
Foundation on Education, the average gross
national product in constant 1949 dollars was
.87 per cent over the last five years. Quoting
the late Dr. Gilbert Jackson, who had estimated an average annual growth rate in
constant dollars of 1.75 per cent, Dr. Deeks
states that if this rate had been attained over
the last five years there would have been

$2.5 billion more gross national product than
was actually the case. Such a sum would
have gone a long way towards providing
the extra jobs and the extra taxes necessary
to keep our economy in a healthy condition.
The third objective shoud be full employment. One of the most serious challenges and
one of the most complicated problems facing
Canada today is that of providing satisfactory
employment opportunities for everyone willing and able to work. This should not be an
impossible task for a country with the wealth
of resources we have at our disposal, but if
we are to achieve full employment certain
prerequisite conditions must be met.
The first of these is a willingness and desire
to work on the part of all of our people. Unfortunately, there are times when I get an
uneasy feeling that some people are not too
anxious to work, but this does not apply to
the great majority.
The second prerequisite is the maintenance
of a progressively expanding economy to provide necessary jobs. This is the responsibility
of business, industry, and government.
The third prerequisite is the capacity to
produce the quality of goods the market demands at a unit cost which is competitive
with other countries.
The fourth prerequisite is a marketing
policy in the field of international trade that
is imaginative and aggressive. Here I would
like to pay my respects to the Minister of
Trade and Commerce, who has been working
hard and has done some things which are in
keeping with this kind of objective. In other
words, he has brought energy, enthusiasm and
a lot of drive to his work.
The fifth prerequisite is an educational
program which will provide the trained manpower in science and technology at least
equal to that being provided by other and
competing countries. Here is an area where
we are not doing as well as we might.
Sixthly, we need as a prerequisite a widelyexpanded program of scientifie research at
both the basic and applied levels. In this
respect the federal Government bas been allocating increasing amounts of money for
research in Canada. This has been done directly through the National Research Council
and also through the National Research
Council to Canadian universities. The total
budget for the National Research Council in
1961-62 was just under $45 million. Of this
amount $14.4 million was allocated to the
universities to carry out actual studies. In
addition, in the 1962-63 budget-and this is
the first time it has happened-an amount
of $1 million bas been set aside for applied
research in industry, to be carried out on a
long-term basis by industrial firms in Canada.
This is a good beginning, but I suggest we will

SENATE
have to go much further in that direction. If
it is accepted that scientific research is the
basis of any prosperous economy today, we
have a long way to go to keep up with our
competitors.
The late Dr. Steacie, who was head of
the National Research Council, in his last
report, stated that Canada was spending .79
per cent of the gross national product on its
research and development, while the United
States spent 2.8 per cent, and the United
Kingdom spent 2.11 per cent. Against this,
the statement has been made by authoritative
sources in the United States, on the basis of
the best information available, that Russia
is spending more money on basic research
than all other countries in the world and
certainly more than double the amount being
spent in the United States. Nevertheless, the
amount spent on research and development
in the United States rose from $5 billion to
$15 billion in the ten-year period from 1950
to 1960. The rapid increase in expenditures
on scientific research and development in
that country is reflected in the employment
of scientists and engineers. The numbers rose
from 223,000 in 1954 to 387,000 in 1960, representing an increase of 87 per cent in six
years.
Honourable senators, in his speech yesterday the honourable senator from Gormley
(Hon. Mr. McCutcheon) referred to something
he called "sterile statistics". I would be the
first to admit that statistics can be sterile,
they can be deadly dull, they can be misleading. On the other hand, sometimes they can be
pregnant with meaning. I am suggesting to
you, honourable ladies and gentlemen, that
some figures today are full of meaning for us
and that we would be less than wise if we did
not pay attention to them.
If we accept the thesis that modern industrial progress is based on the numbers of
highly-qualified scientists and engineers employed, some comparative figures may be
of interest. It is estimated that at the present
time Russia employs 975,000 engineers against
730,000 in the United States, and the picture
is not likely to improve much in the next
six years because graduation rates are fixed

by the present enrolment. These figures show
that the United States will graduate 240,000
engineers in the next six years, while Russia
will graduate 750,000. It is estimated that by
1965 the Russians will have 1,725,000 engineers, against 970,000 in the United States.
Let us go to the technician, technologist
category. In the year 1959-1960 Russia enrolled
2,651,000 in this category compared with
80,000 in the United States. The annual graduation rate of technicians trained exclusively
for industry-that is, high-level techniciansaiounts to 250,000 in Russia and 16,000 in the

United States. Recently a delegation from the
American Engineers Joint Council, after making a study in Russia, reported that not more
than 1,000 of the engineering graduates in the
United States were equal in quality to those
in Russia. None of this makes for comfortable reading and certainly it gives us no
cause for complacency.
Incidentally, certain charts are published
by the Canadian Universities Foundation, and
an exceedingly interesting one illustrates that
Russia spends 100 times more money on propaganda than does any other nation. Whether
this is true or not, it seems to me it is time
we did a little more propagandizing of our
own.

There are other factors, but these are basic.
So I am suggesting, honourable senators,
that we need to pay more attention to a
national program of education to develop and
encourage Canada's economic survival.
It would be possible to develop many
aspects of the thesis that Canada must evolve
some new directions if she is to fulfil even
partially Sir Wilfrid Laurier's prediction that
the 20th century would belong to Canada;
but I propose to deal with only one major
problem, and this is the one which we must
solve if we are to succeed. That is the basic
problem of the quality of education we provide and the numbers of people we train to
make our economy effective.
I know there are people who will say that
a discussion of education bas no place in a
federal chamber when the responsibility for
education is by statute a provincial matter.
Let me say at once that I make no apology
for discussing in this chamber the very basis
of any success which Canada may achieve as
a modern nation. The Fathers of Confederation were able and dedicated men who in
their wisdom served their country well. But
those men never in their wildest dreams conceived of the kind of technology which is the
basis of modern industrial nations. If they
had, they would have made some provision
for the more adequate financing of education
than can be done from provincial and municipal resources.
Before giving some statistics on what our
present position is and what our needs are,
let me say at once that I am confident Canadian public men can devise formulas for the
more adequate support of Canadian education
without infringing the delicate sensibilities of
the provinces.
The federal Government has been providing aid for education on an increasing scale
for many years. We have only to think of the
grants to universities, and the vocational
training programs under which we have
already spent $267 million since the new
Technical and Vocational Training Assistance

OCTOBER 11, 1962
Act was passed in December, 1960. While I
do not want to bore you with statistics it is
necessary to use some to get a picture of the
present situation and some estimate of where
we are going from here and, very importantly,
how we compare with our competitors.
In the current school year in Canada the
total enrolment in elementary and secondary
schools is 4,600,000. Of this number 20 per
cent, or 920,000, are in secondary schools. In
the current year, 140,000 are attending universities. It is estimated that the cost to the
Government per pupil, that is, apart from
what parents have to pay, is as follows:
Elementary-$250 per year, or $920,000,000;
secondary-$425 per year, or $400,000,000;
university-$1400, plus, per year, or about
$200,000,000; making a total of $1,520,000,000.
This total figure does not include the money
being spent on private schools, nor on adult
education which, if added in, would probably
bring it close to $2 billion per year.
Some projections that have been made by
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and the
Canadian Universities Foundation should be
of interest. I am going to confine my remarks
to what is happening at the university level
because this is the critical area in Canadian
education and it is the only place from which
we can get the highly-trained scientific personnel necessary for the world of today. Do not
misunderstand me, honourable senators: this
is a major issue facing the Canadian people,
and we are falling behind in this respect. It
is estimated that by the academic year 19651966 we will have to provide for an additional
50,000 students in our universities, making a
total in that year of 190,000. By 1970 it is
anticipated that the university population will
increase by another 135,000, bringing the total
in that year to 325,000.
The estimated annual operating costs which
are presently running at $200 million a year
will increase to $300 million by 1965-1966,
and to $450 million by 1970. In the same
period of time the capital costs will require
$375 million by 1965-1966 and $1 billion by
1970. For example, in the current academic
year, 1962-1963, Canadian universities are
spending $167 million on capital; in 19631964 they will spend $255 million and in
1964-1965, $309 million.
In order to turn out the trained manpower
required, we obviously need to have an adequate teaching staff. In 1960-1961 there were
9,000 full-time teachers and research workers
employed in Canadian universities. It is estimated that by the academic year 1965-1966,
14,000 will be required, and by 1970-1971,
25,000. Allowing for an annual withdrawal
rate, through retirements, death and other
causes, of five per cent per year, we will have
to recruit an additional 23,000 teachers and
27511-5-6

research workers for universities in the next
10 years. This is on the basis of a purely normal rate of growth, and makes no allowance
for an expanded program.
Just to underline the deficiency in teaching
staffs with desirable qualifications, we had a
total enrolment in the graduate schools in
Canadian universities in the academic year
1961-1962 of 7,347. In the spring convocations,
masters degrees were given to 2,800 and doctors degrees to 325. Most Canadian universities today are trying to make the doctoral degree the minimum prerequisite for permanent
appointment. However it is just not possible
to get enough people with this standing to
staff our universities, and we have to settle
for people with lesser training.
It is estimated that by 1965 one Canadian
university-the University of British Columbia-will require half the doctoral graduates
in Canada in one year. This is only one university and it is not the largest. This illustrates the tremendous shortage of people with
the kind of training required to teach and
conduct research.
I could go on at much greater length to
quote additional statistics, ail on the same
point, namely, if Canada is to maintain its
place in the scientific world of today we must
be prepared to find greatly-increased funds
for education, and these can only be provided
by finding some formula by which resources
of the federal Government can be placed more
effectively behind those of the provinces.
Expressed as a percentage of the gross national product, Canada has made substantial
strides in attempting to meet her educational
needs, but these are far short of what is
necessary. In the current year Canada is
spending 3.8 per cent of its gross national
product on education-the highest we have
ever spent. The figure for the United States
is about the same. Again, the most authoritative figures we can get on Russia is about 7.5
per cent-almost double.
One of the privileges of living in a democratic society is that we have some choices,
and it may be that we have reached the stage
in our national development where we may
have to exercise some degree of choice as to
how we expend our resources.
It is easy to point out that Canada, for
example, is spending 63 per cent of its
national worth, or its G.N.P., on consumer
goods. The United States is spending 66 per
cent on consumer goods, and Russia 29.5 per
cent. In other words the Russians are concentrating their expenditures on capital goods,
military commitments, education, basic research, propaganda and foreign aid, while
Canadians are concentrating their expenditures on food, shelter, household costs,

SENATE
entertainment, transportation, clothing, medical costs, tobacco, alcohol, and so on. For
example-and this is a good illustration of
the direction of national wealth-in 1960 the
Russians manufactured 125,000 automobiles.
In the same year the Americans turned out
4,300,000. I do not have the Russian figure
for 1962, but the Americans expect to turn
out seven million automobiles. In another
area, in 1961 Canadians spent $719 million on
tobacco and $921 million on alcohol, or a
total of $1,640 million for these two items.
Now I have no wish to deprive those who
require these goods for their pleasures, but
as long as we in Canada are spending more
money on these two items than we are spending on education, I suggest to you that we are
not in a position to say that we cannot afford
to meet the increasing costs of education.
More and more, if Canada is to maintain
ber place among the modern nations of the
world, we may have to start exercising
choices. It may be that we shall have to
voluntarily reduce our expenditures in what
might be called the luxury segment of our
economy and transfer these expenditures to
the more productive areas of industrial and
scientific development.
The alternative to this is to be prepared
voluntarily to pay the additional taxes which
will be necessary to maintain the complement
of scientific manpower necessary to keep the
Canadian industrial machine functioning at
top efficiency. If we are not prepared to
exercise the choice of diverting some of our
expenditures from the consumer segment to
the more productive areas, or to pay additional taxes, there will be only one inevitable
end. The Canadian standard of living will
deteriorate and we shall not be able to maintain our position among the front rank of
industrial societies of the world. In that event,
Laurier's prediction that the 20th century
would belong to Canada will have gone down
the drain as just another dream.
On motion of Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton),
debate adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANYSECOND READING
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill S-4, respecting the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, there was
some uncertainty that copies of this bill would
arrive here in time for use today. However,
they came from the printing bureau at about
2.30 o'clock, and honourable senators will
find copies in their files.
This bill is a comparatively simple one. Its
purpose is to grant authority to the Canadian

Pacific Railway Company to build a branch
line of railway a distance of approximately
fifteen and a half miles from a point near
Bredenbury in the province of Saskatchewan
to a potash property located in the northeast
quarter of section 24, township 20, range 33,
west of the first principal meridian in the
province of Saskatchewan.
It is necessary that the railway company
come to Parliament for authority to build
this branch line because under the provisions
of section 138 of the Railway Act it is not
entitled to construct a branch line longer than
six miles without parliamentary authority.
The purpose of this branch line is to give
service to the new potash plant which bas
been constructed by the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation of Canada on
the aforementioned property. The railway
company wishes to commence construction of
the Une this fall, and I hope to be able to
convince honourable senators that that is
quite necessary. It is expected that the construction of the line will create no engineering difficulty because the railway engineers
have gone over the proposed right-of-way,
have tentatively selected it, and consider it
quite feasible for the purpose of economical
railway construction.
Honourable senators will be pleased to
note that the construction of this railway
involves the spending of no public money.
Bredenbury, which I have mentioned, is an
important intermediate railway terminal 10cated 252 miles west of Winnipeg on the
Canadian Pacific's secondary main line between Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Edmonton.
It is equipped with terminal staff and has
all the necessary facilities to handle expeditiously the traffic from the potash plant.
This potash development of International
Minerals and Chemical Corporation is a tremendous one. It is stated to be the world's
largest potash discovery, and it is expected
that it will produce up to 10 per cent of the
world's potash supply.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is this the development
at Esterhazy?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: How far is that from
Bredenbury?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: About 14 miles. There
are two railway lines through there, one
south of the potash plant and the other a
short distance north of it, running from
Winnipeg through Saskatoon to Edmonton.
The annual output of potash is estimated
to be one million tons or better. With the
sinking of another shaft to the 3,000-foot
level the annual output would be increased
by another one million tons.

OCTOBER Il. 1962
Potash is used in the production of chemical
fertilizer, and the markets for it are both
foreign and domestic. It is expected that al
potash produced at this large plant will be
shipped by rail, and that 40 to 50 per cent
will be exported. The exporting will take
place mainly through British Columbia to
such countries as Japan, Korea and Australia,
and to some extent through eastern Canadian
ports to Europe. It is anticipated that the
balance will go to markets in the United
States of America and in eastern and western
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask, what is the
anticipated life of the potash deposit?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That information is disclosed in an article published in the Saskatoon
Star-Phoenix, which I shail read later. However, 1 will say at thîs time that it is a most
extensive discovery. The deposit lies for many
miles in every direction and at a depth of
3,000 feet below surface.
Hon. Mr. Hnalyshyn: Almost 3,200 feet.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is located in the area
between Esterhazy and Bredenbury.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The supply is unlimited.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
although this vast potash discovery was originally made by geologists in 1943 its development presented, considerable difficulties
because of what is known as the Biairmore
formation of shale, dlay and water-soaked
sand that blocked the way to the deposits
which, as I stated a moment ago, are some
3,000 feet beiow surface. However, after
spending some $40 million, the company succeeded, through a method known as "tubbing", in effectively walling off the water
and in stabilizing the shaft leading to the
potash deposit.
This plant was officîally opened on September 20, 1962. The opening was attended, by
the Honourable Paul Martineau, federal Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys, Premier Lloyd of the province of Saskatchewan,
the Honourable Senator Hnatyshyn from
Saskatoon, Mr. James Ormiston, miember of
Parliament for Melville riding and several
distinguîshed residents of the community, including the mayor of Esterhazy and a number
of other dignîtaries.

opening as did the potash mine and
refinery plant of International Minerais
and Chemical Corporation (Canada) Limited, near Esterhazy.
In the first place, the Saskatchewan
Government n-amed the 700-square mile
area around the mine, Potashville. There
was a reason. This is one of the most
important new industries in the hîstory
of the province.
The company had gambled $40 million
on this project, and it is now paying off.
Next year, 21,000 cars of potash will fan
out for shipment to Eastern Canada, the
United States, Japan, Australia, and other
parts of the world. This is a greal industrial achievement.
Saskatchewan's potash deposits are the
world's greatest and richest. The government of Saskatchewan will reap an annual harvest of royalties, estimated at
$350,000.
The article continues:
Congratulations are due the company
for the venture, now showing fulfilment.
Saskatchewan will reap immeasurable
benefits from this industry.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They sure need them.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I niight also say that in
the Esterhazy area new housing developments
are under way, a new school is being built,
and the district is rapidly becoming an important trading centre. The plant employs
some 400 men, primarily from Esterhazy and
the surrounding area. The annual plant payroll wiil exceed $2,400,000, and will support
some 2,400 people.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: Canadian capital?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would rather leave
that question until the meeting of the committee.
This industry has requested the Canadian
Pacific Railway to construct this short branch

I must bring your attention, honourable senators, to the fact that there is an immense
difference between an affirmation and a question. A question is easy to recognize, especially
when it is qualified as such-"I am going to

And now to continue to elucidate the
matter, may I add that there is nothing offensive in comparing anyone to the Trojan
horse, a big thing made of wood, that was
used in olden times to carry soldiers into a
fortress. Those who want more information on
the subject could re-read a chapter of the

Hon. Mr'. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
desire to put four questions on the Order

were asked first on March 28 of this year and
were on the Order Paper until April 18. They
have to do with the relationship that exists
between the constitutional. law and the civil
law, not only in the province of Quebec but
each province of Canada. I do not intend to
say much more now. 1 hope that 1 shahl be
ailowed to have those questions put on the
Order Paper without reading them, because
they are familar to ail my honourable colleagues who were sitting here last session.
In due course, and in order to facilitate the
answers to each one of the four questions, I
shall from time to time stake out the road to
the relative truth that must exist in law as
well as in any other science. There has been
a change in the Department of Justice, and
when the head changes it is full of meaning
especially to those who want to receive an
answer. Let us hope that the new Minister
of Justice wiil take the matter into favourable
consideration. He has already received a copy
of these questions before they appear on
the Order Paper. I am in a very co-operative
mood to supply from time to time the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks), the

Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) and you, too, Your Honour,

EANKRUPTCY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-MOTION FOR SECOND

READING-DEBATE ADJOUJRNED
Hon. John G. Higgins moved the second
reading of Bihl S-2, to amend the Bankruptcy
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, bankruptcy
is an institution that plays a large part in the
commercial affairs of Canada; and there is
no doubt that if it has played a large part in
the past, it will play as large a part in the
future. For, wherever there is commerce,
wherever there is buying and selling or
barter, there will also be bankruptcies.
It is unfortunate for the bankrupt and for
his creditors. In some cases it is a terrible
tragedy for the bankrupt himself, because he

SENATE
is often a man who has put all his money into
a business which prospered for a while and
then failed, and thus he finds himself ruined.
It is equally unfortunate for the creditors,
for I suppose it has never happened that a
creditor has found a business that went bankrupt had sufficient assets to pay 100 cents on
the dollar.
Bankruptcies or insolvencies-whatever you
like to call them-existed way back in the
misty past. Roman law made special provision for bankruptcies, and the law of bankruptcy was for a long time a harsh one
because the bankrupt became a slave of his
creditor. But, the doctrine of jus gentium, the
law of nations, spread from Greece and prevailed in Rome, and the bankruptcy laws
were softened and made more merciful and
equitable by its influence.
England, up to the mid-nineteenth century,
had equally harsh laws with respect to debts,
and men who could not pay their debts filled
the jails, for the idea existed in those days
that a man who could not pay his bills should
be sent to prison. But more humane doctrines
gradually prevailed, and with the changing
times laws became more merciful, and for
many years now the bankrupt may lose his
money but not his liberty.
The institution of limited liability companies has been a boon for people in business.
By this means a man now loses only what
he puts into a company; his private estate
is never touched in the case of a liquidation.
A small man may become a shareholder in a
company and lose only the money he put into
that company, but if that man is a minor
member of a partnership and that partnership fails, then he might lose everything he
owns.
To demonstrate the importance of discussing bankruptcy I shall cite the following
figures with respect to bankruptcies in Canada
during the calendar years 1957 to 1961:
Year

surroundings, and after I started to prepare
this speech I came upon this clipping by
Walter Stewart, a press correspondent in
Toronto. I feel I should give thanks to those
to whom thanks are due, and I would like to
give thanks to that gentleman because he
helped me out in a portion of my speech.
Now, there may be those here who know
nothing about bankruptcy or bankruptcy
laws; there may be those who know something about those laws, and there are others
who are experts on the subject. I say to those
who know nothing about bankruptcy law or
the Bankruptcy Act that they may learn
something; of those who may know a little,
I ask tolerance, for even I, who know very
little, must listen to my own voice with
patience and try to improve myself with
repetition. And I say to those who know a lot
-that is, the experts-they may gain nothing,
but at the same time will lose nothing and
may have the satisfaction of discovering that
I do not know as much as I try to make them
think I know, and it is a great satisfaction to
find out the truth no matter how embarrassing
to some other person.
There are two ways of becoming bankrupt.
The first is by the filing of a voluntary assignment. A debtor executes an assignment of his
property for the benefit of his creditors, and
also makes a statement of his assets and
liabilities. These are filed with the official
receiver, who appoints a trustee. He cannot
appoint anyone as trustee, but only a person
who bas been licensed under the Trustee Act,
and such a person must give a bond for the
due carrying out of his duties and the proper
management of the estate. The official receiver
usually chooses a trustee after consultation
with the most interested creditors, if ascertainable at the time.
Within five days, the trustee sends a notice
for a meeting of the creditors to take place
within 15 days after the mailing of the notice.
Meanwhile the debtor must fill out a questionnaire about his affairs, which is given to him
by the official receiver. The official receiver
will examine him on his answers, and these
are filed.
At the meeting of the creditors, the official
receiver or the trustee will be the chairman.

in a trade or business without disclosing to all
persons with whom he enters into any business transaction that he is an undischarged
bankrupt, and he must inform any person
from whom he obtains credit, for a purpose
other than the supply of necessaries for himself and family, to the extent of $500 or more,
that he is an undischarged bankrupt.
Provision is made in the act for a trustee's
remuneration. The court may, if it sees fit,
refer to the registrar to take the account of
the trustee and to settle the trustee's remuneration. The maximum amount he can
receive is 7l per cent of the amount remaining out of the realization of the property after
the claims of the secured creditors have been
paid and satisfied.
The Bankruptcy Act may be said to establish three procedures:
(1) An insolvent person may be petitioned
into bankruptcy by his creditors (Section 21).
(2) An insolvent person may make an assignment in bankruptcy (Section 26).
(3) An insolvent person or a bankrupt may,
before or after being petitioned or assigning
himself into bankruptcy, make a proposal to
his creditors (Section 27).
I spoke a little earlier about summary
administration as set out in section 26 (6).
The bill before us asks that this subsection
(6) be repealed. Subsection (6) reads:
Where the bankrupt is not a corporation and in the opinion of the official
receiver the realizable assets of the
bankrupt, after deducting the claims of
secured creditors, will not exceed five
hundred dollars, the provisions of the act
relating to summary administration of
estates shall apply.
The procedure outlining the steps necessary to carry out subsection (6) is outlined

in sections 114, 115 and 116 of the act. It is
also asked that these sections be repealed. If
the subsection is repealed, these sections must
also be repealed, for they depend entirely on
the subsection and have relation only to it.
The bill is designed to meet two situations.
During recent years abuses have crept into
the administration of certain estates in bankruptcy by some trustees. Particularly bas this
happened in the case of small estates to which
the summary provisions of the act apply, that
is to say, in cases where the bankrupt is an
individual, or the realizable assets, after
deducting the claims of secured creditors, do
not exceed $500. The provisions do not apply
to corporations.
The purpose of summary administration,
first enacted in 1949, was to provide for the
expeditious administration of small estates,
reduce the cost of such administration and
bring about the early discharge of the bankrupt. To do this the legislation provides for
relaxing certain of the requirements ordinarily applicable in the administration of
bankrupt estates.
The serious provisions relaxed are:
(1) The security ordinarily required to be
deposited by the trustee administering an
estate is dispensed with. There is no necessity
for the trustee to give a bond.
(2) The notice of a bankruptcy need not, as
in other cases, be published in a local newspaper, unless deemed expedient by the
trustee or ordered by the court.
(3) Only creditors who have proved claims
amounting to $25 are entitled to receive
notice, other than notice of first meeting of
creditors, whereas in ordinary bankruptcies
all creditors who have proved claims, are
entitled to receive such notice.
(4) No inspectors are required, as in the
case of ordinary bankruptcies.
(5) The creditors at the first meeting may
authorize the trustee to apply for the discharge of the bankrupt without further
notice to them, where the bankrupt bas not
made a proposal for a composition and his
examination has not disclosed any assets,
whereas in ordinary bankruptcies the trustee
is required to give express notice to the
creditors unless the court dispenses with such
notice.
Taking away these safeguards made the
administration of small estates a sort of
happy-go-lucky adventure, which sometimes
created opportunities for fraud and misrepresentation. Such abuses as soliciting persons to make assignment in bankruptcy, mismanagement of the assets of bankrupt estates,
failing to realize upon such assets for the
benefit of creditors, and misappropriation of
assets, became possible and easy of achievement.

OCTOBER 16, 1962
The elimination of estate inspectors and the
necessity to put up a bond contributed in a
large degree to this state of affairs. This is the
view of the Bankruptcy Branch of the Department of Justice, and it was also brought
to the attention of that department by such
persons as the Chief Justice of the Court
in Bankruptcy of one of the provinces, and
to the Canadian Bar Association.
One purpose of the bill before us is to make
applicable to those estates coming under the
summary administration section the requirements and safeguards applicable to other
estates. To do this, the repeal of the summary administration section is found to be
necessary to create the same situation as existed prior to 1949.
This will work no hardship on small bankrupts. In reality, both creditors and bankrupts will profit thereby as both have frequently suffered from the above-mentioned
abuses.
I now come to the second purpose. The
province of Manitoba had attempted to have
small estates wound up by a certain procedure. It had in effect, during several years,
legislation called The Orderly Payment of
Debts Act. This act provided a comparatively
simple and inexpensive procedure whereby a
small debtor, who was unable to meet his
obligations as they came due, could apply
to the Clerk of the County Court to fix
amounts to be paid into court and distributed
pro rata among the creditors until they were
paid in full.
In 1959 Alberta passed a similar act but,
apparently entertaining some doubt as to
its constitutional validity, referred it for the
opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada on
this point, before it should be proclaimed.
In 1960 the Supreme Court of Canada
held the provincial act to be ultra vires,
as conflicting with the federal jurisdiction
over "Bankruptcy and Insolvency" in the
British North America Act.
The Alberta act, consequently, was never
proclaimed and the Manitoba act was repealed. Both provinces then requested the enactment of federal legislation of the same
character which could be proclaimed by other
provinces if requested.
Part X will not come into operation in
any of the provinces unless the LieutenantGovernor of that province makes a request
that the Governor in Council should issue a
proclamation that it be put into force in that
province which requested it.
This bill, by the introduction of Part X,
enacts a new procedure in bankruptcy law.
Part X-that is the bill before us-closely
follows the provincial legislation just mentioned, which was declared ultra vires. The
scheme, briefly, is that a debtor who cannot

meet his debts may go to the Clerk of the
County Court, or such other court as is
designated, and disclose to him his debts,
his resources and his obligations, and ask
for the issue of a consolidation order which
fixes the sums to be paid into court for distribution among the creditors, until the
debts are fully discharged.
If such an order is issued, a creditor may
not, while the debtor carries out the terms
of the order, proceed against the debtor in
respect of a debt to which the part applies.
Part X does not apply to a debt in excess
of $1,000, except when the creditor consents.
Certain debts do not come within Part X, as
for instance a debt incurred by a trader or
merchant in the ordinary course of his business, that is to say, a trading debt.
This bill, as I have said, deals with small
estates. It does not affect wealthy people,
companies, traders or merchants. But a vast
amount of time and trouble must have been
involved in bringing about the various sections
to effect the purposes of the bill. It may look
like putting the trappings of an elephant on
a mouse.
Before Confederation in 1949, Newfoundland had a very simple process of dealing
with insolvencles. We never used the word
"bankrupt". That word was never found in
Newfoundland law before Confederation. A
man was insolvent if he could not pay his
blls and the court declared him insolvent,
not bankrupt. He could make a composition
with his creditors or assign to a trustee for
the benefit of his creditors. The only time the
debtor would need to go to court under these
circumstances was when certain creditors did
not sign the composition, the assignment, or
the arrangement, and the debtor or some
creditor would be forced to apply to court
to have the debtor declared insolvent in order
to have the assignment or composition sanctioned by the court, which would be done if
three-quarters in number or in value of his
creditors had agreed to the composition or
assignment. The insolvency would then be
set aside. All this procedure was contained in
about ten sections of the Judicature Act.
This bill, however, is designed for ten
provinces and fifteen million people and that
presupposes a vast number of people to be
affected by it. It is a bill designed to form
part of the Bankruptcy Act, enacted for a
vast country of immense wealth and resources. I understand that the Bankruptcy
Branch of the Department of Justice will be
putting forward a complete revision of the
Bankruptcy Act at some time. This will
require much toil on the part of those who
are expert in the subject.

SENATE
Now let us come to the sections of the bill.
I did not anticipate speaking at length amid
the strong heat of an October evening after
a long period of summer cold.
The repealed sections 114, 115 and 116 are
set out in the explanatory notes.
Section 174 sets out the classes of debts to
which Part X applies and to which it does
not apply.
The items specified in subsection (2) are
taken from the provincial legislation, it being
considered desirable to adopt them as they
are. The same applies to subsection (3). But
by subsection (3)(c) the Governor in Council
may, for any province other than Manitoba
or Alberta, designate the corresponding
classes of debts in those provinces where Part
X does not apply. I may remark that under
section 196 the Governor in Council may
raise or lower the sum of $1,000 referred to
in subsection (1).
Section 175 starts the procedure. A debtor
in a province where Part X is in force may
apply to the clerk of the appropriate court in
such province.
Section 176 outlines the duties of the clerk.
He settles the amount to be paid into court
and the times of payment. Creditors may
contest the issuing of a consolidation order at
a meeting set by the clerk.
Section 177. Any creditor has twenty days
to object to the amount entered in the record
as owing to him or any other creditor, or
to the amounts or times of payment thereof
determined by the clerk, or to the fact that
the clerk has not settled any such amounts.
If an objection is received, the clerk notifies
the time and place of hearing thereof to the
interested parties.
Section 178 sets out that at the time and
place appointed for the hearing of an objection taken under section 177, the clerk may
then add to the record the name of any
creditor who was overlooked but whose name
has now come to light.
Section 179. At the time and place appointed to hear objections, the clerk considers any such objection and disposes of it
or refers it to the judge of the court himself.
The result is entered in the record.
Section 180. If no objection is entered
within twenty days, the clerk notes this fact
in the record and issues a consolidation
order.
Section 181 sets out the contents of a
consolidation order. The order must state
the name of and the amount owing to each
creditor, and so on.
Section 182 lays down that an order must
provide for payment in full within three
years, unless all creditors consent or the
court approves.

Section 183. Any party affected by a consolidation order may, within fourteen days
of its making, apply to the court to review it.
The clerk enters on the record the decision
of the court, whether to confirm, vary or set
aside the consolidation order.
Section 184. The court, in dealing with a
consolidation order, may impose terms on
a debtor with respect to the custody of his
property, or any disposition thereof, or the
proceeds thereof, for the protection of the
creditors on the record.
Section 185. Upon the issuance of a consolidation order, no process shall be issued
out of any court in the province against the
debtor at the instance of a creditor in respect
of a debt to which Part X applies, except as
permitted by Part X. Provision for such permission is made in section 189.
Section 186 provides that the clerk of the
court may, after the issuance of a consolidation order, insist upon an assignment of any
money owing or to become owing to the
debtor or earned or to be earned by the
debtor. The clerk may also issue a writ of
execution, upon a consolidation order, and
file it wherever it will be a charge upon land
or chattels.
Section 187 gives the clerk the right to add
to the list of creditors, before the recognized
creditors have been paid in full, a creditor
who is not on the list. The debtor may dispute
the claim and the matter is referred to the
court.
Section 188 deals with a secured creditor
and the manner in which he is paid. These
are actually long sections.
Section 189 is another long one. It provides
that in certain circumstances a recorded creditor may apply, by notice of motion, for
authority to enforce the order as for instance,
where the debtor has defaulted in his payments. He may apply ex parte where the
debtor has absconded; and the court may
authorize the creditor to act on behalf of
himself and all creditors.
Under section 190 a debtor or a creditor
may apply at any time ex parte to the clerk
for a further examination and review of the
debtor's financial position, as a result of which
the order may be revised.
Section 191 imposes on the clerk the duty
to distribute the money paid into court pro
rata every three months.
Section 192. The clerk may, for any purposes of Part X, examine any person under
oath. He also keeps a written record in summary form of the proceedings.
Section 193. Where a debtor is put into
bankruptcy all money already paid is paid
over to the trustees. Although proceedings are

OCTOBER 16, 1962
taken under Part X, this does not prevent
anybody taking bankruptcy proceedings under
other provisions of the act.
Section 194 sets out that a decision or order
of the court under Part X is subject to appeal
in the sane manner as other decisions or
orders of the court in a civil action.
Section 195 provides that a copy of every
consolidation order be sent to the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. The clerk also reports to the superintendent upon the conclusion of each proceedings under Part X.
Section 196, which I mentioned earlier in
relation to section 174, authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations for carrying into effect the purposes of Part X, including the prescribing of forms and fees, the
designating of the appropriate court in provinces other than Alberta and Manitoba, adapting the Part to the particular circumstances
of a particular province, varying in respect
of any province the classes of debts and
amounts thereof to which Part X applies, and
changing or prescribing, in respect of any
province, the classes of debts.
Section 197 provides that the accounts of
every clerk of the court, under Part X, are
subject to audit by the appropriate provincial
authority.
Section 198 sets out that Part X-and this
is important-comes into force in any
province only upon the issue of a proclamation by the Governor in Council at the request of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
of the province concerned. In other words,
Part X does not come into effect in any province unless such province requests that trie
Governor General in Council shall issue an
order making it apply.
Clause 4 of the bill relates to the repeal of
the summary administration provisions of the
Bankruptcy Act and makes it clear that, if a
bankruptcy is being administered under such
provisions when Part X comes into effect, it
will continue to be so administered.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Did I understand him to
say at the beginning of his speech that there
is a limitation on claims to be made against
a man in business who becomes bankrupt, that
a certain portion of his assets may be set
aside for his own benefit?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: To the extent of supplying necessities for himself and family.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Thank you.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, there are a few things I would like to
say in connection with the bill now before us.
Having been on the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the Senate when the Bankruptcy Act was revised in the late forties, and

having been given the arduous job as chairman of a subcommittee which dealt with the
portions of the bill then before us-and where
there was a contest, and representations were
being made, the subcommittee was told to
sit down with these people and resolve their
problems-I acquired some smattering of
knowledge of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.
This application of the Bankruptcy Act is
a broad subject dealing generally with providing the machinery by which a debtor's
assets may be liquidated in the best interests
of and for the benefit of his creditors. But
the subject matter of the bill before us tonight
is a very narrow one; it deals only with
summary administration in cases where the
debts of the individual-and it applies only
to individuals-are within a certain range
limit.
Now the law as it stands at present, provides that the summary administration sections 114 to 116, inclusive, apply where the
assets of the debtor, apart from all secured
claims, are not in excess of $500. That is the
area in which the act at the present time
applies.
The summary administration provisions are
contained in these three sections, 114, 115 and
116, and while they still provided for a trustee
in bankruptcy, such trustee did not have to
make a deposit in order to guarantee a faithful and honest performance of his duties.
Also, there were no inspectors. In practice,
abuses developed even within that small area,
and salaried individuals would go on a buying spree; then they would meet with a very
co-operative trustee and there would be a
summary administration of their affairs. The
machinery even went so far as to provide that
when the trustee was sending out a notice to
creditors he would include in the material a
notice for fixing a day when the debtor might
be discharged from his bankruptcy. So there
was a very friendly sort of spirit, and the
summary administration provisions were
never intended to cover the kind of situations
that have developed.
What does this bill do? This bill repeals
those sections and provides a new Part X in
which a different kind of machinery is set up
for individuals who fit within these conditions, namely, that the creditors' claims individually must not exceed $1,000. If there is
a judgment, for instance, for more than
$1,000, that creditor may come in and take
part in this summary administration, if he
agrees to come in. Now it would appear to
me that that kind of provision is open to at
least as much abuse as the provisions being
repealed.

SENATE
There are certain things in connection with
this bill that I must object to very strenuously, and I shall tell you why. First of all,
under this part there is no such thing as a
trustee. The clerk of the court is the one to
whom the debtor may go and submit his
application and material for what is called
a consolidation order. Then he has to file an
affidavit setting out certain information as to
what his assets and liabilities are, and there
is a hearing by the clerk of the court who in
the first instance makes all these determinations as to proof of claims and the assets
which the debtor has exposed to him. The
clerk then passes on payment on account of
all these claims.
But here we are now establishing the clerk
of the court. In Alberta, according to this
bill, the clerk of the court is the Clerk of the
District Court, and in Manitoba he is the
Clerk of the County Court; as to other provinces it says that the Governor, by order in
council, may determine the court of the
province which shall be the court, the clerk
of which is the one who has the power for
summary administration and to make these
consolidation orders.
I cannot understand why this should be
done when we have, in every province in
Canada, a registrar under the Bankruptcy
Act, who has over a period of years gained
a considerable experience in dealing with
bankrupts, and knows their ways much better
than a person who comes in without any
knowledge of or familiarity with the ways of
debtors. You can be sure that debtors, who
become bankrupt, in many instances-not in
all instances because sometimes it may be a
genuine bankruptcy-may, for instance, try
to conceal some assets in the hope that they
will be beyond reach when the bankruptcy is
declared.
To safeguard the position of the creditor I
think the best available machinery should be
used, if we are going to provide this plan of
consolidation of debts and the orderly administration of the affairs of those debtors who
have not been declared bankrupt. A debtor
goes to the clerk of the court and submits all
the information that is required, an order is
made, and then under the new administration
makes his payments, notwithstanding the
fact that the creditor may avail himself of
the provisions of the act and demand bankruptcy.
My first objection, then, is that the services
of the person in each province who is most
familiar and most experienced in the administration of bankruptcies under the Bankruptcy Act are not going to be used. My second objection is that there is no provision in
this bill for inspectors.

At the worst, I think this bill should provide for the appointment of inspectors in
the discretion of the creditors at the first
meeting of creditors convened by the clerk,
because alert inspectors often uncover assets
that would not otherwise be found. Therefore,
I say that those two points should be considered.
I agree that the provisions of the act as it
now stands have been subject to abuse, and
it is time some changes were made. I am
not sure that the changes need go as far as
Part X in this bill goes, but if this new provision with respect to the orderly payment
of debts in Part X is to be enacted, then I
say that in the interests of the creditors
there should be certain safeguards. The registrar of the bankruptcy court should be appointed instead of a clerk of whatever court
of a province may be designated, and I
believe there should be a discretionary power
in regard to inspectors.
I should point out, honourable senators,
that the Board of Trade of Metropolitan
Toronto, under the guidance of its legal
secretary, over the period since the Bankruptcy Act was revised in the late 1940'sI think it was in 1949-has been making a
study year by year of the experiences of
trustees and all persons concerned in bankruptcies and in the administration of the
act. That organization submitted a lengthy
brief to the Superintendent of Bankruptcy
in December of last year, and the only recommendations in the brief that are acted
upon by this bill are those with respect to
Sections 114 to 116 of the act. The submissions with respect to sections 114 to 116 were:
Certain weaknesses have become apparent in operation under the summary
administration provisions in Sections
114-116. The following subsections of
section 114 involve the principal weaknesses and should be repealed for the
reasons stated:
Subsection (c), for the reason that a
bad impression is created on the part of
creditors who receive a notification of
discharge proceedings along with the
notice of bankruptcy, especially in those
instances where the amount of debts
involved is large.
Mind you, the amount of debts can be
large when the test is that not more than
$500 has been left after the secured creditors
have been taken care of. There is no limitation; no maximization or minimization of
the amount of debts. The submission goes on:
The effect of such a change would be
to leave bankrupts under summary administration to apply for discharge in
the usual way.

OCTOBER 16, 1962
Subsection (f) which would leave the
bankrupt under summary administration
free to submit a proposal under the
proposal provisions of the Act. In any
event there is little to be gained in practice by this provision in the summary administration sections.
Subsection (h), owing to the fact that its
effect is to exclude examination under
oath and make it more difficult to ascertain whether any improper use is being
made of the summary administration
proceedings.
Those are the objections that body had to
Section 114. The submission goes on to say:
Subsection (g) should be amended, so
that there may be inspectors if the
creditors at the first meeting so decide.
The reason for this is that under the
present procedure the Court only has
before it the debtor's statement of assets
and liabilities. Instances have occurred
in which important transfers of property
have taken place prior to bankruptcy
without being disclosed in the debtor's
statement before the Court. The appointment and activities of inspectors in such
cases would serve a valuable purpose in
investigating prior transfers of property
and serve to guard against any undesirable advantage being taken of the summary administration proceedings in this
regard.
I should point out that in order to support this representation, the Board of Trade
of Metropolitan Toronto caused a comprehensive and continuing study of the act
to be made by a committee of persons who
had special knowledge of the subject. This
committee was comprised of leading trustees,
liquidators, members of the accounting and
legal professions, and business executives
who had specialized in bankruptcy matters.
Upon learning that it was the intention of
the Government to revise the 1949 act, the
board's study of the act was reviewed and
brought up to date and its findings were
submitted.
I do not want to be taken as being critical
of the Government or of the Superintendent
of Bankruptcy in saying that the bill before
us deals only with one aspect that is raised
by this brief. It may be that this is all that
could be dealt with at the present time,
and that more study is required in order to
be able to deal with the other phases. What
I say is that when all these people, who have
had experience in this field for a period of
years, say that inspectors serve a useful
purpose, then at least there should be provision for the appointment of inspectors in

the discretion of the creditors at the first
meeting. In some circumstances they may
say inspectors are not necessary, but there
may be circumstances where they are necessary, and it is my opinion that such a discretionary provision should be in this bill if
we are to carry through with the plan that
is proposed.
We should also know more definitely what
courts are to be specified in the various
provinces, excluding Alberta and Manitoba
which are specifically dealt with in the bill.
What court is going to be designated as the
court to be charged with the administration
of Part X, the clerk of which will be the
one who will deal first with the matter and
who may then refer it to a judge of that
court?
To me it seems so wasteful that basic experience gained over a long period of time
in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act
is now being abandoned, and the clerk of
a court is to be designated-and we do not
know which court it is in eight of ten provinces-as the one to deal with these debtors.
Debtors, even under this bill, can accumulate a tremendous amount of debt and still
come under the provisions with respect to
summary administration. The only limitation
is $1,000, which means that each debt must
not exceed $1,000. Therefore, when this bill
becomes law I am sure that the salaried man
who wants to go on a spending spree, or
indulge in an expansion of his credit or a
utilization of what credit he has, will stilI be
free to do so except that he must keep a
little closer account of the indebtedness he
is accumulating and see to it that it does
not become more than $1,000 in any particular place. That still gives him quite a
large area in which to operate. He can then
go to the clerk of the court and make his
amends. This is regarded as being so simple
and so unimportant that provision is not even
made for the salutary check that inspectors
might be able to put on such operations.
Therefore, when this bill goes before the
committee the time should be fixed, and
there should be invited as witnesses not only
representatives of the Board of Trade of
Metropolitan Toronto or its committee, but
also the registrars of the bankruptcy courts
in the various provinces.
I should tell you that in 1949 when we
studied the revision of the Bankruptcy Act
the bill was introduced in the Senate, even as
this bill is being introduced now, and the
study was made in the Senate. We even
had the bankruptcy judges in the different
provinces come here to express a viewpoint
based on their experience. We also had the
registrars and lawyers who were experts in

SENATE
practice under the Bankruptcy Act come
before us. Therefore we had a wealth of
experience and evidence to study.
Any revision of the Bankruptcy Act is a
very important subject. We should thank
the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Higgins)
for telling us tonight that which is true in
some ways-what one should not do if he
wishes to avoid becoming a bankrupt.
I may express the opinion, honourable
senators, that under the provisions of the
bill, and under summary administration
provisions as they exist, should you face
possible bankruptcy and still want to go
your way, if you operate within the limits
provided, you may still be able to escape
without ever being designated a bankrupt and
with some orderly consolidation of your debts,
under the auspices of the court, where you
can have them worked out.
There is one limitation in this. Under the
bill, if you ever get to the position where
you corne to the clerk of the court for a
consolidation of indebtedness, thereafter, and
until you have paid all your debts, you must
not incur more than $200 of new debts. That
puts a check-rein on the debtor. He can
take one plunge and go quite a distance, but
then he has to stay within the somewhat
definite limits until he has paid his debts;
otherwise, the consolidation order goes by
the board and he is exposed to the full
provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.
Since the word bankruptcy has been thrown
around in this place and elsewhere, with
secondary meanings, and even with fifth and
sixth meanings, I think I should point out
that the Bankruptcy Act is a nonpolitical
statute. It deals with assets and liabilities of
individuals and corporations and relates not
at all to politics. It does not cover, nor has it
jurisdiction in relation to, ideas or policies
or parties.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask whether there
is any provision for the payment of the clerk
or does he perform his services free?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think there is, but I
did not go into detail of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is rather an important
point.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, what the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) said in conclusion
is very true. A few days ago the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) said that
part of that mass of legislation which comes
before Parliament every session has no political implications or connotation. Certainly
this is a measure of that character. This is
a bill with which the Senate is able to deal
effectively, as we can give it the kind of

study it needs. Having listened to the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
and, indeed, to the sponsor of the bill (Hon.
Mr. Higgins), I think we all realize that we
can give the bill the kind of study it
deserves.
It was interesting to hear the sponsor of
the bill say that part of the reason for this
legislation arises from the fact that legislation
of this character in Alberta was found to be
ultra vires of the provincial legislature.
Honourable senators who come from the
province of Quebec know that there is on
the statute books of that province, and has
been for many years, legislation called the
Lacombe Law. That law has an effect very
similar to this. I wonder if the officials in
the bankruptcy office could enlighten us as
to why the Alberta legislation might have
been ultra vires and why this Quebec legislation-with which I was at one time reasonably familiar but about which I have forgotten a good deal-is not ultra vires.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: May I remind the honourable senator that the Manitoba law was
passed in 1952. It would be in force still if
it were not for the fact that Alberta passed
an act in 1957 or thereabouts and got suspicious about its validity, and it went to the
Supreme Court of Canada. If the Alberta
legislation had not gone before the Supreme
Court of Canada, the Alberta and the Manitoba acts would be in full force now. I did
not wish to mention the Lacombe Law, as
it is still in existence, but it still can be
brought before the Supreme Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): That is
right. It is a matter which might well be
raised in committee. There may be things
about provincial legislation which, with appropriate amendments, might make it intra
vires of the provinces.
I do not wish to take up the time of
honourable senators with details, but I should
like to suggest a few considerations for the
chairman of the committee and for the witnesses who corne to explain the measure we
have before us.
For example, subsection (1)(b) of section
176 refers to the fact that at the first meeting
the clerk will settle the amount to be paid
into court by the debtor. This may well be
the kind of summary treatment of the statement of debts to which the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) referred.
I would think that the settlement of an
amount of that kind might well abide a
meeting of the creditors and, indeed, if inspectors are to be appointed, a meeting of the
inspectors themselves.
Furthermore, despite the fact that this bill
deals with small estates, there would be great

OCTOBER 16, 1962
advantage, in the interests of the proper
administration of legislation of this kind, in
having a publication in a local paper of the
fact that an application had been made for a
consolidation order.
I am also a little concerned about the restrictive character of section 177, whereby a
creditor is allowed to make certain objections to the matter that is filed by the debtor.
It is a restrictive right that he has; and,
without asking honourable senators to look at
the section now, I would suggest, for the consideration of the committee, that not only
should the items mentioned in section 177(1)
be availed of for criticism by the creditor,
but also any of the matters set forth in the
debtor's affidavit as prescribed by section
175(2).
Speaking again to section 177, I would hope
also that not only should the objections of
creditors be sent to the debtor, but that also
a copy of the petition should be sent to the
debtor, so that if there is to be a hearing
on the question of a petition, the person who
is concerned should know exactly what the
petition is and the words in which it is set
out.
I suppose the sanction that is provided
where it is required to make the consolidation order effective-and the consolidation
order is referred to in section 181-is that
if further debts are incurred, then the provisions of section 189 apply and an amending
consolidation order can be made.
I do think, however, that what the senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has said
about the importance of inspectors is a very
important consideration, and I would hope
that the committee would give serious attention to the provision of inspectors in cases
where they might be required. At least, an
option should be given either to the meeting
of the creditors or to the bankruptcy official
who deals with the application to decide
whether in a given case inspectors should be
appointed.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I answer the question raised by the senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)?
In section 196(b) it is provided that the
Governor in Council may make regulations
"prescribing fees to be paid under this Part".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. May I ask the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) if it
would not be possible to use the trustees in
bankruptcy rather than the registrar in bankruptcy? I suppose registrars are usually established in the capitals of provinces, perhaps
some distance away, while the trustees in
bankruptcy, who are registered under the act,
may be found in various localities of the

province. Would it not be possible to use them,
as we do now, rather than the clerk of the
court?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The objection has been
that co-operating trustees who do not have
to put up a deposit and have no inspectors to
check them have, in instances, collaborated
with the debtor. If you are going to make
concessions to certain classes of debtors, then
you must place the administration in hands
that are not likely to be approachable for the
benefit of the debtor. In other words, you
must ensure that they are going to hew to
the line. The moment you put in a trustee and
require a deposit, you might as well leave it
under the act as it is. I suggested the registrar of the court because he is in that category and has infinitely more experience than
the clerk of any district court or county
court throughout Canada.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I
move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. A. T. Brooks: May I make one statement before the honourable senator adjourns
the debate?
After listening to honourable senators who
have spoken, I think we all realize that an
amendment to the Bankruptcy Act is needed
and it has come in very good time. I also
think that the suggestion of the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
that we should take the time to call witnesses,
perhaps from the different provinces, is a
good one. I think we are fortunate in having
Senator Hayden as chairman of our Banking and Commerce Committee, for he took
such an active part in forming this act some
years ago.
I noted that the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) suggested
using trustees in bankruptcy instead of
registrars. I also noted the objection raised
by the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) at the beginning of his
speech.
The clerks of our county and district courts,
I think we all agree, are very responsible
men. Whether we have a clerk of a county
court or a district court, or a clerk of the
Court of Queen's Bench, we certainly have a
responsible person. It would seem to me that
possibly the idea was to decentralize bankruptcy proceedings from the capitals of the
provinces. A county court official, for instance,
would know the bankrupt, he would know his
creditors, and so on. I am merely mentioning
these as some of the possible reasons why
the legislation has been drafted in this way.
This is a nonpolitical bill, and I would
be very pleased to have it go before the

SENATE
Banking and Commerce Committee for consideration. I am sure a satisfactory time can
be arranged for the purpose of bringing in
witnesses from outside.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I still wish to move the
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I did not mean to interrupt the honourable senator; I just wanted to
make that explanation before the debate was
adjourned.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, the Lacombe Law of the province of
Quebec has been mentioned, and I just want
to make an explanation.
In Quebec, if you have a debt, you can
attach a man's salary. The only purpose of
the Lacombe Law is to make a distribution of
the salary. It does not take into account any
other goods the man may have, only that part
of his salary, which may be attached, and
which is then distributed by the clerk of the
court. If a man wishes to go bankrupt, the
Lacombe Law does not prevent it, nor does
it prevent seizing any of his property if he
has any. The Lacombe Law applies only to a
man's salary, and to nothing else.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: What is the maximum
exemption of his salary?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It usually depends
upon the amount of the salary. In certain
cases only one-third is seizable. In other
cases it may be only one-quarter. I do not
think it goes any further. It also depends
on the man's family. It is only a part of the
salary which can be seized and is distributable. He has to make a deposit with the
clerk, and only that part of his salary is distributed.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Is that similar to garnishee proceedings?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No, it is completely different. It has nothing to do with bankruptcy
at all. It is one good way of making a distribution of a man's earnings which can be
attached, that is all; it does not touch anything else.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask if the sponsor
of the bill (Hon. Mr. Higgins) has the reference to the law reports when the act of the
province of Alberta came before the Supreme
Court of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: No, I have not. It is in
the 1960 reports.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, debate adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
THE

EASTERN TRUST COMPANY-SECOND
READING

. Hon. Donald Smith moved the second reading of Bill S-5, respecting The Eastern Trust
Company.
He said: Honourable senators will see that
the bill is a very simple one, its sole purpose
being to add a French version of the name of
The Eastern Trust Company. It provides that
the company may use in the transaction of
its business either the name "The Eastern
Trust Company" or "Le Trust de l'Est Canadien".
This is one of a number of similar bills
that have come before us in the last few
years. Another such bill was given its first
stage of passage through the Senate this
evening. I think it is a trend which we will
see more of as time passes.
It might be of interest to honourable senators if I were to indicate that this is not
an ordinary trust company; this is a Nova
Scotian trust company which was incorporated in 1893. It has continued to be a
Nova Scotian company in so far as its directors are concerned, in that its president and
fourteen directors out of twenty-six in all,
are Nova Scotians. Many of them are quite
well known to those of us from our province
who sit in this chamber. My honourable friend
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) may be
interested to know that three of the directors
are from his province of New Brunswick.
The company is one of some magnitude in
our province, where a million dollars is a
lot of money. The total assets under the
administration of The Eastern Trust Company, according to its last report, amounted
to $288 million. The company is growing
very rapidly because its volume of business
has more than doubled in the last ten-year
period; and as an indication of the way in
which the resources of the company have
continued to be managed, I might mention in
passing that the company has a consecutive
dividend record for sixty-eight years.
It is of national importance too, because
there are thirteen branches in Canada; all
provinces are served with the exception of
Saskatchewan. I do not know the reason for
the one exception, but I think it might be
remedied in the near future.
In view of the extensive operations of the
company, it does seem proper to have a

OCTOBER 16, 1962
French version of its name to use in the
growing services to the French-speaking
areas of Canada.
If the bill receives second reading, I
propose to move that it be referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

DIVORCE
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE-MOTION
FOR ADOPTION
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the

Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 2 to 306.
He said: As honourable senators will observe, these 305 reports are on the table for
any honourable senator to read.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall these reports be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With the consent of the
house, I move that the reports be considered
now. Perhaps I may make some remarks in
connection with them at this point.
These are the cases in which bills were
passed by this house at the last session. They
then went to the House of Commons and,
as honourable senators will remember, they
died on the Order Paper-327 of them.

These are the cases that have not been
settled, including one in which the respondent
is now deceased, another in which a petitioner
has decided not to proceed, and some 19
in which the petitioners have not complied
with the requirements of continuance. So
there are 325 that are ready now to be reprocessed and sent over to the House of
Commons.
I should say a word about the way this
has been handled, at very considerable expenditure of time and with much difficulty.
We passed a resolution, the vital point of
which is:
Resolved to report recommending that
the Parliamentary fees paid upon the
petitions at the last session apply to the
petitions of this session without further
payment, and that the advertising and
service made for the last session be
accepted as sufficient compliance with the
Rules for the present session.
That was done in a general way because
there was no desire to make fish of one and
flesh of another. The rule will apply to all
alike, but each case has been handled
individually because there is a separate bill
for each one which becomes a separate act
of Parliament.
We gave notice to the parties immediately
after the last session that at the beginning of
this session, if they wished to proceed, they
would have to notify us to that effect. In
every one of these cases you will find a
request that reads in these words:
Please be advised that your petitioner
desires to proceed with the said Petition
and Prayer contained therein.
A good many months have gone by since
the petition was first presented and the
evidence taken, and therefore care has to be
taken to see that we do not cause a bill of
divorce to be enacted where the parties have
come together and the offence bas been condoned, and thus interfere rather than help.
In each one of these cases you will find a
solemn declaration which reads as follows:
1. That I am the Petitioner named in
the above mentioned petition.
2. That I have not since the date of
my declaration verifying the said petition
condoned the marital offence or offences
of the Respondent which I have alleged
therein, nor have I since the said date
had marital relations or lived or cohabited
with the said Respondent.
And I make this solemn declaration
conscientiously believing it to be true,
knowing that it is of the same force and
effect as if made under oath, and by
virtue of the Canada Evidence Act.

OCTOBER 17, 1962
A solemn declaration in similar words will
be found attached to each one of these
reports.
The committee then in each case reports
as follows:
The Committee flnd that during the
last session of Parliament a Bill of
Divorce in this matter was recommended
by the Committee and passed by the
Senate, but owing to dissolution of Parliament the proceedings on the bull were
flot completed.
The Committee again recommends the
passage of an act ta dissolve the said
marriage based an the evîdence adduced
before the Com-mittee at the last session,
which evidence is submitted herewith.
The Committee recommend that the
Parliamentary fees paid upon the -petition at the last session apply ta the
petition of this session without further
payment, and that the advertising and
service made for the last session be
accepted as sufficient compliance with
the rules for the present session.
I can assure the house that each one of these
305 cases has been examined and re-processed, and in each report there will be found
that solemn declaration as ta noncondonation, and a request fromn the petitioner that he
or she wishes ta proceed.
I move the adoption of these 305 reports.
The Hon. the Speaker: With leave of the
Senate it is maved by the honourable Senator
Roebuck, seconded by the honourable Senator Croil, that divorce reports Nos. 2 ta 306,
bath inclusive, be naw adopted. Is it your
pleasure, hanourable senatars, ta adapt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Next sitting.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: Why does the honourable senator say that? Does he wish ta look
inta them?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I do nat wish ta be
unpleasant ta my hanourable friend, but I
missed some parts of his remarks, and I
wauld like ta be able ta read themn before
giving my assent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I repeat themn ta
you naw?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. I missed something,
and I want ta read the honourable senatar's
remarks quietly in my office. Next sitting.
The Hon. the. Speaker: Next sitting.
CONFEDERATION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, rnay I draw your attention ta sorne

valuable publications that have been issued
by the Queen's Printer, and which are available ta ail. I refer to the French and English
editian of the Debates of Conj'ederation of
1865. That book is out of print now, but a

Bureau and I arn sure that each one of you
would like ta have it, if you do nat have it
already.
I hold in rny hand the O'Connor Report,
which has been published also in French and
English. It cantains much data of interest
and especially the up-ta-date jurisprudence
on canstitutional cases.
There is also another book which has been
published in bath languages, entitled The
British North America Acts and Consolidated
Statutes of 1867-1962 by Dr. Maurice Ollivier,
Parliamentary Counsel of the House of
Commons.
I ar nfot tao insistent about it, but these
are books which are available ta you upon
request and free of charge and I arn sure
you would like ta have them for reference in
your own studies.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 11, consideratian of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the apening
of the session, and the motion of Han. Mr.
Haig, seconded by Han. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. M. Gratian O'Leary: Honaurable
senators, may I first add very hurnbly rny
congratulations ta those that have been
offered to His Honour the new Speaker of
the Senate, and ta the new Leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Brooks).
May I also add my condolences ta those
which have been offered the Leader on the
ather side (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford)
on the sorrow which came ta him last week.
I should like to thank also all those
honourable senators on bath sides who have
given me such a cordial and kindly welcorne
here. I would like ta acknowledge especially
the exaggerated tributes paid ta me by the
Leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Brooks), by
my long-time friend, the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford),
and by my old and very dear friend the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). I can only say this to them, that
it happens often in life that biographers are
far greater than the subjects of their biographies. It is in that spirit that I accept the
kindly things they have said about me.

SENATE
Honourable senators, while I rise here with
a mixture of awe and wonder to address this
house, I still would like to remind you that
my connection with the Senate, indirectly, at
any rate, or in a small way, has been a very
lengthy one. I notice that the senior member
of the Senate was appointed back in 1926.
Well, fourteen years before that, as a young
reporter I was reporting and watching the
proceedings of this house.
I remember the days when Sir Richard
Cartwright was Government leader, and I
have a very vivid recollection of Sir George
Ross being brought into this chamber in a
wheelchair, and speaking powerfully and
dramatically from that wheelchair against Sir
Robert Borden's naval aid bill of 1912-a
speech which in fact resulted in the bill's
rejection. Then on through the years I knew,
and remember well, many other famous
figures of this house: Raoul Dandurand;
Charles Beaubien; Frederick Béique-a man
of massive intelligence; Sir James Lougheed;
my long-time friend, my hero of public life,
Arthur Meighen, and many another-men
who have given or gave to this chamber its
memoried greatness, its old and just renown.
Honourable senators, there is something I
would like to say to you, if you will permit
me to do so. I was told on coming here that
I was now coming to an atmosphere of relaxed
and civilized sophistication. I was assured
that the strident partisanship of another
house-and they added, rather slyly, the
strident partisanship of a certain editorial
page in this country-had no place or bearing
in a chamber such as this. Honourable
senators, I think I should confess to you at
once that I shall find difficulty in adjusting
myself to an atmosphere of that kind. I am
a party man, I am a partisan, I am a Conservative without prefix or qualifications.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): I believe in
the two-party system. More than that, I believe that much of the political uncertainty
and instability in this country at the present
time stems from the fact that too many
Canadians have forgotten what the party
system is about, and too many Canadians
have gone about year after year scoffing at
it and deriding it. I think it is an interesting
reflection that for one hundred years, from
the day of Lincoln to the present time, the
United States has managed to maintain its
major two-party system and bas fought off
all challengers to that system by third parties,
by splinter parties, by groups or by factions.
I think that the reason may be found in the
fact that the American people, the leaders

of public opinion in the United States, understood what their two-party system meant and
were resolved to maintain it.
I myself have gone to a number of political
party conventions in the United States. The
last one I attended was in Philadelphia, in
1948. It was a Republican convention. There
were, of course, the usual antics which we
Canadians have a habit of decrying, but,
honourable senators, on the floor of that
convention as ordinary delegates were the
presidents of sixteen American universities,
the leaders of the professions, the leaders in
law, in industry and in commerce. At a convention a few years before there was a
spectacle of that great and distinguished lawyer, John W. Davis, sitting, not on the platform but on the floor of that convention
taking an active part in the routine proceedings.
Honourable senators, I have attended many
conventions in Canada, going back to the
days when I was a young reporter-in the
days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier-and I have
not seen on the floor as delegates the leaders
of our professions, the leaders of the Bar in
Canada, our eminent bankers, or our great
captains of industry, although afterwards they
were heard to condemn politics, to decry
politicians and public men. This, honourable
senators, I believe firmly has been in large
measure responsible for the cynicism regarding parties and politicians and public men
which exists among our young people in this
country. The oldsters have simply not set
them an example.
And while I am condemning businessmen, I
am not going to forget my own profession.
Thomas D'Arcy McGee once pointed out that
at the time of Confederation there were one
hundred public journals in this nation discussing politics and public affairs. Well, we
have more than one hundred daily newspapers
in Canada at the present time, but I ask you
to look over their political designations and
I venture to say that ninety of the one hundred would put themselves down as independent, which in most cases means that they
are merely neutral, that they have no opinions
at all and are afraid to stand up and be
counted.
A few years ago I was vacationing in a
certain province of this country where a
provincial election was being held. I was
anxious to find out what the election was
about and so every morning I studied the
editorial page of the leading newspaper in
that province. For three weeks not a single
reference appeared on that editorial page
about the election, but on the day before the
voting that particular paper carried a long
editorial on the fate of democracy in Bulgaria.

OCTOBER 17. 1962
Honourable senators, I repeat, I am a
Conservative without prefix, without qualifications, and I do not believe that this chamber
or any other chamber in the world could
give to legislation the true, objective, ethical
examination it should have unless the members of that legislature or chamber did hold
those definite political opinions. Surely it is
only a matter of applying your philosophy,
of trying to adapt your philosophy to the
legislation in question. I am going to have a
few words to say later about something that
was said the other day by the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford). One thing I want to make clear is that
I have not come into this chamber to turn
myself into a political eunuch, and I have no
intention ever of running about with those
people with open minds, some of their minds
so open that their brains fall out.
We hear much about the business of
democracy, the principle of democracy, being
the right of choice. Well, it is the right of
choice, but also, and more important, it is
the burden of choice, the responsibility of
standing up and being counted, and I think
that in a forum such as this there should be
some opportunity for education for our young
people in Canada about their responsibilities
and about what parties mean to this country.
As for myself, I wish to God sometimes I
had time to instruct some of our newspaper
people on what the party system has meant
to the press. Had it not been for the party
system in England the so-called free press
would not have existed at all.
And now, honourable senators, I should,
I suppose, come to the Speech from the
Throne which is the main subject of the
motion before the house.
About the address I only want to say this:
I think that we can only consider the Speech
from the Throne in a realistic or useful way
when the legislation which stems from it
comes before this house.
I know it has been said we have to give
special attention to legislation coming before
us because it may be minority legislation,
and I shall have something to say about that
later on.
I have been meeting people in this chamber
and I have been meeting people in the city
who say they find the Speech from the Throne
dull. They say, "We don't find anything new
in it, there is nothing startling, there is
nothing to excite the people of Canada."
Honourable senators, I wonder what people
want in a Speech from the Throne. Do they
honestly believe that any government, Liberal,
Conservative or of any other ideological
stripe, can at this time in the context of our

world come forth with a program guaranteed
to cure quickly all the ills that afflict us?
This has become one of the prevalent
superstitions of our time, the superstition that
a government has the power and capacity to
bring in legislation today or tomorrow that
is going to relieve us not only of the difficulties which beset us as a people, but cover
up all our individual foibles, our individual
faults, and our individual failures.
This, I say, is one of the superstitions of
our time and it is an evil superstition. It is a
superstition which, believing that the Government is some great white father who can
bring manna from Heaven for all of us, is
sapping the vitality and the life of this
country, and I am afraid sapping the vitality
of the nation itself.
I myself am always amazed at the things
Government can do, at the things they have
done over the past five years. When I look
at the program of the Government I am
truly amazed at what they have been able
to do. However, my amazement is almost
equal when I see how little they have been
able to accomplish in telling the public what
they have done. This is one of the most
curious things about this Government. Active
in every way, vigorous in every way, they
seem to have been completely inarticulate
when they came to telling the people of
Canada just what they had done. I do not
know, I do not think any man in this
country is wise enough to know, what could
be done at the present time to relieve, to
cure, so many of the ills that are afflicting
us. There are no economie wonder drugs to
cure quickly all the lls of Canada at the
present time; and any party, any government, which comes and tells the people of
this country that they have the answer to
all our problems are not play.ing fair with
the Canadian people, and are laying up
trouble not only for themselves but for the
whole democratic system.
I leave that and I come for a moment
to something that was said the other day
by my esteemed and revered friend, the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, Brantford). Incidentally, I
must say that he showed himself to be a
most delightful partisan when he spoke. I
was intrigued by the joyousness with which
he told us how in the last election his party
had won an overwhelming victory and how
our party had suffered an overwhelming defeat. I must say that the alchemy of his
thought and the processes of his logic by
which he reached this conclusion were a bit
staggering. He said that 63 per cent of the
people had failed to vote for the Conservatives, and that was a catastrophic defeat; that

SENATE
63 per cent had failed to vote for the
Liberals, and that was a glorious victory!
What intrigued me even more was his statement that because of the situation which
now exists in the House of Commons he and
his fellow senators-and he gave this advice
ta all of us-must proceed ta treat legislation
coming before us here in a different way, to
give it a sharper examination and to look at
it in a different light because, he said, it
would be "minority legislation." The honourable senator from Gormley (Hon. Mr.
McCutcheon) answered this, I thought, effectively the other day; but there is something
else I would like ta say.
Why all this wonderment, why all this
amazement about what is called "minority
government"? There is nothing strange, nothing new, nothing mysterious about minority
government. In the very fatherland of parliamentary government they have had minority
governments again and again. Mr. Pitt governed England for many years; be never had
an organized parliamentary majority behind
him. In the 1890's Mr. Gladstone had two
governments that were in a minority-actually
dependent on the Irish Nationalists of Mr.
Parnell. I see that my most esteemed friend
shakes his head; but we can discuss that
some other day. Of course, there is in Canada
a classic example, that of Mr. Mackenzie King.
So what is all this worry about now? I do
not think minority governments are good,
but they are not so desperate that legislation
emanating frorn the House of Commons at
this time must be looked at in a special light.
As the honourable senator from Gormley
(Hon. Mr. McCutcheon) pointed out, there can
be no such thing as minority legislation. If it
were minority legislation, it would never
come before us at all. It has ta have the
support of the majority, and if it comes
here with the support of the majority, are
we going to look at it and say that the test
you should apply to this legislation is: who
voted for it in the other house; what were
the political labels of the people who gave
it a majority vote? Surely that would reduce
this chamber ta an absurdity.
The honourable leader then discussed the
Common Market. This is a pet subject of
mine, and I was delighted to hear him on
it. I was glad that he mentioned the Common
Market, because it gives me an opportunity
ta say things I think should be said in this
house.
One of the first things that should be saidand I do not say it off ensively-is that in
Canada discussion of the Common Market
has been almost wholly illiterate. Most of
the people who were criticizing the Common
Market had not taken the trouble to find out

what it was about. When one spoke to them
about the Rome Treaty, judging by their
comments some seemed ta think this was a
pact between Pope John and the Archbishop
of Canterbury.
What is the Common Market? Primarily it
is a political instrument seeking political
union in Europe, through the devices of fiscal
and economic measures. If anyone doubts
that, I would advise him ta read what was said
only three days ago by Mr. Macmillan, the
Prime Minister of England, or ta read Mr.
Spaak; and if that does not convince him
that this is a political instrument, a political
organization, first, last and all the time, then
let him read what was said about it last week
by Professor Hallstein, who bas been and is
today the chief architect of the Common
Market.
However, honourable senators, I am not
concerned with that; that is not Canada's
concern. What I am concerned with is the
position of Canada with respect ta the
Common Market. There are people in England, like Professor Harrod, the distinguished
economist at Oxford and the biographer of
John Maynard Keynes, who hold with force
and vigour that the Common Market is a
statistical illusion. There are men like Professor Jay who hold the same view; and
there are in England deep thinkers like
Sir Arthur Bryant, who believe that if
England joins the Common Market this will
be a retreat from greatness, this will be an
apostasy of England's past, and this will be
a sale of the commonwealth birthright for
an uncertain mess of pottage. I am concerned
with the misrepresentation, the confusion and
the distortion of the position of the Government of Canada with respect ta the Common
Market that have arisen in this country over
the last year.
Let us see what has happened; let us go
back through the record-and I shall do it
very briefly. When, two years ago, the
British Government decided they should
explore the possibility of their joining the
Common Market they came ta us and askedas they had a duty ta do, because we are a
commonwealth partner-whether we had any
opinions to offer. Well, we did have opinions
to offer, and there was a meeting at Accra.
You know what happened there.
We went to Accra as a commonwealth
partner with other members of the Commonwealth ta tell the British ministers what we
thought might happen if Britain joined the
Common Market, or joined it without safeguards for our particular trade. And what
happened in this country? There was an outcry, "How dare Canadian ministers go ta
Accra and talk that way ta British ministers?"
This was the mood and this was the spirit.

OCTOBER 17, 1962
We were firing on the Guards. And our
press, including even some of our Conservative press, joined in this hue and cry.
Now, honourable senators, I am quite well
aware that there are a few remaining people
in this country still wet with the spray of
the deluge, who think that if it is raining
in the Strand we ought to turn up our trouser
legs on Sparks street. But what are we to
say of informed public men using nonsensical
arguments like that, telling the house, of
course Canadian trade will be affected, of
course there will be injury to $700 million
worth of exports, but we must let the British
decide? But the British, to give them credit,
did not say that. After Accra they went back
to the British Parliament for a mandate, for
power to go to Brussels and see what they
could do. This is the resolution that was
passed by the British House of Commons on
August 3, 1961, and I would ask you to listen
carefully to the wording of it because it
comes into my argument later:
That this house supports the decision
of Her Majesty's Government to make
formal application under Article 237 of
the Treaty of Rome in order to initiate
negotiations to see if satisfactory arrangements can be made to meet the
special interests of the United Kingdom,
of the Commonwealth, and of the
European free trade association; and
further accepts the undertaking of Her
Majesty's Government that no agreement
affecting these special interests or involving British sovereignty will be
entered into until it has been approved
by this house after full consultation with
other Commonwealth countries, by whatever procedure they may generally agree.
Now that was the mandate they got. That
was the undertaking they gave, that nothing
would formally be done until they consulted
with the Commonwealth, and the manner of
consultation subsequently agreed upon was
the Prime Ministers' Conference held in England two months ago.
In the light of the resolution passed by
the British House of Commons and the
authority that Mr. Macmillan and his ministers had, who will argue that Canada had
no right to have its Prime Minister at this
conference? That is why the conference was
called, to get a progress report or an interim
report up to that time. British ministers had
been assuring us repeatedly that nothing
would be done to affect adversely the vital
interests of the Commonwealth. Mr. Duncan
Sandys at the Conservative party conference
put his hand over his heart and said, "I
will swear I will leave British public life
before anything is done to adversely affect
27511-5-7

the vital interests of the Commonwealth."
Mr. Macmillan gave us a pledge that if there
was a choice between the Commonwealth and
the Common Market there was no doubt
where he stood. He is not talking exactly that
way now, but that is the pledge he gave.
Incidentally, before I forget it, there was
a communiqué put out some weeks ago, after
the Prime Ministers' Conference, which contained certain statements signed by Her
Majesty's Government in Britain. I ask you
to read that communiqué and then read the
discussion that took place the other day at
the Conservative party conference in Wales"E.E.C. or bust". That was the spirit of that
conference. There was nothing about Commonwealth vital interest. And in the speech
by Mr. Heath, which was described by Mr.
Justice Frankfurter as the finest speech in
structure of modern times, what does he say?
I have here the exact quotation, and this
is almost unbelievable in the light of what
has happened since. He said that "under no
circumstances can we enter the Common
Market unless the vital interests of the Commonwealth partners are protected."
Now in those circumstances, surely it became not only the right but the duty of the
Prime Minister of Canada to go to this conference and see how far we could go. That
is what happened.
But what was happening over here while
Mr. Diefenbaker was in London? Over here
an effort was made to stab Mr. Diefenbaker
in the back. Everybody knows that. I have
the proof of it right down in my office. I can
show you that on the very day when two
scurrilous journalists in London, one unfortunately on the old London Observer, the
old organ of J. L. Garvin, and the other the
London Daily Telegraph-What were they
saying about Mr. Diefenbaker? The London
Observer, of all papers, said Mr. Diefenbaker
was speaking for "yokels on the prairies".
Honourable senators, those "yokels on the
prairies" are the people of whom Kipling
wrote after the First World War:
From little towns in a far land we came,
To save our honour and a world aflame.
Then the Observer went on to speak of Mr.
Menzies and said Menzies was followed by
an array-I think the writer used the word
"horde"-of Africans and Asians. This is the
spirit of the Empire prevailing in London
by those who are trying to isolate Mr. Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister of Canada, from
the others.
On the very day those attacks appeared
in the London Sunday press, other London

SENATE
Sunday papers were heavy with headlines
from Canada of what other people in Canada
thought of Mr. Diefenbaker.
Since when has it become the policy of
the Liberal party of Canada that matters
affecting the jobs and lives and property of
Canadian people should be left to the decisions
of Whitehall and the bureaucrats in Brussels?
That is the policy, and I have mountains of
quotations to prove it. This will, of course,
be denied, and the Leader of the Opposition
will be in a position of being able to quote
himself on all sides. He began by saying,
"Why don't we join with Britain?" And
having been told that this could not happen,
be said, "Let us have an Atlantic trade community". And when the President of the
United States knocked that into a cocked
hat, he then proceeds to say, "We will take
in everyone". And when the Prime Minister
of Canada comes home to Canada and says
we have something of that kind, Mr. Pearson
gets up and sneers at him.
I know, or I believe I know, that Britain
is going to join the Common Market. I think
it is a sad thing that ministers of a British
government should come to this country over
the period of a year and give the unqualified
pledges they gave to the Government and
people of Canada and now simply disregard
them. This is the truth, and it cannot be
denied. As I said a moment ago, look at the
communiqué issued by the Prime Ministers'
Conference, and compare that with the
speeches made in Wales the other day. If
that is not an exercise in cynicism, then I
do not know what it is.
You may ask: What do you believe in?
Well, what I believe in is this, that if Britain
joins the Common Market we must find trade
wherever we can find it, and I think that the
Prime Minister bas put forward a program
that is capable of being worked out.
Something was said by the honourable
senator who leads the other side of this bouse
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) about a
growing distrust in Canada and a loss of
faith in this country. He quoted two examples
and then proceeded to argue from the
particular to the general, and to say that if
these two institutions have lost confidence
then all others must have lost it too.
Honourable senators, I have been reading
and studying the debates of the other place
on this so-called loss of confidence in Canada.
One of the reasons given was that the Prime
Minister during the last election withheld
the truth from the Canadian people. Now,
this is a most serious charge. It is called,
as a matter of fact, by the people making it,
a major fraud. This is very strong language.
I recall in the days of Sir Robert Borden,

when he said that a certain statement of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier lacked the essential elements of truth, a lot of people were shocked.
They now use a five-letter word-fraud. I
think that that sort of language, and that
sort of charge, without substantial evidence
behind it, is another reason why the young
people of this country are losing faith in our
party system.
I spoke of evidence. I am looking across
this chamber and I see before me, not only
four of the most famous senators, but
four of the most famous lawyers in Canada.
These honourable gentlemen surely know the
rules of evidence. I ask them to go over the
debates of the other place and to read the
charges that have been made there, and then
ask themselves if any of these charges are
supported by what they regard as admissible
evidence. There is conjecture, suspicion, and
so on and so forth, but there is nothing
concrete to say that a certain person on a
certain occasion did something that has
brought about a loss of trust in the Government.
One of my famous ancestors who bears
my name, John O'Leary, an old Irish revolutionary, once told W. B. Yeats that there
were some things that a gentleman would
not do for his country. Honourable senators,
there are some things that politicians may
not do for their party, and one of them, I
submit, is going about the highways and
byways charging major fraud unless they
are able to back up the charge with evidence.
I am willing to look at the truth. I have
looked at these charges. I have examined
them as objectively as I could, and nowhere
could I find a shred of evidence to back
them up.

The other day the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford)
said, "There is a lack of trust in Canadian
business". I often wonder if those people who
are going about at this time talking about
Canada being in stagnation and talking about
the wasted years ever read the financial
pages of their own newspapers. Is there to be
seen on the financial pages of the morning
papers any evidence that Canada is going to
the dogs? What is to be seen there is the
precise opposite.

In the Liberal party at the present time
there is an economic prophet, a Mr. Walter
Gordon, who, honourable senators will recall, headed the Royal Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects. At the close of the
report of that royal commission Mr. Gordon
and his associates went into the realm of
astrology and presumed to horoscope what
would happen to Canada in the next twentyfive years. It is well known that one of the
things predicted was that by 1965 the gross

OCTOBER 17, 1962
national product of Canada would reach
$39.5 billion. Honourable senators, do you
know what the gross national product is
now? In 1962 it stands at $39.4 billion, and
there are stili three years to go. The per
capita gain in the gross national product
since 1957 has been $63 annually. Such facts
absolutely upset ail these nonsensical things
that are being said.
Unemployment-oh, yes, it has been bad,
worse than it should be. In August of this
year unemployment in this country stood at
4.1 per cent. Mr. Gordon, in his report, quoted
some of the leadîng authorities in the world
as saying that when you get to 4 per cent
you have practically no unemployment. Do
rou realize that unemployment on the prairies
is down to 1.6 per cent, and that the highest
unemployment in this country is in the Maritime provinces, where it is 6 per cent? If
you look at the New York Times of yesterday you will see that in the great state of
Pennsylvania unemployxnent at the present
time is 6.3 per cent.
What is the worry about? Ail they say is:
you have devalued the dollar. Is there anything remarkable about that? Over the past
ten years seventy countries have devalued
their currencies. Japan is a prosperous nation
and we hear every day of its prosperity, but
it is trying right now to devalue its currency. England is in trouble, and the 'United
States is also having trouble. This has nothing to do with the basic prosperity of this
country. Our fields, our forests, our mines,
our nickel, our aluminum and our asbestos
are all there. They have not gone away. Do
you think the sophisticated investors of the
world are not aware of all this? Do you thinc
that they are not aware of Canada's position?
Or do you think that they have, in fact, lost
faith in us? We know it is flot true to say
they have lost faith in us. We know it is flot
true because we have more respect for the
knowledge and the intelligence of the people
whose business it is to find out about these
things.
Honourable senators, I have wandered too
long, and I arn about to make an end, but
there is just one more thing I would like to
say. While I say to you that everything in

27511-5-7j

Canada is reasonably prosperous, I would not;
like to conclude by saying that everything in
Canada is well and that everything in Canada
is going to be well. 1 think that we are in
for some hard, stormy weather ahead. That
is the kind of world we are in. Matthew
Arnold once wrote a striking couplet: "Standing between two worlds, one dead and the
other struggling to be born." In the context
of that new world, the world that is struggling to be born today, in a world in torment;
of transition, in a world where peace seems
to be but a pause to identify the enemy, we
must be prepared for difficulties, regardless
of the kind of government we have. I do not;
think any government can ever be powerful
enough or wise enough to meet ahl the difficulties which we shaîl encounter in the next
ten or twenty years.
We must rid ourselves of this fatal illusion
that security and prosperity can be achieved
without toil and without sacrifice. It may be
that over the past twenty years we have had
too much sail on the ship. I wonder how often
Canadian people sit down and try to understand the significance of this, that since World
War II we have spent roughly $30 billion on
defence. If that does not give us cause for
thought, we are not worthy of our democratic
heritage.
1 think it is true that we are living not
merely on our financial. capital, but on our
spiritual capital as well. Fifty or more years
ago James Russell Lowell warned the American people that the greatness o! a nation
must be weighed in scales more delicate than
the balance of trade. That is a warning which
is a challenge for us today. I arn convinced
that we Canadians have become ail too
obsessed with what somebody has called
"ýexpense-account civilization".
I have spoken too long and I have wandered
too much. I thank ail honourable senators for
having given me their patient and indulgent
attention. I can but hope that I have not
dimmed too much what John Morley once
called "the lamp of loyalty to reason".
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, debate

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen reported that the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications had considered Bill S-4, respecting
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, and
had directed that the bill be reported without
amendment.
Report adopted.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Walter M. Aselline: Honourable senators, I do not usually ask for favours, but
sometimes I am more or less compelled to do
so. There is some urgency about this measure in view of the fact that upon its passage
through Parliament the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company wishes to construct the
line this fall, in order to be in a position to
transport the potash that is now being manufactured at the plant. We had a very satisfactory meeting of the Transport and Communications Committee this morning on this
bill, and I hope that the chairman will say
something about it.
My purpose in rising now is to ask leave
of the Senate to move that this bill be given
third reading today. If it is not read the third

time today it will have to go over until
Tuesday night, and will not be dealt with
in the other place much before the end of next
week.
I move with leave, seconded by Honourable
Senator Hnatyshyn, that the bill be read
a third time now.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
as the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has just mentioned, we
had a very satisfactory meeting of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications this morning, and a most interesting
discussion with respect to this bill.
In form, this is a very simple bill, providing
for the building by the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company of a short branch line in
the province of Saskatchewan to a point
about 15 miles to the southeast of the village
of Bredenbury, which is on the C.P.R.'s line
between Winnipeg and Saskatoon, to service
the plant recently constructed by International
Minerals and Chemical Corporation to recover potash from that area. The total cost
of the line is estimated at about $600,000.
As I have said, this plant is situated about
15 miles away from the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company's line. The question was
raised in committee as to why this line was
necessary, inasmuch as the area is already
served by quite a short branch from the main
line of the Canadian National Railways between Winnipeg and Saskatoon. The committee was quite satisfied, I think, as to the
desirability of building this second line, not
only because it will serve a very large industry on which $40 million has been spent,
but for another reason relating to the particular product it is going to transport.
Potash, apparently, has to be shipped in
special cars called "covered hopper cars".
It is expected that, when the plant is in full
production, over one million tons of potash
will be shipped from the plant each year.
We were told that neither of the two railway companies has enough of these covered
hopper cars to meet the demands of the
industry. In other words, it will need not
only all the covered hopper cars both railways can supply, but the company will also
have to hire privately an additional supply
of these cars. That strikes me as being a good
reason why a Canadian Pacifie line should
be built there, in addition to the Canadian
National line which is there already.
We were told a most fascinating story about
this potash discovery in the province of
Saskatchewan. Apparently there is a bed of
potash extending over an area of two to three
hundred miles through the middle of Saskatchewan, sufficient to supply world demands
for potash for the next 200 years.

I am sure that the work of this committee

itself. It has done an excellent job in recent

the Senate adjourns today it do stand chairmanship of the honourable senator from

SENATE
Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power). The work this committee has done is a fine example of what
can be accomplished by Senate committees.
As honourable senators well know, the committee has been so effective that some of its
recommendations have been adopted by the
Department of Agriculture, and also have
been warmly approved by all provinces of
Canada.
Just a few days ago in the other place
the Minister of Agriculture, in presenting
his report on the ARDA program, stated how
well the report of the Special Committee on
Land Use had been received by the provinces.
He remarked that all ten provinces had
signed agreements with the federal Government. The agreements contain forty different
types of projects which are to be carried out
in each of the provinces. It was also stated
that $50 million was the maximum amount
which the federal Government had approved
for this particular work. Three years, I believe, is the time provided in which to carry
out certain pilot projects and also research.
I am sure that all honourable members feel
that the work of this committee is well worth
while and we are all satisfied that the committee should be continued for another session. Personally, I think it should be reappointed now and probably should be continued for many sessions to come.
Many changes are taking place in farming
operations in this country, as a result of
which new problems arise; and a committee
such as this can do an excellent job. To my
mind its work is linked up not only with
agriculture but with trade and commerce,
and I can see it could be very well linked
up with immigration, because the many millions of acres of empty land in Canada cannot
be left idle too long. When we think of
people starving in other countries we realize
the land of the world must be made productive to feed the people.
So, honourable senators, I can see how
a committee of this kind can do excellent
work, not only at present but for years to
come.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, when this committee was re-appointed
last session I was fearful that it might terminate with that session, and I expressed the
wish that it would be a continuing committee.
For once, I am grateful to the Government
-for continuing this committee throughout
this session. I join the Leader of the Government in the hope that the committee will continue for some time to come because there is
a great deal of work to be done with respect
to the proper use of land.
The committee has wide powers; it is
limited in no way by its terms of reference.
Last year I made certain suggestions as to

what studies the committee could undertake,
and I learned that it had given consideration
to the various subjects I had mentioned.
I remember that when the committee was
set up over seven years ago the then Prime
Minister, Mr. St. Laurent, was very interested
in its work. If I remember correctly, the late
Senator Godbout was its first chairman.
Some Hon. Senators: Senator Power.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I stand
corrected on that, but I remember that Senator Godbout's name had been mentioned as
the first chairman. He was an outstanding
agriculturist but unfortunately his death intervened, and he never became chairman. The
honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power) became the first chairman, and he was
succeeded by the honourable senator from
Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson).
The membership of the committee has been
largely the same throughout the last seven
years. As is natural, there have been a few
changes. This session there are only three new
members. They are the honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), and
two honourable senators from the Maritimes,
the senator from Madawaska-Restigouche
(Hon. Mr. Fournier) and the senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Welch).
The committee is truly representative of
the provinces right across the country. It has
done excellent work in the past, and I am
sure that it will continue to do so. Therefore,
I am most happy to associate myself with the
honourable the Leader of the Government in
seconding the motion which he has moved.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, during the last session of the Twentyfourth Parliament the Special Committee of
the Senate on Land Use held five meetings.
Though the committee had arranged for
many more witnesses to appear before it,
quite a number of those witnesses found it
difficult to make their arrangements for the
later dates; and in the meantime Parliament
was dissolved. Thus, we were unable to
bring in our final report for last session.
For that one reason it is felt this committee
should be re-formed, and that it should bring
in such a report.
Honourable senators will remember that
among the recommendations made in the report placed before this honourable body in
1961 there was one in particular, that the
committee should be reconvened each session.
As the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) has just
mentioned, it is felt the committee should be
of a continuing nature because of the tremendous amout of work that can be done
by it.

OCTOBER 18, 1962
Another recommendation the cornmittee
made was as to "the state and incidence
of rural taxation". It was feit that the coinmittee should retain a research team, or
teams, to assemble data, make a comprehensive study and report to the committee. The
steering committee feit that we should make
a study of taxation in rural areas-taxation
on woodlots, on lands adjacent to large cities,
and so on-and ascertain the effect it has on
the agricultural incorne of the different areas.
If we tackle such a program this session I
believe that we will be doing a great service
to the country and to farmers in particular,
because our study will be concerned with
taxation on lands and forests. In some areas
it has become very difficult; to keep up the net
income of the farm because of the taxation
for education alone. For that reason I believe
a study of this situation could be very effectively done by the special committee at this
time.
(Translation):
Han. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable
senators, having been a member of that
committee for several years, I arn pleased to
support the motion of the Leader of the
Government to reconvene the Land Use Comrnittee. But at this time, I arn more partieularly thinking about the farmers in eastern
Canada, and I mean those from Quebec city
to the Gaspé peninsula, as well as those in
the Maritimes. I heard industrialists, workers,
wage earners and even white collar workers
often say that farmers in that area were
paying very little if any income tax. But how
can a farmer whose income does flot; exceed
$1,200 per year pay incarne tax and support bis wif e and children?
In my opinion, the issue now is whether
we will find ways to develop our inadequately used lands, and our farms that are
too srnall. We realize that formerly the first
settiers in our country settled in the eastern
provinces. However, what can be done in this
day and age with 80- and 100-acre farms?
On the other hand, the western farmers who
came in later, are now capable of purchasing
a better farrn because they have modemn
production equiprnent, they rely on mechanization, and their equiprnent enables them to
obtain substantial crops.
I must say that I arn very happy that the
western farmers enjoy such a favourable
situation, and I arn not at ail envious, nor
jealous of them. But, when their crops are
too big and their production cannot be marketed, the Government makes advance payments to thern. On the other hand, when the
crops are very bad, the Governmnent gives
them a certain amount. When the season is

too short and snow falîs on the unharvested
crops, the Government again has subsidies
for them.
As for eastern farmers, whether they have
agood or a bad crop, they get absolutely
nothing from the governrnent, and they have
to live just the sanie.
However, there are many places in the
eastern regions, where farms could be developed and transformed so as to grow something else than fodder plants for the dairy
industry which seerns to be the main industry in the east.
The Minister of Agriculture just told the
eastern farmers, because it concernis them
especially: "If you cannot lirnit your dairy
production, we shail have to cut down the
subsidies". I wonder what will be left to them
because they will have to change their
methods and, as the senator for Carleton
(Hon. M. O'Leary) said, it is impossible to
transform the whole nation's economy in a
jiffy, in one year. In order to do so, we must
get the counsel of qualified people, theorists
as well as experts, so that we can examine
the situation thoroughly.
I wonder whether it would not be in order
to add to the motion we have before us at
the present time a paragraph stating that the
committee would have the right to direct some
of its members to undertake field studies of
certain problems, in co-operation with federal and provincial authorities, and especially
with those who are in need. The needy
often find answers of which we would neyer
have thought.
When I visit the eastern provinces, and see
what our ancestors have done for the country,
and then cross the fertile western plains, I
feel anguished for a moment, as I ask myself
what will become tornorrow of that part of
the country, our home, which was opened
first. If things continue as they are now, I
fear that a book written at sorne future date,
might well bear the titie: "The Dying Land."
However, if we are willing to recognize the
extent of the problem and, with those who
are immediately concernied, work towards its
solution, we will surely find a means of rehabilitating our farrnland by rnaking it as
fertile and beautiful as in years gone by.
Industrial rnarkets should be set Up where
farmers could seil their products. Everyone
knows that grain is being produced in western
Canada. At first an industry related to grain
production was developed, that o! cattle breeding. Packing bouses were built near those
production centres. Grain is being used toi feed
cattle sold on tbe overseas market. Everyone
knows that westerners have a better standard
o! living than easterners; why make a secret
of it? In the east, mainly in the province of

SENATE

Quebec, there is only one large centre, the
city of Montreal. One third of the Quebec
population lives in the Montreal area. There
are packing houses there, but further east,
there are very few packing houses if any.
You may not know that when the eastern
farmers wish to send livestock to the packing
house in Montreal, the average cost is from
$12 to $15 higher than that paid by the
western farmers to ship their livestock to
Montreal.
Earlier the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson) was speaking on taxation systems, or something in that line. It
seems to me it should be possible to consider
the problem as a whole, so as to find the
organizations that could help our farmers,
which would enable them not only to go in
for dairy farming and cattle breeding, but
also to promote forestry operations, and to
help those farmers to drain their lands.
In my region, in the lower St. Lawrence,
where lands are practically unproductive,
because hundreds of acres of land would have
to be drained, it is easy to realize no farmer
can achieve that all by himself. It is only
through an agreement between the federal
and the provincial governments that such
draining could be achieved and the fertility
of these lands increased. That is no pipe
dream.
Let us consider what is happening elsewhere, in Italy, for example, by the drainage
of the Pontine marshes. Those marshes extended over hundreds of acres of waste land
which, in addition, swarmed with germs and
disease-spreading insects. This project was
achieved within a year by a dictator. I am
convinced that one day, under our democratic
system, through co-operation and good sense,
without a dictatorial government, we will
successfully achieve a similar project. That
region of Italy, formerly known as Cain land,
is today one of the most fertile. This is an
example of people who made a thorough
study of the problems involved.
It is sometimes said that we, in the Senate,
are thinkers, real thinkers. Yesterday, an
honourable senator said: I am a Conservative.
Well, I am a Liberal; but we are all Canadian Senators, we represent everybody, the
whole country. If, in this committee, of which
we have been members for three or four
years, we can manage to co-operate with all
those who have looked into that problem in
order to come up with something constructive
tomorrow, then instead of writing a book

called "The Dying Land" we will be able, on
the contrary, to write one entitled "The Country Where Wheat Grows in a Living Land."
(Text):
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,

may I have just a word? I think the senator
who has just taken his seat (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) is not quite correct when he
says that all the assistance goes to western
farmers and none goes to eastern farmers. He
will recall that assistance on butter and cream
has always been held at five cents a pound
more in eastern Canada than in western
Canada, for the simple reason that the west
was supposed to be nearer to the supply of
feed. The same thing applies to the floor price
of hogs; the price has been four or five cents
higher for eastern farmers than for western
farmers. I merely want to keep the record
straight with reference to the very large
amount of money being spent to assist eastern
farmers by way of freight assistance on grain
coming to eastern Canada from western
Canada.
Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR

ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
may I, first of all, congratulate His Honour
the Speaker, and the honourable Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Brooks), on the high positions they have
attained. I wish also to congratulate the
mover and the seconder of the motion for an
address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne on their eloquence and, more particularly, in a humble way I wish to extend a
warm welcome to the new senators.
I have spoken in the debate on the motion
for an address on quite a few occasions, and
on all of them my remarks were far removed
from party politics. I have spoken on such
subjects as the evil of prize fighting. I still
think it is all wrong for two young men in
perfect physical condition to stand up and
attack each other with violence, and sometimes viciousness. Whether the bout lasts two
minutes or ten rounds, one or other of the
contestants is likely to be very seriously hurt.
The human frame is not constituted to withstand those sledge-hammer blows which are
inflicted during a prize fight.

OCTOBER 18, 1962
On several occasions I have ventured to
speak on the subject of divorce. Under the
chairmanship of the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and later
under the chairmanship of the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), I and other members of the committee have adjudicated-if that is the proper
word-upon more than one thousand divorce
cases. Each one of those cases was a domestic
tragedy.
We see some of the shady side of life in the
divorce court. People come there who seem
to be lacking in character, in background, in
a healthy attitude, and who are not really
determined to make a success of marriage.
An eminent judge in the United States once
made the statement that about 90 per cent
of those persons involved in divorce cases
seldom attended church. However, from the
evidence that is presented we hear much of
selfishness, much of self indulgence, particularly in alcoholic liquor, much of cruelty, and
even, at times, of an absolute disregard of all
moral principles.
We in the Senate do not break up the homes
of the people of this country. Those homes
are hopelessly broken up before the parties
ever come to us. If there is any doubt at all
about a case, we do not recommend it. We try
to apply the law to all cases, and I must
say that I have come to the conclusion that
the law does not always work in favour of
those who deserve its benefits. Many people
in this country get divorced all too easily, and,
on the other hand, others are doomed to live
in misery, sorrow and perhaps suffering because they can obtain no relief under the law.
Honourable senators, to go to another subject, I might say that there was a time in
this country when almost every family, and
almost every child, could be labelled either
a Liberal or a Conservative. Those were the
days of the two-party system. I still think
that if any group of people wish to have
their ideas accepted, and wish to have their
thoughts and opinions transferred into legislation, their aspirations are more likely to be
realized if they work within one of the two
parties than if they support a splinter party.
Times have changed, however. There was a
day when most people got their news from
the weekly newspaper, and that newspaper
generally coloured its news and its views to
suit the party that the editor believed in. We
have today many excellent newspapers and
publications, and I think it is to the credit
of the editors and the publishers of those
papers that all the news is given. They will
feature some particular article that appeals
to them as being sound, regardless of what
27511-5-8

political party it helps or hurts. In my opinion,
much credit is due to the newspapers of this
country.
In many homes there are television sets.
Nearly everybody has a radio. Radio sets are
to be found in the most remote country places,
and much information is obtained through
these media.
In fact, people are pretty well informed at
the present time. As an illustration of this
I point out that a few years ago the people
of this country returned a government with
a larger majority than any government had
had since Confederation, and then only four
years later they left that government on the
verge of defeat. This indicates, I think, first,
that there are many independently-minded
people in this country and, secondly, that
the people expect a high standard of accomplishment from those who are placed in
positions of public trust.
There are, of course, baffling problems.
There are difficult questions, both domestic
and foreign. Everybody realizes that we are
not sailing along in the sunshine of prosperity by any means, and I believe that the
party that will dedicate itself to solving these
problems, the party that will promote legisiaiton designed to strengthen the economy and
not just to get votes, and the party that will
show administrative ability, will merit the
gratitude and confidence of the Canadian
people and will govern this great nation
for many years to come.
I have indicated that I think the recognized
need at the present time is to so shape and
direct our economy that peace and contentment and employment will abide with the
Canadian people of this generation, and of
all generations to come.
I just wish to indicate two things that [
feel will contribute something to the general
welfare, and that will probably increase the
gross national product. The first is education.
Most people who are out of work at the
present time are men and women who have
not had the advantage of an education. The
more schooling a person has, the easier it is
for that person to obtain suitable employment and hold it and advance in it. Education
gives prestige and confidence to any individual and makes it easier for him to learn
new things and to accomplish something
really worth while.
A great blessing would be conferred if, by
artificial means, water could be placed upon
some of the dry parched-out land where,
much to the disappointment and despair of
the farmers, the crops fail year after year.
Water placed on the land by gravity, by a
sprinkler system, or by a spraying system,
would bring most welcome results.

SENATE
This year, in a general way, the crops in the
west were good. Approximately 500,000,000
bushels of wheat will be harvested. The
newspapers say that the farm income is at
a fairly satisfactory level. Even this year,
however, some of the land was so dry that
the seed did not germinate. In some places
frail little plants came up but they never
developed and the crop was not worth cutting. In other places the farmers got only two
or three bushels per acre where they should
have got 15 or 20.
I attended a meeting of some 200 cattlemen and ranchers, and one after another
said there was not enough grass on his ranch
to feed his cattle, that he would have to get
help from the Government to ship the breeding cattle north where there was pasture, and
he would have to sell off his dry stock and
thus deplete his herds.
This is not a new experience in the part of
the country where I have lived so long. Away
back in 1857, Captain Palliser was commissioned by the British Government to explore
the land between the South Saskatchewan
River and the international boundary line.
He made a report in which he outlined an
area triangular in shape consisting of 50
million acres of land, which he called the
great central desert, and he said that it was
not fit for agriculture. Since then, in every
ten-year period there have been perhaps only
two or three paying crops in a small part of
that area. In other years one might almost
say it was a "dust bowl," because black
clouds of dust blew over the area, there was
an absence of the subsoil mixture, and the
rainfall did not come. Warnings were given
of this.
Who were the first people in the territory?
We do not know anything about the moundbuilders, but we assume that in those days
long gone by the Indians came from the heart
of Asia, crossed the Bering Strait, came along
the old North Trail, along the foothills of the
Rockies and wandered over that country for
20 or 30 thousand years.
About 200 years ago, when explorers and
Christian missionaries and early settlers went
into that land they were warned of the conditions. The Indians told them that in many
years the prairie burned up so that, although
there was open range, the buffalo were forced
by hunger to leave their feeding grounds, and
the Indians had to follow them or die.
Irrigation will be a very great blessing in
some of those districts. It is not a new device
for bringing productivity to the land. There
are pictures of Egypt 2,000 years before the
time of Christ, portraying the people as they
bailed water out of the river Nile to put on
the land. The Greeks and the Romans in the
heyday of their greatness had irrigation

schemes. Japan, North Africa and Australia
have had their irrigation schemes. China has
90 million acres under irrigation; India and
Pakistan 60 million, and the United States 26
million. In Canada we have about one million
acres being irrigated, but we could irrigate
another one and a half million.
Where does the water come from? About
10 per cent of it comes from the spring runoff, that is, the melting of the ice and snow.
About 90 per cent comes from the streams
flowing down the eastern slopes of the Rocky
Mountains. It is important for us to take
notice of that situation. Trees play a vital
role in the holding of water. They shade the
land, the leaves and the grass form a blanket
over the soil so that the water is retained,
and the moisture seeps down slowly and
keeps up the water level on the adjacent land.
Unfortunately, if the trees are depleted in
number, if the forests are eut down, the water
cascades down the hills and runs off into
Hudson Bay without doing any good.
Of course, much has been done by way of
irrigation, but it has cost money. Since 1930
the dominion Government has spent $30 million on irrigation, the province of Alberta has
spent $29 million, and the farmers themselves
have spent about $15 million, for a total of
approximately $75 million. The expenditure
has brought results, because today there is a
demand for irrigated land, a demand which
exceeds the supply available.
Those in the best position to know are
convinced that irrigation pays. The projects
which pay best are the small ones close to
the source of supply of water. The most expensive projects are the large ones which at
times have been undertaken for political
purposes and without the advice of technical
engineers who make this their particular
business.
A dried-out farmer worries his head off
every year, wondering where he will get
enough crop to carry him through. On the
other hand, the irrigated farmer knows he
will have his garden, his vegetables, flowers,
small fruits, poultry and other meat supplies
for his family. Therefore, irrigation brings
help to many people.
The name Gault is one familiar to Canadian people. One of the Gaults was finance
minister in Sir John A. Macdonald's cabinet. The Gaults have always been an enterprising family. The very first irrigation
scheme was constructed by one of them in
1880, because of the depression and drought.
He irrigated 20,000 acres of land in the foothills.
Millions of dollars have been spent on irrigation by the C.P.R. In 1917, the Canada
Land and Irrigation Company, with British
capital, irrigated large areas. There is the

OCTOBER 18, 1962
Lethbridge Northern scheme, and there 15
the Taber scheme. There are three large beet
sugar factories fiourishing now in this part
of the province. The South Saskatchewan
River project is about haîf finished. It will
cost between one and two hundred million
dollars. A huge dam has been built there,
three miles wide and 210 feet high, and behind
it is a long lake stretching for about 140 miles.
0f course, much of this water evaporates or
goes away by seepage, but the lake will provide pleasure boating and other forms of recreation and much of the land can be used
as picnic sites. The area will be excellent for
the preservation of wildlife, and the land is
well suited for producîng sugar beets, grain
and livestock. More particularly, power will
be available for the farming districts, as well
as for the cities of Moose Jaw and Regina.
Many of the streams from the rockies have
been damned by the Calgary Power Company to produce hydro-electric energy. In
Manitoba and Saskatchewan many ambitious
schemes have been promoted or are in the
process of being developed.
In Alberta an efficient staff of some 100 persons, including eminent engineers, is engaged
in the study of water conservation. The staff
is not altogether happy about many of these
schemes because the headwaters of many of
the streams are in Alberta, and there is a danger of the demand for water exceeding the
supply, and the future needs of the province may be jeopardized if too much water is
being used. However, that is a problem for the
Prairie Water Board, which is composed of
representatives from, each province and also
from the dominion.
Just one more point. Canada is rapidly
becoming an urban nation. At the time of
Confederation haîf of its people were on
farms. 1 learned recently that only about il
per cent of our people now live on farms.
Therefore, as cities enlarge there will be more
and more demand for water and electric
power.
Honourable senators, I will close by saying
that care must be taken regarding water
supply, because all down through the long
history of the world the decline and faîl of
nations has gone hand in hand with the
misuse of water supply. Water is our most
valuable resource and its depletion would be
more disastrous than the depletion of oil,
minerals, or even lumber. Marketing boards
need to be set up to dispose of our productsand that can be done. Quite a number of
processing plants are in operation, but a few
more may be required to preserve the food
supply. I hope this activity will be continued.
People who dwell in dry farming areas live
a lonely life, whereas those who dwell on
27511-5-81

îrrigated land enjoy the pleasures of coinmunity if e and, most important of ahl, they
are able to produce food of the very kind
that is in so much demand throughout the
world.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate

DIVORCE
REPORTS

0F COMMITTEE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, Nos. 2 to 306, which were presented
yesterday.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved that the
reports be adopted now.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I spoke yesterday on this matter,
when I asked that consideration of these
reports be deferred until the next sitting.
I wonder if my honourable colleagues would
allow me to proceed with the discussion, for
I have a few remarks to make and it will
not be possible for me to complete them
today.
Han. Mr. Roehuck: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I must take you into my
confidence. For the benefit of the new senators, at the last session I appealed to my
colleagues who were here on April 17 last,
the day before the last day of the session.
I draw your attention to page 522 of Senate
Hansard for Tuesday, April 17, and also No.
39 of the Minutes of the Proceedings of the
Senate of the saine date. At that time the
session was about to end, but we did not
know when the end was to come. We knew
nothing of what was going to happen. There
were a lot of papers on the table, nobody
knew what was in them, and then we were
told that they were reports from, the divorce
committee. They are to, be found in No. 39
of the Minutes to which I have referred. Then
the honourable senator fromt Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), as appears at page 522
of Senate Hansard:
.. presented the committee's reports,
Nos. 307 to 340, and moved, with leave,
that they be taken into consideration
now. Motion agreed to.
I was present with my colleagues. I do not;
blame anyone else; I blame myself for having
let that occur. I did not know what it was
at ail, and I was here. I was a party to the
adoption of those reports, and 1 did not say
a word. First reading was then given to a
number of divorce bills.

SENATE

We did flot know at ail what it was about.
They were numbers 294 to 327. And then the
bis were given second reading.
I read frorn Hansard:
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shall these bis be read
the second tirne?
HON. MR. ROEB3UCK: With leave of the
Senate, 1 move that these bis be read
the second tirne now.
I was here but I said nothing. Contînuing:
Motion agreed to and bis read second
time, on division.
One of my colleagues said, "On division"
It was the only thing that was said, and he
did not know what il was about.
Then we proceed a few lines further-on
the sarne page, mark you, honourabie senators,-and the bis were given third reading.
I read:
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shall these bis be read
the third tîme?
HON. MR. ROEBUCK: With leave of the
Senate, I move that the bis be reafi the
third time now.
Motion agreed to and bis read third
lime and passed, on division.
1 was here; I said notbing. I saw ail this,
and it went on so quickiy it was like a film
that was shown 100 fast. It did not break
the sound barrier but it broke the decorurn
barrier.
Afterwards, to my great surprise, the day
after, when I held this Hansard in my hand
I found the tilles of tbe bis, and that for the
first time-the day after they were passed.
Then I saw in the Minutes of the Proceedings
of the Senate the reports of the Senate cornmittee, wbich had been lying on the table and
of which I knew nolbing at ail. I find that il
is not reasonable.
Now, honourable senators, we are inclined to
sympathize with the Chairman of tbe Divorce
Committee because he has a heavy weight
on bis shoulders. 1 agree. Many times have
I said in the house that the work of the members of the Senate Divorce Comrniltee was
praiseworlhy. But today it is not a question
of being for or against divorce in principle;
the question is whether we shahl have sorne
decorurn in the house, whether we shouid
know what we are debating. Whether we
sbouid know or flot, we shouid at ieast have
the tilles of the bis. Imagine any senator
atter tbat sitting was over, afler we had
adopted the cornmittee reports, passed 33
bis on first, second and third reading, being

asked, "What have you done?" The answer
is, "We have passed a certain number of
divorce bis."
For the punishrnent of ail of us, those bis
were sent 10 the House of Commons and they
were stopped there. Tbey did not pass. It was
to punish ail of us individuaily. It was the
punisbrnent of Parliament for showing sucb,
I will say, celerity in passing that iegislation.
I appeal to you, honourabie colleagues, and
I ask you, do you find it sensible and reasonable? Perbaps nobody thought of it. We were
at the end of the session; the session was to
conclude at any moment, andl that was il.
Some members had gone home.
The new president 0f the Canadian Charnber of Comnmerce-I do not rernember the
gentleman's name-made a speech which was
reported in the press in which he said that
the great evii of our limes is the indifference
of ail the people to wbat is going on. I arn
not the one who said that; il was said by the
new president of the Chamber of Commerce.
We will turn fl0w 10 what bas been happening yesterday and today. I have in my
hand the Minutes of the Proceedings of the
Senate of Canada for yesterday, October 17.
Yesterday, honourable senators, the same
thing was going to happen. There were several piles of reports on the table and nobody
knew what they were about; tbey were 10
pass innocuously.
I do flot attribute the biame for tbis praclice 10 anyone else. I was just as wrong as
any one of my colleagues; I was indifferent, as
the president of the Chamber of Commerce
said. Afterwards I feit a deep rernorse in my
beart and in my soul, and I said if I can
protest against such a practice I wiii take
the first opportunity 10 do so. As Ibis present
session is just starting I arn doing il now,
and 1 appeai 10 the new senators and 10 my
oid colleagues for their support in Ibis malter.
We can do sornething good for the Senate.
The Senate couid be ail powerfui, provided
that we foiiowed the ruies of pariiamentary
practice.
Now let us corne back 10 what bappened
yesterday. In Ibis book there are 121 pages,
containing the minutes of the sitting of yesterday which lasted about two hours.
On page 92 of the Senate Hansard of yesterday the bonourabie senator from, TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said:
As honourabie senators wili observe,
Ibese 305 reports are on the table for any
bonourabie senalor 10 read wbo wisbes
10 do so.
It was very generous of him. In the third
coiumn of bis speech he said:
I can assure tbe bouse that eacb one
of these 305 cases bas been examined and

OCTOBER 18, 1962
re-processed, and in each report there will
be found that solemn declaration as to
non-condonation, and a request from the
petitioner that he or she wishes to proceed.
I move the adoption of these 305
reports.
Two columns before he suggested to us that
the mass of reports, covering 121 pages, was
available for us to read. Then two columns
later he said: "I move the adoption of these
305 reports." How could anyone, in five minutes, read ail those reports?
I made a computation based on the Hansard of the House of Commons of Monday,
October 15, 1962. There were 200 questions
asked by the members and answered by the
Government-200 of them. There were 83
pages covering the sittings that lasted from
2.30 to 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and from
8 until 10 o'clock in the evening. On Tuesday
last, for the same hours of sitting, the House
of Commons Hansard covered 47 pages. In
ail, that is 130 pages for il hours of debate
in the House of Commons.
As I have said, in this chamber yesterday
the adoption of those reports was moved in
the next but one column following the invitation to read them. Physically I amn unable to
read 121 pages in 10 minutes. I wonder if
some others can.
Then yesterday, when His Honour the
Speaker asked if the reports should be adopted,
bearing in mind the feelings I had on April
17, 1 said, "Next sitting". Then the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity said:
Why does the honourable senator say
that? Does he wish to look into them?
HON. MR. POULIOT: I do not wish to be
unpleasant to my honourable friend, but
I missed some parts of his remarks, and
I would like to be able to read them
before giving my assent.
HON. MR. ROEBTJCK: May I repeat them
to you now?
HOM. MR. POULIOT: No. 1 missed something, and I want to read the honourable
senator's remarks quietiy in my office.
Next sitting.
THE HON. THE SPEAKER: Next sitting.
We have resumed consideration of the
reports this afternoon. This is quite a long
story, and I have to check some information.
Therefore, honourable senators, I move,
seconded by the honourable senator from
Queens (Hon. Mr. MacDonald), the adjournment of the debate.
Han. Arthur W. Roebuck: I suppose that
motion is not debatable, but some remarks
have been made here that should not go without comment.

Han. M1.Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croil: You can speak to it on a
question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, perhaps I have
a real question of privilege in connection with
some of these remarks.
It has been said that nobody knew what
these reports were about. 1 am responsible,
in some measure at least, as Chairman of the
Divorce Committee, for the knowledge of the
members of the committee and for the combined knowledge of us ail. I would like to
challenge that remark with ail seriousness.
The reports that were on the table at the
time in question were the culmination of
hearinýgs in which the committee had called
witnesses, had heard those witnesses, had
considered the evidence and had come to a
considered judgment in regard to each and
every one. There was not a case there that
had flot been thoroughly considered and completely understood, and concerning which
justice had flot been determined in a moderate and judicial manner.
Jnstead of this body acting capriciously or
carelessly in connection with those cases, the
house relied on certain senators, such as
myseif and my colleagues, for the work we
had done, the judgments we had rendered
and the common sense we had applied. To say
that there was anything hurried or careless
about the proceedings on that occasion is an
injustice to this house and a serjous injustice
to the members of that committee.
There are only two points I wish to makeand I cannot possibly sit silent while statements of this kind are made. It has been
said that the action in the other place was
taken as a punishment by Parliament for the
celerity with which we had passed these
305 bills. My honourable friend may have
information that 1 have flot with regard to
the action 0f the House of Commons, but I
wouid cail attention to the fact that Mr.
Peters, one of the members of the House of
Commons who was blocking the passage of
these bills, made the statement that the work
of our committee had been well done. 1 give
him credit for that statement.
Ail my knowledge of what went on is
contrary to the statement that there was any
revenge or punîshment meted out to the
Senate 'because of the celerity with which we
had passed bills which, by the way, had taken
us ahnost the whole session of Parliamnent to
consider and pass properly. The ones that
are before us today have been before us for
nearly a year, and in ail that time the information has been available to any honourable
senator desiring to make inquiries. The cases
now under consideration are those that we
deliberated upon last session, and not this

SENATE
session. The honourable senator who now
complains that he knows nothing about them
could have made inquiries throughout that
period. Not only while the session was in
progress but also during the recess, he could
have studied them to the last detail and
could have read every word of evidence upon
which each judgment was based.
I have suggested that these reports be
adopted now, not because I have any personal
interest in these matters-I have no more
personal interest in them than any one of
you. It is true that we of the committee
devoted time and energy to their consideration; but we did so for the same reasons and
motives that now guide you. This body bas a
duty to perform, a duty which is upon the
shoulders of all of us, and we are trying to
discharge that duty properly and decently. I
did suggest yesterday that consideration be
then given to these reports, and when my
friend insisted on adjourning the matter to
the next sitting I had no recourse and I made
no protest. The item was adjourned and it is
now before us.
I have said many times that I never ask
for immediate passage of bills or the adoption
of reports unless there is a good reason for
doing so. I follow the rules, just as you do
with all other bills, but when there is a
reason for asking to be allowed to do otherwise, I give the reason. We of this committee
merely pass on the suggestion.
The reason I ask that these reports be considered now is that they have been before us
for a long time, and the petitioners whom
we have adjudged as being entitled to relief
have been held for all that period not knowing whether they were married or divorced.
This would appear to be a piece of very
inefficient justice, to say the least. Justice
delayed is justice denied. The same thing
applies right now.
It was my thought-not my interest, because I am no more interested than you arethat we should send these measures to the
other bouse as rapidly as is reasonably
possible. We worked overtime to re-process
these 305 cases. As an indication of that, may
I inform you that I have signed in that
material 610 documents-610 signatures will
be found in those reports. The Clerk of the
Senate will sign another 610 times before
these reports go to the Commons. All that
detail appears routine when you see it in the
Minutes, but it is not routine. Every one of
these cases bas been individually processed,
and both our officials and the members of
the committee well know that the parties are
entitled to the judgments we have rendered.
I sympathize with my friend when he says
he finds it difficult to keep up with us in all

our work, but I am prepared at any time to
move that he be made a member of our
committee.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He can sit with us. If
he does not wish to be a member of the committee and spend the time we spend in dealing with these cases and studying the facts
so far as is humanly possible, let me remind
him that our doors are always open, and that
an honourable senator does not have to be a
member of the committee to attend and watch
the proceedings in every case, be it contested
or uncontested. I am not responsible, nor are
the members of my committee responsible,
for the fact that my friend is not aware of the
extensive detail included in this material.
What I want to make clear is that there has
been no carelessness whatever, or lack of
knowledge in respect to the presenting of the
reports and the passing of the large number
of bills which will follow.
Now so far as an adjournment of the
matter is concerned, my friends are aware,
as I am, of the desirability of sending these
bills to the Commons at the earliest possible
moment. I think there is an urgency in this
but, honourable senators, you know as much
about it as I do, and I have nothing to say
with regard to the motion to adjourn.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, debate
adjourned.
BANKRUPTCY

ACT

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October
16, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Higgins for the second reading of Bill
S-2, to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
the amendment to the Bankruptcy Act was
explained by the honourable senator from
St. John's East (Hon. Mr. Higgins) and it
is, of course, a welcome measure in so far
as it goes. But, as has already been pointed
out in the house, it deals with a narrow
field. On the other hand, the honourable
sponsor of the bill said that there would be
a general revision of the Bankruptcy Act at a
later date. My hope is that it will not come
too late.
I support this bill in its present form because it makes some useful provisions. It decentralizes to some extent the practice of
bankruptcy proceedings in the provinces from
the large capital cities, and if the county or
district court clerk does not know at the
beginning how to handle the administration,
he will learn it in time. In any event, there
is a vacuum that needs to be filled, as the

OCTOBER 18, 1962

honourable senator indicated to us, in that
some provinces are in difficulties as a result
of legislation which they relied upon for some
time.
I think this proposed measure will help the
little man in dealing with a very personal
problem. I do say this, however, that to do
away with inspectors is a mistake. They can
be and indeed are most useful, in the sense
that they have done business with the insolvent-as my friend likes to call him, and
I too prefer that word. They know something
of the business, the locality, the character of
the people, and they may even know something of the assets that the man may have.
Consequently, inspectors are useful. In any
event, I should not think the clerk would
want to take all the responsibility to himself
at first, and he would welcome the assistance
of inspectors or such people until he learns
more about the new practice. In this respect
I agree with the observations made by the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) and the honourable senator from
Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly).
The amendments deal with an immediate
problem, but there is much more that needs
attention. I think the whole question should
be discussed here and now, since the act is
open for discussion. This act has been on the
statute books for twelve years without any
worthwhile amendment. If there has been any
amendment, it has been slight and inconsequential. In those 12 years the face of business has changed. Times have changed; new
competition has developed; goods and services
that are available to us have also changed.
A few days ago I looked up some of the
debates that took place when the act was
introduced, and there I read that the act was,
. . . intended to permit an honest but
unfortunate debtor to obtain a discharge
from his debts in order to provide for his
rehabilitation as a useful productive
member of society.
That is a very laudatory purpose, but I
would remind honourable senators of something they already know, that over the years
more and more businesses have clothed themselves in corporate garments which have
neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be
damned. These corporate bodies have become
a media of fraud, because there are loopholes
in the Bankruptcy Act which give the debtor,
who has some foresight and who does some
planning, an opportunity of escape. Since most
enterprises of any size are conducted es limited companies, the head of the firm is never
responsible for the debts unless he particularly makes himself responsible, and he
usually does not.

In the changing conditions of commerce in
this country the present Bankruptcy Act is
inadequate and too lenient. I had hoped that
after 12 years it would be tightened up by
this revision so as to provide protection for
the unsuspecting against planned bankruptcy
and disregard of creditors.
In 1960 in the city of Toronto there were
258 business failures, and in 1961 there were
277. The liabilities in the city of Toronto
for 1960 were $94 million odd. That figure is
a little abnormal, due to the fact that two
mining companies, Can-Met Explorations
Limited and Stanrock Uranium Mines Limited,
failed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We had a Conservative
government then, you know.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Thousands of small investors
were wiped out. In all of our larger cities the
number of business failures rose. I think it
is a matter of some consequence that in 1960
we had a total of 1,901 business failures with
debts of $180 million, and in 1961 there were
2,028 with debts of $115 million. Honourable senators will notice that despite the
fact there were more failures in 1961, the
total amount of the debts was less. I quote
these figures, not for the purpose of damning
anyone, but to indicate that there is a real
problem which we have not faced up to.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I ask the honourable
senator if he bas the figures for 12 years
ago when this act was passed?
Hon. Mr. Croll: No.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Of course, that would be
the only fair comparison.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am not attempting to
make a comparison.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The honourable senator is
making a comparison whether he is attempting to or not.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I have many figures here.
I did not intend to deal with the period of
12 years ago, but if the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) wishes me
to quote those figures I will see if I have them.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Frankly, I do not see the
pertinence of the figures the honourable senator is quoting.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The figures have a purpose,
and I said it was to indicate that there is a
problem. Surely, when there was a loss of
$94 million in the city of Toronto in 1960,
and when normally such loss is $20 million
or $25 million in one year, this is something
unusual.
I am getting to my point, which is that the
bankruptcy field has been neglected for 12
years. There is enough room for everybody

SENATE

to share some responsibility, because five of
those years were wonderful Liberal years.
My honourable friends on the other side of
the house do not need to worry too much
about that.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: My point is that these

problems do not occur suddenly. They have
been accumulating over 12 years, and this bill
is intended to cure what has been accumulating for those years.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, that is right. This is
not like the devaluation problems that occur
overnight.
As I say, these problems are here, and they
have probably existed since the act was put
on the statute books. I will go further and
say the reason for this is that during the
course of the years very few frauds have been
uncovered, and only a minute number have
been prosecuted.
Let me give you a typical case which I have
taken from the press. The question is asked:
Why aren't there more bankruptcy
investigations to determine the possibility
of fraud?
And the answer is given:
Because there usually isn't enough
money to pay for one and the creditors,
who have already lost plenty, are loath
to dig further into their pockets, that's
why.
In a recent small bankruptcy, involving
$12,000 in assets, a sum of about $5,000
was recovered through the auctioning of
the bankrupt stock. Who got the money?
Not the creditors.
Upwards of $350 went to the man who
took stock. The auctioneer got a commission of about $500, plus another
$1,500 for "expenses". The trustee got
$425 for handling the business. The
solicitor to the estate got almost $700,
and the solicitor on the assignment got
$80. After other expenses were paidpostage, advertisements, hydro, storage
charges, room rental for creditors' meetings, etc., there was exactly $176.93 left
for the creditors to split up. Of this, the
Unemployment Insurance Fund, a preferred creditor, got $13.80. Business tax
ate up $5.27. The sheriff got $158.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is better than

average.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The average must be very
bad because as I add up those figures there
was a loss of about $2.

The explanatory note to the bill says:
The purpose of these amendments is
to correct certain abuses that have
occurred in the administration of small
estates under the Bankruptcy Act, by
repealing those sections in the Act that
provide for the summary administration
of such estates.
My view is that the abuses are not so much
with the small estate as with the big estate.
It is at the big estate we should be aiming.
Society has a tendency to go after the small
fry and let the big fish escape. I do not think
the damage is done by the petty offender. I
think it is done by the big people. Some of
these big people threaten the financial structure of a community. Certainly they undermine confidence and they take away the
savings of hundreds of little people.
Too often it is the white-collar operator
who violates the criminal law as applied in
bankruptcy, in the course of his occupational
activities. He is getting away with it. We
treat this problem far too casually.
I hope that by this amending measure we
may close the loopholes, or at least look
forward to the time when they will be
closed. I hope that time is not too far distant.
Honourable senators, I have known instances where the bankrupt attended the
first meeting of creditors, having arrived in
his wife's Cadillac car, the children's sports
convertible not being available. I have known
of cases when creditors' meetings have been
adjourned or postponed to await the bankrupt's return from a trip to Florida. These
people are commercial pickpockets. They
sometimes break a creditor, but more often
they hurt him. It is time that this Bankruptcy
Act were considered by those who are experts
on it.
There is need to establish under this act a
bankruptcy fraud squad, men with long
noses, big ears and inquisitive minds, with
a determination to root out the evil. The
type of bankrupt I am speaking of is the
man without shame or decency or a sense
of honour. Most of the time, they plan to
defraud their creditors; they are looters and
ought to be in gaol. More often than not, they
have been able to use the act in a way in
which it was never intended to be used, as
a haven. Some of these unprincipled people
have grown rich by bankruptcies.
The sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Higgins)
has quoted poetry from time to time. I do
not often understand it, but I have always

OCTOBER 18, 1962
enjoyed it. I should like to do the same
thing now. I came across this ditty, which
expresses the mood in which I have been
tallcing:
The law doth punish man or woman
That steals the goose frorn off the
common,
But lets the greater felon loose,
That steals the common from the goose.

It may be that we are flot doing sufficient
in this bill. However, we should flot let Urne
run without doing something about this very
vital problem which. we have far too long
neglected.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 6, 1962
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-68, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service for the financial year
ending the 31st March, 1963.
Bill read first time.

SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Choquette, that
this bill be read a second time now.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have no objection to the bill receiving second reading this evening, but I do not
want this practice to be considered a precedent that can be followed on every occasion.
I realize that this bill passed the other house
last week, and for that reason I think we
should deal with it tonight. I will not object
to second reading now.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I thank the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) for his courtesy.
Honourable senators, Bill C-68, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year
ending the 31st March, 1963, was introduced
in and passed the other place on Friday last
and is now before us for our consideration
and approval. I would like at this time to
say a few words in explanation of the measure.
Firstly, the proportions requested in this
biull are intended to provide for all the necessary requirements of the public service up
to November 30, 1962.
In no instance is the total amount of an
item, as shown in the revised estimates for
1962-63, being released by this bill.
This bill was prepared, in so far as was
possible, in the form with which honourable
senators have become familiar over the past
several years. Some change has been required
this year, however, as a consequence of the
revision of the estimates.
The revised estimates were tabled in the
other place last week and at that time were
distributed to all honourable senators. I
tabled the estimates in this house, as you
know, just a few moments ago. Former appropriation acts released supply on the basis
of the amounts shown in the estimates tabled
on February 12, 1962.
Honourable senators will understand that
those estimates, having been replaced by the
revised estimates, cannot be used as the basis
for further supply. Moreover, it would be
undesirable to allow the spending authorities
previously granted to remain at higher levels
based on the original estimates. This bill,
therefore, bas been drafted in a manner
which will relate previously authorized supply, as well as the additional supply requested
for November, to the revised estimates which

OCTOBER 23, 1962
the honourable Minister of Finance tabled
last week and which I tabled here this
evening.
The passing of this bill will in no way
prejudice the rights and privileges of bonourable senators to criticize any item in the
estimates when it comes up for consideration,
and the usual undertaking is hereby given
that such rights and privileges will be respected and will not be curtailed or restricted in any way as a result of the passing
of this measure.
Honourable senators will note that there
is further borrowing authority provided in
the bill. Appropriation Acts Nos. 3 and 5,
both passed before the dissolution of Parliament on April 18, 1962, provided total borrowing authority of $1,500 million. This bill
provides for a further $500 million. This
borrowing authority is needed to permit the
Government to raise new money required by
it for the financing of its ordinary operations
and for loans and advances to crown corporations. As one example, it is contemplated
that greatly increased funds will be needed
for the Export Credits Insurance Corporation.
Honourable senators, in further explanation, I would say that the bill will provide
in respect to the revised estimates of 1962-63:
(a) two-thirds of all of the items to be voted
in those estimates, namely, $2,514,223,947.34;
(b) an additional one-quarter of 17 votes
set out in Schedule A, amounting to
$33,266,831.25; (c) an additional one-sixth of
18 votes set out in Schedule B, amounting
to $11,139,450; (d) an additional one-twelfth
of 33 votes, set out in Schedule C of the bill,
amounting to $52,558,215; totalling in al
$2,611,188,443.59, less the amounts authorized
by Appropriation Act No. 3, 1962, and Appropriation Act No. 5, 1962, in respect of the
corresponding items in the main estimates
referred to in those acts, in the amount of
$2,379,368,873.77. The net amount, therefore,
provided by this bill is $231,819,569.82. As I
have already stated, there is an additional
borrowing authority of $500 million.
Honourable senators, this is the substance
of the bill, and if any further explanations
are necessary I shal be pleased to give them.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honorable senators, this is an appropriation bill of the kind
which we receive from time to time when the
Government is requesting interim supply. Its
purpose is to put the Government in funds so
that it can pay the bills that are presented to
it during the month of November. This is
necessary because the estimates have not yet
been passed by the other house. Honourable
senators will recall that the estimates were
considered in part before dissolution. Revised
estimates have since been tabled and there

has been no time to consider them. Similar
bills to this will come before us from time to
time throughout the session.
It strikes me as passing strange that this
bill should ask for only one month's supply.
It is usual for the Government to ask for
supply for at least two months; and often
for a longer term. Why they ask for only one
month's supply, I do not know. It may be
because the Government does not expect to
be in power for any more than one month.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Oh, no, that is not
the reason.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): My friend
says that is not the reason. The only other
reason I can think of is that probably at the
end of November the Government will ask for
two months' supply and that will carry them
over the period of Christmas and New Year's.
Time will tell why supply for only one month
is being asked for at this time.
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) bas referred to the original
estimates and the revised estimates. The
original estimates showed a sum required by
the Government amounting to $6,276 million,
and the revised estimates ask for $6,048 million. There has, therefore, been a reduction
of $228 million from the previous estimates of
over $6 billion.
I am sure honourable senators remember,
as I do, that in 1953 and in 1957 members
of the present Government, who were then
members of the Opposition, said how easy it
would be to reduce expenditures by $500
million. It was going to be easy, when the
Opposition of that day came into power, to
slash the estimates by $500 million. Of course
when they came into power they did not do
it; it could not be done. On the contrary, the
estimates were increased rather than reduced.
I am not criticizing the Government at this
time for what was done then, but I am pointing out that that was big talk and it was impossible to put it into effect.
The estimates for 1952-53 ran to $4,500
million, and the 1956-57 estimates ran to
about $4,800 million. If the then Opposition,
when they came into power, had reduced the
estimates by $500 million they would have
made a reduction of between 10 and 11 per
cent. But now, in this day of austerity, with
the great slashing of the estimates being made
to put this program into effect, the reduction
is about 3j per cent. Even in ordinary times
they said they could bring it down by 10
per cent but now, with their best efforts to
pare down the estimates, all they can do is
reduce them by about 3j per cent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that taking into
account what they have added on?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is
the reduction of the estinates tabled in April

estimates of the previous year.

as old age security, old age assistance, blind
pensions, disability pensions, family allowances-

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But it does not include
the additions that were made?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): -and
hospitalization. Is anyone prepared to reduce
any of those? In fact, there is talk now of
increasing family allowances by extending
the maximum age limit to 18 years in the case
of a child still attending school. So there is
no indication of a reduction of such expenditures. The only reduction I think possible in
connection with that department concerns
pensions. It seems to me that if we had a truly
contributory system, the amount paid by the
Government could gradually be reduced over
the years. I trust that it will not be long
before such a scheme is introduced.
I have mentioned these things just to point
out how difficult it is to bring about reductions. It is said that we are reducing the
expenditures by $228 million, but are we
reducing them this year? As the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has said, we are reducing the
estimates which were tabled in the bouse in
the earlier part of this year. However, I doubt
very much that there will be a reduction of
even one cent in the expenditures this year
over those of last year. The revised expenditures this year amount to $6,048,214,000, but
to that we must add $623,650,000 for old age
pensions. Then we must add to that an increase which was granted this year raising
the pension from $55 ta $65 a month, amounting to $124 million. If those two items are
added to the revised estimates it will be seen
that after the reduction is taken into effect
we are going to spend $6,795 million.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I am just
taking the totals at the moment. Honourable
senators, I am not complaining too much
about this.
Hon. Mr. McCuicheon: You said we did
our best.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: Hospitalization.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I won't
say you did your best, I will say it is a very
difficult thing to do. Let me put it this
way: you said your worst when you were
in Opposition, that you could reduce the
estimates by $500 million, but the best you can
do now is to reduce them by some $228 million.
Of course, it is difficult to reduce items of
expenditure once you have put them on the
statute book. From time to time, when expenditures were increasing, the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
from his seat here would express the warning
that expenditures were increasing and it
would be impossible to reduce them. Of
course, that has come true.
What estimates would you reduce-National
Defence? Well, a reduction of $85 million has
been made in that department, but 26 cents
of every dollar raised still goes to defence.
Honourable senators, I believe that any of us
would hesitate at this time of international
crisis to reduce the National Defence estimates by any more than has been done in
the bill now before us. Had this crisis arisen
some months ago or even a month ago, I

The next largest item is that of Finance.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I see in the estimates here
The cost of financing Government expenditures is the second largest spending item, for 1962-63 the expenditure for old age

further increases the expenditure by $124
million. If those items are added to the
revised estimates it will show that we are
approving, when these estimates come before
us, a total expenditure of $6,795 million. I
would add that we have not yet seen any
supplementary estimates. Last year the total
supplementary estimates amounted to $617
million, and if the supplementaries are in that
amount this year, we will spend over $7
billion 400 million, which would be no reduction over last year.
Possibly the Government will be able to
slash the supplementary estimates, but even
if they do so they will still be spending over
$7 billion. I mention these things just to point
out that although there may be a reduction
in the estimates as originally filed, it does not
seen to me that there will be an overall
reduction in our expenditures; on the contrary, there will probably be an increase.
Hon. David A. Croll: If no other honourable
senator wishes to discuss the matter, I have
an item I want to bring to the attention of
the house, and in doing so I shall change the
tone of the debate somewhat. I want more
money spent, and I want it spent more particularly on the Colombo Plan.
I think the house will perhaps recall that
twelve years ago Canada, along with a group
of nations, small countries, formed the
Colombo Plan. Canada was, in fact, one of
the original members of the plan, and during
those twelve years we have contributed approximately $380 million, which is a fair sum
of money. In the first ten years it amounted to
about $30 million a year, and in the last two
years we have been contributing on the basis
of $50 million a year. Our contributions took
the form of grants of money, in some instances, and loans, supply of equipment and
food grains. Each country had its own plan
of development and sat in with the Colombo
Consultative Council for the purpose of having its plan approved.
Now, twelve years after the commencement
of the plan, sixteen countries in South and
Southeast Asia have power stations, factories, roads, clinics, schools, irrigation, canals
and power dams. They had none of these
before. In such things lies the chief hope of
victory over poverty, want, famine and disease for these people.
Some time ago the Prime Minister was
asked why he was raising Canada's contribution to the Colombo Plan to $50 million, and
in reply this is what he said:
Canada does not just make cash gifts
to the underdeveloped countries in the
Colombo Plan. It provides them with
Canadian goods, equipment, and services

carefully selected to make a basic contribution to economic development.
Practically the whole amount of the
$50 millions that Canada is currently
contributing annually to the Colombo
Plan is, therefore, paid out to Canadian
firms and individuals and represents a
substantial amount of business.
The estimates which we are considering
here tonight provide a reduction of $8,500,000,
so that we will now be contributing
$41,500,000. I think that we in this country,
and I am sure this house shares my view, have
a moral obligation to help these people. Moreover, as these underdeveloped countries grow
in strength and size they have for us a
growing available market; and it must be
remembered that one of the purposes of our
going into the Colombo Plan was to prove
to these people that we are their real friends
and they can turn to us. When we talk about
a reduction of $8,500,000 in the Colombo
Plan we must also remember that we started
the plan twelve years ago, and in those sixteen countries the population has since increased 100 million. Their need is apparent.
In our own country we have wasted $500
million on the Arrow, and in defence we have
squandered millions of dollars on missile
programs that we had to scrap. Can we honestly afford to do less than we have been
doing for these people when their need is
now so much greater?
I do not for a moment suggest that Canada
is not making a worthwhile contribution,
but we can do much more than we are
doing. Listen to these figures with respect
to Colombo Plan trainees in 1960. I am here
referring to people from Colombo Plan countries who were sent to various other countries
of the world where they were trained and
sent home qualified to carry on in a fashion
that would be most productive. In 1960 Australia trained 425, Canada 277, the United
Kingdom 613, and the United States 2,511.
With respect to experts working in the Colombo Plan countries, Australia has 50, Canada 34, Japan 62, the United Kingdom 46,
and the United States 324.
These figures are really nothing to boast
about. These Colombo Plan countries need
more of everything. They have to be taught
how to grow more food, how to produce more
goods, how to train administrative personnel,
and how to develop the social services that
we think so much of and which are so useful.
We, on the other hand, by spending this
money in this country can provide more
employment for our own people, and at the
same time support a good and worthy cause.
There was a suggestion made some time
ago that all countries in the plan should give
one per cent of their gross national product.

SENATE
Some countries thought that that figure was
a little too high. It would certainly increase
our contribution considerably. In fact, it
would increase every country's contribution
considerably. The only country that comes
close to giving one per cent of its gross national product-and I am sure it will surprise you when I name it-is France. I do not
quote these figures to belittle my own country, but in comparison they are worth considering. On a per capita basis France contributes $110; the United States $80; the
Netherlands $75; and Canada $27, which is
one-sixth of one per cent of our gross national
product. That is not a large sum of money
to spend on so worthy a cause.
The Toronto Globe and Mail was angry
when it found out that our Colombo Plan
aid was reduced by $8,500,000, and it had this
to say:
Many Canadians hearing that Ottawa
has cut Colombo Plan aid by $8.5 million
as part of the nation's austerity measures
will hang their heads in shame. The
Government decided to reduce its surplus
wheat shipments to India, Pakistan and
other Asian countries, and in this way
chopped the aid figure to Southeast Asia
from $50 million to $41.5 million.
In a land where most of us have more
than enough to eat, surely the last place
where Government spending should have
been trimmed is surplus food gifts to
the world's hungry nations.
That reminds us of something that is very
pertinent to Canada.
Canada was one of the initiators of the
World Food Bank, where the 27 member
countries have pledged $86 million in
surplus grain and other foods, shipping
and a variety of commodities and services. Presumably the $8.5 million cut
will make it that much easier for Ottawa
to fulfill its commitments to this new
experimental food-sharing project.
I must admit that this is an angry editorial.
Nevertheless, it is something that makes us
think when we realize that we take this
thing rather lightly. There are people in
this country who are deeply concerned, and
the Globe and Mail speaks for many.
Honourable senators, we have the resources
in our country that can help the less fortunate
to create a new world of opportunity, but
somehow or other we have lacked the vision
and the will to do that which is so necessary.
I take this occasion to say what is in my
mind. I regret very much that we took a
backward step with respect to one of the
great undertakings with which we associated

ourselves in the days when we were drearning
of a better world for other people who were
less fortunate than ourselves.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I think the practice in past years has been
for the Leader of the Government in the
Senate to answer questions that honourable
senators may have with respect to any particular item in the appropriation bill before
them, and I think the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) said in
his remarks tonight that he would be pleased
to do so. I do not propose to make any extended remarks in regard to the general
terms of the bill or the amounts involved,
but I would like to inquire concerning one or
two items.
In Schedule A on page 3 under the heading
"Finance" may I inquire as to the meaning of
the word "repaid" as contained in the following paragraph:
Miscellaneous minor or unforeseen expenses, subject to the approval of the
Treasury Board, including authority to
re-use any sums repaid .. .

Just what does that word "repaid" mean?
Does this item include amounts paid by other
nations with respect to loans? Will those
amounts be now used for expenditures by
the Government during the past year or
in future years? I would like a definition of
the word "repaid".
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The explanation I have
for this item is that it is one of the two
contingency funds which are intended to
meet otherwise unprovided-for expenditures
of a department. Generally, the limits of
interim supply can be expected to give rise
to more unforeseen requirements, many of
them temporary, than would develop under
full supply conditions. This vote is to take
care of contingencies and unexpected expenditures. I believe this type of vote has
been in estimates from time immemorial.
It is a vote that is in every year.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am not questioning the
fact that this vote is in the present estimates,
or in bills of a similar nature to this one. I
am questioning that one word "repaid", and
I am asking for its exact meaning. My question is: does it include repayments of loans,
and are those sums to be used to defray expenses for the current year? That is a very
simple question.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It is to cover contingencies that have been paid for out of sorne
other fund.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does the vote include loans
recently repaid by certain nations?

OCTOBER 23, 1962
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Weil, this amount is $3
million.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It is quite a substantial
reduction of a loan. The vote does not include it?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: No.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: On page 3, vote 40, I
would like to know if the amount of the payment to the province of Nova Scotia in connection with vocational training is covered
by that particular item.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I have not the details here
for each province. This is just a general statement. I will get the information for the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: When the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
is getting that information, would he also
get it for each of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: In regard to page 4, vote
10, what is the amount being paid to Nova
Scotia with respect to campground and picnic
area developments? Perhaps the honourable
leader would be good enough to give us the
amounts spent in each of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I did not expect a detailed inquiry as to ail the items in the
book of estimates which I tabled tonight and
which we have just received. These explanations pertain to one-quarter of the vote which
is being taken at this time. They apply mostly
to seasonal and other work. As to the items
for which all this money is expended in the
general estimates, I do not think the honourable senator really expected that I would
have ail that information here tonight. I will
get the information for him. I hope there will
be another time to consider these estimates
more fully.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I can appreciate that the
honourable Leader of the Government is not
fully familiar with the financial picture.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I may say that in the last
few days I have gone over items of interim
supply for many years, and I cannot find any
case where there was a detailed report provided on the different items of the estimates,
on a bill of this kind. If the honourable senator looks back over the years, he will find
that is so.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Every honourable senator
in this chamber this evening who was here
last session heard the saine type of question
being asked and answers being given in a
somewhat detailed manner. Therefore, I felt
I was in order in asking some simple questions.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Such questions were
mostly on supplementaries.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I go one step further?
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks), because of his interest in
the Maritime provinces, may be able to
answer a question dealing with public works.
I am particularly anxious to find out whether
there is included in the estimates an amount
dealing with wharves and dredging at Sheet
Harbour. I ask that question because the
unemployment situation there is quite alarming. The paper mill there is anxious to provide much more employment. Perhaps we
could also be told whether there are anyand I am emphasizing "any"ý-moneys being
spent in Nova Scotia at the present time, and
included in these estimates, in so far as
public works are concerned.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I can understand the
honourable senator's interest in Nova Scotia.
I am sure ail senators are interested in items
for their own provinces. I would be delighted to get this information for the honourable senator and see that it is sent to him
or placed on the record. However, I do not
have the information here. I do not know
whether there is anything for Sheet Harbour,
but I shall certainly find out and let him
know.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): We are
ail interested in Nova Scotia and in the
Maritimes generally, and I think we would
like to see this information on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: In a general way.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Brooks moved that bill be placed
on the Orders of the Day for third reading at
the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

OCTOBER 23, 1962
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I suppose the commitments are being reduced
from time to time?
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Yes. I mentioned
that the total liability currently was $138.8
million. The total loaned under this section
from 1945 to date has been $428 million, so
that the liabilities have been reduced. There
has been repayment of $290 million out of
a total of $428 million during the period from
1945 to date; but the current situation is that
in addition to $138.8 million in liabilities there
is a firm commitment of $34 million, and there
are prospective commitments which will
use up the remaining $27 million.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is it intended to increase the subscribed capital?
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: No, it is not, because the commitments under section 21 are
commitments for the account of the Government. I would refer the honourable senator
to section 21 subsection 2 of the act. It
reads:
(2) All moneys required by the Corporation to discharge its liabilities arising under any contract of insurance
entered into under this section shall be
paid to the Corporation by the Minister
of Finance out of unappropriated moneys
in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
The corporation in effect is acting as agent
for the Government.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The corporation's authority to insure is not being increased beyond
the $200 million limitation, is it?
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Not beyond the
$200 million limitation provided for in section 14, which is arrived at by multiplying
its capital surplus plus its authorized capital
by ten.
Subsequent amendments are to section 21A.
Section 21A of the act is designed to authorize
long-term loans for capital equipment and,
again, these are loans for the account of the
Government. The total liability authorized
under this section at the moment is $300
million, and that is not being increased. But
there are certain amendments being proposed
with a view to facilitating administration.
Section 21A subsection 2 of the act
authorized the corporation, when approved
by the Governor in Council, to guarantee the
payment of an instrument given by an importer under or in respect of an export
transaction, or to purchase a guaranteed
instrument, or to lend money to the holder
of a guaranteed instrument, or to sell a
guaranteed instrument. The main amendment,
and the others consequential upon it, is that
when the corporation is authorized by the

Governor in Council it may lend money to an
importer on the security of an instrument
given by an importer in respect of an export
transaction. In effect, the corporation has that
power now. As the act stands, when the
exporter obtains approval from the corporation and from the Governor in Council, the
exporter takes a note from the importer in
the other country, whether that is a government or a private corporation or individual,
for the amount of the credit. The corporation, with the authority of the Governor in
Council, then guarantees the note, and the
corporation is then authorized to buy the note.
The amendment would enable the corporation to deal directly with the importer, and
it accomplishes two things. In the first place,
it simplifies what is otherwise a somewhat
cumbersome transaction and, in the second
place, it enables the corporation, which is an
agency acting on behalf of the Government
of Canada, to deal directly with another
government. Many governments would prefer,
and have so indicated, to deal directly with
the corporation, giving their note in hand to
the corporation rather than giving it, say, to
the company from whom they might be purchasing machinery in this country.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is my friend suggesting
that in these circumstances the importer of
the Canadian goods would be the government
of that country?

Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: Yes. I would refer
my friend again to the annual report of the
corporation, at page 5, where it deals with
the contracts under section 21A. This, I am
sorry to say, does not spell it out clearly, but
I can say that there have been direct credits
to at least two countries under this section
where the governments have indicated they
would prefer to deal directly with the corporation rather than go through the motions
that are now required under the act.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is odd phraseology,
calling such a person an importer.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: When I say importer
I am thinking of the purchaser.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It would have been a
happier choice to use the word purchaser.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: I yield to my friend
in the matter of semantics.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is nice to get some
concession.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I suppose from the
point of view of prestige, if the corporation
is dealing with the foreign government, which
is going to be the importer, the foreign government would prefer to have money lent

SENATE

to it by the corporation rather than have
the corporation guarantee the foreign government obligation.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: That is correct, and
foreign governments have indicated that they
prefer to give their note in hand and get
the money and pay the bills.
If this bill is read the second time, I shall
be happy to move that it be referred to the
appropriate committee.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Do the exports referred
to in this bill include exports made by a
Canadian crown corporation or agency?
Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: I am sorry, I cannot
answer that question. There is nothing I
know of in the act that would prevent that,
but I shall inquire and let my honourable
friend know.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hugessen debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
THE NORTH AMERICAN GENERAL INSURANCE
COMPANY-SECOND READING
Hon. A.

K. Hugessen

moved the second

reading of Bill S-6, respecting The North
American General Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill, similar in substance to a
number of bills that we have had before us
in the last two or three sessions. It is submitted on behalf of a company called The
North American General Insurance Company, which conducts automobile and fire
insurance, with its head office in Montreal
and a branch in Toronto.
The company carries on 85 per cent of its
business in the province of Quebec, and the
great majority of it with people in that province whose native tongue is French. It is

therefore asking for the authority of Parliament to adopt an alternative name in the
French language. Its present name is, "The
North American General Insurance Company," and the name which it desires in
addition is, "La Nord Américaine, Compagnie
d'Assurances Générales".

I do not think there is any further explanation that need be given, unless any
honourable senator so desires.
I understand that in the last year or two

the usual procedure in the case of bills of
this kind has been to send them for consideration to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, and if this bill

receives second reading I shall be glad so
to move.

THE LATE JOHN T. HAIG. P.C., 0.C.

TRIBUTE
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators will no doubt have heard of the death
yesterday of John T. Haig, P.C., Q.C. after a
very long illness. He will be remembered by
honourable senators as the Leader of the
Opposition in this chamber from 1945 to
1957, and as Leader of the Government for
one session during which he was also a member of the Cabinet without portfolio.
He resigned his seat in the Senate in
January, 1962 on account of poor health which
prevented his being present in his seat in
the Senate.
It has not been the custom, honourable
senators, for us to pay tribute to the memory
of a person who at the time of his death
was not a member of the Senate, but in
view of the fact that John T. Haig was a
senator for nearly twenty-seven years, during
which time he took a very prominent part in
the work of the Senate, and particularly in
view of the fact that his son, the honourable
senator from River Heights, has succeeded
him and is now a member of this chamber,
I, with the leave of the Senate, should like
to say something about the late senator. I
know I speak on behalf of all honourable
senators present and with your approval.
John T. Haig was born in Ontario but at
an early age settled in the province of
Manitoba, where he received his public school,
high school and university education. Both
he and I graduated from the University of
Manitoba, but he graduated some nine or ten
years before I did.
I began to be well acquainted with John
T. Haig about the year 1909. That was the
year in which I graduated, and I immediately
became articled as a law student in Winnipeg.
From that time on I knew him as a distinguished lawyer, a man who made a great
success of his profession and built up a big
practice in Winnipeg.
I knew him as a sportsman, particularly as a
curler. We curled many games together after
he came to Ottawa. I remember his playing the
third position for me on many weekends at the
Ottawa Curling Club and the Rideau Curling
Club. In addition he was for many years

chairman of the Macdonald Brier Curling
Trophy and we frequently attended the dominion curling championships together.
I also remember John T. Haig as a politician. He was active in politics for over fifty
years, not only in his native province of Manitoba but in the federal field.
On Wednesday last the honourable senator
from Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary) described
himself as a party man, a partisan and a
Conservative without prefix or qualification.
Honourable senators, that description also
fitted John T. Haig to a "T"-and he never
faltered.
As honourable senators are no doubt aware,
I was also well acquainted with our deceased
colleague as a senator. I believe that almost
from the time I became a senator I have been
a member of the Standing Committee on
Divorce. For quite a number of years I was
chairman of the committee, and John T. Haig,
during that time, as well as at other times,
was of valuable help to me. He was deputy
chairman of my committee for a number of
years, and between us we disposed of many
thousands of petitions.
John T. Haig became Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate in 1945, and continued in that office until 1957. During his
term of office I sat beside him in the front
row, and in his absence I was acting Leader
of the Opposition. He became Leader of the
Government in the Senate when the administration changed after the 1957 election, at
which time I also sat with him in the front
row and in his absence was acting Leader
of the Government.
During the twenty-seven years that John
T. Haig was a senator he performed outstanding public service. He was highly thought
of and made many warm friends.
Honourable senators, I hold in my hand a
telegram I have just received from his son,
Senator Campbell Haig, in which he states
that his father's funeral will take place at
1.30 p.m. on Saturday, October 27, and he
requests me to go to Winnipeg and be present
as an honorary pallbearer.
I am sure all honourable senators would
wish me to express to the five children and
other relatives of our late colleague your
sincere regrets and deepest sympathy. May I
say that my wife will accompany me and we
will do our best to represent the Senate at
the funeral.

I aged a little during my five years of office,
but that was not because of any hard work
that I had to perform here. Honourable
senators, you made my task easy, and I thank
you, Mr. Speaker, for your reference to my

may I associate myself with His Honour the
Speaker in congratulating the honourable
senator from La Salle on his birthday. I do
not know what his age is, but he certainly
does not look it, whatever it is!

The original Export Credits Insurance Act
was first enacted in the year 1948. At that
time its primary purpose, I think we may
say, was to set up a corporation to insure
Canadian exporters against loss on exports
of Canadian goods to foreign countries, for
which purpose the corporation was authorized
to issue policies, and the basic feature of
that function of the corporation was set out
in section 13 of the act, which is still in
effect. It says:
The corporation may for the purpose
of facilitating and developing trade between Canada and any other country,

history.
corporation has been very successful, and at

SENATE
the moment it has an earned surplus of something in excess of $1 million. I think that was
the figure my honourable friend gave.
That was the first and, I think, the primary
purpose of the legislation when it was introduced in the year 1948, but there was a
secondary purpose which is to be found in
section 21 of the act and which deals with
large export transactions, or transactions of
such a size that the corporation could not
normally engage in them as a business risk,
and particularly those where the terms of
repayment are so long that there, again, it
would not be an ordinary business risk to
enter into such transactions.
Section 21 provides that the corporation
can enter into insurance contracts with respect to these large and long-term export
agreements only if the minister reports to
the Governor in Council that the board of
the corporation is of the opinion that a proposed contract of insurance will impose upon
the corporation a liability for a term or in
an amount in excess of that which the corporation would normally undertake in relation to any one contract, and that in the
opinion of the minister it is in the national
interest that the proposed contract be entered
into. Under those circumstances the Governor
in Council can empower the corporation to
enter into insurance contracts in respect of
these particular large and long-term transactions.
There was a limitation placed on the obligations which the corporation could undertake
under section 21 of $100 million.
In the session of 1957-58 the limit on that
liability under what I might call section 21
contracts was increased to $200 million, and
in the amendment proposed in the bill now
before us there is suggested a further increase
to $400 million. The minister explained that
the present limit of $200 million is almost
used up, or is about to be used up, and that
is the reason for the contemplated increase.
There is another function of the corporation,
which is really quite apart from its original
function of issuing policies of insurance on
exports, and which was first enacted in the
statutes of 1959 when section 21A was introduced into the legislation.
Section 21A authorizes the corporation to
guarantee, and generally to deal in instruments such as bills of exchange or promissory
notes given by foreign importers to Canadian
exporters which, when so guaranteed by the
corporation, are termed "guaranteed instruments". But, at that time in 1959 a joint limit
was placed upon both contracts of insurance
which the corporation could issue under section 21 and the liabilities of importers which
could be guaranteed under section 2 1A of

$200 million, which is the same figure that
had been authorized for the corporation with
respect to insurance contracts only in the
previous year.
In 1961 that was changed. These liabilities
were separated, and it was provided again
that the corporation could incur liabilities
under insurance policies under section 21 to
the extent of $200 million, but that it could
also guarantee the contracts of importers on
guaranteed instruments issued under section
21A for a further $200 million.
In the earlier session of this year that was
again changed by increasing from $200 million
to $300 million the maximum liability of importers under guaranteed instruments which
the corporation was authorized to guarantee.
So, honourable senators, if this legislation
is adopted the corporation, under sections 21
and 21A, will be empowered to obligate itself
to the extent of $700 million; $400 million by
way of direct contracts of insurance, and $300
million by way of guarantees on importers,
instruments called "guaranteed instruments".
That is a considerable increase in the last
f ew years.
These guaranteed instruments under section
21A partake of the same nature as the corporation's insurance policies under section 21 to
this extent and in this manner, that they,
too, must be authorized by the Governor in
Council, and all financing transactions entered
into by the corporation in relation to these
guaranteed instruments are entered into for
the account of the Government and not of
the corporation itself, and they form no part of
the corporation's profits or its capital or its
assets of any kind.
I think it is fair to say that since the
amendment of 1959 the corporation has gone
much further afield than the mere issuing of
insurance policies to Canadian exporters under either section 13 or section 21, which was
really its sole function for the first eleven
years of its existence. The corporation is now
actively engaged under the direction of, and
for the account of, the Government in the
financing of Canadian export trade, and the
manner in which it can do that and its
activities in relation to the financing of export
trade are being further increased by section
3 of this amending bill.
I should say that heretofore the corporation
has had the right, since the amendment of
1959, to guarantee the obligations of a foreign
importer, but henceforth, as is proposed by
section 3 of this bill, it will not only have
the right to guarantee the obligations of a
foreign importer but it will also have the
right to advance money itself to the foreign
importer. I suppose the way in which this
will work-and I have tried to think it out

OCTOBER 24, 1962
in my own mind-would be this: Suppose a
Canadian exporter wishes to sell a million
dollars' worth of steel rails to, let us say, the
Government of Liberia, and that government
desires to pay for the shipment on an extended
basis of five years. As matters stand now,
that government could give the Canadian
exporter a promissory note for $1 million
payable five years hence and that note could
be guaranteed by the corporation.
Under the proposed amendment, the corporation could go further than that; it could
advance the money to the Government of
Liberia itself to pay off the Canadian exporter
and it could itself lend the money to the
Government of Liberia and take the latter's
promissory note.
As my honourable friend the minister (Hon.
Mr. McCutcheon) pointed out yesterday evening, quite a number of these transactions
now are apparently transactions between
Canadian exporters and the governments of
foreign countries; and the governments of
foreign countries prefer to deal directly with a
government authority in the country of export. One can well understand that that is a
logical reason for making the necessary
changes.
There are some features of section 21A
which I do not understand too well, in relation to the financing of these guaranteed
instruments and which are still further extended by section 3 of the bill. It would
almost seem as if the corporation were taking
the power to become an issuing house for
securities and to sel guaranteed instruments
of this kind to the public. Whether that is
intended or has ever been done, I do not
know. That is a point we should discuss
when the bill goes to committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Where
does that appear in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is in section 3. The
corporation is entitled not only to lend money
to an importer but to guarantee the payment
of an instrument, to purchase a guaranteed
instrument, to lend money to the holder of
a guaranteed instrument and to sell to any
person a guaranteed instrument.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: That, of course, is
in the present act.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is true. I am not
saying that has changed. It is enlarged in the
bill. I think we should have some explanation
in committee as to what forms of transactions
take place now and are contemplated under
these wide powers that are conferred upon
the corporation in this respect.
I think the bill is one which generally
speaking deserves the support of honourable
senators. As so often happens in these cases,

when the bill goes to the appropriate standing committee we should have before us the
heads of the department of government which
actually administers and operates this most
interesting legislation, so that we will be able
to satisfy ourselves on the general way in
which the intentions of Parliament are being
carried out.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I think we all agree that the bill
has been very well explained to the Senate
by the honourable gentleman who has just
spoken (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). The minister
who introduced the bill (Hon. Mr. McCutcheon) suggested that it should go to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, and with that we would all agree. I
feel that in committee we should have as
full an account as possible of the business
which this organization has been carrying on.
Reference was made this afternoon by the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) to the fact that this has been a
very successful financial organization and that
a profit of $1,400,000 had been made.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: After income tax.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is
most commendable, but probably there have
been losses and perhaps we could get information in committee as to where those
losses have occurred. Moreover, there seems
to be a large number of accounts outstanding
at present-a large amount in dollars, in any
event. Are any of those accounts at present
in arrears? I feel that information should be
before the committee and no doubt the minister will arrange to have it presented.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: I move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
With reference to what the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) has said, I may say that
the president of the corporation will be
present in the committee and all the information which honourable senators desire
will be available.
Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 18, consideration of His Excellency the

SENATE
Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Honourable
Mr. Haig, seconded by Honourable Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address
in reply thereto.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I rise on this first occasion with that deference
which a newcomer here is privileged to give
to the great traditions and the near-century
of achievement of this honourable chamber
and its distinguished members past and
present.
I rise also with that sense of personal
diffidence which befits one who lacks, as I
do, the parliamentary experience which is to
be found here in such abundance. Indeed, I
find it here in such superfluity that on this
occasion I would fain borrow some of it if
I could.
It is beyond my powers to express fully the
emotions that arise at this time. For many
years I have observed and admired from
outside the great institutions of Parliament,
of which this chamber is not the least, but I
had not, until a very short time ago, hoped
for or expected the honour of a summons
to attend here and take part in your
deliberations.
I cannot allow the occasion to pass without
expressing my thanks to the Prime Minister
for what I take to be his hope that I may here
prove in time to be of some usefulness to my
country. I say "my country" because Canada
is my country, although I came to live here
only forty years ago, having been born in
Dublin, Ireland-born, I am proud to say, a
subject of that same Crown to which I renewed my allegiance as a Canadian citizen
in your presence only a few weeks ago.
Indeed, honourable senators, I can think
of no better precedent for my life-long loyalty
to the same Crown, as an Irishman and a
Canadian, than the fact that I am here
assigned to a seat in a Canadian Parliament
with an honourable Canadian Senator O'Leary
on my immediate left and another honourable
Canadian Senator O'Leary on my immediate
right.
May I pay my respects to Your Honour
and add my congratulations to those already
so eloquently expressed by others on the
high place to which you have been called.
I have been tremendously impressed by the
dignity and distinction which you have
brought to the Chair. I could not help thinking on many occasions how pleased one who
was your friend and admirer, and I believe
my friend too, would have been to see you
here. I refer, of course, to your successor in
another place, the late Sidney Smith.
The honourable senator from River Heights
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable senator

(Hon. Mr.
from Madawaska-Restigouche
Fournier) are not in the chamber today.
Senator Haig is absent on a sad duty which
was referred to earlier; and Senator Fournier
is away on the nation's business.
However, I would like to add my congratulations to those already expressed on
the splendid manner in which they moved
the motion which is under discussion. It
seems to me they set a high standard for uswho, I suppose, are inevitably to be called
"the new ones", though I hope not for longto follow as best we may.
I also offer my congratulations to my
leader, the honourable senator from Royal
(Hon. Mr. Brooks), and also to his predecessor, the distinguished Privy Councillor who
now sits on his left (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
I wish the new leader full success in the
discharge of his important responsibilities.
I think it is appropriate that I add, even
at this late date, something about the recent
indication of the sagacity and persuasive
genius of our Prime Minister in what he has
done to grace our front bench here by the
presence of the senator from Gormley (Hon.
Mr. McCutcheon). At the same time, I pay
my respects to the senator from La Salle (Hon.
Mr. Drouin) and congratulate him on his
birthday. I wish him at least the third quarter
of his century here, whatever his plans may
be for his future after that, of which I am not
competent to speak at this moment.
Finally, I pay my respects to the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) who now, as I understand it, graces
the third of the high places of Parliament,
to which he has given distinguished service
for so many years. I extend to him my
sincere sympathy in his recent bereavement,
and I am sure he has found considerable
comfort in the knowledge of the admiration
and affection in which Mrs. Macdonald was
held by all who knew her.
Honourable senators, I apologize that on
this occasion I am not competent to address
this chamber in the French language. I hope
in due course, if I am here long enough, to
make lamends. I have two teenage daughters
who are becoming fluent in both languages.
A long time ago I determined that in this,
as in many other respects, they were going
to be better Canadians than I am. Being
teenagers, they are doing their best to bring
me up to their standards.
When the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) opened discussion from the other side on the motion before
us, I found myself wondering at his charm
and his eloquence, and also wondering how
it was possible for any man, even with his
wide experience, to say such terrible things

SENATE
confidence. I find it interesting to note, however, that the September issue of the official
publication of that association, called Industry, dealt with the subject in the clearest
possible language which would seem to leave
no doubt as to its meaning. In that issue I
read these words:
How fares the Canadian economy as
summer gives way to fall in this year
1962?
The answer is that it is faring very
well indeed. Most of the mid-year statistics relating to business and industrial
activity are now available and they make
impressive reading.
Industrial production in the first six
months of this year was up more than
9 per cent... Likewise, manufacturers'
shipments. Retail sales were higher by
more than 5 per cent.
Then it goes on to say:
Output of . .. cars and. . .trucks climbed
by more than 30 per cent in the first
half. .. sales by more than 20 per cent.
The number of new...dwellings under

construction at the end of July was 9
per cent greater than a year earlier,
while the number of completions in the
first six months... was 11 per cent
greater...
The buoyancy of the economy in general and of the manufacturing industry
in particular was the reason why there
was a record number of Canadians at
work at the end of July-180,000 more
than a year earlier-and why nearly
50,000 fewer were without employment.
Significantly, of those who were looking for a job-4.5 per cent of the total
labour force-only one in three had been
unemployed for more than three months.
(In the U.S. unemployment hasn't fallen
below 5 per cent since 1957). Even so,
what all this increased business activity
means-and we ought surely to recognize it-is that more Canadians than ever
before are living better than ever
before...
Then the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) sought to identify
Mr. Carl Pollock, President of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association, as "one of our
own people who has lost confidence in
Canada". That would surprise Mr. Pollock if
he read it, because here is what he said on
October 1, 1962, as reported in the Daily
News of St. John's, Newfoundland:
Industrial production, manufacturers'
shipments, retail sales, individual earnings and savings are all showing increases
with most of them running at record

levels. The fact that there were 180,000
more Canadians with jobs at the end of
July than was the case a year earlier,
tells its own story.
Again, in Halifax, Mr. Pollock is reported
in the Halifax Chronicle-Herald issue of
October 5, 1962, to this effect:
Times are far from bad and to create
any impression to the contrary is to do
no service to Canada.
Honourable senators, I am new here, I am
new to this kind of debate, and I find it increasingly difficult to understand how in the
face of statements like that it can be said that
our Canadian economy is not going ahead.
And there are many more.
It seems to me that this strange story of
lack of confidence in Canada was the underlying theme of the address to which I have
referred. And yet, if I were to put all the
objective evidence, the evidence of a cloud
of witnesses, on the record I am afraid that
in the next Glassco Commission Report the
Queen's Printer would be under severe criticism for redundance.
May I be permitted to read a few extracts.
From Spotlight on Canada, the official
publication of the Mercantile Bank of Canada
(Montreal), in its mid-September issue, I
read:
The Canadian economy performed
better than was expected and will come
closer to matching early-year expansionary expectations than will that of the
United States.
Let us go to the other end of the country.
In the Victoria Daily Colonist issue of October 3, 1962 I read:
Mr. Pearson should know that Canada
has entered into an era of development
which calls for its people to show pride
and confidence in themselves and their
country-not despair and defeatism.
Honourable senators, I could go on and on
in this vein. Three years ago the Prime
Minister, when reporting on the first year of
recovery from a recession-I think it is fair
to call it, if not a Liberal recession at least
one that started when the Liberals were in
office-said:
Canadians worked more, earned more,
spent more and saved more than in any
year in history.
That has been true of every year since, and
it is more true in this year 1962. This year
we reached successive new peaks in such
major economic fields as national output, employment, income, consumption, and foreign
trade. In the first two quarters of this year,
the real gross national product-and let

OCTOBER 24, 1962
me emphasize that word "real"-seasonally
adjusted, has averaged 7.8 per cent higher
than a year ago. It does not sound to me as
though the economy is on the decline.
Some honourable senators will perhaps
remember the now famous "Six Indicators of
Recovery" cited by President Kennedy in his
radio address on August 13 last. I have had
a comparison made of the figures the
President gave with our own figures, and it
is quite clear that we have done better than
the United States for a considerable period
of time. Let me give some examples for the
period of a year and a half between January
1961 and the second quarter of 1962.
In gross national product, the Canadian
increase in real terrns was 9.8 per cent compared to 8.5 per cent for the United States.
In personal disposable income, the Canadian
increase was 11.1 per cent higher, compared
with 7.8 per cent of the United States. In
corporate profits before taxes, the Canadian
increase was 44.7 per cent higher, compared
with 27.9 per cent in the United States.
In wages and salaries, we did not do quite
as well but we came very close to the American rate, our rate of increase being 8.7 per
cent compared with 9.1 per cent in the
United States.
Unemployment in Canada in this same
period of a year and a half between January
1961 and August 1962, declined 62 per cent,
almost double the United States decline of
31.2 per cent. That same ratio applies when
allowance is made for seasonal factors.
Industrial production-and here I take the
somewhat longer period of two and a half
years, from January 1960 to July 1962-rose
8.5 per cent in Canada compared with 6.9
per cent in the United States.
I am sorry to take up the time of honourable senators with these figures, but for
whatever effect they may have on others I,
as a Canadian, am proud of them and I think
they are a justifiable cause of pride for
every Canadian. I do not pretend to be an
economist, but when I read this proof that
my country is surpassing the rate of progress
of the richest nation in the world I for one
want to stand up and cheer for Canada, and
I have not too much patience for thoseoutside this chamber of course-who seem
to want only to sit on their hands and sigh.
It may be said that I am giving the facts
for the last year and a half or two years only.
I have done so for two reasons: firstly, because it seems to me that this was the period
on which the address to which I have reference laid most emphasis; and, secondly, because this is the culmination of the efforts of
this Government to bring about this kind of
prosperity despite the situation it inherited
in 1957.
27511-5-9j

I am not going to attempt to assess responsibility for that. We all know that these
things come in cycles, but I do seem to remember that in spite of some criticisms that
have been made about statements made by
the Government side in the last election, no
one would argue that the true state of the
economy in the election campaign of 1957
was exactly proclaimed from the roof-tops
by the members of the then Government.
That was referred to, if the grammar can be
pardoned, as the "You never had it so good"
election.
I shall not refer to the famous report that
came out shortly after the present Government took office.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), in his excellent report
of the other day on the potash development
in Saskatchewan, spoke of the $40 million
gamble by an American company and pointed
out how much we should welcome that kind
of investment in Canada. Of course I agree
with him, but I find it hard to reconcile that
with the conduct of some others who seem to
be going about Canada and other places saying to prospective investors, "Watch out.
You only think you have confidence in Canada. We Liberals know better."
There is one particular aspect of this which
I suggest is of great importance. During the
election, the Prime Minister and others
drew attention to the general prosperity of
the nation and progress of the economy. They
said there was progress and there was prosperity. Since then it has been said in some
quarters-those same quarters that seem to
me to so strangely resent any good news
about Canada-that the true facts have not
been given you.
Let us be fair. The fact of the matter is that
the progress of the economy in the last three
months after the election surpassed any prediction made by the Prime Minister during
the campaign and, as far as I have read, any
prediction made by any cabinet minister.
Time-and I do not mean Time magazineis a great corrector of untruths. The Sudbury
Star, which nobody will say is a Conservative
paper, carried an editorial on October 11,
headed, "These are 'Tough' Times? Evidence
Contradicts Claim". The editorial reads:
Each week provides further proof of
the falsehoods spread around the country

Canadians still have abounding confidence
in their country and its future despite the
downgrading political tactics in which
opponents of the government engaged.

SENATE
activity. City after city reports high values
in building permits and decreases in unemployment figures.
What do the 'downgrading' politicians
have to say about that? How come there
is so much new building and so much
employment in Canada if we are going
to the dogs?
These are more than straws in the wind.
They provide the concrete proof that
Canada is still forging ahead and the
'tough times' exist only in the minds of
opponents of the government and those
who believe the vote-seeking fairy tales.
The evidence is conclusive that the
Canadian economy is nothing like the
prophets of doom portray it and the
Canadian people should turn aside from
the crying towels proffered by politicians
whose main aim is to get into office.
Then we have heard it said, despite the
clearest evidence to the contrary, that the exchange crisis denied the truth of the Prime
Minister's statements about the general state
of the economy. I do not think that is true.
As a matter of fact, honourable senators, I
am told that one of the major aspects of
the relationship between national prosperity
and our exchange situation is that of cause and
effect. That is so because imports for manufacturing, and for consumer use, and nonresident dividends going out, together form
more than one-half of the drain on our foreign
exchange reserves. So, under normal circumstances, the greater the prosperity of this nation the greater the drain on our foreign exchange reserves. That is one of the many
paradoxes of our unique and complex economy.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
then said-I thought, with a shudder-that
we had a record of "deficit after deficit." Those
were the words he used. Nobody likes deficits-national, corporate, or personal. However, I would remind honourable senatorsand I think these are interesting figuresthat our total deficit in the last four years
was about $2.1 billion, but the increasesand I emphasize the word "increases"-made
by the present administration in the field of
social justice, for human betterment, and
on that account alone in these five years, total
$5.3 billion. Yet, some honourable senators
have commented on the need for greater social
justice payments in this country.
To take one other item, the annual increases
in federal payments to the provinces total
another $2.5 billion. So here we have a deficit
of just over $2 billion for these two items,
and a total cumulative increase of about $8
billion.
I am aware that there are those who do not
think these increases should have been made,

but, honourable senators, I think such individuals would have a hard time convincing
the old-age pensioners, the hospitalized, the
needy, the unemployed, the disabled and the
people of our provinces that they received
more than they needed or deserved.
Regarding deficits, I think it noteworthy
that the policy of the Government of having
deficits in certain years has some support in
very high places-high places which I think
honourable senators opposite would recognize
as authoritative. For example, the Leader of
the Opposition in the other place, as reported
in the Globe and Mail of June 8, 1962, said
that he:
. . . would not be opposed to a Liberal
Government incurring additional federal
deficits for the next year or two.
How readily do some political pied pipers
change their tune.
There was also a reference in the address
of the honourable Leader of the Opposition
here to the lack of confidence on the part of
Canadian farmers. I believe the election
results gave rather a full answer to that
assertion, and I am not surprised because in
1961 the gross cash income of Canadian
farmers was up by 39j per cent, a new record,
and it is going to set a new record again this
year.
There was also a reference to lack of confidence on the part of American investors. I
read a statement issued by the United States
Department of Commerce which said that the
intention of American businessmen is to
invest $2.2 billion in Canada in the next two
years. That is higher than the average
attained over a long period of time.
It was said that warnings about unemployment have gone unheeded. The phrase used
was:
It was laughed off and we were merely
described as gloomsters and doomsters.
The last part of the sentence may be true,
but I am sure the honourable senator's intention was exaggerated by the words he used
at that time, because this recurring problem
of unemployment has been with us since
1867, and even before, and it bas never, that
I have heard or read of, been "laughed off"
by any Canadian government.
I wonder if the honourable senator had a
temporary lapse of memory about such things
as winter works-an entirely new concept,
a brilliant new approach to this problem. I
wonder if he had just forgotten for the
moment the tremendous Government program
that bas resulted in the building of threequarters of a million housing units in Canada
in the past five years, almost half of them
having direct Government support. We have
the results.

OCTOBER 24, 1962
In September, unemployment was down ta
3.9 per cent of the labour force. No one is
happy when anyone is unemplayed in this
country. I quote another authority, Walter
Gardon, wha I think will be recagnized on
the other side af this chamber. In his i amaus
repart af 1956 he said that 4 per cent af the
labour farce unemplayed was f ull emplayment; and he even quated some American
ecanamists as saying that 5 per cent m.ight
well be full employment. That is interesting,
because we have heard it said that the Prime
Minister's predictian ai full emplayment this
summer did not came true. The September
figures make it clear that it did.
May I read one mare paragraph fram the
address which interested me? The honourable
senator first quated these wards framn the
Speech fromi the Throne, which is the subject
ai this debate:
The purposes oi the fiscal measures ta
be placed bef are you at this session will
be the creatian af better employment
apportunities for the Canadian people . .
the strengthening af Canada's balance
of international payments and the maintenance ai stability in prices.
Then the honourable senatar asked the
following question:
Honourable senatars, those are fine
words-indeed, a worthy endeavaur-but
what evidence is there af any action an
the part ai the Government ta give effect
ta those fine words?
If facts had teeth I believe that the honourable senator might have been bitten, because
the evidence was at hand on the three specific
points that he singled out.
"Better employment apportunities": The
evidence is that, as he spoke, new jobs were
being created in this country at the rate ai
150,000 a year.
"The strengthening ai Canada's balance ai
international payments": The evidence is that,
as he spoke, the very measures he referred ta
were restoring $636 million ta aur foreign
exchange reserves, and attaining new alltime records in the expansion ai exports
which the year before had reached a paint
where we had a favourable balance ai commodity trade for the first time in a decade.
"Maintenance ai stability in prices": The
evidence is that, again as the honourable senator was speaking, the Dominion Bureau ai
Statistics was compiling figures which would
show an actual drap in the cost ai living in
Canada in the month ai August--and that
despite ail the statements we heard during
the election campaign about the terrible
thlngs the stabilization ai the dollar was
going ta do ta prices in Canada. I repeat, the
cost ai living was down in August. Nat only

that, if I remember the figures correctly, in
the last five-year period the rate ai increase
in the cost ai living has been just over 1
per cent, as against a
per cent, maybe 1l
more than 2 per cent increase in the previaus
10 years.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is that 2 per cent per
year?
Hon. Mr. Grasari: There was a 2.1 per cent
per year increase over the 10-year period,
1947 ta 1957; and between 1 and 2 per cent
-I do not remember the exact figure, but
certainly less than 2 per cent-in the last five
years.
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has
an officiai publication called "Canadian Business" In treating a longer period ai tixne, it
says this:
A 12-nation comparison ai retail price
increases over the 12 months up ta May
this year shows that Canada has been the
mast successulThat is, the most successful ai the 12
nations-in keeping down the cost ai living.
The Canadian increase was just under
1 per cent. The United States' was a
shade more. Biggest increases were in
France, Holland and the United Kingdam, where the cost ai living rose by
over 5 per cent. In Germany and Sweden
it rose by 4 per cent.
These figures relate ta one year. I hope
those are being worked over by the statisticians ai the Comman Market, as well by
those who like ta make uniavaurable campansons between Canada and these countries.
Now, I wonder if any iurther evidence is
necessary. Let me just run over a iew headlines, and I shail abbreviate them as much
as 1 can. I think it is important that I put it
on record that this is not just one newspaper
here or there, or one bank here or there; it
is a chorus or cloud ai witnesses that I amn
bringing here ta support what I am saying.
The President ai the Toronto-Dominion Banxk,
on October 11, said-and I will abbreviate the
citations:
The Canadian dollar crisis is aven and
while some problenis remain ta be solved,
they are not insurmountable.
Then, inom John Meyer, financlal editor ai
the Montreal Gazette, on Octoben 12:
Enough has been accamplished-in devaluation, impont surcharges, expert financing-ta show what can be accomplished if the process ai adaption to the
economy's requirements is continued.

SENATE
Then, from the "Business Review of the
Bank of Montreal, September 26, 1962:
It is evident that the emergency program announced three months ago in
support of the fixed exchange rate established at the beginning of May has been
successful in restoring stability and confidence in the Canadian exchange market.
I will skip some others. Any honourable
senator who would like to see some more may
have them. I have a pile of them.
Then, from the editor of the FinancialPost,
October 13:
Mr. Diefenbaker's administration, despite its minority existence and unsure
tenure, has given intimations of marshalling the very great resources of the federal government to create a better climate
for business progress and individual wellbeing.
Then, from Leslie Wilson in the Globe and
Mail of October 19-these are all current
references; I am not going back to history
at this time, though I shall in a moment:
These surcharges ....

have sparked a

significant round of plans among secondary manufacturers to expand their
operations. Even if the surcharges must
be removed within a year or so, it is
argued they will have created consumption patterns whereby some Canadian
manufactures will have displaced imports.
Then, in the Ottawa Journal of October 10,
1962, Mr. Jack Pembroke, President of the
Royal Trust Company, said:
The Canadian dollar bas strengthened
and there is little need for government
intervention to maintain it at a fixed
rate.... There is more money for investment than first-class mortgages available in Canada today....

There is evi-

dence of overseas money now coming
into the country....
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): What evidence is there?
Hon. Mr. Grosar±: I am quoting Mr. Jack
Pembroke, who says there is evidence of
overseas money coming into the country.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I am asking, what evidence is there?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Could I reserve that
for the next occasion when I have the honour
of speaking here?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I am sorry
I interrupted the honourable senator.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Then, even In the
Toronto Daily Star of October 13 we read:
The Diefenbaker Government's austerity program has helped to restore the
health of the Canadian dollar.
And even Bruce Hutchison, writing not,
it is true, in the Victoria Daily Times, but in
the Christian Science Monitor of October 5:
Despite a foreign exchange crisis and
an official program of "austerity", Canada's troubled economy achieved rapid
growth in the first nine months of 1962.
Now we come to the last statement by the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) which I think I should
refer to at this time. He said:
. . . there seems to be only one person
who has any confidence in the administration-or, at least, did have any confidence
in the administration-and that is the
Prime Minister himself.
Now, of course, it would be unfair not to
recognize that it was obviously a rhetorical
statement, and not meant to be taken too
seriously. However, I would like to use it
as an occasion to bring to your attention
some further comments that I have to make,
and these will be my closing comments. I use
this quotation to bring them within the rules
of relevancy, because I am going to speak
of the excesses of partisanship in other places
and at other times. I am not speaking about
anything that has happened in this honourable chamber, but I would like to mention
the harm such excesses have done and are
doing to Canada.
I think we have come to the time when
deliberate, planned, attacks on Canada and
on the Prime Minister of Canada must be
branded as a disservice to Canada, whatever
service they may be presumed to give to
lesser interests. I am not referring to any
isolated instances or occasional outbursts, or
what at the time looked like clever devices
but turned out to be merely vulgar. I am
referring to planned tactics and ordered stratagems which fail to distinguish between the
licence traditionally recorded in political controversy and what is regarded as the responsibility which should restrain any Canadian from deliberately downgrading Canada
and attempting to debase the office of Prime
Minister, or that of the Leader of the
Opposition, or any of the high offices of
state.
However, in the recent election and since,
we have had a distinct lowering of the level
of political controversy in this country. I
thought we had come some of the way from
the organized personal attacks and organized
physical violence which took place in other

OCTOBER 24, 1962
days-but they have been recently revived
as one of the devices in the armoury of some
who would bring down the Govermnent.
This might be described by some as emotionalism, competitiveness, and the desperate
ambition which seems to characterize some
of the Opposition partisanship at this time,
were it not for the clear evidence of the harm
that has been done to Canada by those who
seem to think that there is no other way to
get into office than to deny Canada's progress,
to undermine the confidence of Canadians
in their country and to ridicule the honest
efforts being made by others in the interests
of the nation and its people.
And yet I have seen these things done
within recent months, and I think I know
enough about the mechanics of politics to
recognize that some of them are organized.
Surely it is time to call a hait. Surely there
are political actions which can be criticized,
partisan politics which can be challenged,
party programs which can be controverted,
without resort to personal attacks on Canada
and personal attacks on Canadians.
I recognize, of course, the truth of the
old maxim-and I won't quote it in Latinof Publilius Syrus two thousand years ago:
In heated argument we are apt to lose
sight of the truth.
Surely this is not a time for us to lose
sight of the truth. Let those who think it
proper, seek to bring down the Governmentnothing wrong in that. But let those of all
political parties remember that one of the
main functions of all political parties is to

I shall quote Mr. Chalmers' conclusion in
a moment, but I should like to comment for
a second on those two historical references,
because I think there is nothing I can say
that will point more truly to the real nature
of the choice before the Canadian people today, between a Conservative administration
and a Liberal administration.
The 1887 reference is, of course, to the
infamous "axle-grease" statement by the
great Liberal leader. The Liberals had the
answer to this fundamental question that
faced Canada then as it does now, and their
answer, according to Professor Creighton,
dean of Canadian history, was that
The very idea of a separate, viable

after 15 years of Liberal administration, was
almost precisely the same, namely, the survival of the concept of Canadianism in North
America. I am not quoting yet, but I do offer
again the interpretation of the historian rather
than my own. His chapter is entitled "The
Turning of the tide", and in that chapter
Professor Creighton says that in that election,
as in the other, it was in the traditional
confidence of the Conservative party in Canada that:
. . . this robust feeling of Canadian

nationhood found vehement political expression.
Of the Liberal party's attitude-and how
little times change, honourable senators-he
says:
...

in

this vitally important

respect,

it was a sharp departure from the national policies of the past. It was precisely this departure which the Canadian
people was moved, by the strongest inner
compulsion, to reject.. . And in the
election of 1911 they shook off the leadership of those who seemed to be trying
to divert them from their course.
So, honourable senators, here we are in
the year 1962, facing the same issue once
more. We have a Conservative administration with a national policy. We have a Conservative administration that is opposing the
old and discredited counsel of non-confidence
in Canada, and once again it raises a strong
voice for Canadian interests. Once again it is
confident that we can pay for the axlegrease in every part of the land, even from
"igloo to igloo". Once again we have the
leadership of a great Canadian who has,

like Sir John, three times defeated his principal detractors, and will do so again.
I bring the story up to date, using the
words of Mr. Chalmers of the Maclean-Hunter
Publishing Company, and in the same context
from which I quoted earlier, in the hope that
they will be framed over the desks of all the
doubters in this nation including, I suggest,
a few members of his own organization who
do not appear to share his objectivity or his
optimism. Here are his words:
Now it is 1962. We are told by a great
many people that the Commonwealth is
finished; that Canada's export industries
are in for deep trouble. There are people
in Canada who think that the great Canadian experiment is over; that it has
been proven that we cannot build an
East-West nation against a North-South
economic grain; that we would be better
to join up in economic union with the
United States.
There is just as much nonsense in
such talk today as there was in the
gloom of 75, 50 and 25 years ago.
Canada is today a nation with a will
of its own; with a way of life of its
own that it cherishes and intends to
preserve; with opportunities in the economic and cultural fields as bright and
promising as those of any nation on
earth.
I apologize, honourable senators, for trespassing for so long on your time. Thank you
for your attendance and your kind attention.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fergusson, debate
adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

OCTOBER 25, 1962
The honourable senator frorn Gormley (Hon.
Mr. McCutcheon) has merited and received
my admiration since I first knew him when
he was President of the Canadian Welfare
Council, and particularly since I heard his
presidential address in 1957, which seemed to
me a very sensible and intelligent statement
of the way a layman looks at welf are. 1
wish that more laymen in the welfare field
in Canada had similar views.
I listened, perhaps with more than usual
interest, to the maiden speech of the honourable senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary), who has had such a long and distinguished journalistic career. As hie dipped
into the past and recalled for us other times
and other faces, I arn sure that his references brought back nostalgic memories to
every honourable senator who was privileged
to hear him. However, I feel that I must disagree with him on a number of issues which
hie discussed, and I regret that hie is not
present today.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): He will
read your speech.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Times have indeed
changed with the passage of years, and it is
true that Canada's press can no longer be
designated by political affiliation. to the degree
possible in the past. It would also appear
that we are likely to find there is not the
sanie spirit of adherence at all times to the.
two-party systern in Canada. Frankly, I do
not think these are necessarily retrograde
developments. We have had diversions from
the two-party system before, and some of
those whom I consider arnongst our finest
members of Parliament of the past have been
members of some other parties. I arn sure
that if the two-party system is in the best
interests of the Canadian people, it will
ultimately prevail. I certainly feel that
present-day Canadians are just as înterested
in Canada's welfare and its future as were
the people of Canada at any time in the
past, and that in the fullness of time this
will become abundantly clear.
I arn sure we ahl learned with regret that
the honourable senator seems to entertain
some misgivings concerning the atmosphere
of titis place, and that he feels it may be a
littie difficuit for him to adjust to this
chamber. In fact, to me the tenor of his
remarks rather suggested the cynicism which
he seerns to feel exists in Canada regarding
parties and public men. I arn sure 1 speak
for all honourable senators when I assure
him that in order to adjust here he will flnd,
with the passage of time, that it will not be
necessary for hlm to divest hirnself of his
philosophy of life or those principles that
have been his guideposts throughi the years.

However, I arn sure that with his long association with the Canadian political scene, the
honourable senator will agree with me that
in the grand scheme of Confederation, the
founding fathers very clearly had in mind
the establishment of a second place where,
on occasion, the problenis confronting the
nation could be considered, removed to some
extent at least, from the heated political
atmosphere which on occasions prevails in
the other place. I think there have been occasions in rather recent memory when many
Canadians, if not the majority, have offered.
prayerful thanks for the foresight of our
founding fathers.
Obviously the honourable senator's ideas
on the subjeet of political partisanship in the
Senate conflict basically with those of the
Right Honourable Arthur Meighen who, the
senator frorn Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary)
stated, was his hero of public life.
In a speech by the Right Honourable Senator Meighen made before the Canadian Club
of Montreal, and reprinted as an appendix to
the Senate Hansard 0f August 6, 1960, hie
said:
The Senate is worthless if it becomes
merely another Commons divided upon
party lines and indulging in party debates such as are familiar in the Lower
Chamber session after session. If the
Senate ever permits itself to fulfil that
function and that alone in the scheme o!
Confederation, then the sooner it is abolished the better.
Honourable senators, when I first entered
this chamber I was happy to see that partisanship did flot invade it, and on many occasions
when I was called to speak outside o! the
Senate on the subject of my experiences here
I stressed this point, and I quoted in support
of my argument statements from speeches by
Senator Meighen, Senator Dandurand, Senator Roebuck, and by the recently deceased
Senator John T. Haig, who was surnmoned to
the Senate in 1935 and was Leader of the
Conservative party in this house from 1945
to 1957.
The late Senator Haig was highly regarded
by members of both sides of this house, as
those who were not here during his time will
learn by reading in Hansard the many
speeches regarding him when, after a seriousý
accident in 1953, he was incapacitated for a
time and unable to be with us. When he,
returned hie received. many congratulatory
speeches, not ail frorn the members of his
own party. It is true that, he always remained.
loyal to the philosophy, and principles of bis:
party, but as far as I can remember he was
careful not to intrude pro-vocative -teferences
to them into this chamber.

SENATE
When Senator Haig spoke to the Rotary
Club at London, Ontario, in 1952 he said:
My experience bas taught me that at
first when a new member comes into the
Senate his political leanings are very
marked, but as time goes on he realizes
that his duty as a senator is so important
that be should forget his politics and put
his country first.
Honourable senators, if I should be called
upon to make a similar speech I would not
be honest if I said that at the present time
the Senate is still following that tradition. I
deeply regret this departure because I am
one who agrees with another statement made
by the late Arthur Meighen in the same
speech from which I quoted earlier:
Members of the Second Chamber must
get away, lift their minds far fron those
hard-drawn lines of party, or they cannot serve their country.
However, I feel that when very partisan
statements have been made, as they have
been made here recently, some answers should
be forthcoming.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: In listening to the
honourable senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary) I found myself in substantial agreement when be expressed amazement at the
things government can do, and at some of
the things that have been done during the
past five years. However, I did find it difficult
to follow him in his suggestion that the
Government had been inarticulate. How can
this be when they have had the services of
such well-known public relations artists as
the honourable senator from Pickering (Hon.
Mr. Grosart), the man who is known from
coast to coast as "Mr. Canada" and, last but
not least, the honourable senator from Carleton himself?
Publicity bas followed the Government's
actions, and certainly few issues have received
such worldwide attention over the past quarter century, and stirred the Canadian people
to such depths, as did the Coyne affair, the
attempt to talk the dollar down which culminated in the dollar crisis, and the Government's handling of the Common Market
problem.
I found myself again in agreement with the
honourable senator when he stated that we
could only consider the Speech from the
Throne in a realistic and useful way when
the legislation which stems from it comes
before this bouse. It is hoped that it will not
be too long before Government policy in
respect to some of the more urgent issues
becomes apparent.

In this connection I would like to refer
to a press report of certain remarks made by
Per Jacobsson, the Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund, as reported
in the Montreal Star under date of September
17 last. The report reads:
Fund managing director Per Jacobsson
told reporters at a weekend press conference he hoped the success of Canada's
austerity program would not lead her
people to believe economie stability could
be achieved without additional permanent
measures for the future.
Jacobsson said he found it "very
useful" that Bank of Canada governor
Louis Rasminsky's recent report made
Ottawa belief clear that steps taken so
far did not eliminate the need for a
long-term solution to the country's financial crisis.
Mr. Jacobsson also said:
I hope Canada's emergency program is
not too successful, or they will think a
long-term program is not needed.
To me, one of the most disturbing and
distressing features of the present situation
is our apparent loss of stature among our
friends abroad and our near neighbours-.
and I say this in spite of the protest of my
friends opposite.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: The remarks of the
Managing Director of the International
Monetary Fund, which I have read to you,
certainly suggest some doubt as to what he
thinks may be expected from us. Obviously
we have lost stature in the United States. The
remarks of the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary), in dealing with
the Common Market and the position of the
British Government, and his references to
the stand taken by the British press, leave
little doubt but that our relations with the
British people are at an all-time low.
I cannot agree with the honourable senator
that in Canada discussion of the Common
Market is almost illiterate. Certainly there is
wide consciousness of Canada's present and
future dependence on foreign markets for
the extension of our economy, and that good
relations are more or less a prerequisite to
expanding trade. There bas also been wide
discussion of the possibility that Great Britain
rnight find it essential to ber welfare and
survival to join the Common Market. With
discussion centred on these basic premises,
I cannot see how the public can be considered illiterate on the subject.
As far back as June 1960, when I was
addressing this house during the debate on

OCTOBER 25, 1992
the resolution introduced by the honourable
senator from. Sheiburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), on the desirability of Canada entering
into reciprocal trade agreements with the
countries of the 21-nation group, so that by
becoming associated with their 500 million
people we might remove the tragic possibilities of Canada's becoming isolated from the
great modern currents of trade, I urged that
we should begin to consolidate our position.
It seems unfortunate that so littie has been
accomplished along this lime since that time.
Meanwhile, as we aUl know, the United
States has embarked on a new world trading
policy. The recent cail by our Government
ta convene a trade con! erence of the free
nations seems to me likely to resolve itself
mostly J.nto a meeting of the members of
GATT, and I doubt whether this would be
an adequate solution to our problems.
In dealing with the economîc situation in
Canada, the honourable senator donned his
rose-tinted glasses and proceeded to ask, "So
what is ail this worry about now?" Despite
the fact that at present anyone who questions
the suggestion that "we neyer had it so good"
is accused o! selling Canada short, I feel I
should mention at least one statistic. I refer
to the forecast of the gross national product,
incorporated in the report of the Royal Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects, page
327?. On referring to the forecast mentioned by
the honourable senator from Carleton I find
that, as is usual in such cases, alternative
possibilities were presented. Under one set
of possible conditions it was suggested that
our grass national product might reach $39.5
billion by 1965, and that under some different;
conditions it might reach $41.8 billion.
I would remind honourable senators that
these estimates are, of course, in terms of
1955 dollars. Therefore, a comparison with
current figures must be adjusted to take into
account price changes, to make the figures
comparable.
I arn informed that when the current gross
national product figure of $30.4 billion, which
was quoted by the honourable senator, is
properly adjusted, the figure which. can be
compared to this ini the Gordon Report is in
the order of $33 billion, suggesting a rate o!
growth o! less than 3 per cent per annum,
which compares to a rate of growth o! 4.7 per
cent suggested in the Gordon Report on the
lower estimate.
1 should like to make a short reference
ta unemployment. It is true there was some
decrease in unemployment between inidAugust and mid-September. There was a
decided drop, but we ail know that the main
factor governing this was the many students
who returned to school after looking for jobs
ail summer. It is clear from the Gordon
Report, which was quoted by the honourable

senator from Pickering (Hon. Mn. Grosart),
that there have been many suggestions as ta
what may be considered a tolerable condition.
Views on this matter obviously change witb
the passage o! time. I seem to recail that in
the more or less recent part there was some
suggestion that no one should suifer because
o! invaluntary unemployment.
Honourable senators, it bas always seemed
to me that it makes a great difference whether
one is simply a statistic or one of those who
are suffering because of involuntary unemploymnent.
Unemployment stili remains higher lin the
Atlantic provinces than elsewhere. The honourable senator from Pickering (Hon. Mr.
Grosart) quoted statistics from which he
argued that there was full employment, based
on what I believe Mr. Gordon meant by the
existence o! a tolerable condition. I think this
is pnobably the first time the honourable senator sa unquestionably accepted a statement
of Mr. Gordon's. I arn inclined to think that
this is one of the instances where statistics
were used as a drunken man uses a lamp
post, more for support than illumination.
Hanourable senators, there is another matter
to which I should like ta draw your attention
today. On October 16, the honourable senator
from Murray Harbour (Hon. Mns. Inman) and
I were absent !nom this chamber. We were
attending the annual meeting of A.P.E.C., o!
which we have been members since its inception. The meeting was held in Fredericton,
my home city. You will perhaps forgive me
if I say that I welcomed the opportunity to
be in Fredericton when it was at its best,
with the colourful leaves of its beautifui trees
casting reflections on the Saint John River,
s0 widely known as the Rhine of Ainerica
and which contributes so much to the if!e of
New Brunswick and to the city o! Fredericton. Certainly on the day we were there
Fredericton lived up to Sir Charles G. D.
Roberts' description of it:
Fredericton, my City, a jewel and a
dream.
Dr. Desrnond Pacey, an outstanding Canadian author, who is a professor on the staff
o! the University o! New Brunswick, i an
article which appears in the Atlantic Advocate of February 1962, quoted A. J. M. Smith
as saying:
The Fredericton of the seventies...
appears like an enchanted city, wlth its
e]m -shaded streets, its generously proportioned old homes, its Cathedral, and the
college on the hill, while the river winding through the town and the wooded,
*siopes behind brings the forests and an
echo of the sea almost to people's very
doorsteps.

SENATE
Dr. Pacey in his article goes on to say:
As one who is proud to call Fredericton his adopted home, I should like to
say that I do not believe this atmosphere
has been altogether lost. I encountered it
the moment I arrived in Fredericton, and
have cherished it ever since; Gentleness,
courtesy, a genuine respect for learning
and literature.
However, the honourable senator from
Murray Harbour (Hon. Mrs. Inman) and I
were not attending a meeting that had to do
vith learning or literature. As I said earlier,
ve were attending the annual meeting of
.P.E.C. When we returned to Ottawa and
aere questioned about our absence, we found
many of our friends did not know what the
letters A.P.E.C. stands for, despite the excellent description given of it by the honourable
senator for Murray Harbour in a speech made
in this chamber on February 19, 1959. Consequently, with your indulgence, I would like
to tell you a little about this organization, the
designation of which was coined from the first
letters of its name-"Atlantic Provinces
Economic Council". A.P.E.C. members are
made up of representatives of business and
industry, and many individuals interested in
regional economic progress. It is nonpolitical,
nonprofit and voluntary. Its origin can be
traced to a report made in 1951 by the late
Dr. C. H. Blakeny of Moncton, who was
Chairman of the Maritime Provinces Board
of Trade Committee on Industrial Development. Dr. Blakeny, a former Minister of
Education, was a keen businessman and was
anxious to bring about a new spirit of enterprise in his part of Canada. In that report
were two statements which have been quoted
many times since in connection with A.P.E.C.
One is:
We in these provinces must finally
realize that we must do less clamouring
for (Federal) government assistance and
more to help ourselves . . .
And the other:
Yet the time has come when we must
make an effort to literally pull ourselves
up by our bootstraps.
This report was followed by a meeting of
the premiers of the four Atlantic provinces in
1953. Much correspondence and discussion
took place, and finally in 1954 the movement
came to a head and the Atlantic Provinces
Economic Council was born.
The policies and objectives of A.P.E.C. are
three in number. First: research or to get the
facts. Much has been done along this line.
A.P.E.C. issues a year-round Economie
Review, a newsletter ten times a year which
gives a quarterly review of economic conditions, an Atlantic Provinces check-list, an

Atlantic Provinces Trade Directory and
Statistical Review, all of which are published
on a regular basis. Besides these, a total of
approximately 50 research studies, reports,
pamphlets and other material of importance
to the Atlantic economy have been issued.
Actually, the A.P.E.C. library has the most
complete available list of economic studies in
relation to Atlantic provinces. Second: to
foster co-operation within the region. Third:
the promotion of interest in the support of the
region for industrial development.
Among the activities to prornote the second
and third objectives, A.P.E.C. arranged for
exhibits of Atlantic wearing apparel and footwear, of Atlantic-produced food and beverages, an Atlantic building products show and
convention, a trade exhibit at Goose Bay,
Labrador and Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island
and Harmon Air Force base of the United
States Air Force at Stephenville, Newfoundland.
Members of the executive and representatives of the Government visited Goose Bay
air bases to promote trade between Atlantic
provinces and the north. Joint meetings have
been held with the New England Economic
Council and through these meetings definite
steps to promote inter-regional trade and capital investment were agreed on. Several conferences of the premiers of the four provinces
were held at the same time and place as meetings of A.P.E.C., and close liaison was established on both business and social levels.
Following one of these meetings a Premiers'
Committee was set up to make plans for the
establishment of an Atlantic provinces office
in London, England, and this was set up in
1958, immediately across the street from Canada House. The opening was attended by the
premiers of the four provinces and the President of A.P.E.C. The Agent General is Mr.
H. Watson Jamer, former A.P.E.C. Chairman
in New Brunswick.
Honourable senators, although this seems to
be a new venture, I discovered that New
Brunswick had had an agent general in London many years ago, and that the first one,
sent over some 175 years ago, was Brooke
Watson. He later became Sir Brooke, and
eventualIy became Lord Mayor of London and
Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. I
thought it might be a matter of interest to
honourable senators that so long ago New
Brunswick had felt it important to have an
-agent general.
In 1959 a joint statement by the four
premiers and A.P.E.C. announced that an
Atlantic Provinces Research Board had been
set up in Fredericton.

OCTOBER 25, 1962
In 1961 the report of A. K. Cairncross, now
economic advisor to the United Kingdom government, was released to the premiers of the
four Atlantic provinces. His view was that
the federal Government must be the principal
agent of policies to eliminate the lag in
economic development in the region.
In order to tackle the program and carry
an the effort to "pull ourselves up by our
bootstraps", the council concentrated on encouraging secondary manufacturing, whlle
hoping for the necessary f ederal assistance.
A number of commîttees have been set up
by A.P.E.C. The one to assist the growth
of our light industries, and the development of
industries generally, interests me especially.
1 feel that not only in the Atlantic provinces
but throughaut Canada we must pramate the
growth of secondary industries. It may be recalled that I expressed this opinion in a
speech made in this chamber on July 5, 1960,
as reported in Senate Hansard at page 944.
There is another interesting conimnittee,
consisting of a professor from, Acadia University and a professor from the University
of Maine, which is învestigating the information that may be available regarding trade
between the Atlantic provinces and the New
England states, and the Committee Is ta
report on the advlsability of launching a joint
project in this field. We trust that this study
will produce practical resuits. The people
from the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova
Scatia and Prince Edward Island remember
that in the days before Canfederation we had
a booming economy based on our free trade
with our New England neighbours which we
lost when, as a member of the Canadian
Confederation, we had ta submit ta tariffs
put on for the benefit of the industrial provinces of central Canada.
Based essentially on Professor Cairncross's
repart, supported by other studies axnong
A.P.E.C. members, there is wide acceptance
af the belief that it is essential ta the development of the Atlantic provinces that the
Government of Canada shouid create in this
regian an agency or agencies ta assist in the
program of expanding the level of public
and private investment.
At the annual meeting attended by the
honourable senatar fram, Murray Harbour
(Han. Mrs. Iniman) and me, great satisfaction
was expressed as ta the statement in the
Speech from the Thrane that the Gavernment
of Canada propases ta create an Atlantic
Provinces Development Board ta recommend
measures and projects that would promate the
econamic development af the Atlantic regian.
Members of A.P.E.C. place heavy reliance
on this statement, and it is to be hoped that
the creation of the Development Board will

take place soan and that the personnel will
be the best that can be found-individuals
with wisdom, foresight and experience. It is
recognized that it is necessary that nat only
A.P.E.C. and the federal Gaverniment, but
the provincial governments as well, must do
all in their power ta develop aur economy and
this, I feel, is being done by the present
New Brunswick Governinent.
Amongst ather things a Research and Productivity Council has been set up, through
the assistance of which same 40 ta 50 new
firms got underway in New Brunswick in
the past f ew years, and this organizatian has
assisted many other firms ta increase their
capacity.
In line with the development of small industries, and same nat sa small, ail af which
will help ta cut down New Brunswick's
unernployment problem, the New Brunswick Government, by legislation passed last
year, paved the way for the establishment in
that province of a $50 million mine, mill and
smelter project which will develop a 60million tan are body in the Bathurst-Newcastle area. This will provide 200 permanent
jobs. The New Brunswick Government recently built a large, modern plant that it has
leased ta an electronics firm which employs
mare than 1,000 workers, mostly women.
Other businesses recentiy established are a
$1 million plant ta build flshing draggers,
and a softwood-plywood plant, a peat mass
campany, a paper bax plant a paper bag
plant, a shoe last firm, a floor mop and broom
establishment, and a chemical factory ta produce chiorine and caustic soda for the pulp
and paper industry which, with its high
capital investment, has been the backbone of
provincial production for many years.
To help meet the demand for skilled labour
which has resulted from this expansion in
New Brunswick, the Government launched
last winter a large-scale training program for
unemployed persans. This was conducted
under the new Federal-Provincial Technical
and Vocational Training Program. Training
classes were operated in 68 centres. About
2,300 trainees took part-which I am told
is unequalled anywhere in Canada. One new
technical and training school is in operation,
and at least six more are planned.
In spite of all this effort ta pull ourselves
Up by aur boatstraps, unemployment in New
Brunswick is stifl higher than in other parts
o! Canada. The New Brunswick Gavernment
belleves that if we receive help through the
proposed Atlantic Provinces Development
Board, although previausly New Brunswick's
location was ýconsidered a disadvantage, new
factors which have came into being may make

SENATE
this eastern Canadian province a keystone in
the distribution picture. With more than
2,000,000 people in the Atlantic provinces
now, New Brunswick would seem to be a
logical centre from which this expanding
market could best be served. With many
drastic changes taking place in world trading
patterns it is possible that, situated on the
Atlantic seaboard with the harbour of Saint
John open to year-round navigation, New
Brunswick may well be recognized as the
threshold of North America, the natural place
from and through which distribution and exchange should be made, both across the Atlantic and towards the west. Thus, New
Brunswick may again assume the position of
a leader in world trade which she held a
century ago.
Reference to the changing pattern of world
trade again brings to mind the European
Common Market, interest in which at the
A.P.E.C. meetings vied with interest in the
Atlantic Provinces
Development
Board.
Speeches and panels were devoted to the
Common Market and dealt with the effect it
will have on the Atlantic economy if Britain
joins the E.C.M. Opinion was divided on the
subject, almost all agreeing that some difficulty would arise during the necessary period
of adjustment, but many believing that in
the long run it would help the Atlantic economy.
The Mount Allison University seminar,
which is held at Sackville, New Brunswick
each year, studies matters of current interest.
The seminar gets wide publicity through TV,
radio, and press in the Atlantic provinces and
even beyond, and this summer the seminar
was devoted to the study of the Common
Market. Certainly, in our province, we are
not ignorant or illiterate concerning this subject.
Honourable senators, other legislation mentioned in the Speech from the Throne excited
my interest and I hope I shall be able to contribute to the debates on the bills when they
come before this house. I await eagerly the
introduction of the measure to establish an
Indian Claims Commission.
Fronm my experience on the recent Parliamentary Joint Committee on Indian Affairs,
I believe there are many claims on the part
of various tribes and bands that should be
thoroughly investigated and fairly settled.
I am exceedingly interested in a national
system of contributory old age pensions
with disability and survival benefits, and the
possibility-with the co-operation of the
provinces-of legislation to implement portable pensions. The establishment of a National Council of Welfare will provide co-

ordination between federal and provincial
governments in this field, which is very badly
needed.
In welfare, honourable senators, my chief
interest is in making provision for our older
citizens. As I explained in a speech to this
house on February 8, 1955, I am interested
in the subject generally, whether it has to
do with housing, employment, income, health
or free time of our older citizens.
At present, through its Committee on
Aging, the Canadian Welfare Council is
doing a Canada-wide survey to determine
just what are the needs of Canada's older
citizens in the field of housing. Proper housing is, I think, the most urgent problem of
older people in Canada, but there are many
other problems that require attention and
legislation to establish a program that will
ensure independence, dignity and respect to
all citizens through their later years. It is
my hope that before long a National Conference on aging-similar to the White House
Conference on Aging which was held in
Washington in January, 1961 and attended by
a number of Canadians, as observers-may
be held in Canada. Possibly such a conference might be recommended and given support by a national council on welfare which
was mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.
I thank you, honourable senators, for your
kind attention.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Willis, debate adjourned.
OFFICIAL REPORT
CORRECTION OF STATEMENT

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, on a question of privilege: After listening to the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), and in order to
prove that there is no narrow political bias
on this side of the house, I feel constrained
to request that a correction be made in
Hansard.
Honourable senators may recall that yesterday at the close of the debate on the Export
Credits Insurance Act I made a few remarks.
It appears, from reading page 127 of Hansard,
that I said at the beginning of those remarks:
Honourable senators, I think we all
agree that the bill has been very well
explained to the Senate by the honourable gentleman who has just spoken
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
Of course that was true, but what I
actually said was also true. This is what
I said:
Honourable senators, I think we all
agree that the bill has been very well

OCTOBER 25, 1962
explained to the Senate by the honourable Minister without Portfolio (Hon. Mr.
McCutcheon), who introduced it, and by
the honourable gentleman who has just
spoken.
PRIVATE BILL
THE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS 0F IRELAND
CANADA-SECOND READING

IN

Hon. John G. Higgins moved the second

reading of Bml S-7, ta incorporate

The

Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, it is with
much lnterest, deep pride and abounding
pleasure that I undertake the task of Introducing this bill in the Senate today. From
the Urne 1 attained my fifth year until I
reached university status I was under the
care and tutelage of the Order of the
Christian Brothers of Ireland.
I amn assurning that most of you had neyer
heard of this Order until it was mentioned
in this chamber last week. 0f course, littie
was knawn about it in Newfoundland-except
aznong a few people born in Ireland-until
it was introduced there, and some trne
elapsed before it was known generally
tbroughout the country.
The titie "Christian Brothers" had a famillar ring about it, but it had a famfllarity
associated wlth commerce. In the l9th century,
before the institution of limited liability campantes, a number of mercantile firms affixed
the word "Brothers" ta their farnily name.
There was, for instance, Martin Brothers.
These mercantile flrms, with others, used ta
buy fish in August or September from. fishermen in various parts of Newfoundland in
order ta seil it on the variaus markets in
Europe: England, Greece, France, Italy and
Spain. The price ta be offered ta fishersnen
would flot be known until some time in
August or September, when the contracts
with the foreign firrns had been made.
One August, shortly after the Order came
ta Newfoundland, two Christian Brothers
went on a holiday in a steamer going around
one o! the bays. They were standing on the
deck, dressed in their black clothes and clerical collars, as the steamer entered a little
cave where there was a small village. On the
wharf stood the magistrate and some fishermen. One a! the fishermen approached the
magistrate and asked, "Magistrate, who are
these men?" The magistrate replied, "They
are Christian Brothers." Mused the fisherman,
"Christian Brothers? I have deait with Job
Brothers, Bawring Brothers and Ryan Brothers, but I have neyer heard of Christian
Brothers. What price are they offering far
fish?"

It was flot taa long before the name "Christian Brothers" became familier throughout the
country. In fact, I may say that rnany years.
ega it was said that the greatest blessings ever
irnported into Newfoundland were rabbits and
Christian Brothers.
At first the members of the Order caerfrom Ireland, but later a number o! Newfoundianders joined the Order and were sent
to Ireland ta be educated, efterwards return-ing ta Newfoundlend as Brothers. That state
af effairs no longer exists, and naw the ranks.
of the Christian Brothers of Irelend consist
elmast entirely o! citizens of Canada and the.
United States.
Having presumed that you do flot know
anything about the Order-and what I havejust said does not help in any wey ta a better
understanding-I trust that you wîll flot mind
my delivering a short account o! the history
o! the Order, beceuse it has something ta dowith Canadian education.
The Order originated in Irelend. The
founder was Edmund Ignatius Rice, e member
of a well-known farily iii County Kilkenny,.
Sauthern Ireland. He was epprenticed ta Mis
uncle, Michael Rice, who had a substantial
business in Weterford, County Cork, and was.
an exporter, importer and dealer in ships'
pravisions.
Edrnund Rice inherited his uncle's businessand becarne a successful businessman. At the.
age o! 38 years he was the owner o! about
2,000 acres of land and much property in
Water!ord and Callen, County Kilkenny, andl
possessed a capital of about £50,000. At thisage he decided on the nature of his vocation.
He decided thet he would retire from commercial life and devote himself ta the education o! the Catholic youth of Waterford. For
many years he had devoted much tirne and
maney to looking alter the poar, the aged'
and destitute, and prisoners in the local jfil.
When he died there was nathing lef t of
Mis fartune, one which would have beenregarded as large in those days.
There wes a glering lack of educational
facilities for the poor boys of the cîty of
Waterford, in fact, for the whole of Ireland.
There were charter schools throughout Irelend, but they were used ta proselytize the.
Catholic youth. The only alternative was the

R's, but to those who wished to advance further they taught Latin, Greek and the sciences.
Some who came out were great classical
scholars.
Edmund Rice was debarred from founding
a religious order because the Relief Act of
1791, which granted certain concessions to
Catholics, also contained a clause forbidding
the establishment of any religious association
or order. This was not repealed until 1892,
when a further penal section against religious
orders or associations was inserted in the new
act. Because of those discriminatory laws the
Order of the Irish Christian Brothers, I know
you will be shocked to hear, continued to be
an illegal institution until the year 1922.
However, Edmund Rice looked around for
dedicated men, imbued with the same lofty
ideals and enthusiasm and devotion as himself, and opened the first school in Waterford.
Times and ideas were changing. The old
order was changing, and men were becoming imbued with the thoughts and ideas of
liberty and democracy. The American War
of Independence and its successful conclusion
had an effect on the political thought in
England. The rising tide of nationalism, starting in the new sovereign United States, and
spreading to the Canadas, together with the
victories of Napoleon in Europe, had brought
a bigger idea of democracy in England and
led to a more conciliatory attitude and tolerant policy on the part of the British Government toward Irish Catholics.
Edmund Rice took advantage of this, and
with the approval of his bishop decided to
form the members of his small community of
teachers into a society consecrated by vows
to the service of God and religion. In 1808
the Congregation of the Brothers of the
Christian Schools of Ireland was informally
founded. Twelve years later by a brief of
Pope Pius VII, the Congregation was formally
established and Edmund Rice became its first
superior.
The development of the Order was rapid
and its schools spread over Ireland. In 1822
at North Richmond street in Dublin, the
cornerstone of the great O'Connell School
was laid by the celebrated Daniel O'Connell
who referred to Edmund Rice, who was
now Brother Edmund Rice, as "the patriarch
of the monks of the West".
In 1875 the Order was first introduced
into Newfoundland. The previous year the
Order had been introduced into Australia,
and the first school on the North American
continent was opened in New York City in
1906.
In my native city of St. John's there are
three schools which have been carried on
for nearly a century. The first was my old
school of St. Bonaventure College which

opened in 1875, and shortly thereafter there
were St. Patrick's Hall School and Holy Cross
School. Although this is a Catholic Order, a
very large number of boys of various Protestant denominations have attended these
schools.
The total number of Brothers in Canada
is 140, and there are about 10,000 pupils attending their schools. There are twelve schools
in Canada now: two in Vancouver, one in
Victoria, one in Montreal, eight in Newfoundland.
The first school on the mainland of Canada,
apart from Newfoundland, was at Halifax,
Nova Scotia. This is St. Mary's College,
where in the distant past one young Harold
Connolly learned the rudiments of culture
and absorbed the beauty of the English language so deeply that he has often delighted
one of the great legislative houses of the
world with this oratory, pouring forth his
Ciceronian periods with Demosthenic force,
vibrant with the musical modulation of his
voice. If he is here today, let him speak.
An Hon. Senator: He is temporarily absent.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: What life could he put
into the subject! And with what thundering
voice and thrilling accents he would talk "of
sunshine and of song and summer days when
he was young".
This reminds me that one can become
poetical on an occasion like this, but one must
use doggerel when dealing with mundane
subjects like, for instance, bankruptcy.
The Order extends throughout five continents. There are now 3,500 Brothers teaching
137,000 boys in Ireland, England, the United
States, South America, South Africa, India,
Australia, New Zealand and Canada. There
are 38,000 boys attending 94 schools in Australia.
The purpose of this bill is to form a
Canadian Provincialate. At the present time
there is one Provincialate for the whole of
the North American continent, with its headquarters in New York. This bill sets out the
formation of a Canadian Provincialate with
its head office in the city of Montreal or such
other place within Canada as the corporation
may decide.
I draw your attention now to section 3 of
the bill which sets out that one of the objects
of the Order is to establish and maintain
orphanages. I am sorry I did not get information on this point, but I know of one orphanage in New York, and I know there is one
on the outskirts of my native city, St. John's,
which has been carried on since the 1890's
and cares for about 300 orphans.
The bill contains the usual sections dealing
with the incorporation of religious and other
such bodies, and section 3 sets out that the

things and a few facts of which you are well
aware. I understand that the number of
reports in this Order is considerable, and I
want to make myself clear about the purpose
that I have in rising to address you.
Some of our most distinguished colleagues
are members of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, and I have repeated time and time
again that their work is praiseworthy, that
I regret very much that they have to suffer
that burden, if I may use that expression, and
I hope the day will come soon when they will
be relieved of that part of their work in order
that they can give to the Senate the full
measure of their talent.
At the outset I wish to thank all my honourable colleagues who had no objection to
allowing this Order to stand, and I thank
also my honourable colleague from Queens
(Hon. Mr. MacDonald) for having seconded
my motion for adjournment a few days ago.
If we want to know why the word "divorce"
is in the part of the constitution that enumerates the exclusive powers that belong to
the Parliament of Canada, we must go back to
the time when it was first put in our legislation, and we must also go back to the
Charlottetown Conference when the Fathers
of Confederation met together, shook hands,
and decided nothing but to meet again in
Quebec City.
That happened in the fall of 1864. A few
weeks later, in October, they met in Quebec
City, and they passed what are called the
Quebec Resolutions. All we have today is the
text of those resolutions which appeared in
the last pages of the Confederation Debates
of 1865. One well-known historian, Sir
Thomas Chapais, who was a member of the
Senate for many years and who was the
son of one of the Fathers of Confederation
and the son-in-law of another, wrote that it
was very unfortunate there was no record
of the deliberations that took place at the
Quebec Conference. He wrote that in his
history of Canada, which is quoted again in
a book on the Chapais family, written by
one of his nieces. Therefore, all we have
about the Quebec Conference are the resoluREFERRED TO COMMITTEE

it power to establish schools, and section 5
gives it power to purchase land. Section 6
gives it the right to sell property. These are
the usual sections. Section 12 gives it the
right to borrow money, and section 12 (2)
sets out that it cannot engage in the business
of banking or insurance, but I cannot imagine
the Christian Brothers engaging in either of
those lines.
In dealing with section 14, I must ask your
forbearance because I have not the Companies Act here. Perhaps some other senator
who is also a lawyer might be able to explain this section, should a question be asked.
It is a very simple bill. Its purpose, as I
have said, is to make the Order in Canada
separate from the Order in the United States.
That is the real purpose, and in fact it is
the only purpose. The result will be that
instead of having a North American Provincialate, there will now be a Canadian Provincialate and a United States Provincialate,
each separate and distinct. I do not know
what rights the laws of the land in the United
States give the Order, but here it wants to
carry on the work of an ordinary religious
body, to hold property, and to be allowed to
build schools and carry out its other objectives.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am a humble layman,
and I see in clause 7 of the bill a reference
to "a licence in mortnain". What does that
mean?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: In the olden days a
person was not allowed to give property to a
corporation, because if he did it would be
given to a "dead hand". That exists up to
modern times. Land cannot be conveyed to
corporations except by statutory authority.

And Subject 31 is "Marriage and Divorce".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On what page is that?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: It is at page 1029, at the
end of the book. If my honourable friend
desires it I will be glad to pass the book
to him.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have a copy.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: On the following page,
Resolution No. 43 reads as follows:
The Local Legislatures shall have
power to make laws respecting the following subjects ...
And subject No. 15 is:
Property and Civil Rights, excepting
those portions thereof assigned to the
General Parliament.
The whole matter was referred to the
Supreme Court in the first place and then
to the Privy Council in 1912. It was decided
then by the highest tribunal that marriage
and divorce are exclusive to the federal
Parliament, with the exception of the solemnization of marriage which is exclusive to
the provinces. The court added that everything concerning marriage and divorce belonged exclusively to the Parliament of Canada, with the exception of the solemnization
of marriage reserved exclusively to the
provinces.
It would be superfluous to read section 91
and 92 of the Constitution of 1867 concerning
respectively the powers of the Parliament
of Canada and the provincial legislatures,
because you know them by heart.
As we have nothing with regard to the
debates or deliberations of the Quebec Conference, we must have a look at the Confederation Debates, where the aforementioned resolutions have been discussed by
the Fathers of Confederation.
At that time the Prime Minister of Canada,
who was also Receiver General and Minister
of Militia, was the Honourable Colonel Sir
Etienne Pascal Taché. He was a delightful
gentleman and was a very good family doctor. I do not believe that he had made any
special study of law; when he spoke on marriage and divorce he read a paper which
had been presented to him to read. It is reported as follows at page 344:
Remarks have also been made about
the laws of divorce and marriage, and
the honourable member for the division
of DeLanaudière (Hon. Mr. Olivier) told
us that the Conference had done well in
transferring the power of divorce to the
General Government. On his part, I think

this was a wise view of the question, and
I am glad to have the opportunity of
now telling him so. He was, however
very uneasy about the word "marriage".
Well, I will try to put him right and at
his ease on that point; and I will give
him the answer as I find it put down in
writing, so that no possible misunderstanding may continue to exist. If the
honourable gentleman will but take his
pen, he will be able to note my answer:This is the paper which he read:
"The word 'marriage' bas been inserted to give the General Legislature
the right to decide what form of marriage
will be legal in all parts of the Confederation, without in any way interfering
with the rules and prescriptions of the
Church to which the contracting parties
belong."
It was the first mention of the rules and
prescriptions of the church, in that reference
or explanation about marriage.
Then, a few pages further on, at page 388,
Sir Hector Louis Langevin, who was a member of several governments before and after
Confederation and who at that time was
Solicitor General East, spoke as follows:
I will now answer the honourable gentleman as categorically as possible, for I
am anxious to be understood, not only in
this House, but also by all those who may
hereafter read the report of our proceedings. And first of al I will prove that
civil rights form part of those which, by
article 43 (paragraph 15) of the resolutions, are guaranteed to Lower Canada.
This paragraph reads as follows:"15. Property and civil rights, excepting those portions thereof assigned to the
General Parliament."
Well, amongst these rights are all the
civil laws of Lower Canada, and among
these latter those which relate to marriage; now it was of the highest importance that it should be so under the
proposed system, and therefore the members from Lower Canada at the Conference took great care to obtain the
reservation to the Local Government of
this important right, and in consenting
to allow the word "marriage" after the
word "divorce," the delegates have not
proposed to take away with one hand
from the Local Legislature what they had
reserved te it by the other.
Strangely enough, it was exactly what they
did. It is for everybody to decide whether it

OCTOBER 25, 1962
was done or not, especially according to the
interpretation given later by the Privy Council. The quotation continues:
So that word '<marriage", placed where
it is among the powers of the Central
Parliament, has flot; the extended signification which was sought to be given
to it by the honourable member.
I shall fot read all of the discussion but
only what those Fathers of Confederation
have said about marriage:
With the view of being more explicit,
Inow propose to read how the word
marriage is proposed to be understood:I ask you, honourable senators, to go back
to what Sir Etienne Pascal Taché has said
and compare it with what was said by Sir
Hector Langevin, who continued as follows:
"The word marriage has been placed
in the draft of the proposed Constitution
to invest the Federal Parliament with the
right of declaring what marriages shail
be held and deemed to be valid throughout the whole extent of the Confederacy,
without, however, interfering in any
particular with the doctrines or rites of
the religious creeds to which the contracting parties may belong."
It was the second Urne that there was a
mention, by the Fathers of Confederation, of
religion with regard to marriage.
At page 781, the honourable Solicitor General Langevin said:
The honourable mernber did not; quote
the whole of that portion of my speech
which relates to marriage; he simply
quoted the first part, but he ought to
have given the second, which is as foliows:
"The fact is that the whole matter
arnounts to this-the Central Government
may decide that any marriage contracted
in Upper Canada or in any of the Confederated provinces, in accordance with
the laws of the country in which it was
contracted, although that law might be
different from ours, should be deemed
valid in Lower Canada, in case the parties
should come to reside there, and vice
versa."
This was merely a development o! what
1 said. I stated before that the interpretation I had given o! the word "marriage"
was that of the Governmnent and of the
Conference o! Quebec, and that we wished
the Constitution to be drafted in that
sense. The honourable member for Vercheres-

That is, Mr. Geoffrion:
-quoted that part of the draft of the civil
code which states that one of the articles
provides that a marriage contracted in
any country whatever, according to the
laws o! the country in which it shail
have been contracted, shail be valid, and
he argues !rorn that, that sinoe it was
declared by the civil code, there was no
necessity for inserting it in the resolutions. But the honourable member must
be aware that that part of the code may
be repealed at any time, and that if this
occurred, parties married under the circumnstances referred to would no longer
enjoy the protection they now have .and
which we desire to secure for them under
the Constitution. I maintain, then, that
it was absolutely necessary to insert the
word "suarriage" as it has been inserted,
in the resolutions, and thaýt it has no other
meaning than the meaning I attributed to
it in the naine o! the Government and of
the Conference.
In all my legal research I have neyer found
anywhere such an argument that the federal
Parliament would have to pass some legisiation because it was concerned that the provincial legislatures would repeal the legisiation
which they had enacted. In fact, ahl legislation can be repealed. The constitution can be
repealed by the Imperial Pariament at the
present Urne, and all the iaws of Parliament
can be repealed by Parliament, and all the
laws of the legisiatures can be repealed by
the legislatures. But when they are passed,
they are passed seriously and in order to be
kept on the statute books. That argument was
most extraordinary, because Book 1, Title V
of the 1862 Report of the Civil Code Commission contains article 19, which in 1865 had not
yet become law, but had been tabled and sent
to the government of the day three years
before one o! the Fathers of Confederation
made that statement. It has remalned ln the
Civil Code o! Quebec of Lower Canada, where
it has been since 1866. This Is the article
referred to, Article 135:
A marriage solemnized out of Lower
Canada between two persons, either or
both of whom are subject to its laws,
is valid, if solemnlzed accordlng to the
formalities of the place where it is performed, provided that the parties dld
not go there with the intention o! evading
the law.
As that privilege existed at the time in the
draft of the Civil Code-and as it exlsts now
in the Civil Code itsel!-there was no reason
at alI that justified the Fathers of Confederation to put marriage as well as divorce under

SENATE
the jurisdiction of the federal Government;
and it may explain the reason why they mentioned that the legislation would not affect
the religious beliefs of the people. Perhaps
they used that pretext to induce the clergy
of all denominations at the time not to protest against the adoption of that part of the
Constitution which put marriage as well as
divorce under the jurisdiction of the federal
Government.
But there was another reason why it was
done, and it will be found in Senate Hansard
of March 19, 1957, at page 370. In 1867, the
year of Confederation, and two years after
the Confederation debates, the estimated population of Canada was 3,463,000. And what
was the number of divorces granted by Parliament from 1867 to 1872? You may know, but
if you do not already know the statistics you
will be greatly surprised: In 1867, none; 1868,
1; 1869, 1; 1870, none; 1871, none; 1872, none.
There were two divorces granted by Parliament in six years. That is 'quite different
from today. I have not the latest figures,
but the number of divorces before us at this
time is 305, or one half of the divorces passed
during last year-the average being approximately 500 to 600 per session. From 1955 to
1959, in six sessions of Parliament, the number of divorces granted by Parliament was
2,806. That figure is given in Senate Hansard
of March 24, 1960, at pages 450 and 451.
To shorten matters, I will not speak today
of the investigators. I want my honourable
colleagues to consider the matter objectively,
as I have done, in order to find a remedy for
this situation and to try to find a way, or
some means, to get rid of divorce matters
in the Senate, and in the House of Commons
as well.
All the petitioners have paid their fees for
their appearance before Parliament and to
have some legislation enacted dissolving their
marriage. Those people have apparently acted
in good faith and their petitions deserve due
consideration. The fact that this order of
business has stood over a couple of times has
not delayed justice at all because not a single
piece of divorce legislation has yet been passed
this session by the House of Commons.
Honourable senators, we must make some
approach to come to an understanding and to
see what can be done to remedy the situation,
to relieve the Senate and the House of Commons of this burden. I hold no grudge against
anybody. We must do something to redress the
wrong which was done nearly a century ago
by the Fathers of Confederation who lived
under different conditions and at a time when
divorce practically did not exist. The population of Canada has increased and today the
situation is very different from what is was
nearly a century ago.

We must face the situation as it exists, and
I ask for the co-operation and the support
of all of my colleagues to try to find some
means to rid Parliament of divorce.
The suggestion has been made that divorce
matters should be referred to a federal court
for the very reason that the powers of the
Parliament of Canada relating to marriage and
divorce are exclusive. Reference has been
made to the Exchequer Court by the former
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine),
by the honourable senator from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis), and by other honourable
gentlemen. I think that Mr. Stanley Knowles
sponsored some legislation in that regard some
years ago. It is not only the Exchequer Court
that could deal with it; a new federal court
could be created by Parliament, and that
court could sit only in Ottawa and could hear
each divorce case.
I gave some figures on March 29, 1960,
which will be found in Senate Hansard at
pages 450 and 451. But in this year of grace,
1962, I would like my colleagues to be free
of all responsibility with regard to divorce
matters by entrusting them to judges who will
have at their disposal means to check the
veracity of witnesses and who will see to it
that everybody enjoys fairness and justice in
divorce matters. This will not encourage
divorce at all. If in some provinces there are
more divorces than in others, it is because
there the grounds for divorce are more
extensive.
I submit all this to you, honourable colleagues, appealing to your sense of fairness to
remedy the situation.
I have a number of suggestions for using
your brilliant minds to accomplish something
that will mean more to the country than the
obligation you now have to listen to divorce
cases.

THE LATE SENATOR FRASER
TRIBUTES

Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, it is my sad duty to say that since last
we met we have lost a much respected colleague. I refer, of course, to, our good friend,
Senator William Alexander Fraser, who
passed away at his home i Trenton on
Friday last, at the age of seventy-six.
Senator Fraser served his country in this
chamber for over thirteen years, and bis wise
counsel will be very much missed. He was
born and educated in Trenton, and over the
course of bis lifetime played a large part in
the business and political life of that town,
and as weil tbroughout ail of Ontario.
As a prominent industrialist and fruit
grower, the late Senator was director of a
number of companies in the canning and
lumbering fields. He was president of Trenton Cooperage Mills Limited, which he
founded. He was also a leader ini the fruit
growing field, whlch was one of bis special
interests.
His service in public ife was flot confined
to the contribution he made in this chamber.
From 1930 until 1945 he represented the
constituency of Northumberland in the House
of Commons with great distinction. Prior to
that, from 1924 until 1930, he was mayor of
bis native town of Trenton. In the Flrst World
War he served with the 49th regiment. Honourable senators, I wish to extend miy sincere
sympathy to our late coileague's widow and
iminediate family and to the many close
personal friends who, with us, mourn bis
passing.
Hon, W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, our late coileague was a man of strong
views. He had strong likes and dislikes. He
was neyer lukewarm about anytbing. Always
faithful to bis friends, he neyer took a
middle course; he neyer sat on the fence.
We always knew where he stood, and that
applied also to bis political views. Indeed,
he was usually impatient with anyone who
did flot see exactly as he did politically.
However, we ail respected him for bis strong
vlews.
Senator Fraser's life was a series of successes. As the Deputy Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Choquette) bas said, he

served bis municlpalityr on various boards
and as an alderman. He was very proud of
the town of Trenton and eventually became
its mayor. His county eiected him a member
of the House of Commons. Later, he was
appointed to the Senate, and was a member
of this house for thirteen years.
The late Senator Fraser was raised on a
farmn, and bis first undertaking was that of
farming. He was a most successful farmer,
and had one of the largest orchards in
Ontario. He processed bis fruit by modern
methods, and was one of the first growers to
give spring delivery of the previous fall's
crop in perfect condition. He also bad a
creamery and was lnterested in the cheese
processing business. As an industrialist he
established a cement plant and an iron and
steel works in the town of Trenton. He was
also in the hotel business. He was a promoter
of the Lord Elgin Hotel here in Ottawa, and
more recently a promoter and a director of
the Lord Simcoe Hotel in the city of Toronto.
His interests extended to the newspaper
world, and he established and was the
proprietor of a newspaper I Trenton.
The late senator loved bis home town of
Trenton and did many tbings for it. He was
anxious that the Royal Canadian Air Force
should establish a base I Trenton, and it
was due i large measure to bis enthusiasm
tbat consideration was given by the Government to the establishment of an R.C.A.F.
station there. One of the factories be caused
to be established i Trenton was that of the
Bata Shoe Company. The owners of that
company came to Canada from abroad in the
early days of the war and establisbed a
factory in Trenton. It was one of the first
large factories to be set up in Canada with
sponsorshlp from abroad.
Most of the late senator's ventures were a
financial success. I bave said that he was
outspoken and at times unrestrained in bis
language, but he was a very klnd soul. He
was charitable and helped many who were in
need. Though it was not generally known,
he frequently came to the help of persons in
financial difficulties. lie took a lively interest
in the Salvation Army and established a playground for children in Trenton, wbich is now
being operated by that organization.
I join with the Deputy Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Choquette) i extending
my sympathy to Mrs. Fraser and those who
were near and dear to the late senator.
Hou. Jean-François Pouliot: Honoumable
senators, in May, 1934, Mm. Herb Lennox,
who was the former Conservative Member
of Parliament for North York, died. Hie was
my pair, and I said a f ew words about him
and bis career in a ceremony such as this

SENATE

which took place at that time in the House
of Commons. Afterwards my old friend Bill
Fraser said to me, "If I die before you, I
ask you to say something about me in the
House of Commons". At that time he never
expected to be appointed to the Senate. But
what he then said to me meant that our
friendship was to last until one of us should
depart. This, honourable senators, is the kind
of friendship which exists in parliamentary
life land which may be considered the reward
that we may expect from such a life.
Those who knew Bill Fraser in his later
years could not imagine what a ball of fire
he was when delivering a speech in the
House of Commons, especially about the
marketing legislation sponsored by Prime
Minister Bennett in 1935. We were very
different from each other, but we were very
good friends nevertheless. Bill Fraser was one
of the most useful members of Parliament to
serve his country in both houses of the Parliament of Canada.
I agree with what has been said so eloquently by the honourable Deputy Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Choquette) and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), but I have something else to add. On Sunday last I received
a long distance telephone call fron one of
our esteemed colleagues, Honourable Senator
McLean of Saint John, the room-mate of
the late Senator Fraser. He told me that he
probably knew the late senator better than
anybody else, and that as he would be attending his funeral today he would be unable to be with us tonight in order to pay
a final tribute here to his room-mate and
friend.
He told me that when Senator Fraser gave
help to anyone be did it out of the kindness
of his heart, and he told those who felt that
he was too generous that he was investing
those gifts in the bank of kindness and goodness in order to obtain dividends when he
went to the Great Beyond. Senator McLean
added that one would be surprised to hear
of the number of children of every race and
colour-young Negroes and young Chinesewho had held the late senator in their arms
to thank him for what he had done for them.
Senator McLean also said that Senator
Fraser and his wife were most happy together,
that they were worthy of each other and
had the same inclination to help their fellow
citizens indiscriminately, and to be kind for
the sake of humanity at large. There can be
no finer tribute paid to our esteemed colleague, the late senator, and to his widow, to
whom I offer my most sincere sympathy. I

will go further and sympathize with the citizens of Trenton who have been well represented in the House of Commons and in the
Senate by our lamented friend, the late
Senator William Alexander Fraser.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Exceilency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Harry A. Willis: Honourable senators,
this is rny maiden speech in this august
assembly. As a senator from the province of
Ontario, I rnust first of ail pay tribute to the
late Senator Fraser. 1 did not; know him personally, although in the realrn of provincial
politics in Ontario our paths often crossed. I
join with those who have already spoken in
conveying to the late senator's family condolences on his passing.
My second tribute must be to you, Mr.
Speaker, whom I have known for many years,
and of whom I can speak most favourably.
I congratulate you upon your attainment to
the high office you now occupy. Those of us
who were present in this chamber on the
opening day of Parliament, knowing that you
had but a few days to prepare, were delighted
by your performance. If it is permissible to
do so, 1 should like to pay tribute to your
lovely and charrning wif e who, together with
you, fulfils the social amenities in the highest
taste.
The Leader of the Governrnent (Hon. Mr.
Brooks)-the Goverminent which I supporttold us last week that hie would be unable to
be present this evening. I want to congratulate hirn in absentia upon his elevation as
Leader of the Governmnent in the Senate.
I congratulate my old associate from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Choquette), who has risen to
the role of deputy leader, which hie fills most
adrnirably.
I pay tribute to the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), who
is an oid friend of mine, though different in
politics. He and I have been members of the
Board of Governors of McMaster University
for many years. I wish hlm weli, and I hope
he remains in his present position for a long,
long time. I want him to know that I sincerely appreciate the courtesies hie and his
family have extended to me.
I corne now to the senators from Ontario.
I cannot refer to them ail, but one I should
like to refer to in particular is the honourable

senator fromn Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). 1 remember him as Attorney General
of Ontario under a Liberal Government. As
such, hie introduced many measures in the
Ontario legisiature which were highly beneficial to the province. Perhaps I should have
mentioned my friend, the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) first, for his
was a prior appointrnent. He and I have
known each other for rnany years.
1 would also mention the senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), who is absent
this evening. I arn privileged to serve on certain boards with him.
Next I would mention the senator frorn
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croli), a man of
independent spirit, whom I have always
admired.
It gives me pleasure also to speak of the
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert),
who is a long-standing acquaintance of mine,
and was one of the first to greet me when 1
came to this chamber.
May I say also that the senator frorn Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) did me a certain
courtesy not long ago which I appreciated
most deeply; there are not many who would
have done for me what hie did, and I want
to express my appreciation to him in this
chamber.
I corne now to one of the senators who
is newer here than I-I arn one or two Up
on hirn-namely, the senator frorn Gormley
(Hon. Mr. McCutcheon). He and I are good
friends of long standing, for we were associated together in ear]ier years at law schoo]
at Osgoode Hall. The Government could flot
have appointed a more masterful financier
than hie. It is said that hie can read and
analyze a financial statement or the estirnates
tabled in the house with the sarne scissorlike precision that Senator Sullivan performs
Senator Mcoperations. 1 congratulate
Cutcheon, as a member of the Government,
and I also congratulate the Government on
his inclusion.
Senator Sullivan, who sits on this side, as
ail honourable senators know, is an erninent
ear specialist. I compliment hlm on being
first in his field. As many honourable senators know, he won his laurels in athletics as
a member of Canada's Olympie championship
hockey teamn in 1928.
I do flot know whether j okes are permissible
in this chamber, but if they are flot I arn
sure His Honour the Speaker wîll cali me to
order. But 1 want to say to Senator Sullivan
that I arn rerninded of a certain lawyer who
sent out bills for services on any and every
pretext. He met a client one day on the
street who said to hirn, arbitrarily: "It's a
fine day-I'rn telling you, not asking you."

OCTOBER 30, 1962
I want to congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier,
Madawaska-Restigouche) of the Address in
Reply on their splendid efforts. Unfortunately
they are both absent this evening. Senator
Haig is living up to the reputation which his
father forged in this chamber, and Senator
Fournier is living up to the reputation he
established in the province of New Brunswick.
Honourable senators, I do not know if it is
permissible to pay a tribute to an officer
of the Senate, but I arn going to do so anyway. Again, I know His Honour the Speaker
will call me to order, if necessary. 1 want to
mention Mr. MacNeill the Clerk of the Senate,
who has been guide, philosopher and friend
to me. In my opinion, he is one of the top
officers in the whole Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Willis: Honourable senators, 1
corne from the county of Peel which I arn
very proud to represent in this assernbly, for
it is the banner county of Ontario. Senator
Blain represented the county of Peel from
1917 until his death in 1926, and I arn proud
to succeed hirn here.
I was interested the other day in
the exchange between the senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson) and the senator frorn
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaiilancourt) with respect to the Land Use Cornrittee. Senator
Vaillancourt spoke about the eastern farmer,
and Senator Pearson about the western
farmer. I arn a farmer frorn the central
province of Ontario, and I do not want the
farmers of my province to be forgotten, for
we have problems just as do the farmers of
eastern and western Canada. I corne from
township of Caledon, where I farmn the old
homestead. My father was warden of the
county of Peel and so were rny two uncles.
My father married a Liberal.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I knew
there was some good in you.
Hon. Mr. Willis: My uncle was past president of the Liberal Association, and when I
came to marry I chose a damn good Liberal
girl by the name of Mary Dryden-a prominient surnarne in Liberal history in Ontario.
Her grandfather was Minister of Agriculture
in that province for twenty years, and her
father was quite active in Liberal politics.
When I phoned ber father to say that I hoped
to rnarry his daughter he said, "I think you
are ail right but you are a heck of a
Tory"ý-but he didn't use the word "heck".
Now, honourable senators, I want to, pay
a tribute to the honourable Senator Fergusson. I arn sorry she is not here tonight. She
preceded me in this debate in both eloquence
27511-5-11l

and delivery. She rerninded me of Longfellow's Evangeline. H-istorically, Evangeline
came from Nova Scotia. I admire the Maritimes, I admired the honourable senator's
speech, and I sent her a note afterwards
saying that it would be difficuit to follow her
in the debate.
Now I corne to the point where, as the
honourable senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary) said, he entered this chamber as a
Conservative. I corne frorn a farnily where
one Conservative vote was a worth while
target in an election. When the honourable
senator frorn Carleton was speaking he macle
me think of these words of Gilbert and
Sullivan:
I often think it's cornical
How nature always does contrive
Tnat every boy and every gai,
That's born into this world alive,
Is either a littie Liberal,
Or else a littie Conservative.
With ail the splinter groups in the other
house, that may not be true today.
But I corne here with no apologies whatsoever.
The first ni ght that this assembly met we
paid our respects to late departed senators,
one of whom was an intirnate friend of mine,
the late Senator Brunt.
On the second occasion we met in this
chamber the honourable senator frorn De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) rose and asked
a candid question and demanded a candid
answer. So far none of the newly-narned
senators have answered him. But tonight I
arn going to answer hîs inquiry. I have looked
up the British North America Act just to
refresh my mernory, and I find that the
appointment of senators to this chamber
is by order in council and by tradition it has
become the prerogative of the Prime Minister
in office. On this, honourable senators, I quote
an eminent constitutional authority who had
this to, say:
I think party supporters must have
respect for and show loyalty to their
leaders. I show loyalty to my leader;
I arn ready to defend him because I arn
proud of him.
Now, who said that? It was Mr. Pouliot,
when he was member for Terniscouata in
the other house, the sarne Senator Pouliot
who is here tonight. I agree with hima cornpletely in the statement he made.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If my honourable friend
wîll permit an interruption-I appreciate
very rnuch the fact that he has read sorne
of my speeches, and I hope that he will live
long enough to read them all.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Willis: That, honourable senators,
is the direct quotation from a speech made in
the other house on April 29, 1926, and when
a friend-and Senator Pouliot is my friend,
for I have known him for many years-asks
a candid, friendly question and calls for a
candid answer, I say to him what George
Canning said as Prime Minister of Great
Britain in the Mother of Parliaments:
Give me the avowed, the erect, the
manly foe,
Bold I can meet,-perhaps may turn
his blow;
But of all plagues, good Heaven, thy
wrath can send,
Save, save, oh, save me from the
Candid Friend.
Honourable senators, I now want to speak
on the record of the present Government and
the Speech from the Throne. I want first to
speak about something that all senators know
-this Government gave Indians the right to
vote for the first time in the election of
1962. Who got their votes, I do not know,
but they voted. The man responsible for
that, apart from the present Prime Minister
of Canada, was one of our members, the honourable senator from Lethbridge, (Hon. Mr.
Gladstone). I say, honourable senators, that
was a laudable move.
I intended to say a word or two about the
honourable senator from Norfolk (Hon. Mr.
Taylor). I did not know him until I came
to this chamber, but I accompanied the
Prime Minister in October, a year ago, to
the Norfolk County Fair at Simcoe, and if
ever there was a man making political hay
that day it was the same Senator Taylor,
and I admired him for it.
There bas been a lot of criticism about the
Government's appointment of royal commissions. I have looked over the list of commissions which previous governments have
appointed and I find, as the Prime Minister
stated in the other house, we have been in
power only six years and the Liberal Government for twenty-two, and we are still one
commission behind. I do want to commend the
Government on the Glassco Report. How the
Prime Minister was able to get a man of the
stature and ability of Grant Glassco to head
that commission, and the able men he had
with him, I do not know. I say that that is
one of the finest reports that has been handed
down in Canada since the days of Confederation. It is a splendid report and it should be
acted upon.
May I tell another joke that the Prime
Minister sometimes relates on the hustings
about people who are appointed to this
house? Sir John A. Macdonald was attending

the funeral of a late senator who had died
in Napanee. Sir John was in, shall I say,
high spirits as he was standing at the graveside. Another prominent gentleman, standing
beside him, said to Sir John A., "I wish I
could take his place." Sir John replied, "I
wish you could, but I think it is a bit too
late now."
I am sorry that the senator from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. O'Leary) is not here tonight. I see
that his Report on Publications is mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne, and that some
of his recommendations are going to be implemented. Senator O'Leary was appointed to
head that commission before he became a
senator. There again, the Prime Minister
chose the right man for the right place in
Grattan O'Leary, as we knew him then, the
famous editor of the Ottawa Journal.
I come now to the Royal Commission on
Taxation. I think this is a worthwhile study
for the Government of Canada to undertake,
because there are today so many taxes at so
many levels-municipal, provincial, federal,
all intermingling. To head that commission
the Prime Minister has appointed a brilliant
chartered accountant.
Then in the Speech from the Throne there
is evidence of the continuation of this Government's agricultural policy. I refer to the
Farm Credit Corporation Bill now being
considered in the other place. It is good legislation for both the farmers and the people
of Canada. Also there has never been a
minister of agriculture who has sold more
wheat than the present minister, the Honourable Alvin Hamilton. For years there has
been talk about the surplus of wheat in
Canada and questions have been raised as
to how we would ever get rid of it. Now we
have a young, brilliant Minister of Agriculture who comes along and does a remarkable
selling job.
Honourable senators, I have read that some
people are deriding the Government, but I
also read the other day in the Toronto
Telegram--I suppose there will be laughter
at that reference, but it is still a good paperan article by Edwin Mahoney, headed "France
Bullish On Canada". There are many people
who are bullish on Canada because of the
political policies this country is adopting.
I come now to another matter dealt with
in the Speech from the Throne, which may
fall rather hollowly on ears opposite. I refer
to the matter of closure. We heard a lot
about closure in 1956, but make no mistake
about it, the election of 1957 was won on
that issue. The Government, in the Speech
rom the Throne, says that it is going to

OCTOBER 30, 1962
bring down legislation for the abolition of
closure. I believe that all members of this
chamber should approve that legislation.
I turn now to redistribution. In the Speech
from the Throne the Government says:
To ensure that the redistribution of
electoral districts is made objectively and
impartially, you will be asked to approve
a bill to establish an independent commission to recommend redistribution.
All parties, I suppose, have been guilty of
gerrymandering, which is the political tern
used in connection with redistribution. Of
course, the shining example of that was the
Lake Centre riding. Before redistribution the
Lake Centre riding was held by the present
Prime Minister of Canada, and when the
redistribution report was brought in all that
was left of the Lake Centre riding was the
lake. I do not know-perhaps the committee
had a particular candidate in mind-but I
might suggest that Jonah of Biblical times
would have been an excellent candidate for
the lake. However, the man who had held the
Lake Centre seat had the courage to run in
a renowned Liberal constituency, which seat
he won, and he has won it on successive
occasions since. I say that this Government,
and the Prime Minister in particular, are to
be commended for bringing in an objective
and impartial measure, in the form of an
independent commission, to decide how electoral redistribution should be made.
Honourable senators, I also wish to congratulate the Government on its winter works
program. The Minister of Labour bas been
working in close co-operation with provincial
and municipal governments and governments at every level. This program is working well, and is creating much employment.
I come now to the speech of my friend the
honourable senator from Brantford (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald). He talked at length about
minority governments. As the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary)
pointed out, minority governments have been
known since the days of Pitt the Younger in
England. In 1921 the then leader of the
Liberal party, the Right Honourable Mackenzie King, had a minority government, and
he faced the House of Commons with it. With
that minority government he governed the
country from 1921 to 1930 with the exception
of a few months in 1926.
What has happened in the province of
Ontario? My friend the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and
my friend the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol) were members of the Liberal Government in Ontario,
until differences occurred. I am not going
to say anything about that, but they were
27511-5-ll

ministers of the Liberal Government in
Ontario. What happened in 1943? The Liberal
Government of that day, under the Honourable Harry Nixon, a very fine man, held
about 60 or 70 seats, and when the election
was over the Liberals had retained only 15
seats.
The Conservative party, led by the Honourable George Drew, had 38 seats, and I believe that the C.C.F., as it was then called,
had 34. In that situation was there any
suggestion made by my friends opposite that
the Honourable George Drew did not have
a mandate? They were greatly relieved that
he and not the C.C.F. was in the driver's
seat. There was no call for the immediate
assembly of the legislature of Ontario. The
election was held on August 4, and the legislature did not meet until sometime in
February. Did we hear any hue and cry
about a minority government, that no appointments should be made? Not a word.
Then we come to 1957, and what happened
then? I take issue with my friend the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald,
Brantford) when lie says that the leader of
the Liberal party, the Honourable Mr. Pearson, made the greatest comeback ever in
history.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Willis: What about the situation
in 1957? In the House of Commons the
Progressive Conservatives had 51 supporters
before the election, and after the election
they returned to the bouse with 112 seats,
a gain of 61. The Liberal party, under Mr.
Pearson, returned 48 members to the House
of Commons. In the last election lie was
returned with a total of 100 members, a
gain of 52. So our gain in 1957 still topped
by nine his gain in the last election. I just
point that out to keep the record straight. In
1957, when the Liberals had 105 seats and
the Conservatives 112, was there any suggestion made by the renowned constitutional
authority, the Prime Minister of the day, the
Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, that he
should not give up office to the then Leader
of the Opposition? Of course, I do not know,
but I heard there were two or three dissenting cabinet ministers. However, the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent knew his constitutional history, and he immediately tendered his resignation to the Governor General
of the day, who called upon the now Right
Honourable John G. Diefenbaker to form a
government.
Was there any suggestion that that was a
minority government? Was there any suggestion that lie should not appoint judges, senators or others to official positions? Senators

SENATE
were appointed in 1957 when Her Majesty
the Queen was opening Parliament. Did we
hear any voice of objection from those sitting
on the other side? Not one. Not only that,
but the Prime Minister of the day, the Right
Honourable John G. Diefenbaker, who was
sworn in on June 21, 1957, went to the
Prime Ministers' Conference in London, England. I realize, of course, that Mr. St. Laurent
had his bags packed and his reservations
made, but he was enough of a man and a
constitutional lawyer to know that he could
not attend. Did honourable senators or the
members of the party opposite raise any objection to Mr. Diefenbaker's going to the
Prime Ministers' Conference in 1957? Not a
word of objection was heard, and they
thought he did a wonderful job.
So, why the hue and cry in 1962 over Mr.
Diefenbaker going to the Prime Ministers'
Conference on the European Common Market?
I will tell you why. The cup of victory was
so close for them on the night of June 18,
but suddenly the western farmers came
through and success was torn away. The
result was frustration, and that was the
reason for the hue and cry against the present
Prime Minister's going to that conference.
I had the honour to be appointed to this
body by John G. Diefenbaker, Prime Minister
of this country. I was proud to be appointed
by him as-to change the words applied by
my friend, the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot)-a "workhorse", and I will continue to work for him,
because I think it is in the interests of
Canada to work for such a splendid Prime
Minister.
It appears to me that there is some uneasiness on the other side of the chamber. My
friend the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye raised a point on seven words from
the Speech from the Throne. I have combed
that speech, and I think I have found the
seven words which gave rise to this uneasiness:
Legislation respecting the Senate will
be introduced.
What is wrong with those seven words?
Why should not legislation respecting the
Senate be introduced? The first time I heard
about reformation of the Senate was as a
boy going to high school in 1919, when my
father mentioned it. The Liberal party met
in this city and chose the Right Honourable
Mackenzie King as their leader, and at that
time they had as a plank in their platform
the reformation of the Senate. What happened
to that plank? I will tell you what happened
to it: it died of dry rot.
I think this chamber should consider
Government legislation by the Prime Minister

of the day as such legislation is brought
before it. I say that we have a moral duty
and obligation to examine such legislation
and to do so carefully.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We will do that.
Hon. Mr. Willis: So will we.
I wish to say that the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford),
who is a good friend of mine, in the closing
remarks of his speech seemed to be prejudging the legislation which was forecast in
the Speech from the Throne; and it also
seemed to me-if I am wrong be can correct
me-that he was opposing a lot of things to
come before this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): You cannot read that interpretation into anything I
said.
Hon. Mr. Willis: I accept the correction and
I withdraw any remarks which implied otherwise, but to me it appeared that he had a
reservation in respect to the form of legislation which might come before this house. If
that is wrong I heartily withdraw because I
know my friend is a man of his word and a
man of honour.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Bran±ford): I said,
and it is all that you can read into my
remarks, that we will consider all legislation
as we have done in the past.
Hon. Mr. Willis: Well, it just adds a little
more spice to the cake.
Honourable senators have quoted various
authorities on the functions of the Senate,
and the honourable senator from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. O'Leary) quoted Arthur Meighen.
I too want to quote Arthur Meighen on the
function of this chamber when he said:
Members of the Second Chamber must
get away, lift their minds far from those
hard-drawn lines of party, or they cannot serve their country. They have to
make up their minds to give every
government fair play and not to stand in
the way of legislation unless they are
convinced it must be defeated on its
merits . . .
I say to this honourable bouse that I, as a
newcomer to this body, will reserve my
judgment and my vote on all legislation that
comes before it, and I am not going to have
any preconceived ideas about legislation
before it comes here, whether from the Government or from the other place. I think it is
our obligation and our duty to examine
legislation carefully, to give it due consideration, and then to make our decision.
I would like to say in closing that never
in my life, and I have been interested in
politics for a long time, have I seen a more

OCTOBER 30, 1962
determined effort to detract from a great man,
a great leader, and a great Prime Minister,
than has been done in the case of the Right
Honourable John G. Diefenbaker, I say to
the honourable members of this chamber that
the election campaign which culminated on
June 18, in which the name of the Prime
Minister was ridiculed by the use of the word
"Diefenbuck", was a disgrace to Canada. But,
as I was told by one of the members of my
own constituency, they would sooner have
"Diefenbuckers" than "Pearsonitis".
All I ask is that we give legislation by this
Government fair consideration, that we
examine it thoroughly and then make up
our minds as to how we will vote.
I close by saying that I am grateful to have
been appointed by the greatest Prime Minister
Canada bas ever had.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hayden, debate
adjourned.
SONS OF FREEDOM DOUKHOBORS
IN CANADA
MOTION TO APPOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEEDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
October 10, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Croll:
That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to inquire into and report
upon the continuing problems presented
by the Sons of Freedom Doukhobors in
Canada and any problems related
thereto;
That this said committee be composed
of twenty honourable senators ta be
named later;
That the committee be empowered to
send for persons, papers and records; and
That the committee be instructed to
report to the house from time to time
its findings, together with such recommendations as it may see fit to make.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Honourable senators, this debate has been adjourned in my name, but I am yielding my
place to the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson).
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, I rise to talk on this motion now before
the house, and moved by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croll), but I am rather hesitant to follow
the able speech we have just heard from
the honourable senator for Peel (Hon. Mr.
Willis). We have heard three good speeches
from this side, and I feel I should have been
inoculated with a little bit of Irish blood to
be able to speak as they do.

In speaking to this motion with regard to
the Doukhobors, I would like to give as my
opinion, and to emphasize it very strongly,
that this type of motion may cause friction
between certain groups of people, and bring
bad feeling upon ourselves in the Senate
and to the majority of the Doukhobor people.
I personally have known many Doukhobors, and have had business dealings with
them for years. I have found them as sound
a class of people as any other ethnic group
in Canada. They are thrifty, honest, and
hardworking. They keep beautiful homes and
excellent buildings. They grow flowers
around their buildings to add a little touch of
colour about their farm homes. They are
progressive, both in farming and in business.
They take part in local affairs and become
municipal councillors and reeves in their
municipalities. They are excellent farmers
and keep up with all modern types of farming, especially in western Canada. In my
opinion they are as thorough-going Canadians
as any group who have come to this country
from Europe.
In my relations with these people I came
to know them personally. I have stayed at
their homes. I have shared bread with them.
I have never felt my work with these people
was any different from that with any other
nationality in western Canada. These people
to whom I refer constitute today the bulk of
the Doukhobors in Canada. They have large
settlements around Canora, Blaine Lake,
Borden, and Langham, in Saskatchewan, with
all of which I am familiar.
Many years ago a small group known as
the Freedomites, or the Sons of Freedom,
started to burn schools in the settlements, and
generally to carry on as they do at the present
time in British Columbia. But that sect has
since moved out of Saskatchewan, and as far
as I know all its members have gone to
British Columbia. They comprise a very small
group of the race of Doukhobors.
The Doukhobor is a strong family man and
is very religious in his emotions. He believes
strongly in certain ways of life, and in parental
authority. To them this is their way of life,
and was for generations before they came
to this country. It is difficult for these people
to become assimilated into the western type
of living and home life as we know it.
It is my opinion that the only way by
which they can be assimilated into our system
is the slow process of education and example
given them by our own people. This has happened to those who have now taken their
place in the communities of Saskatchewan,
and I have no doubt that a percentage of
them, though it may be small, will break

SENATE
away from the sect that is in difficulty in
British Columbia at the present time, and will
gradually conform to our way of life.
Our problern, as I see it, honourable senators, is ta bear with these people and try
ta inculcate in them aur free, easy and modern
way of life. We should punish, where necessary, those who are guilty of infractions of
the law, but I do nlot think we need make
a full inquiry inta the Daukhobor way of life
in Canada. It is for this reason that I cannot support this resolutian.
Honourable senators, I feel it would be a
very bad thing for the Government of Canada,
and the Senate in particular, ta be involved in
an inquiry of this sort inta the lives of a
certain group of citizens. I feel that inquiries
into any ethnic group reek of superiarity
an the part of thase who make the inquiry.
The need of aur country has always been

for integration of ail the peaples inta one
whole, and flot a division into ethnie graups.
It might as well be said, because we have
difficulty with a few youngsters in certain

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators,
when the new senators came into the Senate
I personally welcomed them. When I saw
His Honour the Speaker shortly after his
appointment, since he is a very old friend of
mine, I congratulated him. He is doing precisely the excellent job that I felt most confident he would do. At this stage, in relation
to the newly-appointed senators, that is all I
have to say that might come within the description of complete recommendation for
what they have said since they became members of this chamber.
The debate so far on the motion for an
address has taken a different course from
that of debates on the address in previous
years while I have been a member of the
Senate. If we have ground rules-and I
thought that maybe we had a few-they seem
to have been completely scrapped. Having
regard to the tenor of the speeches, particularly those made by the newly-appointed
senators, I would regard this debate on the
motion for an address as having no rules
other than one to the effect that it is open
hunting season. If I have a quota of ducks
in this open hunting season, then I hope I am
able to get a few today.
As I regard what bas been said, it appears
that the newly-appointed senators are a
special task force to whom has been assigned
two chief duties. One is to see to it that
the image of the Prime Minister is put on
the highest pedestal that human ingenuity
could possibly construct.

Hon. Mr. Grosari: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The second is to point
out to the people of Canada that, whether or
not they feel it or believe it, they are having
the best time of their lives now.
Well, that is a large order but, this being
the space age, these senators who took off on
their tasks and got into orbit faster than
anything ever has at Cape Canaveral, and
then having at least established a position, on
cloud nine, they looked down from that
lofty eminence and told us of the wonders
of the world so far as Canada is concerned.
It is true that it is difficult for us to follow
all that, for we who are on the ground in
Canada, mingling with all the people and
listening to all sources of information, have
not had made available to us as yet the
sights that must have been unfolded to them
from that lofty position. However, I would
point out to them that sightseeing and a
special viewing of that kind, coupled with
skilled oratory, is still not enough. There
should be some attempt made at stating fact
-fact in a form which can truly be accepted
as fact-and I hope to indicate in a few
particulars where that fact is missing.
I am sorry the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary) is not in his
place because I want to say a few things
about his remarks. After he had finished his
speech I told him that every time I have
heard himi speak-and I have heard him often;
I am a great admirer of his-I have had to
dig my feet firmly into the ground to keep
from being carried away by the force and
spell of his oratory. However, I succeeded in
not being carried away the other day, but I
suggest that possibly the orator himself was
carried away because-the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson)
developed this when she spoke, coupled with a
criticism of Mr. Walter Gordon-the honourable senator from Carleton took the figures
of the gross national product as projected to
the end of this year, compared that projection
with the one Mr. Gordon made in his report
in 1955, and pointed out that really Canada
is free-wheeling at a much swifter rate than
even that which Mr. Gordon thought would
be a good rate. The honourable senator took
the 1955 projection, and said that we had
now arrived at about the point where Mr.
Gordon thought we would be in 1965.
But one little fact was overlooked. If one
is going to make comparisons then one has
to make them as between figures that are
related. The projection made in 1955 in relation to subsequent years was in constant 1955
dollars, and that sum of money was being
compared by the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary) with the 1962
figures. He might just as well have compared

OCTOBER 31, 1962
apples with bananas. At least when apples
and bananas are compared one might end up
with a good fruit salad, but when one compares these two entirely different sets of
figures one ends up with exactly nothing.
If you put them on a basis of equality, then
there is nothing extraordinary about the comparison; the gross national product, in terms
of constant dollars of 1955, would still follow
reasonably closely in line with the projection
which Mr. Walter Gordon made. However,
enough of that.
Honourable senators, I should point out that
when my friend the honourable senator from
Pickering (Hon. Mr. Grosart) took off into
space he really did a thorough job. One of
his comments was that "one of the greatest
economic upsurges in our history has taken
place in the last five years". Then he called
for his witnesses-headlines and quotations.
Argument by headline and quotation is not
very satisfactory. It may be wonderfully
satisfactory on a political platform or in a
partisan pamphlet; but when you are speaking to people who want to know the facts
underlying such a statement, it becomes an
entirely different thing.
In my friend's quotations, the first reference he made was interesting to me. I was
happy to note that he was referring to a
bank of which I think most highly. He referred to the current "Monthly Review" issued
by the Bank of Nova Scotia.
The only trouble about my friend's reference was that he was too scissor-happy. While
he reached into this letter and abstracted a
quotation from it, he stopped at the first
sentence and even then he took only part of
the first sentence. That was part of his buildup to "one of the greatest economic upsurges
in our history" having taken place over the
five-year period.
May I read the whole of the first sentence
to you, honourable senators, and you will
see what I mean by his being scissor-happy.
First of all, I should tell you what my friend
read:
business activity in Canada has improved
markedly during the past year and a
half.
The whole sentence reads:
After some years of disappointing
growth and a recession which reached
its low point in the early months of 1961,
business activity in Canada has improved
markedly during the past year and a half.
There is a little difference there. I cannot
read into that sentence any support for the
statement that this is the greatest economic
upsurge of all time.
27511-5-12

Furthermore, my friend the honourable
senator from Pickering (Hon. Mr. Grosart)
did not give us the title of the letter, which
is of particular interest. I can understand why
he did not. When you get up on cloud nine
and your oratory takes over, ordinary words
are not quite enough to describe what you
want to say. The heading of this letter is:
"Moderate Tempo in Canadian Business." Of
course, in the language which the honourable
senator from Pickering used during his remarks, the word "moderate" would have
little meaning. That word is too anaemic to be
used in a context in which he wished to describe Canada as a land of milk and honey, a
Canada that was enjoying its greatest prosperity, in a cloudless economic sky, a Canada
where the genius of leadership and the magic
wand of Conservative doctrine had brought the
Canadian people, in the language of Tennyson's The Lotos-Eaters, "unto a land in which
it seemed always afternoon".
There for a moment I have attempted to
use the kind of language that my friend used
in his portrayal of Canada.
There are many other comments in this
letter, which I am sure my friend read and
with which I shall not burden honourable
senators now. I would be prepared to discuss
them on any occasion. I think it gives a very
fair statement of the play of economic forces
in Canada over a period of years.
May I repeat to my friend that if one is
calling on headlines and quotations, the essential principle first must be to give a true
and accurate quotation, otherwise everything
is distorted and thrown out of context.
We come to another statement in connection with our rate of unemployment. It
seemed to be very significant, at least from
that position high up on cloud nine, that the
actual rate of unemployment for September
was 3.9. True, if it were seasonally adjusted,
as the D.B.S. figures are for all other periods
we have dealt with, it would be higher than
3.9. But immediately my friend took off with
another one of his statements that this supports the great upsurge-the greatest of all
time-a statement seeking to establish that
we are well on the way to achieving new
highs. A number of factors were completely
overlooked, one of them being that from the
end of September until February we move
into a period where unemployment becomes
increasingly greater. To stop with one month,
on the theory that one swallow makes a summer, is not, in my submission, the right way
to make a projection in support of a positive
statement that we are, and have been for a
period of five years, in the greatest economic
upsurge in the history of Canada.

SENATE
I am very happy to learn that in the month
of September our rate of unemployment
dropped. I would point out that, as my friend
must know, September is a sort of dividing
month when the labour force reduces because of the many people who return to their
scholastic vocations, and so on, and when
construction jobs are being completed, and
thereby the rate of unemployment is not
unduly accelerated. It is dangerous in those
circumstances to try to argue by using statistics for one month, particularly if one does
not go back earlier than September of this
year. It is true that when the statistics are
looked at in the light of previous years an
improvement is indicated, but certainly it is
not an improvement which would justify the
statement that for the past five years we are
living, enjoying, and moving about in this the
greatest of economic upsurges. In that connection, I wonder if my friend has read an
article in Maclean's magazine, dated November 3, 1962, which states:
Among people who compile and compare unemployment statistics, there is
general agreement this fall on only one
thing: this winter will be a long and
hungry one for many Canadians. But
exactly how tough things will get is still
anybody's guess, and almost everybody in
Ottawa is playing the unemployment
numbers game. Predictions: Government
economists say that peak unemployment
will probably come in February and
involve about 8 per cent of the labour
force, or around 550,000 men. This is one
percentage point lower than last year's
peak, and is an optimistic forecast.
I am very happy that even on those figures
there is a little room for optimism as against
previous years; but I say in all seriousness
there is no room for the kind of optimism
that whirls around on the economic merry-goround, proclaiming that this is the greatest
ride we have ever had and that greater things
are still to come. I have to look at trends. I
have not that eye that my friend appears to
have in undue measure because I am a
little envious that he is able to make a
mountain out of a molehill as well as he does.
Next, my friend in discussing the greatest
period of prosperity overlooked a number
of things. I guess they were unimportant
from that lofty position up yonder, but down
here we remember and are mindful of some
things that we are still living with. We recall
devaluation, we recall the emergency that it
precipitated-and the description "emergency" is one that was applied by the Prime
Minister himself. I recall austerity, and the
connotation of austerity, where we imposed
surcharges on already high tariffs with the

avowed purpose of reducing imports so as to
establish some better relationship between
exports and imports.
There are many other things I recall in
that connection. I still recall our huge force
of unemployed. I recall our deficits, persistent
deficits, and how my friend dealt with these
in a very casual way. In effect he said, "Yes,
we incurred deficits but we gave a lot more
money ta the people of Canada in welfare
benefits, and we gave a lot more money in
payments to the provinces".
Well, on the question of payments to the
provinces do not let us forget that I have been
the one voice in this chamber for a number
of years-and fortunately the Prime Minister
heard me at some stage-opposing any taxation by the federal authorities the proceeds
of which were going to be handed over to
a provincial authority. In my submission, and
it is still my view, there should be a direct
link between the authority that imposes the
tax and the one that spends the moneythey should be the same people-and then
the expenditures might be more cautiously
made, and the taxpayer would be more alert
as to knowing who was really putting the
bite on him for his tax dollars. Be that as it
may, I look at all these things in perspective:
devaluation, emergency, unemployment, the
continuing situation of having to meet substantial balance of payments, and our exports,
which are now on the increase. As to exports,
I remind you that the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) said in his speech
that he found it favourable that for the first
seven months of 1962 exports to all countries
were up 11.3 per cent over 1961.
He found that noteworthy and a thing to
praise. I agree it is noteworthy and is a
thing to praise. It means more domestic employment in connection with the production
of those goods for export, but the connotation
in which you must look at exports is in relation to imports in order to see how we are
faring with our balance of payments. So we
might look at this, and I say to the Leader
of the Government that for the first seven
months of 1962 our imports were up 15 per
cent over 1961. Therefore, while we are producing more for export we are not closing
the gap between exports and imports and
thereby not reducing our obligations as to
balance of payments.
There is another thing that I might point
out while I am dealing with this area and
trying to set out all the facts so that we
will have realism in our discussion. It is
this: My friend must know that the rate of
growth in the gross national product of Canada from 1957 ta 1961 was about one per
cent and the rate of population increase
was about 2 per cent. Now, if I take the year

OCTOBER 31, 1962
1962 as having a 6 per cent increase and I
average it out over the period from 1957
to 1962, I arrive at a rate of increase in the
gross national product which would be less
than the rate of increase in our population.
Economists have said-and I am sure my
friend has seen it, and if not I can give him
references-that in order for our economy to
take care of our labour force and the accretions to it, we must have an annual increase
in our gross national product of the order
of 32 per cent.
I should point out to my friend-although
I know this is a horrible thing for me to do,
because what went on in Canada prior to
1957 when those Liberals were in office is
something that you just do not speak about,
since Canada just started living in 1957-that
the average rate of growth of the gross national product in Canada for the ten years
prior to 1957, or up to 1957, whichever way
you want to take it, was of the order of
4j per cent.
I could also point out to my friend that in
1950 our dollar was down to 91 cents in
terms of United States dollars, notwithstanding that it went up in value before 1957
until it reached something of the order of 5,
6, 7, 8, or 10 per cent. I should also point
out to my friend that-he undoubtedly
knows but I will recall it to him-in that
period we had the same problem as we have
today of having to meet our balance of pay-

ments, to close the gap, and a very substantial
gap, between exports and imports which has
to be settled by the provision of exchange.
But there was this big difference that between 1950 and 1957: there was a substantial
inflow of foreign capital year after year, and
even in 1958 it was of the order of $1.5
billion. Our balance of payments was of the

order of about $1 billion, $1.1 billion or $1.2
billion, but we had from the capital inflow
source enough to take care of our balance
of payments.
In 1959 the capital inflow got down to
$1,150 million; in 1960 it dropped to $875
million; in 1961 it was just over $600 million,
and in the first six months of 1962 it was
$135 million.
One of our big problems continuously has
been that of taking care of this gap in the
balance of payments. You will recall, I am
sure, the budget speech which the then
Minister of Finance made in December, 1960
-not his maiden, his baby budget-when he
introduced measures increasing the withholding tax, or placing withholding tax, on
interest and dividend payments to non-residents where formerly there had been no tax
or a substantially lower tax. He gave certain
reasons for doing it, and although I am sure
27511-5--121

you are all familiar with what he said on
that occasion, I shall repeat his words:
In the light of the developments I
have described, however, it has become
desirable to propose certain measures
which will, I believe, help the Canadian
economy to achieve an improved equilibrium with the outside world. At this
stage of our national development it is
appropriate to withdraw some of the
special incentives which were designed
in past years to attract foreign capital.
As a result of such special concessions,
non-residents profiting from investment
in Canada do not always bear their fair
share of the general costs of government

and administration, although they benefit
in full measure from them. To redress
this situation, I shall be recommending
several amendmetns to bring the principal
non-resident withholding taxes up to a
uniform level of 15 per cent, which is
recognized in our law as the standard or
normal rate.
Now, this is significant to me, but my
friend may say that it is an entirely unrelated
matter and is purely coincidental with the
change in taxation in relation to interest payable to non-residents holding Canadian bonds,
federal and provincial, that in 1960 our
capital inflow was of the order of $875 million,
that in 1961 it dropped to $600 million, and
in the first half of 1962 it was down to $135
million.
So long as the Canadian economy is in a
position where we cannot close the gap between exports and imports and we have to
find exchange to take care of the balance of
payments, then for just that long this must be
a healthy climate for foreign capital to
live in.
The best witness I can call-and a witness
that my friend would not, in view of what he
has said, dispute-is the Prime Minister himself, in the Speech from the Throne, where he
says that one of the functions of his Government is going to be to make this a climate
hospitable to foreign capital. I suggest that
there is some relationship. There may have
been other reasons, inducing reasons, which
I will deal with in a moment. However, I
should point out certain other things to my
friend that may take just a little of the rosy
hue off the picture that he gave us the other
day of this great era of prosperity.
The economists seem to be agreed that so
far as capital expenditure in Canada is concerned the drive in capital spending in this
country is lagging, and that it has not been
picking up in line with the pick up in business
leading to more exports and consumer spending. One reason for that may be that we still

SENATE
have over-capacity in Canada, and until we
become healthier in that regard we cannot
expect capital expenditure at a high rate.
But it is a very significant factor in a fully
operating economy, where your desire is to
have maximum employment and maximum
happiness and satisfaction for people living in
Canada.
These are all things I point out to my
friend, and to all honourable senators. I point
them out not with the intention of saying
that you must draw the conclusion that
Canada has gone down the drain. So far as
Canada and my love and respect for Canada
are concerned, I bow to no one, not even when
my friend attempts to wrap himself in the
glories of Canada and brings in, under the
great flag that he wraps around himself, even
as distinguished a person as Mr. Chalmers.
I still avow that no matter what I say here
I say it in the spirit of a true Canadian, and
I have the right to point out that things are
not as rosy as we are led to believe and that
these are factors which should be considered.
Even the honourable senator from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. O'Leary) did not go as far as the
honourable senator from Pickering (Hon. Mr.
Grosart), because after the senator from
Carleton had reached that crescendo in his
oratorical effort of praising the prosperity of
Canada, he then went on to say:
While I say to you that everything in
Canada is reasonably prosperous, I would
not like to conclude by saying that everything in Canada is well and that everything in Canada is going to be well.
There is the difference, and the significant
difference between myself and my honourable
friend from Pickering is that I believe
Canada, under proper guidance, can work
herself out of her problems. I am not one of
those who are going to sing in high C, or get
up on cloud nine, in order to try and persuade
Canadians to believe that our condition is
infinitely better than on a factual study one
can logically conclude.
There are some other points I wish to
make in connection with what the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary)
said. I regret that the Senate was used as
a sounding board for airing a family quarrel
between British and Canadian Tories. In
my view it contributed nothing to the quality
of the debate in this chamber. If one's spleen
gets worked up to the extent that one has to
ourst forth in such expressions and wash
the party linen in public, my friend had other
facilities available for doing so, and his doing
so in this chamber did not add anything to
our deliberations here.

Another point that interested me was the
statement by my friend the honourable senator from Carleton that in Canada discussion of the European Common Market has
been almost wholly illiterate. I suggest to my
friend that perhaps he should change his
circle of friends, because if he came over and
talked to us or moved in other circles he
might think differently. There seems to be a
pretty good understanding of what the Common Market is in those circles, and it may
be that my friend has just been keeping the
wrong company too long.
If honourable senators will permit me to
revert for a moment to the question of devaluation: it is an interesting and very serious story as far as Canada is concerned, for
I have indicated to you the vital importance
of capital inflow. Not only do we have to
close the gap between exports and imports
but we also have to provide for that tremendous amount of money which moves out of
Canada in the form of intangibles, nonmerchandise transactions, dividends, freight,
insurance premiums, and that sort of thing.
Therefore, we must provide ourselves with
the means to take care of them.
In the late months of 1961 and the early
months of 1962 our foreign exchange margin
showed a wide spread. The only way one
could interpret it was that there was a reasonably wide spread. The continuing view was
that the Canadian dollar was weakening
and that devaluation would have to come. To
prevent the dollar from dropping further, a
substantial amount of money was used out
of our exchange funds in January and February of 1962 to try to bolster the dollar at
95 cents. In March nothing of importance
happened in relation to the dollar or the
fund, but in April the downward pressure
commenced again, and the net loss of U.S.
dollars for April was in the order of $115
million. Before the rate was fixed at 92J
cents on May 2, we had a loss of about another $116 million.
The decision as to devaluation was taken
on May 2, and yet as late as two weeks before that date the then Minister of Finance,
the Honourable Mr. Fleming, had stated that
our best interests did not dictate such a course.
I do not cite that to question the judgment
of the then minister, but only to point out
that the circumstances which had developed
in the period of two weeks from the time he
made the statement were of such importance
that he had to reverse his opinion and go
for devaluation of the dollar at 92J cents.
I say that was the time that the emergency
should have been recognized. That was the
time when, if we had any remedial measures,
they should have been brought into force. In

OCTOBER 31, 1962
fact, all that happened was that we were carried along, and the Government persisted in
announcing to the public that 92k cents was a
fair figure, that the dollar would be able to
hold its own at that level, and that our position was secure.
Immediately after the election a real emergency was apparent and it became necessary
to introduce measures of austerity, to
announce that we were going on a housekeeping savings program to the extent of
$250 million, and to arrange for loans from
the International Monetary Fund, from the
Bank of England and from the Reserve Bank
of the United States, together with lines of
credit to the order of over $1 billion.
On an examination of the figures it will
become apparent that our exchange fund had
dropped from about $2 billion at the beginning of 1962 to less than $1j billion on May 2,
1962. Surely there was enough significance
in that drop and in the force of those circumstances which compelled the Minister of
Finance to change his opinion on devaluation
to convince us that we should then have
got going with our measures for correction,
instead of waiting until a further impact
developed with the result that by the time
we announced austerity we had lost another
$300 million or $400 million.
Now we come to assess the situation-and
I do not want my friend to think I am picking
on him, but he made some statements which
I feel lack factual support, and I hope I am
successful in pointing out to him the fact that
there is some question as to whether or not
any factual support exists for what he says.
He commented in his speech on the tremendous increase of $636 million in the exchange
fund since "D-day" came on June 24. He
says, pointing to that buoyancy and the resiliency in our economy which could produce
such a change so quickly, we are off again,
free-wheeling, and the sky is the limit. The
upsurge had stopped suddenly, and we were
on the way again.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Is the honourable senator suggesting that I used the phrase "the
sky is the limit"? I am wondering if he is
suggesting that I used any of these extravagant phrases. It might be fair to keep to the
phrases I used.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If my friend feels my
paraphrasing of what he said is not accurate,
then I shall withdraw the phrases I used and
retain the exact language he used. I shall put
it whichever way he prefers. "The sky is the
limit" is my expression, but I thought it
flowed freely and logically, from what he said,
much more so than did some of his conclusions.

Now let us see how this situation has built
up. Does my friend know-or should I say
does he recall, because I would assume that
he did know in July-that there was an
advance debt repayment by France which
swelled our exchange funds by $62 million?
Does he recall that in October there was an
advance debt repayment by the Netherlands
that swelled the exchange fund by a further
$32 million? Does he know that the take-over
by Shell 011 of shares of Canadian Oil
resulted in an increase in exchange to Canada
of the order of $110 million? Does my friend
appreciate too that this replenishment of the
exchange fund took place in July and August,
our tourist season, which produces substantial
exchange funds? Before I would embark on
a prediction that all is well, I would want to
wait a little longer and see how we fare in
September, October, November and December,
when those favouring forces will not be working as strongly for us and when we will have
a chance to see whether our economy has
got out of the priming-of-the-pump stage, and
has acquired sufficient momentum to operate
on its own.
There you have an increase of about $700
million in the exchange fund, but I would
say that these advance debt repayments, the
proceeds of the Canadian Oil takeover, and
the tourist traffic revenue, would amount to
approximately $400 million or $500 million
of that.
There is still another factor that my friend
must consider, namely, that the businessmen
of Canada who sold their goods outside
Canada and who, during the period since the
beginning of the year, were receiving payment
in United States dollars, left these United
States dollars abroad because from the signs
then apparent they expected there must, of
necessity, be some devaluation, and after June
24 they started closing out those accounts and
bringing that money back into Canada,
thereby further increasing the exchange
fund.
These are the different factors involved,
and I cite them to my friend, not because I
am unhappy that they occurred, but in case
he should be tempted to take off again on one
of his descriptions of the biggest upsurges of
prosperity that Canada has ever had. I
would point out to him that these were things
which he cannot say were done by this great
Government which he did so much to electand may I add that he did a good job so far
as getting them elected. These are things that
I am very happy to say indicate that some of
our economic forces can operate irrespective
of government. I say that in the most general
language in the world, because some decisions
can be made without having to refer to
government.

OCTOBER 31, 1962

have tremendous operations in Canada, and I
would venture to guess, so far as their tax
position being affected one iota by the withholding tax here, that by reason of the very
unusual way in which the effective tax rate
is calculated for life companies in the United
States, and the way tax credits are calculated,
they will be getting full credit for what they
pay here. In effect, so long as that withholding tax remains-and I am not sure of how
long it will remain since the Speech from the
Throne says that there is going to be a
climate hospitable to foreign capital investment-it will be Uncle Sam who is really
paying the withholding tax to the Canadian
Government, because these companies will
get a credit for it in the United States.
Be that as it may, there are several factors
in it. One is that the loan is payable between
now and next May. I understand the reason
for that was that the United States treasury
was concerned about its balance of payments,
and therefore requested the loan be dealt with
in that form.
When I looked at the prevailing rate on
United States government long-term bonds
at that time, I noted it was in the order of
about 3.8 per cent, but when I looked at
the history of the spread between interest on
United States long-term bonds and interest
on Canadian bonds in the United States
market heretofore, I found it was of the
order of one-half of one per cent.
I find all these factors which demonstrate
to me that we may have rushed too quickly,
and for some purpose that is not easily discernible, to conclude this borrowing at a
rate which indicates that the United States
investor did not regard the Canadian bond
as being as high a type of security as the
U.S. government bond.
While I am on that note I should point
out, too, that recently the Municipal Finance
Corporation in Alberta negotiated a loan of
$25 million in the New York market, payable
in U.S. dollars at 5 per cent interest, or
coupon rate. I understand the bonds will be
offered about the middle of November, and
that the issue price is par.
In our borrowing in September, and in the
Alberta borrowing in November, there is
apparently no distinction recognized in the
rate. I am not suggesting that there is any
doubt in the minds of the foreign investors
that these bonds will not be paid, but the
spread indicates a judgment of the quality
of the security at the time the offering was
made as against U.S. government bonds.
This just about brings me to the end of
what I can usefully say on an occasion such
as this, but I do want to point out the
great danger of distorting facts and situations. Of course, when you are hungry for

good news even a morsel very quickly magnifies itself into a full course meal. On that
basis I think my honourable friend and the
other speakers in the group that I classified
earlier took the morsels where they could
find them, and got the excess of comfort
they could out of them. I am not blaming
them for that. Perhaps had the situation
been reversed I might have been trying to
do the same thing. What I am trying to do
here is keep my honourable friend's feet on
the ground, and to be as realistic as I can.
In case my friend may not have heard me
clearly and distinctly the first time-because,
apparently, that can happen when I am
speaking, as indicated by his previous question-I shall repeat that in nothing I have
said have I represented that Canada is in a
hopeless economic position, that Canada is
bankrupt. I want to emphasize that very
clearly. I believe strongly in Canada. I
believe strongly in the ability and desire
of the Canadian people to work hard. Our
resources are unlimited.
The honourable senator from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. O'Leary) said: we still have our
gold mines and our asbestos; our minerals are
still there in the ground. Yes, and I might
even add that we had them between 1930
and 1935, but there was something more
needed than just the possession of these
valuable assets. They must be developed,
and the climate for development must be
properly nurtured. Having regard to our position, to our population, and the necessity
to export in order to live, we require a
substantial capital inflow to carry out developments. Without the development we cannot spend the wealth from the resources
that are in the ground.
These are the things I am pointing out,
and I am saying that at the present stage
of Canadian development I do not know
whether the upturn is going to persist and
reach levels beyond those of the recession
in 1958, 1959 and for some time in early
1960. Whether we are going to get beyond
that, I do not know, but I have enough
faith in the sturdiness of the Canadian
people and in the good sense of the businessmen of Canada to say that sooner or later
we will get these things on the right rails.
We must take not only a short-term but
a long-term view, because the real solution
to our problems is in an increase in our
exports to such an extent that we can take
care of our balance of payments, and when
we achieve that objective we will be moving
along very well.
However, having regard to our financial
requirements for development, and to the fact
that we do not appear to be able to reduce
our balance of payments-it is estimated

SENATE
that this year they will be at least as high
as they were last year, namely, of the order
of $900 million or $1 billion-we have got
to combine our efforts in such a way as to
provide incentives and to create a climate
in which this economy can work to full
measure.
"Priming the pump" may be a very good
policy from time to time, but I know from
my own early days the basic origin of that
expression. The pump was primed because it
had got a bit rusty, or because something
was sticking and would not work. You primed
the pump to make it work. You primed it
expecting it would continue to work after you
stopped priming.
We have reached a stage with respect to
our winter works program, our subsidies, and
all such things, where their eftect must be
to impart a momentum to the economy that
will make it carry on. That is how we should
look at these things. In the meantime, in
order to take care of such situations as unemployment, we must apply these other temporary measures, but we must never use them
as an end in themselves.
I cannot finish without giving my honourable friend from Pickering (Hon. Mr.
Grosart) one more reference. I do not think
I would have used this had he not referred
to Mr. Chalmers. What I intend to read now
is from Mr. Chalmer's paper, the Financial
Post. The date is October 20, so it is fairly
recent. This is from a front page editorial
under the heading "Nation's Business":
Here is a question to which, we suggest, our political governors promptly
address their serious attention.
Can very basic changes in Canada's
iniquitous and destructive tax system
await the usual lengthy mechanics of
royal commissioning?
The hard and ugly fact is that our
anachronistic tax system inhibits and discourages economic growth. It punishes
success. It destroys capital. It is one of
the most violently offensive tax systems
devised anywhere in the world.
I will let my friend see this editorial afterwards, so that he can fully understand it.
I pass over a paragraph, but it does not
change the context of what I was reading.
The editorial continues:
"Social justice" and "economic equality" have been the predominant objectives of the Canadian economic society
of the past. But for a country which has
reached our point of stagnation and which
faces the horrendous task of creating new
jobs by the million within the next

decade, there is very real social injustice
in perpetuating the tax system of earlier
generations.
While I am on that point, I should like to
refer to a quotation from a speech made by
President Kennedy within the last few
months. In setting out his objective and that
of the American people-an objective which
is equally applicable to us-he said:
My interest is in an economy which
will be strong enough to absorb the potential of a rapidly expanding population, steady enough to avert the wide
swings which bring grief to so many
of our people, and non-inflationary
enough to persuade investors that this
country holds a steady promise of growth
and stability.
Then there is a special reference to the United
States:
My specific interest at this time is in
maintaining a competitive world position
that will not further stir the gold at
Fort Knox.
Paraphrasing that to apply to Canada, I
would say that my special interest at this
time, in maintaining a competitive world
position and in improving the economy of
Canada, is to see that we will not again
disturb our exchange fund to the extent that
we have to rush into emergency and austerity.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I ask the honourable
senator if, when he said "again", he was referring to the last time it was done, by the
previous administration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend is a master
propagandist. His use of the word "again"
there is very significant. I know of one occasion when we had a form of austerity to
support our devalued dollar-that was after
the war. I know of only the one occasion, so
I must answer my friend's question by omitting the word "again". Now we understand
each other. I was referring to any occasion
at any time in the history of Canada when
the resources of Canada, generally or in any
particular, became imperilled.
Apparently I still have not got my message
through to my friend. The barrage that is
floating there, whether it is radioactive or
not, is such that I am able to get through only
once in a while.
I am speaking on the Canadian situation
and I am trying to eliminate from it a lot of
the colouring which has been put into it in
the last few weeks. There are many more
things to be said on this question but there
is another time for saying them.

OCTOBER 31 1962
We have been using half measures in the
matter of taxation. I shall not say much on
that point, as there is a royal commission
dealing with it. I may change my mind on
that in the future. There is a continuous battle
going on in Canada between high, repressive
rates of taxation and the so-called tax incentives to make people think they are not as
badly off as they are. Down one line you have
high repressive tax rates; down the other you
have the forces of incentives.
Notwithstanding the royal commission now
appointed to study the question, I say that
tax rates will not go down until Government
expenditures go down in relation to Government income. The sooner there is an end to
deficits, the better it will be for Canada. I
have a great witness in support of that
because the Prime Minister said in the Speech
from the Throne that it is the objective of his
ministers to balance the budget. I am very
happy to hear that. However, as long as we
maintain those two parallel lines that never
meet, and then superimpose a third one
whereby the income tax division in its administration is establishing new fronts by way
of interpretation and taking away from you
by court decision the protection you thought
you had in the section in the act, some day
there is bound to be a collision, and then for
the first time, I suppose, we shall know where
it is that parallel lines meet.
May I conclude with some words I used
some time ago. I feel at liberty to repeat
them because they were not addressed to
anyone present here today.
The government will continue to search
out new areas for taxation and will rework older areas for additional pickings
while increasing the list of non-taxable
factors deductible from earnings before
determination of profit. And the word
profit will become even more wondrous
in what it includes and excludes. Some
day, and I hope reasonably soon, taxes
and trade, wages, prices and profits will
be put together in a partnership for prosperity. Let us hope that goal is reached
without undue delay.
On motion of Hon. Mr. O'Leary (AntigonishGuysborough), debate adjourned.
SONS OF FREEDOM DOUKHOBORS
IN CANADA

MOTION TO APPOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEEDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Croll:
That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to inquire into and report
upon the continuing problems presented

by the Sons of Freedom Doukhobors
in Canada and any problems related
thereto;
That this said committee be composed
of twenty honourable senators to be
named later;
That the committee be empowered to
send for persons, papers and records; and
That the committee be instructed to
report to the house from time to time its
findings, together with such recommendations as it may see fit to make.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
perhaps I am right in thinking that when the
question of the Doukhobors in British Columbia comes up, someone from that province
should speak; and may I point out, without
being too blunt about it, that personal knowledge and contact is far ahead of simply reading something about the matter in the press.
Now, disrobing by the Doukhobors is nothing new. Back in 1936, I recall that the Conservative member for Kootenay rose one day,
and pointed across to Mr. King, and said,
"What would you do, Mr. Prime Minister, if
you woke up some morning, looked out the
window and saw a naked woman?" "Why", replied the Prime Minister, "I would send for
the Leader of the Opposition". At the outset,
let me say to the mover of this motion (Hon.
Mr. Croîl) that it is not my intention to support it, and before I finish I shall give the
reasons for my decision.
I do not need to take up much time in
relating the entire history of the Doukhobors.
They came to Canada from Russia in 1898.
Russia had had so much trouble with them
that she was glad to get rid of them. As a
matter of fact, history tells us that there
came a period when once a week she took
a group of them out and shot every tenth
man, so fed up was she with the way they
were conducting themselves in that country.
Tolstoy has been mentioned as one who
favoured their cause. It is true that he and
the Quakers of England played a considerable
part in having them settled in Canada. They
came to Canada under a promise that they
would not be called on for military duty.
May I point out to the mover of the motion
(Hon. Mr. Croll) that the leadership of the
Doukhobor group has somewhat changed.
Formerly they had a male leader. Those of
us who come from British Columbia know
that the real leader lives in one of the South
American countries. He escaped with some
$90,000 of Doukhobor funds, and I understand
that collections now are taken from the
Doukhobors and sent to him-money which
comes from the Government of Canada, shall
I say, in the way of welfare allowances,
children's allowances and old age pensions.

SENATE
He was careful to take with him a signed
document that he had the sole right to do
what he liked with that money.
The majority of the Doukhobors are very
good citizens, in both Saskatchewan and
British Columbia, but it is difficult indeed to
get the other group to understand that they
must obey the laws of Canada. It annoys me
greatly that some people who have expressed
themselves in the press and at gatherings,
think a grave injustice has been done to the
Doukhobors. Well, are they going to contend
that the Doukhobors can do anything they
like-violate and defy the laws of this land,
and that we should then pat them on the back,
tell them to go home and be good little boys
and girls?
Honourable senators, let me enumerate
some of the damage and losses which have
taken place in and around Castlegar since the
year 1923. The losses total $17 million, resulting from bombing, burnings, and blowing
up of bridges, grain elevators, railway tracks,
community halls and dwelling houses. Those
losses since 1923 average $1,200 a day.
No pressure or intimidation has been put
on the Doukhobors by the provincial government. I ask the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) to give
me his opinion as to whether or not he
would have them arrested for doing this
kind of thing, or would he just speak nicely
to them and let them go on their way. The
latest damage, amounting to $1 million, was
the dynamiting of one of the largest electric
power lines in the west. This resulted in a
thousand miners and smelter workers being
off work for months. Of course, the provincial
government sent up the police, who picked
up quite a number of these people and took
them off to jail. After a long and fair trial
they were sentenced to prison. Offhand, I
have forgotten the length of the prison
terms, but the federal Government deemed
it advisable to build a special prison for the
Doukhobors. It was erected at a place called
Agassiz, about sixty miles from Vancouver.
Now, I have heard and read of professors,
schoolteachers and others criticizing and crying to high heaven about the Attorney General stopping fifteen hundred Doukhobors
who were on the march to the prison at
Agassiz. I have seen on television, and heard
over the radio, speeches on this subject,
particularly by women. By the way, the
leaders of the Doukhobors are now women,
not men. These people who appeared on T.V.
and spoke over radio were shaking their
fists and saying, "We are going to bust into
the jail. We are on our way, and nothing
on God's earth will stop us."
Now, if I were walking down the street
and met a fellow with a gun who said, "Tom

Reid, I am going to shoot you", would it not
be the duty of the police to stop him? All
the provincial government did in this case
was to say, "We won't allow you to go to
the jail." However, they took some precaution by putting barbed wire all around the
jail.
There has always been trouble with the
Doukhobors. The last time a group of them
was jailed, they went on a hunger strike for,
I think, over a week, and then the authorities
ordered them to be fed forcibly. They were
not to be allowed to die, and rightly so,
and therefore it was justifiable to feed them
forcibly. Yet the government was severely
criticized by many people who thought it was
barbarous to put a tube down the throat of
a man or woman in order to maintain life.
This situation has prevailed with the Doukhobors for years and years. It applies to a
small sect of about 1,200 persons, who are
different from the rest of the Doukhobors,
and who apparently cannot or will not be
changed in their religious views.
Saskatchewan is a good example of an
area where the Doukhobors have become
real citizens of Canada. Their leader in that
province is a prominent lawyer, and he and
two or three others travelled to British
Columbia and pleaded with the Sons of Freedom: "If you are going te carry on in this
way for God's sake change your name to
something other than Doukhobors, and do
not bring all this disgrace and scandal on
our race." However, they paid no attention
to this pleading at all, nor to the speeches
that were made to them by other Doukhobors
from Saskatchewan.
Now, honourable senators, one reason I am
opposed to the motion is that this dangerous
group that is now in control evidently cannot be reasoned with, and so far nothing
bas been done with them. I do not really
know what can be done with them. We certainly cannot put them in jail until they
break the law. The provincial government
acting properly, did go out of its way, and
after a fair trial, put them in jail for burning
houses, blowing up railway lines, and dynamiting power lines. But, something more, it
seems, bas to be done. I think the Attorney
General of British Columbia did right when
he stopped their protest march at a distance
and prevented them from going any further.
There were persons who condemned a small
municipality which enacted a bylaw ahead
of the time of their arrival prohibiting the
Doukhobors from camping there. The question of the validity of that bylaw is now before the courts. I can well understand that
action being taken by a small municipality
when 1,200 Doukhobors were on their way to
the town, intending to set up tents without

OCTOBER 31, 1962
any sanitary conveniences or arrangements
or water supply. We can well appreciate the
mess that would result if they were allowed
to camp there. Of course the people in the
interior where they came from did not want
them either and were quite willing to see
them move elsewhere.
I oppose the motion to set up the proposed
committee, because I feel the Doukhobors,
that is the Sons of Freedom, are definitely
against any kind of government or control
by government. I am afraid that if a committee of the Senate were set up its investigations would have no effect at all as the
Doukhobors would look upon it as government
action. I am sure they would not know the
difference between Parliament and the Government. The committee would go out froin
here as a Government body, and in my opinion only trouble would result.
However, if any committee is to be set up
I would suggest that it be composed of representatives of churches, labour, industry,
chambers of commerce, farmers, and women's
institutes, and let them go out and see what
they can do. I repeat, I would not be a party
to a committee of Parliament being set up
because its members would go out there as
total strangers to the problem. The committee would have on it only one or perhaps
two senators from British Columbia, and the
others would know nothing of the destruction
caused, or how troublesome the Sons of Freedom are now and have been in days gone by.
I think we should give the suggestion of
setting up a Senate Committee a great deal
of serious thought. On the other hand, if the
committee were set up to function only in
Ottawa I do not think it could get a witness
from around the area concerned to appear
and testify. They would be afraid of being
bombed or having their houses burned. You
cannot blame them. One really has to go out
there to appreciate what is happening and
to realize the serious problem that exists.
I was in the city of Nelson at the time
the Doukhobors were holding a parade, and I
saw a girl of twenty-two standing on the steps
of a bank. This girl had been employed for
four years in that bank and was a respected
citizen. As the parade passed she ran down
the steps past me, and all of a sudden her
clothes were off and she was in the parade
with the others. Can you explain that kind of
mentality? Nobody can tell why they do
these things.
It is my opinion that if a committee were
sent out west it might not have anyone attend
to give evidence. The Doukhobors would be
very suspicious, for a Senate committee would
be labelled as part of the Government of
Canada.

I do not know what the cure is. I am very
much surprised at the amount of support
these people get from certain quarters such
as university professors and those highfalutin boys who think they have brains, but
many of whom have little, and who try to
speak as with the voice of wisdom. These are
the people who are damning the Government
for not doing something more. But what can
the Government do? Very little action can be
taken unless the Doukhobors do something
wrong. Seventy of them have been put in jail
for their crimes.
Since the beginning of June, 170 homes
have been destroyed in their sprawling shack
villages hidden away in the Kootenay mountains in western British Columbia. Most of
the arsonists are female members of the band
of 4,000 fanatical Sons of Freedom. They are
against the Government; they will have nothing to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Would
they burn their own homes?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes; I can show you pictures
of what they have done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Or, did
they burn other people's homes?
Hon. Mr. Reid: They burned other people's
homes too, with the result that their neighbours became afraid to speak out against
them. It was mostly the women who burned
their own homes, and always burned them
at break of day-it must have been a kind of
ritual with them. After the houses were
ablaze they stripped off their clothes and
stood before their burning houses. The
destruction of 160 homes is a big loss. I want
to point out to those who are sympathetic
with these people that everything possible
has been tried to make real Canadian citizens
out of them. The Government has not been
using military or police force against them.
I feel sure no one in the Senate would say
they should not be taken to court for the
damage they have done; nor do I think anyone would support the view that nothing can
be done.
I may say that I would not like to be a
member of a committee from this chamber
because I know it would not get very far
with the Sons of Freedom. As I said, they
would look upon the committee as a Government body and they would almost be willing
to sell their lives to block any action by the
Government.
Honourable senators, I may have wearied
you somewhat with the figures I have given,
but I wanted to lay some of the facts before
you and to let the Senate know at least where
I stand on the question.

SENATE
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words on the motion to
set up a committee of the Senate to investigate the Doukhobor problems. In proposing
that such a committee be set up, the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croll) displayed a deep interest in this problem.
When I left the Ottawa Valley as a young
man, and went west, I got firsthand information regarding the Doukhobors and the elaborate territory that was allotted to them. I
only wish I had a picture of the many villages and the beautiful farmland allotted to
these people along the banks of the North
Saskatchewan River. Some of the finest townships in the west were set aside for the
Doukhobors.
When they came to Canada in 1898 they
were guaranteed, as the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina pointed out, that they
would never be asked to take part in military
action. They were given territory and privileges that were unavailable to any other
class of people in Canada or anywhere in the
world. But the Doukhobors were beset with
thievery by their leaders who misused their
money. They were allowed to settle in beautiful villages with wide main streets, hundreds of houses on some of them, while every
Canadian homesteader was forced to live
on his homestead for at least six months of
the year for so many years.
They were allowed to live in the villages
and cultivate whatever land they wished.
They held this land from 1898 until 1907.
Naturally, just as there would appear to be
now, there was a great crusade or political
upheaval in the country and questions were
raised as to why these people should be left
in this position.
At that time, for some reason or otherperhaps in order to keep absolute control
they were ordered by their leader not to
take the oath of allegiance. Faced with this
situation, the Government did everything possible to find a solution. They got a clergyman and a commission to go among the
Doukhobors, explaining to them that although
they would be asked to take the oath of allegiance they could still live in their villages.
They refused to take the oath, and finally
the Government was forced into the position
where they had to make an announcement.
May I say that a few settlements grew up,
but all this land was reserved for ordinary
homesteaders, and it was amongst the finest
in Canada. It was a beautiful sight, to go
down to the villages and see the haystacks.

They had a two-year supply of hay. The
stacks were built to a great height, in fact
so high that they had to erect scaffolding on
the sides. They always had plenty of help in
preparing their hay-the women raked it
until it looked beautiful and would shed rain
for years.
The thing I complain about is that they
were given other special privileges that I do
not think were agreed upon. They were
allowed to register their own births and marriages; they had their own system of marriage
and divorce. Now they appear to want to
retain these privileges in spite of the Government's wishes. In other words, they want as
little governmental control as possible.
The expression of opinion I have heard
from the really good men among them today
-men whom I could not distinguish from
any ordinary good Canadian citizen-is that
in the past the Government has not dealt
with them severely enough. Recently one such
man returned from British Columbia after
the arrests had been made, and I said to him,
"Well, Alec, what are they doing?" He said,
"I think they mean business now. We are
now going to get rough with those fellows,
which is what we should have done long
ago."
The honourable senator mentioned the fact
that they even tried separating the children
from their parents. It was never the intention
merely to separate them. The only reason this
happened was that the parents refused to
send the children to school. The Government
took the children from those parents who
refused to send them to school, and the Government built a school and kept the children
under its care. A few years ago that problem
appeared to be settled; the parents agreed to
send their children to school, and they were
returned to their homes.
A few of them have their leader in South
America, and they give money to him in just
the same way as they did to the older Peter
Veregin. This leader bas bought himself a big
estate down there, and has given his followers
orders to make all the trouble they can.
Honourable senators, what I really rose to
say was that rather than rendering the Doukhobors a service by forming this committee,
we would be doing them a great disservice.
They would be clamouring to come down here
and be heard, and there would bo no end to
it. I say that rather than helping them to find
a solution to the problem we would be doing
them a great injury by setting up a special
committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, debate
adjourned.

The Hon.

GOVERNMENT HOUSE
Ottawa

November 1, 1962
Sir,

I have the honour to inform you that
the Hon. Patrick Kerwin, P.C., Chief
Justice of Canada, acting as Deputy to His
Excellency the Governor General, will
proceed to the Senate Chamber today,
the lst November, at 5.45 p.m., for the
purpose of giving royal assent to certain

bills.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,

Your obedient servant,
A. G. Cherrier
Assistant Secretary
to the Governor General.
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate.

Hon. Clement A. O'Leary: Honourable
senators, naturally it is with some trepidation and a sense of awe that I rise in my
place for the first time in this chamber. The
fact that I am junior in years-and perhaps
in many other respects as well-has nothing
whatsoever to do with my feelings. They are
simply an acknowledgment of great men, past
and present, who have graced and are
presently gracing this chamber. That I am
honoured and happy goes without saying,
honoured that I should so suddenly find myself in the midst and part of such distinguished company, and happy that I should
have been the one chosen to represent that
part of Nova Scotia extending from Colchester
County to the Strait of Canso.
May I say that it is many, many years
since that particular area of the country was
so recognized and, consequently, I would be
less than grateful were I not to express my
thanks and appreciation to the Right Honourable the Prime Minister for his obvious
awareness of this fact and the rectifying of
a situation about which we were not entirely
happy over the intervening years. I know
that no honourable senator present will accuse
me of partisanship, at least so soon, were
I to state that on the last occasion we shared
a similar happy experience it happened that
a Conservative Government was in power in
Ottawa. I am sure that this must be pure
coincidence.
Personally, I very humbly accept the great
honour conferred upon me and I must at
the same time accept the burden of the depth
of responsibility attached. My role is by no
means an easy one in that I follow in the
footsteps of a venerable and respected friend
of yours and mine, an exemplary Canadian
whose long life was one of deep devotion to
church and state, whose ideals must have had
their motivation from concepts we recognize
as the ultimate in human character. I am, of
course, referring to the late Senator Felix
Patrick Quinn of Halifax-Bedford. Honourable senators, I simply ask at this time that
you accord me the privilege of accepting me
as one sincerely attempting to be his worthy
successor, hoping in due time to acquire just
a few of those attributes which made him

NOVEMBER 1, 1962

so loved by all who knew him. I am sure
that you will all agree that my aspiration is
both noble and worthy.
Honourable senators, although my acquaintance with His Honour the Speaker has been
relatively brief, it did not take me long to
appreciate why he should have been so
selected to grace the Chair. May I offer him
my sincere congratulations.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), is not unknown to me, although I realize I am a
comparative stranger to him. One with such
a record of service in public life could
scarcely escape the attention of an aspiring
politician of many years or, for that matter,
of anyone in this nation who is interested in
public affairs. I wish him continued good
health, and many more fruitful years of such
service. I join with those who have preceded
me in this debate in tendering him my deepest
and most sincere sympathy in the recent irreparable loss of his beloved wife.
When I refer to the honourable the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks), who
is, I regret, unavoidably absent today, I know
that honourable senators opposite, and all
honourable senators not from the maritime
or Atlantic provinces will forgive my lighting
up with pride when I recall our associations
in days past. During the honourable senator's
sojourn as a more active politician, during
his memorable reign as Minister of Veterans'
Affairs, I came to know, love and respect
him. My ardour is presently undiminished;
as a matter of fact, nothing could make me
happier than continuing to serve under his
wise guidance.
The mover of the motion for an address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne (Hon.
Mr. Haig) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Fournier, Madawaska-Restigouche), truly distinguished themselves and thereby brought
great distinction to themselves, this chamber
and their respective provinces.
The honourable senator from MadawaskaRestigouche (Hon. Mr. Fournier), being a
colleague from the other place, is perhaps the
first of the new senators to whom I should
express my delight on being his classmate
here. This same expression of comradeship
and pleasure is equally extended to the other
six new senators.
I regret that the honourable and gracious
senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) is unavoidably absent from the chamber
today. I find myself concurring at least in
part with some of her remarks made in this
chamber on October 25, more specifically
where she addressed herself to the cause of
some of our Maritime problems and the
various attempts made towards solutions.

Without seeking to labour regional thinking,
I feel inclined to repeat and, therefore, quote
the honourable senator when she said:
The people from the provinces of New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island remember that in the days
before Confederation we had a booming
economy based on our free trade with
our New England neighbours which we
lost when, as a member of the Canadian
Confederation, we had to submit to tariffs put on for the benefit of the industrial provinces of Central Canada.
I think that for my purpose here I need
not comment further; instead, I will move on
to the honourable senator's reference to her
attendance at the annual meeting of A.P.E.C.
held recently in her home town of Fredericton. After her explanation and detailed remarks, and also those made by the honourable senator from Murray Harbour (Hon. Mrs.
Inman) in 1959, to which the honourable senator referred, I am certain this house is pretty
well informed as to the aims and objectives
of this Atlantic Provinces Economic Council,
or A.P.E.C., as it is better known.
Relating her remarks to the Throne Speech
I was happy to note that she, as a member
of A.P.E.C. warmly endorses, as does the
executive of that body, the intention of the
Government to establish an Atlantic Development Board for the purpose of advising
"on measures and projects that will promote
the economic development of the Atlantic
region of Canada."
In a national sense, perhaps this Atlantic
Development Board might be considered secondary to, but certainly complementary with,
the National Economic Development Board
outlined in the Throne Speech. I think it
obvious that there is a distinct relation between the two, with a special recognition of
the several handicaps of the Atlantic provinces, and I believe we can all assume that
the Atlantic provinces and the country as
a whole, will benefit when both have been
set up. I have no doubt but that the creation
of the Atlantic Development Board will come
about soon and that the personnel will be
the best that can be found, namely, "individuals with wisdom, foresight and experience," a hope expressed by the honourable
senator from Fredericton.
In addition to these important announcements contained in the Throne Speech, I note
from the October A.P.E.C. Newsletter, volume
6, number 8, that this organization bas considered noteworthy and of significant interest
to the Atlantic provinces, and to the country
generally, quite a lengthy list of items. Therefore, I shall start at the beginning and state
that both the honourable senator from

SENATE
Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) and I
have covered the National Economic Development Board; we have both covered the
Atlantic Development Board.
To these I will add, from my perusal of
this recent A.P.E.C. Newsletter, first, the
quotation from the Throne Speech, reading
as follows:
New opportunities are opening up for
fruitful negotiations to reduce the barriers to trade on a general, non-discriminatory basis.
Reference was then made to the intended
expansion of the export trade promotion campaign of the Department of Trade and Commerce. And under the same heading was
quoted the statement from the Speech, reading:
Its (the government's) commercial policy negotiations have the objective of
opening additional markets to Canadian
producers in fair exchange for opportunities for others to sell in Canada.
The Newsletter then commented as follows:
In the long run, a policy of freer trade
is apt to benefit the Atlantic provinces
because of the relative importance of
export-oriented resource industries in the
regional economy.
A.P.E.C.'s Newsletter quoted further proposed legislation as follows:
Far-reaching changes are taking place
in manpower requirements in Canadian
industries as a result of automation,
other technological developments and
world competitive pressures. A measure
will be placed before you designed to
assist employers, workers and their organizations in meeting the impact of industrial change.
The comment made here was that this might
be intended to assist Canadian industry to
adjust to current changes in world trade
and other fields.
This Newsletter, in commenting on the
establishment of a national power grid, suggested that this could mean "the earlier development of the hydro potential of such
projects as Hamilton Falls in Labrador".
It was pointed out that the announced
intention of the Government to implement
some recommendations of the Royal Commission on Transportation is of more than
passing interest to shippers in the Atlantic
provinces. Favourable acceptance of this was
quite definite and specific. It was related
here, as all Maritimers are aware, that the
Maritimes Transport Commission in its submission to the royal commission, in association with A.P.E.C., stressed the fact that

over the years the horizontal freight rates
policy has not been in accord with the Maritime Freight Rates Act, thereby reducing
the assistance that might otherwise be received by regional shippers. Consequently, I
am sure that all A.P.E.C. members were happy
to read in the Throne Speech that the application of certain recommendations in this
field are intended, "to remove the need for
general horizontal freight rate increases which
have borne so heavily in the past upon certain
areas and groups of producers."
The Throne Speech proposals with respect
to agriculture were quoted in part, having
to do with ensuring the availability of storage
facilities for feed grain in eastern Canada and
British Columbia.
No mention was made in the Newsletter
of the announced intention to increase funds
under the Farm Credit Act and to permit
"greater flexibility in their use." I was rather
surprised at this omission, in view of the
large segment of our population that may be
favourably affected. However, I realize that
it is quite possible that the details since
publicized were not available when this issue
of the Newsletter was being drafted. Keeping
within the rules, I hope, I shall not at this
time go into details, other than to state
briefly what is common knowledge and is
pertinent to agriculture in the Atlantic provinces.
The increasing of available funds under
the act comes as a matter of necessity in the
light of past experience, and perhaps more
notably because of the "flexibility" referred
to in the use of these funds in the future.
In addition to off-farm earnings to be recognized as income for purposes of borrowing
under the act, the amendments will, to take
one example, permit the farmer to develop
non-agricultural enterprises on his farm-almost any type of enterprise that will make
for more profitable use of his land resources.
I believe we can all see that such a broadening of the act will do much to assist the
low income farmer-and, unfortunately, we
have a large number of these in the Atlantic
provinces-by bringing him into that area
encompassed by the ARDA legislation. And
may I say that to my mind the success of
the ARDA program is a "must" if we are
to retain our rural population with such
diversified occupations as farming, fishing,
lumbering, construction work, and so on. In
many instances all four mentioned are pursued by one and the same person in an effort
to secure a modest standard of living.
Under the heading "Industrial Development" the A.P.E.C. organ quoted that part
of the Throne Speech dealing with the
proposed intention of the Government to
expand further the role of the Industrial

NOVEMBER 1, 1962

Development Bank for national development
purposes. Here funds for both the ARDA
and the shipbuilding subsidies programs
were mentioned-programs of intense interest
to the Atlantic provinces. Under the same
heading-and I do not know just whywere listed the intention to re-introduce, for
example, the $50 increase in the personal
income tax exemptions allowed for dependent
children, other new tax exemptions, and
so on.

I regret having used so many quotations
from both the Throne Speech and the A.P.E.C.
Newsletter. I did so only to stress the importance placed on the Throne Speech by
this voluntary, nonpolitical and nonprofit
organization which bas as its basic objective
Atlantic economic progress.
Here and now I would very much enjoy
becoming a member of that "special task
force," so-called by the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) yesterday.
I regret that he, too, is not in his seat today.
Due to a commitment made with respect to
the time of the house I would take today, I
must of necessity forgo membership in that
delightful body, at this time.
Suffice it to say that just assuming this
"special task force" were not a fictional creation in the mind of the honourable senator
from Toronto, I cannot think of a more
pleasant role to assume than that of an educator attempting to teach those who so aptly
fit into the category of the "none so blind as
those that will not see," that the image of
the Prime Minister of this country rightly
deserves to be placed on "the highest pedestal
possible," and that, as the honourable senator
is very well aware, as are the majority of
financial institutions and businesses across
this country, this past year bas by no means
been unrewarding for them. It is not necessary for anyone to climb onto cloud nine, or
use any words of embellishment to point up
this fact.
Honourable senators, in conclusion I simply
say that I appreciated this opportunity to
make these few remarks. In the future, both
in the deliberations of this house and in the
committee work, I sincerely hope I may be
useful.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Davies, debate
adjourned.

He said: Honourable senators, I take pleasure in moving the second reading of this bill
which has now become a hardy perennial. On
three previous occasions I introduced a bill
similar in principle to the present one. On
the first occasion the bill received second
reading and was under consideration by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce when prorogation supervened. I first
spoke to the matter on May 11, 1960, as
reported in Senate Hansard, at page 559. On
that occasion I gave general examples of
interest charges, hidden charges, and second
mortgage manipulations. On the second occasion the motion for second reading was
defeated by a comparatively small margin. 1
spoke on February 2, 1961, as reported in
Hansard commencing at page 299. There I
repeated much of what I had already said,
and I added further examples as applied to
furniture, television, and radio financing.
On the third occasion, in the last session,
the bill received second reading without a
recorded vote, and had been referred to the
appropriate committee when Parliament was
dissolved. The report of my remarks on February 13, 1962 commence at page 141 of
Senate Hansard. At that time I spoke of the
changes which had been made in the bill and
limited its application to consumer credit.
On that occasion I again presented the available facts and gave the arguments to meet
the assertion charge that had been made,
and which I will discuss later, that there were
some mathematical difficulties in that we
Canadians could not add, subtract, or divide.
I hope that this bill will make further progress than its predecessors, although I observe
that the life of the Twenty-Fifth Parliament
hangs on a very slender and, indeed, fragile
thread. I hope it lives long enough to deal
appropriately with this bill.
I intend at this time, for the benefit of new
senators and for the refreshment of the memory of others, to traverse the ground once
again. I shall, however, be as brief as possible,
and shall present the case in capsule form;
even at that, it may not be short for I feel
it is necessary once again to bring the subject matter into proper focus.
The opposition raised four points.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Who are
the opposition?

Hon. Mr. Croll: Those persons who opposed
the bill or spoke in opposition to it, and
they were on both sides of the house. They

FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL

SENATE
Let me deal first with the question of
constitutionality. It seems to me that that
was amply answered by the opinion which
was given by our Parliamentary Counsel, Mr.
E. R. Hopkins, who is considered learned and
distinguished in these matters. He said that
in his view the bill was constitutional on two
grounds. I shall not discuss those at the
moment, but you will find his opinion as an
appendix to Senate Hansard of February 2,
1961. It would appear we are always involved
with the British North America Act in this
house, but whether one is a lawyer or a layman it is interesting to read it for its background and educational value. If after reading that opinion there is still some doubt in
your minds, you might look at the opinion
of Mr. F. P. Varcoe, Q.C., given in 1935, when
he was Deputy Minister of Justice, in connection with the Small Loans Act, which in
principle is the same as this bill except that
it relates to cash loans.
I think you will have no difficulty in
reaching the conclusion that this bill is constitutional but, if necessary, I shall once
more in the course of my discussion try
to clear that matter up. I feel that opposition
on the ground of constitutionality has been
or will be abandoned. In any event, it is
untenable, as I shall once again demonstrate.

will, perhaps, be in order. Let me read the
preamble and then explain why I put it in:
Whereas Canadian consumers generally
are not being fully or accurately informed, with reference to any recognizable common standard, of the cost of
the credit extended to them in respect
of retail purchases, and it is highly
desirable in the public interest to ensure
that in future they will be provided with
such essential information: Therefore
Her Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
There is a preamble to the Small Loans
Act, and on one occasion before the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce Mr.
Varcoe suggested that the preamble had an
important bearing on the constitutionality of
the measure. I did not subscribe to that
theory, and I do not now. I have not added
this preamble with any thought of strengthening the constitutionality of the present
bill. In this case it does not, in my opinion,
require strengthening, as I shall demonstrate.
It is my thought, rather, to focus attention
on the purpose of the bill; to focus attention
on-to use a lawyer's term-the mischief
which the bill seeks to remove.

2. That the "full disclosure" of finance
charges in terms of simple interest would
highlight the cost of consumer credit.
This, it is suggested, would encourage
consumers to buy within their means and
avoid excessive use of consumer credit.
3. By requiring merchants and financial institutions who extend consumer
credit to disclose the "true" rate of
"interest" it is felt that an unscrupulous
minority would not be able to take advantage of the uninformed by charging
excessively for consumer credit services.
What does this bill mean in language that
the layman can understand without difficulty?
If you buy an automobile for $2,500 by making
a down payment of $500 and spreading the
rest of the cost over a three-year period the
dealer will tell you that the charge will be
$65.56 a month. If this bill is passed he will
have to disclose that the finance charges on
the $2,000 you owe amount to $360, and that
the annual interest rate is 11.5 per cent. If
you acquire a refrigerator without any down
payment and make 18 monthly payments of
$26.18 to pay for it, the dealer must tell you
that the annual interest rate is actually 22
per cent.
The purpose of this bill is to arm consumers
with information which will enable them
to shop intelligently for the best credit deal.
Because consumers are the most vulnerable
and the most unorganized people in our
society, besieged by advertising, pressured by
salesmen, and victimized by monopoly prices,
they are almost defenceless against the onslaught on their pocketbooks by unscrupulous
vendors who overpersuade the unwary buyer
of modest means with the "no payment down
and take all the time you want" pitch. The
true interest charge on the deferred balance
is not revealed, and the seller makes his
money out of financing the debt rather than
from a legitimate profit on the merchandise.
Honourable senators, I said I would indicate to you the need for this bill. I am satistled that I do not need to waste time in this
chamber talking to you about the need for
it. It is well known to all of us. I have received a great number of unsolicited letters
from all parts of the country, and those which
I shall read are all signed.
I have a letter from a professional man in
London, Ontario, which reads:
Anodized aluminum siding was being
put on a house across the street and I
asked for an estimate to sheathe my
house. When I asked if this was the
price for cash down, he said he did not
accept full payment by the customer as
he has an agreement with the loan company only to do work paid for through

the loan company on their terms to the
customer. It made no difference to him as
the loan company paid him in full on
completion of the job. I refused to deal
with him.
I have a letter here from a lady in
Calgary in which she says this:
Some stores have a type of charge
account which permits the customer to
pay only part of the amount owing. At
the end of the month he receives a bill
and, unless he pays the full amount
owing, service charges are added to the
bill the following month. However, these
service charges are not based on the
amount actually owing, but on the
amount owed the previous month. Thus,
if the bill was $100 and on receiving
the bill he paid $50, the following month
service charges of approximately 1-1j
per cent on $100 would be added before
the $50 was deducted.
I complained about this some time ago
to the credit department of SimpsonsSears. The assistant credit manager assured me that they did not do this and
agreed that it would be dishonest. I explained that they did and was referred to
the credit manager. He said that it was
store policy across Canada and that he
could do nothing about it. I know personally of several people who closed their
charge accounts there when they realized
that they were being overcharged. Since
that time the Hudson's Bay Company has
instituted this policy also and just recently the T. Eaton Company has followed suit.
What the lady was talking about, of course,
was what we call revolving credit. That is
the poor man's charge account, which permits him to be permanently in debt to the
vendor, for a price. It reminds me very much
of the company town where the employees
had to buy everything from the company
stores and as a result they remained perpetually in debt. The only difference today
is that such people have a choice as to who
should be their creditor.
I have a letter here from the Better Business Bureau, Vancouver, as follows:
It is the common practice for firms,
which cannot do their own financing, to
make arrangements with finance companies to take care of their credit sales.
The finance companies supply the
forms used by the vendors.
The vendor writes, or types, the terms
of the contract, then presents them for
signature.

SENATE
What happens is the purchaser, if he
is careful, will read only what is written,
or typed, and when satisfied sign as instructed by the salesman. Purchasers
often are unaware of the fact that they
have entered into a contract with a
finance company-not the vendor.
Therefore, it appears to me, unless
other guarantees or contracts have been
made between vendors and purchasers,
the latter, if dissatisfaction should occur,
may have no right to go to the vendor
for satisfactory adjustment of a complaint.
One of our own staff stated she had no
idea the deal was being financed by a
finance company until she received notice
and payment arrangements from the
finance company.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask the
honourable senator a question. I have in mind
the case of a man who bought a frigidaire
for $450, and after some time he still owed
$400. He had not been told when he bought
the article that arrears of interest would be
added to the capital and that he would pay
interest on the whole amount. Would the
honourable senator's bill protect such a purchaser in that he would be told, when making
a purchase, just what he would be up
against?
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is precisely what I
have been talking about. The bill is designed
to require that the purchaser be given the
information, be given the truth in lending,
be given all the facts. I do not know the
facts of the case to which my honourable
friend refers, so I shall not prejudge it or
give an opinion on it, but I can say that my
friend is right as to the purpose of the bill.

Mark these words:
This man originally borrowed $1,500
and there were three rates of interest in
the calculation. On the first $300 he was
paying 2 per cent per month or 24 per
cent per year. He was paying on the loan
over $300 to $1,000 1 per cent per month
or 18 per cent per year and on the balance of $500 he was paying j per cent
per month, which is only 6 per cent per
year.
You can see from this simple illustration that if he paid the first $500 on the
loan that he was still saddled with a
$1,000 loan on which he was paying 18
per cent per year on $700 and 24 per cent
on $300. These finance companies and the
way they operate disturbs me greatly and
I certainly hope that this year you will
be successful with the bill you are introducing.
I have in front of me an item from the
Toronto Star of April 12, under the headline:
"By Pierre Berton". He made some study of
this subject, and I have quoted him on other
occasions. This is a typical account, but I
should like to get the message across. He says:
The cost of money in the automobile

was in 1958 before the banks got actively
into the business of car loans. However,
in a more recent case, last summer, a
Toronto man paid upwards of 32 per cent
in interest charges on a five-year-old
Mercury Sedan from Arby Motors Ltd.
financed through Danforth Discount.
Such charges are often made on the
basis of a man's credit rating; in the
latter case the purchaser had borrowed
the down payment from a finance company and so he had no real equity in
his automobile. In both instances, it's significant that the purchasers couldn't keep
up their payments and the cars were repossessed.
THE SALESMAN

GETS A CUT:

An even odder case, which I'd scarcely
believe if I hadn't seen the contracts
and payment books, involves a man who
bought a two-year-old station wagon
from Del Bodkin Motors in New Toronto.
He made a substantial down payment and
the contract shows his interest rate was
only 14.4 per cent per annum. However,
the Delta Acceptance payment book
showed that monthly payments were
four dollars a month higher than the
contract showed. This brought his true
rate of interest to 18.8 per cent per annum. He couldn't handle these payments
and so traded down to a cheaper car.
On this his rate of interest was 29.1 per
cent.
In the automobile field the scales seem
to be tipped against the man who wants
to pay cash, just as they are tipped against
the man who wants to pay off his loan
at an earlier date than set.
Recently a customer who had bought
a new car at a true interest rate of 16.8
per cent through General Motors Acceptance Corporation, decided to pay it
all in the fifth month. The extra finance
charges brought the cost of his loan to
25.3 per cent per annum. That's because
there are certain fixed charges on these
loans that can't be returned.
It's well known in the auto industry
that some of the profit of cars comes as
a result of cutbacks from acceptance
companies. Part of this cutback is passed
along to the car salesman on the floor
which means that every man has a vested
interest in talking his customers out of
paying cash.
I have a copy of standard salesman's
agreement put out by Hogan Pontiac,
which uses General Motors Acceptance
Corporation. This agreement shows that
every salesman gets a bonus for every

car he finances through GMAC. On new
cars this bonus starts at $10 per contract.
If he sells more than 15 contracts he gets
$15 for every car he finances-and that
payment is retroactive. No wonder salesmen find it attractive to boost the easy
payment plan. (Some used car dealers,
who charge about 30 per cent interest
make their profits almost entirely from
financing. They're really in the loan
business.)
QUOTING THE DISCOUNT RATE:

Here's a rundown of Operative 67's recent experience in trying to find out the
true interest rate on a loan of $1,500
from six auto firms selected at random.
Ensign Motors, Queensway: Salesman
said rate depended on customer's credit
rating and amount put down. If down
payment was 25 per cent, loan was at
six per cent; otherwise at nine per cent.
He insisted rate was only charged on a
reducing balance. An actuarial check on
actual payment showed the "six per cent"
loan ran at 13.4 per cent for 24 months
and 12.3 per cent for 12 months; the "nine
per cent" loan at 18.7 and 18.3 per cent
respectively.
Plaza Chev. Eglinton: "I wouldn't care
to work it out," said the salesman, "but
it comes to 8 or 9 per cent." We worked
it out: It came to 17.7 per cent over 30
months.
Renault, Canada Ltd., Golden Mile:
They claim the interest is 9 per cent. It
came to 18.8 for 30 months; 19.2 for 36.
Volkswagen, Canada Ltd., Golden Mile:
They claim the interest on a new car for
two years is 6 per cent. Payments worked
out to 13.3 for 2 years, 14.1 for 30 months
and 14.5 per cent on 36 months. They
claim the interest rate on a used car is
7 per cent. It worked out to 16.5 on two
years; 17.2 on 30 months. The interest
here rises depending on the length of a
loan, thus, from a sales point of view
the longer term loans are the most attractive.
York Mills Pontiac, Yonge St.: The
salesman said the interest would be exactly 11.14 per cent financed through
GMAC. Actuarially the real rate works
out to 22 per cent on 24 months and 22.8
per cent on 30 months.
Grant Brown Motors, Weston: Salesman
said the interest rate would be 6.8 per
cent (also financed through GMAC!) On
the payment schedule he gave it worked
out to 16.8 per cent over 30 months.

SENATE

What these salesmen are usually quoting is not a true interest rate, but an approximate discount rate, in which you
pay interest on money you've already
paid back. It is this mathematical trick<
that allows them to quote lower rates
without a twinge of conscience.
Now, I said I would deal with the question
of demand for the bill.
Hon. Mr. Emerson: May I ask the honourable senator if he has been reading from an
article written by Pierre Berton in the
Toronto Star?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes. You know him by
reputation. He is a very well-known columnist.
Hon. Mr. Emerson: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I now go to the question
of demiand. On another occasion I said, and
I repeat now, that the principle of this bill
has the support of the Consumers Association
of Canada, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the Canadian Congress of Labour,
the Canadian Welfare Council, the Canadian
Catholic Conference, the Anglican Church of
Canada, credit unions, co-operatives, and
numerous organizations. There have been
countless editorials in many papers, on the
principle involved in this bill, and I have
yet to see one in opposition. The support for
the bill is snowballing, and I believe it will
soon be overwhelming. It is interesting to
note that this is not a party bill or a partisan
bill. Last year a Conservative member introduced a similar bill in the House of Commons.
This year a Liberal member and an N.D.P.
member of the House of Commons introduced
bills similar to the one that is before us now.
I have before me a copy of a letter which
was sent to me, dated March 1, 1962 and
addressed to the Honourable Salter Hayden.
This letter was written by an investment
counsel of the city of Toronto, and reads as
follows:
The Globe and Mail today quotes you
as doubting that all the people who buy
on time have no knowledge of arithmetic
and have no native shrewdness. I respectfully suggest that your information
in this area may be inadequate, and that
careful interviews would show that many
of the people who buy on time have but
a vague understanding of the total cost,
and scarcely any understanding of what
it means as a rate of interest. It is true
that most people, if informed that the
financing of the merchandise will cost
$50 and that the interest will be 25 per
cent (your example), would proceed with
the transaction in any case, but at least

they would have the opportunity to
understand, and the opportunity to compare. Moreover, there are some people
who would not proceed with the transaction, because they would decide that
the cost was too high.
On purely economic grounds I believe
a strong case can be made for legislation
of this type. Disclosure would foster
comparisons and competition, and would
lower the cost of consumer financing.
Free economic forces would accomplish
what regulation never can. There would
be economic benefits of a broader nature
also, because a reduction in the profitability of consumer lending would tend
to channel funds into more productive
and constructive activities. (You will be
well aware that there are ample funds
in Canada for conservative loans at 5
per cent to 7 per cent, but an inadequate
flow of funds into more venturesome
and creative investments where the appropriate return is higher.)
He continues:
The foregoing sets forth rather inadequately why you have seen so much
support for the bill from what you
describe as "responsible public organizations and in newspaper editorials". I
think the closer one is to the man in
the street the more one sees the need
for this legislation. It seems to me morally
desirable, economically sound, easily
workable, and consistent with the spirit
of free enterprise.
I believe that passage of the bill will
reflect credit upon those who support it.
Now let me say something on the other
point raised: Can it be implemented? Is it
workable?
The suggestion was made that the bill could
not ba implemented because it could not be
made workable. I refer you to, and remind
you of, a letter which I read to this bouse
on April 3, 1962, written by a university professor. I had called him earlier and asked him
if I could use the letter, and he said, "By all
means." The letter was written by Professor
Stanton of the University of Waterloo, head
of the Department of Mathematics since the
day the department opened.
The letter was addressed to the Financial
Editor of the Toronto Daily Star, and dated
March 30, 1962. This letter can be found on
page 437 of the Senate Hansard of April 3,
1962 but, as I want the record to be a continuous one, I shall again read it.
Dear Sir,
It is perhaps unnecessary to write you,
since others have probably already

NOVEMBER 1, 1962
pointed out to you the incorrect picture
given on page 14 of the Toronto Star for
March 28. The article on simple interest,
far from being an impartial survey,
merely publicizes incorrect or misleading
statements made by the finance companies. In particular, the impression that
the mathematical equation given cannot
be solved, is absolutely incorrect; it is a
matter of the most extreme simplicity to
make a table giving the solution for
various values of the symbols involved.
Any car dealer who is capable of reading
a table (such as the present tables giving sales tax) would likewise be capable
of reading off the effective interest rate
from a table giving effective interest
rates.
Whatever may be the merits or demerits of Senator Croll's bill requiring
disclosure of effective interest rates, inability to compute these effective interest
rates is not a failing of the bill, and any
pretense that there is a mathematical
difficulty involved bas no basis in fact.
The opponents of the bill argue that computation of annual interest rates would be a
burden on the small retailer. Financial tables
are available now for the computation of
interest on bank loans made to businessmen
who, for themselves, insist on knowing the
true annual interest rate on the money they
borrow. Surely our computers are capable of
solving this minor mathematical problem for
small retailers.
I referred a few minutes ago to an investment counsel from the city of Toronto
who wrote to the Honourable Senator Hayden. Let me quote what he had to say on
this point, under the heading "Workability".
There are really no practical obstacles
to the calculation of rates of interest.
The truth is that, in attempting to defeat
this legislation, lenders have posed examples which are far more complex than
those which are used in real life. Thus,
they produce a variety of different answers from different experts. However,
in practice, loans usually call for orderly
and uniform repayments, and the true
rate of interest can be determined within
a fraction of a per cent. The workability
can, therefore, be ensured by requiring
disclosure to the nearest one-half per
cent, or even to the nearest per cent.

The FinancialPost, which is a leader in its
field, deals with the subject of mortgages-I
quote from the Toronto Daily Star of March
23, 1962-and endorses the bill in these words:
But it would be very much to the benefit of all Canadians if the Government
were to take up the Croll idea, expand

it to include regulation of mortgage lending, and rap the knuckles of a business
which, on the fringes at least, thrives on
widespread public ignorance and its own
greed.
Moreover, I point out that there is no
criminal liability which would flow from nondisclosure but, in the event of non-disclosure,
a credit financier would be unable to retain
or recover any part of the finance charges.
This bill constitutes an important first step
in the protection of consumers of retail credit.
It is based on the premise that if people knew
what they were being charged they would be
less likely to make instalment purchases which
would leave them hard up or destitute, and
at the very least, would enable them to shop
intelligently for credit.
Why do people enter into these instalment
arrangements often at grave risk to the financial security of themselves and their families?
It is easy to say, "Charge it", sign a piece of
paper, and walk away with the merchandise.
It is easy to avoid finding out what the finance
charges are, not having to face up to them
immediately. The sole purpose of this bill is
to require credit financiers to tell the truth
about these charges. In too many cases the
consumer is misled into paying a higher price
for credit than he bas been led to expect, and
indeed a higher price than be can afford.
Honourable senators, this bill does not attempt to set a ceiling on finance charges. Perhaps it should, as does the Small Loans Act in
respect of cash loans. What it does do is protect the innocent, the unwary, the ignorant
and the unsuspecting by requiring that they
be fully and accurately informed of the costs
they are incurring. As I remarked on an
earlier occasion:
In this age of credit card mentality, the
consumer is being sliced up like a piece
of cheese and he hardly realizes it.
The letter I read to you from a life insurance
executive in Kirkland Lake should make honourable senators think, as I am sure it will,
when they realize that the interest rate to a
borrower of $1,500 was sliced up between 24,
18 and 6 per cent.
While some might think the principle of
the bill might go further, it is in fact restricted it Iismust emphasize that this problem is big,
national, and it is a growing one, alin its application. It applies only to the sale though in the beginning it may have

SENATE
On April 3 last I placed on Senate Hansard
a table showing the extent of the retail credit
extended to consumers in each year from
1952 to 1961. There was a substantial increase
each year from 1952, when the amount was
$1,073 million, until December 31, 1961 when
it was $2,349 million. These statistics come
from the Bank of Canada. The latest figure,
as of the end of June, 1962 is $3,417 million.
I have an article taken from the Ottawa
Journal of July 13 last, headed "Canada's
Credit Spree". In part, it reads:
Thrift, to some economists, is an oldfashioned and not an entirely respectable
virtue. Too much saving stagnates the
economy, goes the theory. Business booms
and everyone prospers when the consumer, with credit or with cash, buys,
buys, buys.
There is enough truth in the theory to
make it attractive. Certainly it has become part of the way of our times to
go into debt in buying a house, a car or
major appliances. Borrowing even for
luxuries carries no stigma. The man who
saves until he can pay cash for his home
or his car is a rare bird.

with the rate charged at others. If the
suppliers of the funds themselves continue
to display an unwillingness to advertise
their charges clearly and effectively, it
may be necessary to exercise Parliament's jurisdiction over matters pertaining to rates of interest and pass
legislation requiring uniform, clear announcement of the rates of interest
charged on loans to consumers, in terms
of some common formula.

There could hardly be a more precise endorsement of the principle of the present
bill than what I have just quoted from the
Gordon report, and I could not put it better.
May I add that President Kennedy is also
in my corner-and, I hope, in the corner of
the Senate. I have a press clipping from the
"Washington,
Citizen datelined,
Ottawa
March 16, 1962," which says:
President Kennedy has sent Congress
a large package of proposals to protect
the consumer, including instalment contracts that reveal the true rate of interest.

contrary, both the act and the precedents
point unmistakably to the conclusion that any
legislation which in pith and substance deals
with interest-and this would clearly include
the disclosure contemplated by this bill-is
valid federal legislation.
Honourable senators, I will not develop
this further at this time, since I dealt with
the matter at great length in closing the
debate last session, and a further opportunity
will be afforded me, should it be necessary to
take advantage of it, later this session.
Honourable senators, may I also observe
that this bill incorporates the "all-inclusive"
principle, which is to the effect that such
legislation would be abortive unless all
charges were included. Not only has this principle been embodied in all the small loans
acts of the various States of the Union, but
it has been embodied in our own Small
Loans Act, which deals with cash loans and
has been on our statute books for many
years. The definition of "finance charges" in
this bill is practically identical with the
definition of "cost of a loan" in our Small
Loans Act.
I merely add two comments at this stage.
The constitutional validity of the Small Loans
Act has never been questioned or challenged.
Moreover, it has been amply demonstrated
that it works; it is in operation daily and
no difficulty has been encountered either with
the application of the "all-inclusive" principle, or with the requirement that charges for
cash loans up to a specified amount are limited percentagewise.
I invite honourable members to dwell upon
what I have just said.
It has also been said that the enactment
of this bill would dry up the well-springs of
credit. To this I simply say that the passage of
the Small Loans Act did not stop the making
of cash loans. It simply brought the companies under reasonable control and, as has
been indicated, they are growing by leaps
and bounds.
Honourable senators, there are some ailments of the body politic which it may not
be possible to cure, but which may be ameliorated or controlled. The present bill is of
an ameliorating character, and I feel sure
that it will have the desired effect upon both
the purveyors and the consumers of credit.
What is obviously needed is a consumers'
bill of rights on a national scale which is as
comprehensive as possible within the limits of
federal jurisdiction and, as we have seen,
27511-5-13

federal jurisdiction with regard to interest
alone would go far to provide a constitutional
basis for such a consumers' bill of rights.
The consumer has the right to be informed,
and this bill will result in his being informed.
Honourable senators, I hope that this bill
may shortly be referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee. The life of this Parliament, as I have indicated, may be short,
if not sweet, and we ought to try to make
as much progress as we possibly can before
dissolution is once more upon us. I hope that
we shall conclude the debate on second reading as soon as possible and allow this measure
to go before the committee where interested
persons can be heard. Then in the light of
all the facts the decision will be that this
is a good bill.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I shall not detain the house for more than a
minute. I voted against the predecessors of
this bill in other sessions, but I have told
the sponsor, the Honourable Senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll), that I
would vote for his present bill because of
certain changes he has made in it. At this
time I merely wish to inform the Senate
that I intend voting for the bill, despite the
fact I voted against the previous bills.
Hon. Malcolm Holleft: Honourable senators, the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) has left me convinced that if I did not vote for this bill
I would have no regard for the people who
sent me here. I have seen a lot of cases, too,
whereby people who bought consumer goods
on credit have finished up broke, to use the
common phrase, in trying to pay off the
amount which they borrowed, not knowing
at the time of borrowing that they would
have to pay so much by way of interest.
The only thing I regret is that the honourable senator has taken too many teeth out
of his bill. It now applies only to consumer
credit and does not cover other types of
loans. I am sorry that this is the situation,
but I intend to support it anyway.
In my own province I know much use has
been made of credit buying, and the credit
financiers seem to be thriving wonderfully
well. They are prospering in every sense of
the word.
I do not wish to delay the house, but I
want to express my opinion that this legislation will not harm anyone; on the contrary,
it will do a lot of good for our friends and
neighbours, and I certainly will support it.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 1, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon.
Mr. Haig, seconded by Hon. Mr. Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, before discussing briefly two or three
items contained in the Speech from the
Throne, I should like to congratulate His
Honour the Speaker, and also the new Leader
of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) on their respective appointments.
I also wish to say how much we all appreciated the friendly and fair way in which
the former Leader of the Government, the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), led the Government side of the
house and presented Government business.
May I also add my word of welcome to
all the new senators. I hope they enjoy the
work of the Senate. I feel I must say a
special word of welcome to my old friend
and newspaper colleague from Carleton (Hon.
Mr. O'Leary). I am sorry he is not here this
evening. His brilliant maiden speech, delivered three weeks ago, thrilled us all. Indeed, he has already indicated that he is
going to be a most valuable addition to the
debating strength of the Government side of
this chamber.
The mover (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier, Madawaska-Restigouche), and the new senator from Gormley
(Hon. Mr. McCutcheon), have likewise given
us a most favourable glimpse of their talents.
They, too, are all excellent appointments,
reinforcing those of whose good qualities we
have already been made aware.
I congratulate the new members on their
maiden speeches and I hope we shall hear
from them often in days to come.
Although I was unable to be present in the
Senate at the opening of the session when
tributes were paid to senators who had
passed away since we last met, I should like

NOVEMBER S. 1962
to express my regret at their untimely deaths.
We shall miss them. Senator Brunt from
Hanover, who was Deputy Leader of the
Government, and whose cheerful and friendly
ways endeared him to us all will, I feel, be
particularly missed. As I was in Britain when
I read of his death, I wrote a tribute to him
and sent it to Sir William Haley, editor of
the London Times, who very kindly published it.
Honourable senators, I shall be as brief as
I can in discussing the Speech from the
Throne. I did not hear it delivered, but I
have read it through carefully a couple of
times, and would like to say a few words
about several matters referred to in it. I shall
not deal with the main parts of the speech;
they have been analysed by abler speakers
than I.
We have been told the Throne Speech indicates that the country is in very good shape
financially and is improving. We have also
been told that there is something seriously
wrong with the country. All I want to say
is that I do hope all the plans that have been
laid for developing the country will not lead
to an increase in taxes. As the senator from
Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron) stated, we are a
country of only 18 million people and there
is a limit to what money we can raise and
spend.
We have become a welfare state and we
are now beginning to realize how costly it is to
make all these worthwhile contributions to
comfortable living. This year we shall probably spend a total of about $7 billion. We
find it hard to believe that before the war
of 1939-45 we were budgeting each year for
something less than half a billion dollars.
I am glad to see that the Government expects the committee which is looking into the
matter of unemployment insurance to report
this autumn. I hope the report will recommend making this insurance scheme less of
a burden on the taxpayer than it is today.
I have previously expressed myself, when
a Liberal Government was in power, on the
matter of old age pensions and I do not want
to labour that question now. I do feel, however, that until the old age pension is entirely
contributory and not dependent on a tax on
corporate and private incomes, there should
be some means test for such pensions and
persons with incomes over a stated amount
should not be entitled to them.
I see by the Speech from the Throne that
the Government intends to invite the provinces to a conference with a view to looking
into the matter of changing our national
flag. Many of you will remember that some
years ago the late Right Honourable Mackenzie King set up a joint committee of the

Senate and the House of Commons with the
same obj ect in view. I was a member of that
committee, and I recall that the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) was
the joint chairman for the Senate. I have
very vivid recollections of our hearings. One
group led by the late J. R. MacNicol of
Toronto would not agree to a flag which did
not have the Union Jack on it; another group
would not have the Union Jack on Canada's
national flag at any price. There was no compromise and eventually the committee was
disbanded without reaching any useful conclusion.
During the sittings members of the committee were flooded with hundreds of designs.
School children, whose teachers evidently had
some views on the matter, sent us letters by
the dozens submitting designs which in many
cases were quite ridiculous.
Personally, I do not see anything wrong
with the Canadian Red Ensign, and I am sure
there are several million Canadians who are
equally content with it. But the Red Ensign
does not please everyone. Every so often one
reads a letter in the press condemning the
Red Ensign as a national flag.
My own opinion is that we should have a
national flag representative of the two great
races of this country, the English and the
French. I should like to see a flag which embraces both the Union Jack and the Fleur-delis. Those of British and French descent make
up about two-thirds of the population of
Canada, and they have contributed the major
share to our development. Therefore, I feel
that it is quite right that both should be
represented in our national flag. But I see no
object in adopting a flag which recognizes
neither. At the same time, when we are dealing with this matter of a flag I wonder why
we cannot make it possible for Canada to
have a national flag representing the English
and French domination of the country, and
also let each province have its own flag for
use within Canada. I understand that Nova
Scotia has a flag of its own. Why then should
not each province have its own flag? It seems
to me that would please a great many people
and would give each province a new distinction.
There is nothing new in this idea. The
Union Jack is the flag of Britain, but the
Welsh, as you know, are strange people and
as a part of Britain's population have their
own flag and national anthem. At my summer
place in Wales I have two flag poles. While
we are in residence we fly two flags: the
longer pole, the Canadian Red Ensign, and on
the shorter one, the Red Dragon of Wales. As
the main feature of its design, the Welsh flag

SENATE

has the Red Dragon that we see on the ceiling of this chamber. Then, too, the Welsh have
their own national anthem. "God Save the
Queen" is the British national anthem, but
"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" is that of the Welsh.
For the benefit of those who do not understand Welsh, that means "Land of My
Fathers."
Why, then, cannot the Canadian provinces
have their own national anthem if they wish?
I hope the meeting of the provinces will arrive at a decision which will please all the
people of Canada.
Honourable senators, I want to say a word
about Canada Council grants. I was very much
interested in some of the matters touched on
by the honourable senator from Banff (Hon.
Mr. Cameron). In connection with the Canada
Council grants he told us that some 500
Canadian students are entitled to grants each
year. I am wondering whether there are any
restrictions connected with them. I think they
make a valuable contribution to the education
of our university students. However, I am
wondering, whether, when a student finishes
a course which a grant has made possible,
he has to stay in Canada for a certain
length of time or, if he so desires, can he go
immediately to the United States and take a
position in that country. As far as I know
he is quite free to do so. I do feel, however,
that when a student benefits from a Canada
Council grant, he or she should give some
of his time and ability to this country before
leaving us. It seems only reasonable to me
that these grants which are put up by the
Canadian taxpayers should result in some
benefit to Canada.
Honourable senators, I was glad to see in
the Speech from the Throne that a royal
commission bas been established to review
the whole field of federal taxation and its
impact on the Canadian economy, and to
recommend reforms and improvements. As
I said a few minutes ago, we have gone heavily
into what is called social security. Social security costs money, and I hope the royal commission referred to will study the situation
carefully and decide how far we can safely
go. Today in Ontario the tax rate applied to
companies is 52 per cent. The federal tax
is 47 per cent of profits after the first
$35,000 and up to that amount it is 18 per
cent. Added to that is a 3 per cent contribution
towards the old age pension fund. The provincial profits tax is 11 per cent, but of that
9 per cent is rebated, leaving 2 per cent.
However, when you add the three taxes together it means that of the profits an Ontario
company makes the federal and the provincial
governments take away 52 per cent.

Frankly it is too high. I do not know much
about big companies, but I do know that
when the Government takes 52 per cent of
the profits of a small company, it is very
hard for that company to set aside much in
a reserve fund for contingencies after a
dividend, even a small one, has been paid to
shareholders.
We are advised in the Throne Speech that
restraint is necessary with regard to controllable spending. But a few lines further on
there is the reference to the ensuring of the
expansion of Canada's economy. Well, I can
assure honourable senators that I am speaking from experience when I say that after
meeting the heavy taxation in force today it
is not easy to find money for expansion.
Now a word about newspapers. I listened
with attentive interest to the eloquent speech
made a few weeks ago by the new senator
for Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary). It was full
of strong points and delivered with the
senator's usual force and persuasiveness. I
do not fully concur with his views about
partisanship. The senator regretted that today
we do not have the strong partisan editorials
in our newspapers that we had in days gone
by. He says that about 90 of the 100 or so
daily newspapers in Canada today "have no
opinions at all, and are afraid to stand up
and be counted." I do not agree with this
view. Many of our papers deal strongly with
many subjects, local and otherwise, but,
admittedly, they are not strongly partisan
politically day by day. There are reasons for
this attitude. Is it not to some extent due to
the fact that newspaper publishing bas
changed over the years and today is very
costly?
The senator from Carleton has spent most
of his life with a powerful partisan paper in
the capital of Canada. In this city there are
two strong, influential and, I assume, prosperous papers. There are not many cities in
Canada today which support two daily papers.
Time was when Ottawa had three dailiestwo of them, if not the third, putting out both
morning and evening editions. Time was, also,
when Toronto had three morning papers and
five evening papers. Hamilton had three;
London, three; St. Catharines, three; Brantford, three, later two and now one. Woodstock, a city of 22,000 today, has one paper;
when it had a population of 10,000 it had two
papers, and for a time three. The small town
of Ingersoll with its 5,000 people had a daily
paper. Those days are gone forever. Only
large cities today can support two daily
papers.
The whole newspaper publishing field has
changed. Everything today is very expensive.
When the Government took the control off

NOVEMBER 6, 1962
newsprint at the end of the war it was $55 a
ton; today it is $130 a ton in Kingston, and I
expeet it is as high, if flot higher, in most
cities. Fifty and even forty years ago wages
were 10w; today they are very high. No one
wants to return to those earlier conditions.
But it is the high cost of publishing that has
made s0 many cities in Canada today onepaper communities.
To corne back to the regret about partisan
editorials which was voiced by the honourable senator from Carleton: it is not easy,
nor is it fair, when one is publishing the only
paper in a city, to be strongly partisan. On
a rough average, one-half of the readers are
Tory and one-haif Liberal. One has to remember this when writing political editonials
unless one wants to be constantly offending
about 50 per cent of the subscribers. However, I too have something of a nostalgia
occasionafly for what we might cail "the good
old partisan days". I could tell many stories
about some of the caustic comments, and
witty ones, in partisan papers in the old days.
I remember, many years ago, the lawyer
who was then occupying a law office next
door to that which is occupied today by the
Leader of the Opposition in this chamber
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), being neferred to in one paper as a political. "vulture".
That was strong language even for those days,
and it naturally resulted in a libel suit. Then
there was the time when a printer in Toronto,
who worked in the samne job-printing office
that I worked in at that time, decided to run
for mayon on the socialist ticket. He received
just unden 200 votes. The man who was
elected and his chief competitor both received
many thousands of votes. The Toronto Globe
came out with an editonial note the next
morning to this effect: The defeat of Mr. Soand-So, the Socialist candidate, is said to be
due to the over-confidence of hîs supporters.
The Toronto Globe was not always witty,
however. Sometimes it was highly cnitical.
As honourable senators will remember, in
the old days the Globe was the Bible of the
Liberal party in Ontario. Therefore, there
was naturally great consternation when in the
days of the Ross Government the Globe came
out one morning and declared in a strong
editonial that there were "barnacles on the
ship of state"l.
One of the brightest editorial cross-fires
that I remember took place one day when
the Liberal paper in an Ontario city requested
"our esteemed Conservative contemporary"l
to stop writing "idiot-Tory-ais". The next
day the Conservative paper came back with
a bright retort. The edlitor pointed out to <'our
esteerned Liberal contemporary" that what it
had refenred to as "idiot-Tory-ais" could not

possibly be anything of the kind, because the
minute you put the "Tory" in you knocked the
"idiocy" out.
True, the editorial columns of the days gone
by were often bright and witty, but it took
more than bright and witty editorial notes to
meet the rising costs of publishing. Eventually, two-paper cities were forced to become
one-paper cîties and, in the case I have just
been referring to, the very witty Tory editor
becarne the editor of an independent Liberal
newspaper.
Now, a word about publicity in Britain. I
should like to touch for a f ew minutes on a
subject which has been on my mind for
several months. I refen to the lack of proper
publicity about the Dominion of Canada in
Great Britain. We seem to get a good deal of
adverse publicity, but not enough of the
favourable kind. I arn referring particularly
to interviews given to the press by Britishers
who have corne to Canada and if, witbin a
few weeks or perhaps months, they have
not got their feet on some ladder which iE
going to lead to success and wealth, they return to their native land dissatisfied ané
broadcast unfavourable publicity about Canada.
We had a case of this in the month of
August last year which annoyed me verý
much. A mnan returned to Britain after a short
stay in this country and immediately gave
to the press his unfavourable views about
Canada. Haif a dozen papers which I happened
to see had such beadings as this, "Completely
Disillusioned About Canada". That man had
left Britain and gone to Fort Macleod, Aiberta. He did not immediately get the sort
of good-paying job which hie expected to find,
s0 hie packed up and ieft, and hie tried to give
Canada a bad name. He said hie was neduced to
cleaning windows in order to make a living.
There were two or three things which
struck me about this case. In the first place
Fort Macleod is a small place of about 2,000
people. It is possibiy quite a nice iittle community, but one does not expect to find many
vacant jobs in a town that size. The fact that
this man did not find a job to suit him
in a smali Alberta town is no reason for a
whoiesale depreciation of Canada. Perhaps
if hie had tnied a larger place he would have
done better.
The point I wish to emphasize is that we
should have a proper publicity department
attached to Canada House in London, which
would imrnediately pubiish a reply to sucb
stories. A smart young Canadian reporter,
properly acquainted with Canada couid, I
arn sure, deai with these misleading stories

SENATE
and minimize the damage they do to Canada.
I throw out this suggestion to the Government.
I am worried about the large amount of
bad publicity this country gets in Britain, and
about the small amount of good publicity. I
am asked occasionally to address a service
club, a women's business or professional
club, or some like organization, and I always
say that I will address them if I am allowed
to speak on Canada. If I am not allowed to
do so then I do not address them. When I do
speak I try to tell them something about
Canada. I tell them frankly that they do not
know anything about Canada. The reason
I want to speak about Canada is that I was
educated in the old country and I never heard
the word "Canada" mentioned at school. The
only way I had of knowing about Canada was
through letters from relatives who were out
here.
Honourable senators, I know I have spoken
for too long already, but before I sit down
I want to say a word or two about Britain's
entering the Common Market. It is a most
controversial question.
I was a delegate this past summer to a
Commonwealth Press Union Conference in
London, at which there were about 100 delegates, half of them from Britain and the
remainder from various countries of the Commonwealth. One afternoon was given up to
a discussion of the Common Market.
I must say that when I went over to Britain
I was not too keen on Britain's entering the
Common Market. I wondered if such a step
was necessary and how it would affect Canada.
The chief speaker at the Press Union discussion was Mr. Edward Heath, the Lord Privy
Seal. As honourable senators know, Mr.
Heath is the British minister in charge of the
negotiations with the Common Market countries. We were told that the economic side
of the matter was important for Britain,
but that it was not by any means the most
important. What was important to the British
Government was that it should be able to sit
down in the councils of the governments of
the other western European countries, and be
able to present its position politically and
diplomatically instead of having to go more
or less hat in hand at the door asking to
be heard.
As I listened to this discussion I was
reminded of a phrase once used by a late
senator in this chamber. When speaking during the debate on a certain bill, the nature of
which I have now forgotten, he said:
It's better to be inside breaking up
the furniture than outside kicking down
the door.

That seemed to me to be the attitude Britain
is taking in connection with the Common
Market.
The senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary) was surprised at the change of front
displayed by some of the British ministers at
the Conservative Convention at Llandudno
a few weeks ago. It did not surprise me. It
is the Welsh air. There is no telling what it
will do to a fellow. If I let my imagination
run riot I can imagine what could have happened to the British Prime Minister when
he went down to Llandudno. I can see him,
on the morning of the big discussion on the
Common Market, walking along the esplanade
of this beautiful Welsh seaside resort. He
breathes the invigorating air blowing off the
bay, he sees ahead of him the Great Orme
and away to his right the Snowdonian mountains, and he is very thrilled. As he strolls
along he is recognized by some of the Welsh
people who are also out taking the air, and
they give him the Welsh greeting: 'Sut
ydachchi heddiw; sut ydachchi heddiw". This
makes him feel very cheery, and he smiles.
Possibly he meets one of his pals, like
Rab Butler or Mr. Maudling, or possibly Mr.
Joseph, the Minister for Welsh Affairs-I do
not know, of course, I am visualizing all this
-and they go into a pub and have a drop
of Welsh home-brewed ale. There he is greeted
with a hearty "Iechyd da bob bun", which
pleases him.
When Mr. Macmillan left London, he was
feeling depressed and downhearted because he had been living in that depressed
atmosphere of London; he had been hearing
doubts and fears about Britain's entering
the Common Market and was upset about
the whole matter. However, after ho had
walked along the esplanade at Llandudno
and had a drop of Welsh home-brewed ale,
he came out of the pub full of bounce. I
can see him throwing out his chest and saying to himself: "This is the old stamping
ground of Lloyd George. This is where he
used to roll them in the aisles. This is also
the place where Jo Grimond a couple of
weeks ago delivered the greatest speech of
his career at the Liberal convention. Well,
anything Lloyd George could do, and anything that Jo Grimond can do, I can do
better". With that he went back to his hotel,
and eventually to the Conservative convention where he made his thrilling speech on
the Common Market which swung all but
47 to his way of thinking. I think that is
probably what happened.
Leaving Mr. Macmillan for a moment, and
speaking seriously, after listening to the discussion at the Press Union Conference I felt
that the thing for Britain to do is to enter

NOVEMBER 6, 1962
the Common Market if she can make satisfactory arrangements. I find no fault at all
with our Prime Minister's attitude at the
Prime Ministers' Conference. He was there
to put forward the Canadian position, and I
think he did it very well. The arguments of
the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia and
New Zealand were carefully listened to, and
noted. I feel sure that at Brussels both Mr.
Macmillan and Mr. Heath will try to get the
best terms they can for the Commonwealth
countries and that they will do their best to
protect Commonwealth interests. However,
I do not think we should complain too loudly
if we have to make some sacrifices in order
to enable Britain to get in on the ground floor.
It is interesting to read what Mr. R. A.
Butler, the British Secretary of State, had
to say at the Conservative convention. These
are his words, as reported in the Toronto
Star on October 13:
If we are to do our duty by the Commonwealth, if we are to pay our defence
bills, if we are to export more capital to
the Commonwealth, if we are to help
underdeveloped countries, if we are to
balance our overseas payments and finally, if we are to raise our standard
of living, we must have a wider home
market for our modern and complex
exports. That is the absolutely vital economic reason for going forward with this.

I heard him remark that the mission of the
Jews was to teach Christianity to the Christians.
In this chamber, with one single exception,
we are all Christians-nominally at least. Perhaps to some degree we are all Christians,
and I submit that we had a magnificent lesson
in Christianity when the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol) moved
his resolution to establish a special committee
to inquire into and report on the continuing
problems of the Sons of Freedom Doukhobors.
That lesson was reinforced and enlarged by
the kindly and truly Christian address which
he delivered to us in support of that motion.
For sixty years a small section of the Doukhobor immigrants who came to Canada as
long ago as that has harassed and frustrated
the Canadian authorities. While the great bulk
of Doukhobors have behaved themselves in
a law-abiding manner, that small minority
have refused to obey our laws and have
marked their protests against fancied wrongs
by acts of criminal violence, such as the dynamiting of schools, bridges and electric power
plant facilities; by arson, the burning of homes
belonging to themselves, to their more Canadianized fellow immigrants, and to others.
They have refused to assimilate with their
neighbours and they have outraged the respectable portions of the community by parading in the nude. It was for a group of
people such as this that the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina moved his resolution, to benefit these people who have troubled Canada for more than half a century.
It was for them and for ourselves, for the
people of British Columbia and to some
extent for the people of Saskatchewan, that
he made his eloquent plea. In words which,
I humbly submit, might have been used by
the founder of Christianity himself under
similar circumstances, he asked us to extend
the hand of friendship, with a sympathetic
understanding; to turn the other cheek, as it
were, and with a fourfold forgiveness to proceed to rescue these "Peck's bad boys" from
self-imposed disaster.
The honourable senator from TorontoSpadina gently suggested that we too may
bear some responsibility-a small and undefined responsibility, it is true-by our own
neglect for the one thousand men, women
and children who are now bogged down beside the road to Agassiz, after a trek of 300
miles.
Honourable senators, notwithstanding the
facts, which I have recited as forcibly as I
can, you must know that I agree with him,
for I have seconded his motion. And why not?
I am reminded of the words attributed to
Edward Wallis Hoch, sometime Governor of

the State of Kansas, and the owner of the
Marion Record, a newspaper of that state.
The words are as follows:
There is so much good in the worst of us,
And so much bad in the best of us,
That it hardly becomes any of us
To talk about the rest of us.
I will go along with the senator from
Toronto-Spadina on the principle that, while
the light hangs out to burn, the vilest sinner
may return; and I would like to open the
door, if only just a crack, for the sinner to return. I do not agree with the statement which
has been made that an act of Christian kindness on our part in an attempt to bring about
better conditions will offend the law-abiding
portion of the Doukhobor community. I think
it is much more likely that these people, who
perhaps individually have suffered from the
lawlessness of the Sons of Freedom, will
hope, perhaps somewhat hopelessly, that we
succeed.
I am not one to pass over the difficulties or
to shut my eyes to them; you and I, of
course, must recognize that there are difficulties to be encountered. The first difficulty that
comes to my mind is the Doukhobors' lack
of responsible and effective leadership, and
so it may be difficult, if we nominate a committee such as is proposed, to arrange the
proceedings, to conduct negotiations, and
finally to achieve some communal understanding. That difficulty may not be insurmountable, but certainly it is something that
we should recognize in advance, and not try
to close our eyes ta it.
The next difficulty that occurs to me is that
these present martyrs, who are in such a bad
way on the road from Krestova to Agassiz,
have burned and destroyed their own homes
behind them and now have nowhere to go
where they may resume a normal form of
living with lessened tension and, I would
hope, with better intentions. What is to be
done with them? I am frank to confess that I
do not know what is to be done with them,
but I do know that neither the people of
British Columbia nor we as senior statesmen
of this great country can stand idly by while
these people die like flies in the course of a
hard Canadian winter.
The third difficulty is an economic one. I
do not pose as having any special knowledge
about the Doukhobors and their community,
or even their lawlessness. I have done my best
to read and inform myself on the subject, and
I have gone through a magnificent report,
produced ten years ago, by the University of
British Columbia, which gives one some
understanding of these people, but I am not
posing at all as an expert in this matter.

NOVEMBER 6. 1962
However, it does corne to me that a possible
explanation of the rernarkable conduct of
these people is in the econornie phase of their
existence.
When the Doukhobors came to Canada sorne
sixty years ago they formed co-operatives for
the cultivation of the land which we gave
them. Their industry was entirely agriculture,
but unfortunately these comrnunistic communîties have not been successful; they have
failed, and failed with a good deal of bitterness. Sorne of these people have been left
rather high and dry. Those of the Sons of
Freedorn who have not established their own
homes on their own farms now work for
wages; and as honourable senators are aware,
employment during these last few years has
been seriously depressed. The Sons of Freedom who are now in jail at Agassiz, and
those on the hîghway leading to that place
from Krestova, have given Up farming almost entirely. I arn credibly informed that
in Krestova there is not sufficient land around
their homes to make a family garden. Those
who farm their own land, of course, are respected members of the community. Those
who are otherwise employed are liked by
their employers, who find thern quiet and
docile, obedient and industrious. However,
their employrnent has been adversely affected,
and very rnuch so during the current depression.
I amn not pronouncing a possible solution,
but is it not possible that the basic cause of
the trouble among these people is their
poverty? Might it not be that disastrous
economic conditions are the basic cause of
the discontent of the Sons of Freedom'?
Mr. Choquette: How rnany are they, al]
told?
Hon. Mr. Roebuclc: By the widest count,
about 2,000; about 1,300 are bogged down on
the road. In all, there are approximately
20,000 Doukhobors, perhaps more.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Basically, what do they
want?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is what we are
here to find out. I do not know. I may be
wrong in my assumption with regard to econornic conditions.
Han. Mr. Horner: You are absolutely wrong.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, perhaps so. The
honourable senator frorn Blaine Lake <Hon.
Mr. Horner) knows a certain portion of them,
and he spoke about that portion. He made a
plea for the self-respecting, the law-abiding,
settled Doukhobors of this country. With his
plea 1 entirely agree; but 1 arn talking about
the landless men and wornen, familles who
have no place in the sun, and who are on the
27511-5-14J

road to Agassiz-a very different people frorn
the well-to-do f armers for whom the honourable senator spoke.
Han. Mr. Reid: They walked away from
their own properties.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: I arn not saying that
they did not. I said a self-imposed disaster.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Nobody chased them out.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No; but rny friend
should just lîsten to me, rather than make
his speech over again.
Han. M. Reid: Well, I know sornething
about them.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Yes, and you told us
that. I have the floor at the moment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: This is all theory.
Hion. Mr. Roebuck: Well, good theory is
good logic, rny friend.
Han. Mr. Brooks: A good start.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, a good start, and
that is all that we propose at the moment.
My friend himself says he does not know
what to do with the Doukhobors, and I agree
with him on that.
Honourable senators, I was endeavouring
to say that I may be wrong in attributing the
discontent of these people and evil deeds
of some of themn to econornic causes, but that
question is what this resolution is designed
to solve. That is why Senator Croîl moved
this resolution, that we may make an effort
to find the answer.
A further difficulty that mnust be recognized
is that the mischief is of long standing.
Others have tried and have failed. But
for the mort part it has been the police
mind that has been trying, not such men
and women who made this university inquiry some ten years ago. Their only authority was to inquire. They made recommendations which, like most reports of bodies of
that kind, went into a pigeon hole. Still others
have tried and have failed, but I would lîke
to point out that a Senate committee has not
yet even tried. 1 do not concede that Senator
Croil, if his proposed cornrittee is established, will fail. He may, but I arn not conceding that for one moment, because I would
point out that few if any can assess the
power of kindness. If you want to defeat an
enem-y-and that is what is proposed-the
way to accomplish it is to make of him a
friend.
That these Sons of Freedom are not impervious to, acts of kindness would appear
from a dispatch from Hope, a littie town
near which these Sons of Freedom. are now
encamped. It was a dispatch ta the Toronto.

SENATE
Globe a.nd Mail of October 29, last Monday.
I would like to read a few lines from it.
Sons of Freedom Doukhobors paraded
on the main street of Hope today, singing hymns and praising the village
residents ...
Mrs. Fanny Storgoff, who speaks for
the sect here, wept tears of gratitude
during the parade. She said the march
demonstrated the Freedomites' thanks to
"the good people of Hope for the kind
manner the Doukhobors have been accepted and treated."
She said that during the last week's
crisis in Cuba the Freedomites had
prayed for delivery of the people of Hope
from atomic bombs and warfare.
So you see that these people are not devoid
of response to acts of kindness. Perhaps we
would gain more in a committee such as we
now propose than the police have gained in
putting large numbers of them in jail.
I would like to impress upon you that were
we to discover the root causes of the Sons of
Freedom discontent and reconcile these people
with their neighbours, we would confer a
blessing, to say the very least, on that disconsolate and homeless band of pilgrims who
are now on the road to Agassiz, and it could
be that these good people who responded to
the kindness of the people of Hope might
even include the honourable Senator Croll
among those for whom they pray.
Were the committee to fail I submit we
would lose little. My honourable friend from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) was chairman of a special committee of the Senate
which inquired into the traffic in narcotic
drugs in Canada. The resolution to set up
that committee, moved in 1955, was a resolution of the same character as that now under
discussion. It was with regard to down-andouts on the road to the grave by indulgence
in narcotics. I would like to recall to the
minds of honourable senators the great success which the honourable member from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) made out of that
seemingly hopeless endeavour.
I would also point out that the amendments to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act
which were made following the report of the
committee embodied most of the recommendations made by the committee. I would
further remind you that when that hopeless
cause was dealt with here and the committee
was appointed under the chairmanship of the
gentleman from New Westminster I voted for
the proposal, wished him well, and started
him on his way, and I rejoiced with him when
he returned with certain things accomplished.
I say that if we were to fail in this endeavour, we would lose little. We would at least

have made an effort and surely, honourable
senators, we in this chamber have the courage at least to proffer assistance. Should we
succeed we will have conferred a blessing in
the first instance on the Sons of Freedom, but
also we will have conferred a great blessing
on the people of Canada at large and I should
think that the people of British Columbia
would say it with flowers.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They sure would.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Of course they would,
and they would welcome our effort.
Hon. Mr. Horner: British Columbia has
asked for no such thing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Maybe they had a conference with you before they decided not to
ask. They have said nothing to me with regard
to the matter and certainly expressed no
opposition to an effort on our part.
The honourable senator from Lumsden
(Hon. Mr. Pearson) said that we would cause
friction by inquiring into the lives of the
Doukhobors. He said the Doukhobors in Saskatchewan are excellent farmers, as sound a
class of people as we have in Canada and as
thoroughgoing Canadians as any of the groups
that have come to this country from Europe.
Well, I agree with every word he said in
that regard, but who has suggested that we
make an inquiry into the private lives of
anybody, the Doukhobors in general, or even
the Sons of Freedom in particular? Senator
Croll has suggested nothing of the kind. I
read in part the resolution that he moved:
-that a Special Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and
report upon the continuing problems presented by the Sons of Freedom...
Not the Doukhobors generally, and not to
inquire into their private lives, but rather to
inquire into the problem of the lawlessness of
the Freedomites.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Did not Senator Croll in
his statement to the Senate propose an inquiry
into the Doukhobors, as well as the Sons of
Freedom?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think my honourable
friend is wrong there. Senator Croll talked
all the way through about the Sons of Freedom, not the law-abiding Doukhobors, and if
he spoke on something that was outside the
scope of his motion he was out of order.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): He is
bound by the terms of the resolution.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He stands by the resolution, but whether he does or does not, I do.
I am advocating this resolution, not the
speech made by anyone. It is the resolution
that is before us, and it talks about inquiring

NOVEMBER 6, 1962
into "the continuing problems presented by
the Sons of Freedom Doukhobors". I say that
none of us is suggesting inquiring into the
life of anyone. We are suggesting an inquiry into the problems of these people,
and I suppose no one here will suggestHon. Mr. Horner: Might I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, you make your
speech after I am through.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would like to ask you
a question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would like to ask you
how you inquire into their problems without
inquiring into their lives?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To the extent which
the problem involves their lives we will inquire into that problem, and I am not at all
afraid of inquiring into a problem that involves human beings. This is a human problem, it is true, but when you talk about
inquiring into the private lives of people
that is quite another matter. We want to
know why these people did certain things.
Is that inquiring into their lives? If it is,
all right-it is their public life, that is true.
However, that is not inquiring into their lives,
how they live, or how they treat their wiveswhether they have stopped beating their
wives-or something of that kind. When we
talk about inquiring into their actions as
citizens of this country, or rather their refusal to be citizens of this country, and their
dynamiting of public and private works,
that is not inquiring into their lives. We
have put some of them on trial on many
occasions. If we send them to jail, is that a
matter of inquiring into their lives?
Honourable senators, I suppose that no one
in this chamber will suggest that there is
no problem when over a thousand men,
women and children, people of all ages and
of both sexes, are camped beside the road,
living in tents in the face of the oncoming
winter. Will anyone say that is not a problem? I heard a trekker, one of the Sons of
Freedom, on television not very long since,
say that the children were ill as a result of
the dampness and cold in which they were
living. I was not surprised. I can assure you,
my friends, there is a problern if these
children die like flies in the cold of this
coming winter. I think the people of British
Columbia will be more kindly disposed towards them than some of us. Certainly, the
good people of Hope have demonstrated
kindness, and in all probability they will do
something even if we do nothing.
Hon. Mr. Monette: May I put a question
to the honourable senator, without offence?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am sure there will
be no offence intended, but I do not like
a continuous running commentary when I
am speaking.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I have a question as to
whether the remarks of the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol)
were limited to the Sons of Freedom or
extended further. This is what he said in
his speech, as appears at page 57 of
HansardHon. Mr. Roebuck: This is not a question.
Hon. Mr. Monette: No, but the resolution
may extend beyond the Sons of Freedom
Doukhobors. If my question disturbs you,
I shall not proceed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it does not disturb
me.
Hon. Mr. Monette: The honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina said:
Honourable senators, in the motion I
have put before you I have deliberately
focussed attention on the Sons of Freedom, the most radical sect among the
Doukhobors, but I have not limited the
investigation to the Sons of Freedom. On
the contrary, the investigation extends
to "any problem related thereto".
Is that something that may lead to a consideration of more extensive matters, or does
it limit your remarks to the Sons of Freedom?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the first place, I am
not responsible for what the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina said in his
speech; I am making my own speech. In the
second place, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina, according to the very words
you have just quoted, referred to problems
of the Sons of Freedom or any problem
related thereto. "Any problem related thereto"
refers to the problems of the Sons of Freedom. It might refer to the loss of their lives
and their economie conditions. It might refer
to the oppression they claim to have suffered,
and many other things. But this is all
directed to the problem of the Sons of Freedom. That is what we wish to inquire into,
and as I understand the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina, that is what he proposes, and not a general inquiry into the lives
of the Doukhobors or any other citizens.
Honourable senators, I was about to say
that the honourable senator from Lumsden
(Hon. Mr. Pearson) asked this question: Are
we to set ourselves up as a group of citizens
superior to our neighbours? Well, I hope not.

NOVEMBER 6, 1962
Senator David Croll's motion proposing
that a Senate committee study the Doukhobor problem deserves a favourable
response. . . .
A Senate inquiry might illuminate the
problem sufficiently to make a solution
possible. What do the Freedomites want
that brings them into conflict with society?
Why do they employ unlawful means to
protest against their grievances when the
law is elastic enough to embrace many
legal methods of protest without resort to
violence? Why do they deliberately and
zealously seek martyrdom? In short,
what's bothering them?
Only by entering into the minds and
hearts of the Freedomites can answers
to these questions be found. The Senate
is eminently suited to try to find the
answers. Its members have no axe to
grind, and many senators have wide
experience in human afTairs. A study
of this kind would be profitable to
Canada.
That is a considered opinion by a very responsible newspaper.
Now, honourable senators, I appeal to everyone in this chamber not to stand in the way
of a humanitarian effort of this kind proposed
by the senator from Toronto-Spadina. I have
no knowledge whatsoever as to how he will
approach the solution of the problem, but I
do know that he is prepared to assume the
labour and responsibility of such an inquiry,
and from a quarter of a century of intimate
association with him I can say this, having in
mind his character and his outstanding
ability, that if he cannot succeed nobody can.
For that reason I say let us join in forgetting,

if we can, the tragie and unhappy past of this
strange, little understood and troublesome
people, but let us not forget the thousand
men, women and children who have trekked
300 miles towards Agassiz, and who are now
in their mad mission bogged down and facing
the rigours of the coming winter. Let us not
forget what may possibly occur during these
winter months when they face death from
exposure and privation. Let us also not forget
the welfare of the community in which these
people dwell. Something must be done to
bring this unhappy era to a close.
This, honourable senators, may be the very
moment to strike with what I have called the
most potent of all weapons, namely, that of
understanding, sympathy and kindness. This
may be the very time to do this because these
people have been in the open now for weeks
and certainly are in a sad condition. This
may be the time to strike, and I submit to
you that the man to head an effort of this
kind is the person who, with your consent,
very recently undertook to do it. That man
is Senator Croll. I suggest, honourable senators, that we all vote for this measure and let
us see what he can accomplish.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Would not all of these
people be frozen stiff by the time this committee made its report?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps
now too late, but that is no

SPEECH FROM

THE THRONE

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators,
fully realizing that my expressions of appreciation may be a repetition, nevertheless,
it is pleasantly imperative that I add my
voice and congratulations to the deserving
chorus of praise already extended to His

NOVEMBER 7, 1962

Honour the Speaker upon his appointment
to preside over the debates of this chamber.
May I wish him health and happiness to
enjoy his new role for, I trust, many more
years.
An equally pleasant task is to associate myself with my colleagues in congratulating
the Government on its wise choice of the
senator from Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks) as
Leader of the Government in this chamber.
I would like to assure him of my loyalty,
co-operation and support. If my colleagues
from New Brunswick have hailed him as a
native son of their picture province, I can
draw personal satisfaction in that his son,
daughter-in-law and three lovely grandchildren have chosen as their home the good
old historic city of Quebec. It should be
underlined that both of these honourable
gentlemen, His Honour the Speaker and the
honourable Leader of the Government are
seconded, morally, socially and graciously, by
two distinguished and charming ladies, Mrs.
White and Mrs. Brooks.
Hon.
hear.

Mr.

Macdonald

(Braniford):

Hear,

Hon. Mrs. Quart: It is extremely rewarding
for the feminine element in the Senate to
know that we have two such staunch friends
at court, should at times we need someone to
plead our cause.
To the former Speaker, the Honourable
Mark Drouin, a friend of many years, I offer
my thanks for having made me feel so much
at home when a novice in this chamber.
My gratitude goes out as well to the
former Leader of the Government, the
Honourable Senator Aseltine, whose advice
to refrain from biased partisanship in the
Senate helped me cool down my Irish temperament and learn to smile, when some of the
senators of the Opposition set a very bad
example in the tempting sport of spiked
partisanship. But, honourable senators, am I
then, to surmise that the policy of the
Opposition is, "Don't do as I do but do as I
say"? Before becoming too provocative, I
shall continue in a more genial mood, discretion being the better part of valour.
I should like to extend a warm welcome
to our new senators. As the Honourable
Senator Pouliot remarked, we not only have
seven wise men, but eight-and with that
I cease my reference to his remarks of that
day. I am confident these eight wise men
will excel in their contributions to the debates of this chamber. Those who have
spoken so far have demonstrated outstanding
ability, and I must confess to emotions of
pleasure in hearing their vigorous appraisals
of the sincere efforts of the Prime Minister

and of our Government for the welfare of
Canada and its people.
May I add my name to the list of those.
senators who, in glowing tributes, deplored
the loss of several of our esteemed colleagues
since the last session, and extend my deepest
sympathy to the members of their families.
I express my most sincere condolence to
Senator Ross Macdonald in his recent bereavement, and wish him to know that theloss of such a beautiful and charming lady
will be felt by all of us.
I extend a special word of appreciation to
the mover of the Speech from the Throne
(Hon. Mr. Haig), a worthy son of an illustrious parent. He is treading in the footsteps
of his father, as was obvious by the eloquent
manner in which he presented a clear, concise exposé of the excellent legislation
proposed by the Government and the logical
reasons for its adoption.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, I also congratulate the
honourable senator from Madawaska-Restigouche (Hon. Mr. Fournier), who seconded
the address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, for the magnificent way in which he
discharged his responsibility. I particularly
want to express my admiration for his deep
understanding of the people of Quebec and
the place this province fills in the Canadian
Confederation. I understand and support the
thoughts expressed by my colleague; they
reflect views not only of a citizen of New
Brunswick, not only of his neighbour in
Quebec, but of a great Canadian.
I hope his contribution will mark another
step toward real progress in cementing national unity throughout this country of ours.
(Text):
Honourable senators, as you know, there
is a definite advantage in speaking in this
debate, for one is not restricted to a discussion
of any item mentioned in the Speech from
the Throne. Therefore, when Senator Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche) was expounding
his views about the people of Quebec and
their good common sense, I experienced a
compulsion to expound mine about my native
province of Quebec.
Quebec is today undergoing a quiet revolution in thought, attitude and action. As in
many other places around the globe, modern
technology and industrial progress are stirring the very core of a peace-loving, pastoral
folk, disturbing traditions in some phases,
but everywhere challenging the direction of
its hitherto clear-cut ambitions.
Placed as I am, a member of the small
English-speaking minority of this large
French-speaking portion of Canada, may I
go on record as stating that nowhere in this
imperfect world of ours has justice, tolerance

SENATE
and fair play flourished so grandly; nowhere
across our country will you encounter a
hand so far outstretched in friendship; nowhere will you meet such a sincere desire to
understand and to be understood. Too often
in the past this outstretched hand was met
with indifference, a smug, superior attitude,
which can no longer be tolerated in a shrinking world. Might over right bas ultimately
perished before the sword of justice and,
thereupon, is recorded in history for all to
see.
In a world of senseless tragedies, racial
discrimination and selfish prejudice, the province of Quebec still stands as a bastion of
racial, religious and social freedom, despite
these rumblings of discontent and petty misunderstandings. No finer tribute can be paid
to Quebec than to have a member of a
minority group, as I am, bear witness to the
justice and treatment afforded minorities in
that province. If distant rumblings are now
to be heard, could it possibly be that Quebec
has softly hummed its tune of bonne entente
to deaf ears along a one-way street? Nothing
is more disheartening te human nature than
to feel that your dedicated contribution to a
great cause bas gone unnoticed. Therein lies
the crux of the matter, because Quebec and
the French Canadian have contributed magnificently to the cause of true Canadianism;
but, unfortunately, too often this sharing in
the construction of their country bas been
lost in the pool of indifference by their fellowCanadians. Too often in the past deeds of
valour, courage and achievement by Quebecers have failed to make even the obituary
pages in the press of ber sister provinces,
whereas the misdeeds of a French Canadian
chauvinist or demagogue have rated headlines. And let not this lack of interest be
confused with a lack of activity, for a graver
error could not be committed.
In the field of progressive education Quebec
stands equal to the best in this country. In
the two world wars surely our Quebec regiments-notably, the fighting "Van-Doos", the
Royal 22nd Regiment-had a glorious record,
as did our many servicemen in the navy and
air force.
In sport, one doubts what would happen
to the national sport of Canada were it not
for the Rocket Richards, the Jean Beliveaus
and the Boom-Boom Geoffrions.
In the arts, French Canada has made many
significant contributions to a national literature; and must I remind my colleagues that
French Canadians are continually composing
and promoting original, popular songs about
Canada.
As a member of the Centennial Planning
Committee for the last four or five years, I
was delighted to learn that folk songs are

enjoying a revival in all provinces across
Canada, for these folk songs are part and
parcel of our Canadian culture and, I understand, will be featured during our centennial
celebrations.
I read recently that when Shakespeare
wanted to express the inexpressible he put
aside his pen and called for music. And who
can deny the stimulating value of "Alouette,
gentille Alouette, Alouette, je t'y plumerai",
sung by all Canadians, with no pronunciations
barred? And what about the rollicking air of
"Vive la Canadienne-et ses jolis yeux doux"?
Its lilting tune and words, honourable senators, are irresistible in winning favour with
the ladies.
In addition to Quebec's wonderful folk
songs, a flip of the TV dial in our province
will convince anyone of the lively cultural
climate which exists in Quebec.
In the field of the humanities, Quebec need
bow to no one. In the field of industry and
technology, perhaps she was a little late at
the starting post because of various and complex reasons. However, now with something
close to impatience she is on the move to
bridge the gap, and perhaps this desperate
hurry and more precisely the misunderstanding of her impatience by her sister provinces
has precipitated the distant rumblings.
It bas frequently been stated by politicians
and others that "La Belle Province de Quebec" is not like any other province. There
is nothing in that statement which should
offend or surprise Canadians of other races
and cultures. But rather, before condemning
those who make such statements our fellowCanadians from the other provinces would
be wise to examine their consciences and
recall certain basic and historical facts in the
pact of Confederation of 1867, which people
sometimes are too prone to forget.
The English-speaking Canadian must stop
expecting his French-speaking fellow-Canadian to be an exact replica of himself. He
never was to begin with, nor is it likely that
he ever will be.
If the Fathers of Confederation had so
wanted it, they would have designed a melting-pot type of constitution. This they did
not do, and it should be faced squarely and
accepted. One step further would bring us
to the wonderful realization that herein lies
the road to a distinctive Canadianism. One
culture complements the other and the union
of both is far greater than either of the components. We have so much to give to and receive
from each other. English-speaking Canadians
must develop enough interest to learn that
the contribution of the people of Quebec to

NOVEMBER 7, 1962
that illusive requisite called Canadian identity
could perhaps be matched in other parts of
the country, but could not be surpassed.
The Fathers of Confederation were not
dreamers. They wanted to create a real Canadian nation wherein two cultures, English
and French, must be free to develop, each
according to its own traditions and character.
These historic facts were made very clear
in the drafting of the act of 1867.
In mentioning the Fathers of Confederation,
a Conservative cannot but take pride in the
fact that Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's
first Prime Minister and founder of the
Conservative Party, and Sir Georges-Étienne
Cartier, were the chief builders of Confederation. Sir John A. Macdonald's dream was
to build a nation from sea to sea, and he
would never have become a father of his
country had he not possessed a vision of
Canada's possibilities for greatness.
In this respect our present Prime Minister
has much in common with Sir John A.
Macdonald. He also possesses a vision of
Canada's future greatness. Would it not then
be simple justice, and most fitting, that, as
Canada's thirteenth or fourteenth Prime
Minister after the next election, the Right
Honourable John G. Diefenbaker be the one
to play the leading role in the celebrations
to mark to 100th anniversary of Canada's
nationhood?
And what of bilingualism? Volumes have
been written about its tangible contribution
to this specific national identity. Suffice it to
say that the bilingual Canadian of today,
from the standpoint of pure logic, has a cultural edge on his unilingual compatriot; and
anyone who refutes this, or rejects an opportunity to learn the second language, simply
limits his own potential.
Common sense dictates that circumstances
and geography determine the opportunity
and degree of our bilingualism. However,
circumstance and geography should have no
bearing on a sincere good-will effort at a
better understanding of our fellow Canadians.
I would submit that if the hand of Englishspeaking Canada grasps the hand of Quebec
we will together rediscover Canada, and in
so doing build a truly great nation for ourselves and generations to come.
It has been well said that language is
indispensable to culture, and it stands to
reason that every additional language acquired stands for additional culture. It seems
a fact that when people can understand and
converse in each other's language a link of
sympathy is established, and a verbal exchange of viewpoints frequently prevents
"molehills" from becoming "mountains" of
misunderstanding.

It is beyond doubt that the installation of
a simultaneous translation system in the other
place and here in the Senate is a great step
forward, for this has removed the language
barrier between English-speaking and Frenchspeaking members of both houses. In fact,
it is an excellent opportunity to perfect our
knowledge and pronunciation of each other's
language. May I be permitted without being
accused of undue partisanship to congratulate
the Conservative Government for this action,
which was long overdue?
It has been truly said that "the greatness
of a country is measured by the stature of
the men and women who live in it". Many
challenges will have to be faced during the
next few years, but surely Canadian unity
is worth some serious soul-searching to work
out a solution.
In a democracy you and I are responsible,
or to blame, if we cannot make it work, and
it is up to each and every one of us to help
our public men, our governments, and others,
to find a solution to this resurgence of ethnic
spirit now taking place in Quebec. We would
all do well to recognize the impact of this
resurgence.
Maybe our young people will provide the
answer to these problems. Let us by our
example help them to abolish the bridgeheads
of bigotry and hatred wherever and whenever
they appear. Let us teach them to develop
their capacity for independence of thought, to
show -respect for laws and authority, to understand clearly the democratic principles by
which we live, and to live by the Divine
commandment: "Love thy neighbour as thyself".
We must convince Canada's youth of the
wonderful heritage they have, teach them to
develop a new set of values based upon
justice and tolerance, geared to meeting the
challenge of the new situation in human relations, and make them realize that it is in
large measure up to them to make Sir Wilfrid
Laurier's prophecy that "the 20th century
belongs to Canada" come true.
Today's youth have labelled themselves the
"if" generation. If they are given the opportunity to reach manhood they might attempt
to solve some of the problems which now
threaten to blow up their world. If we, their
elders, keep the world from blowing up with
their youthful dreams, they would endeavour
to succeed where we have failed.
What a pitifully small inheritance they are
willing to settle for-simply, that we prevent
their world from blowing up! I submit that
right here and now we should strive towards
leaving them something a little better than
a planet still physically intact. We might not
entirely solve the 'problems of prejudice and

SENATE
intolerance, but surely we could refrain from
encouraging or helping the spread of these
evils.
As Canadians, we should do everything
possible to promote national unity and understanding even if, at times, lit means swallowing some selfish pride. We should stop
pretending to be and start behaving like Christians even if, at times, the shoe pinches our
Christian feet. The task might appear difficult
and demand sacrifice, yet surely the reward
of leaving the "if" generation with a world
a little better than this one is worth striving
for. If then we can do this, the "if" generation-our Canadian youth-might become the
generation of achievement.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, this academie debate shows that
the amenities of life are well preserved in
the Senate.
I am pleased, Sir, to join my colleagues
in telling you how satisfied I was at your
appointment. Having known you for many
years in both the Senate and the House of
Commons, I know your fairness and your experience will be a tower of strength for all
members of this house.
It is my pleasure to congratulate the honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
and his deskmate, the honourable senator
from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette), upon
their elevation to the leadership and the
deputy leadership of the Government in this
house.
I have known Senator Brooks for many
years. We served together with the Honourable Mr. Howard Green on the Civil Service
Committee, a committee which did a very
good job and succeeded in tabling a unanimous report during two successive sessions.
I cherish happy recollections of my dealings
with the honourable gentleman, and I am sure
that he will be true to the tradition established by his predecessor, the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine),
who was most helpful to all of us in his
important functions.
I congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr. Haig)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier, Madawaska-Restigouche) of the address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, on their able
speeches.
Honourable senators, I wish to remind you
that the Library of Parliament is at our
disposal. Its wealth of information is probably
unique in this country; its staff, from the
Parliamentary Librarian to the last appointed
employee, is most helpful. Honourable senators will find in the library ail the information
needed to be well informed on any matter
discussed in this chamber.

We have another very precious and rich
source of information in the Government
Printing Bureau. The gentleman who did most
to establish the Printing Bureau as it is now
was Mr. Edmond Cloutier, who suffered an
unfair treatment when he was brought as a
witness before a committee of the House of
Commons. Is it not remarkable that each
morning we get simultaneously a copy of
both the English and the French Hansard of
the House of Commons, which are very
voluminous; the parliamentary papers, that
is, the Routine Proceedings and Orders of the
Day and the Votes and Proceedings of that
house; also, the Senate Hansard and the
Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate;
and all the departmental publications?
At the opening of this session, I mentioned
some of those publications which are available to all of us. Since then, several of our
colleagues have told me that they have received the books they ordered from the
Printing Bureau and are delighted to have
them on the shelves of their offices for
further reference.
Naturally, those books do not read like
novels and may seem to be arid. Even so,
if precise and correct information is needed,
honourable senators may get it not only in
the statute book but from the Canada Gazette,
Part I, which contains much important
information concerning the income and expenditure of each department. The departmental reports are also available, as well as
some other publications which will surely
interest honourable members of the Senate.
I recommend to you not to throw in the
waste basket the leaflets which you receive
daily informing you about the new publications from the Printing Bureau. You should
read them.
Each department publishes a periodical
dealing with its activities. Some periodicals
appear weekly, some monthy, and others are
published two or three times a year. The
publication Foreign Affairs deals with the
activities of the External Affairs Department. The publication Foreign Trade deals
with the trade and commerce of this country.
Those are but two examples of many which
are available.
The present Queen's Printer, Mr. Roger
Duhamel, has succeeded magnificently in continuing the work of Mr. Edmond Cloutier,
with the aid of some dedicated men who are
devoted to serving the country to the best of
their ability.
It was King Solomon who first recommended the reading of books. A long time
afterwards, Caliph Omar destroyed the
library of Alexandria in Egypt.

NOVEMBER 7, 1962
To sum this up, honourable senators, I
may say that you know very well the importance of the information which you need,
and that it is more useful than any lecture or
conference. You may find that information in
the Library of Parliament, in books that
you have to return; or you may find it in
books and periodicals which you may obtain
from the Printing Bureau and keep for your
own benefit.
I turn now to three things contained in
the Speech from the Throne. One is:
Legislation respecting the Senate will
be introduced.
This concerns the age limit for senators. The
Government may, if it wishes, go on with the
bill which is before the other house.
At this point I should like to welcome and
congratulate the new senators and to remind
them that it is a great honour to be a member
of the Senate of Canada.
Some years ago one of the older senators
from Saskatchewan said that a senator should
be, in the first place, a senator. I feel that one
of the new senators deserves special congratulations-I refer to the honourable senator
from Gormley (Hon. Mr. McCutcheon)-for
having resigned his directorates to give his
full time to the Privy Council sittings and
to his duties as representative of the Prime
Minister in this chamber. The first one to
occupy that informal position was the late
Senator Brunt, who was very much liked by
all of us. He was a man who had a high
sense of duty, who worked hard and performed a most useful job.
I find that the duties of the Leader of the
Government in this chamber are so onerous
that it was appropriate for the Prime Minister
to name one of us as his personal representative, in order to report to him what is being
done by the Senate.
Honourable senators, if I insist on drawing
your attention to the reference books which
you may get in the Library or from the
Printing Bureau, it is because I want you,
as senators of Canada, to give the full measure
of your talent in this house. If you do so,
you will find the work most interesting. This
is the loneliest place on earth when one has
nothing to do, but if you follow the legislation and keep yourselves informed about it
as it comes before us you will be interested,
you will be happier, and you will perform a
very useful service to this country.
Some speeches are very eloquent. In this respect I congratulate my honourable colleague
who spoke before me (Hon. Mrs. Quart).
She showed that she possessed that rare gift
which Mackenzie King called good will. We
have to work in unison in order to accomplish
something useful for our fellow-citizens. It

has been done already on many occasions
which have not been forgotten, and what was
accomplished by the Senate, in spite of threats
and menace, was for the good of the country
and was recognized as such from coast to
coast.
That being said, I wonder what will be
the use of the legislation which has been
sponsored by the Prime Minister to amend
the British North America Act with regard
to the age limit for retirement of senators.
Some of them are less young than I am, but
their minds are clear, they have experience,
they have served their country well, and are
still doing so in this chamber. The Government does not say much about the matter in
the Speech from the Throne. It is mentioned
casually, but I hope that the Prime Minister
and the Cabinet will reconsider their hasty
action about it, and that the bill to amend the
British North America Act respecting the
Senate will be allowed to lie on the shelf for
a long period of time.
I would refer now to the following paragraph in the Speech from the Throne:
To ensure that the redistribution of
electoral districts is made objectively
and impartially, you will be asked to
approve a bill to establish an independent
commission to recommend redistribution.
We have enough commissions, and we
have a lot of committees which do not sitthere are some also in the House of Commons. It belongs to the House of Commons to
determine the boundaries of each constituency. I have confidence in the fairness of the
members of Parliament of all parties to be
able to come to an understanding concerning
the electoral divisions in constituencies, and
good work has been done in the past. We
have heard enough about the Fathers of
Confederation and about the statesmen who
were in charge of the affairs of this country
before this Government came to power to
follow their example in that connection. I
still believe that good redistribution can be
made by Members of Parliament, without the
assistance of any commission. A constituency
is like a large family, and no one knows it
better than the sitting Member of Parliament
for that constituency. Therefore, I hope that
that legislation will not go further.
Another matter I have to deal with is
Canadian citizenship. If you look at the dictionary, you will see that a citizen is one
who owes allegiance to a state in which
the sovereign power is retained by the people.
For example, in the United States of America
the Kennedys are American citizens. A person
is a subject when the sovereign power is actually or theoretically retained by a personal

SENATE
sovereign, such as a monarch. This is our
case. Therefore, being loyal to my oath of
allegiance to Her Majesty, I believe that the
Canadian Citizenship Act should be changed
and that in future Canadians should be
called Canadian subjects of Her Majesty.
Since the Statute of Westminster was passed,
we hear so much about states like Canada
and Australia being independent-in the Commonwealth, naturally-that I do not see why
the time has not come for Canadians to be
described as Canadian subjects of Her Maiesty the Queen instead of British subjects
and Canadian citizens.
At present we do not know what we are.
A Canadian citizen, according to Section 21
of the Canadian Citizenship Act, is a British
subject. Then, Section 23 reads:
23. (1) Every person who, under an
enactment of a country listed in the
First Schedule, is a citizen of that country, has in Canada the status of a British
subject.
(2) Every person having in Canada the
status of a British subject may be known
as a British subject or as a Commonwealth citizen; and in this Act and in
any other enactment or instrument, the
expression "British subject" and the
expression "Commonwealth citizen" have
the same meaning.

He may call himself a British subject, he may
be a British subject, but I do not see why he
should have the right to be nominated as a
candidate in an election or to vote for a candidate who runs for public office in this country. The act should make a distinction between
private and public rights, and that would
make it much easier to understand.
At the present time I challenge anyone to
give a clear answer to some questions about
citizenship. We are not in the United States;
we are not in the British Isles. We are in the
realm of Canada, and our Sovereign happens
at this time to be the Sovereign of the British
Isles, and when I took the oath of allegiance
to Queen Elizabeth II it was to her in her
capacity as Queen of Canada. My contention
is that we have all done the same implicitly.
This leads me to another matter which has
been controversial to a certain extent but
about which no decision has been made by the
Government. I refer to a paragraph in the
Speech from the Throne which reads:
As another means of making manifest
the Canadian identity, my Government
will invite the provinces to a conference
for consultation regarding the choice of
a national flag and other national symbols.

NOVEMBER 7, 1962
Moreover, as long as the suggestion is
made, and it is discussed, that there should
be a Canadian flag representing various
races in this country, we shall get nowhere.
The only way to conceive a national flag is
by thinking of a single idea and incorporating
in the flag a truly national and distinctive
emblem of any desired colour on a suitable
background of any desired colour. Whether
it be red on green, green on red, blue on
white, or white on blue, or any other colour
combination, we need a nationally recognized
emblem, one big enough to be seen and
readily identified by all who see it, whether
it be flying from the masthead of the Peace
Tower of the Parliament Buildings or elsewhere. One must be able to see the emblem
to recognize the flag; and in order to have
an emblem large enough there can be only
one on the flag. All the emblems now included in the Red Ensign cannot be incorporated, because one could not see them
properly when the flag flies atop the Peace
Tower. We are not ready for a Canadian
flag, because we do not have a truly Canadian citizenship embracing our loyalty to the
Queen of Canada.
Honourable senators, I now ask you to
allow me to adjourn the debate. I have
expressed my feelings on those matters which
I have touched upon, but I shall have something else to say about another paragraph
of the Speech from the Throne, that regarding the repatriation of the Constitution of
Canada.
Apart from the matter under discussion,
if I may be permitted, honourable senators,
may I remind you that today the city of
Ottawa has lost one of its most prominent
citizens, a gentleman who was for ten years
member of the House of Commons for the
Ottawa West constituency. He was an important businessman, and accomplished a lot
for the city of Ottawa. A well-known sportsman, he was a member for Hockey's Hall
of Fame. He was better informed about
politics than most people, was very well
read, a most kind-hearted man, and a true
friend of the Honourable Paul Martin, of
myself, and many other parliamentarians.
I refer to Mr. T. Franklin Ahearn, who died
this morning at his home. I offer my most
sincere sympathy to his widow and children.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
THE SOVEREIGN LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY
OF CANADA-SECOND
READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved second
reading of Bill S-11, respecting The Sovereign
Life Assurance Company of Canada.

He said: Honourable senators, The Sovereign Life Assurance Company of Canada was
incorporated sixty years ago, in 1902, by the
Parliament of Canada and, as its name
implies, is a company carrying on the business
of life insurance. Its head office is in the city
of Winnipeg. It may be of interest to remark
that, although its head office has been .in
Winnipeg since the company's incorporation,
throughout the years a large proportion of its
business has been transacted in the province of Quebec.
The sole purpose of this bill is to add a
French version of the name The Sovereign
Life Assurance Company of Canada, namely,
La Souveraine, compagnie d'assurance-vie du
Canada.
Perhaps that is all I need say on second
reading. If this bill is given second reading I shall move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, bill
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
BANKRUPCY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-MOTION FOR SECOND
READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
October 18, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Higgins for second reading of Bill S-2, to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, in speaking on the second reading of
Bill S-2, an act to amend the Bankruptcy
Act, it must be made clear at the outset that
I am not an expert on bankruptcy. I merely
wish to try to answer some of the questions
raised by the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), at pages 85 and
86 of Hansard of October 16, and by the
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly), at page 88 of the same date.
I also wish to speak to this honourable house
about some of the experiences we have had
in the province of Manitoba in dealing with
a similar act, the Orderly Payment of Debts
Act.
One of the criticisms directed at the bill
now before us was with regard to the
absence of the provision for the appointment
of a trustee, and allowing the Clerk of the
County Court in Manitoba, or a similar
official in other provinces, to act as receiver
or clerk for the purposes of this bill. The
Orderly Payment of Debts Act was in force
in Manitoba from May 1932 until its repeal

SENATE
in December 1961, by reason of the decision
of the Supreme Court of Canada declaring
that the Alberta act, which was similar to
that of Manitoba, was ultra vires.
After the Supreme Court ruling was made
our provincial attorney general was consulted
with regard to this proposed measure, and he
stated that he would welcome this legislation in proper, legal form, and that it would
be proclaimed in Manitoba as quickly as
possible after its enactment by the Parliament of Canada.
This measure provides a simple and inexpensive procedure for the protection of both
the insolvent and the creditor. As you are
aware, the procedure is that the insolvent
makes his application to the Clerk, his debts
are consolidated, a decision is made as to
what is reasonable and fair for the insolvent
to pay, notices are sent out and these moneys,
when paid, are then distributed pro rata
among the creditors. During the time that
the Manitoba act to which I refer was in force,
I am informed that only about five per cent
of the insolvents failed to make payments.
Of course it may take a few years for the
creditor to get his money, but getting the
money in instalments is at least better than
not getting it at all.
As I said before, there is protection in this
bill for the creditor, should the insolvent fail
to make payments, in that he retains his
rights under the other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. The creditor is further protected
by the fact that when the order has been
made, and the time for appeal has lapsed, it
is filed with the proper office, such as the
Land Titles Office, and the insolvent is prevented from divesting himself of his lands
and, in certain county court districts, of his
chattels.
It has been suggested, I think, by the honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr.
Connolly), that the Official Receiver or Registrar in Bankruptcy should be used instead
of the Clerk of the Court. In Manitoba there
is only one registrar for the whole province,
but there are sixty-two county court clerks
throughout the province, all of whom are
officers of the court. Their accounts are under
the control of the Department of the Attorney
General and are audited each year. So it
would seem to me that this section providing
for the use of clerks would be of great advantage and also less expensive to those living
outside capital cities, although I must admit
that while the Manitoba Act was in force 90
per cent of the claims for consolidation were
from the city of Winnipeg.
In the last couple of weeks I have had the
opportunity of speaking to people in Manitoba about their experiences under the
Orderly Payment of Debts Act, and I found

out that from 1950 to December 1961 there
were on the average 49 cases per year, 90
per cent of which were in metropolitan Winnipeg. Also during that period the Welfare
Council of the Family Bureau of Greater
Winnipeg found that many of their clients
had gone on a spending spree and were in
desperate need of financial guidance, household budgeting, and so on, and the bureau
informed us that the Manitoba Act had been
of great help in solving some of these personal problems. Other welfare organizations
in the city, which dealt with similar problems
of people who belong mainly to the middleincome group, found that under the act the
court gave excellent service to those people
in such difficulties.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask the senator
a question? Under the Manitoba act was the
officer in charge of its administration a clerk
of the court, as is proposed by this measure?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the county court of
Winnipeg a deputy clerk was appointed for
the purpose of dealing only with cases under
the Orderly Payment of Debts Act.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The clerks in Manitoba
have some experience with regard to this
particular kind of legislation?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They have. And as 90 per
cent of the cases were in Winnipeg, the deputy
clerk was better qualified than were the clerks
in smaller towns.
I also found out in talking to our Attorney
General, the Honourable Sterling Lyon, and
his deputy, that they would welcome this legislation to replace the provincial act that has
been repealed.
The experience of the Attorney General's
department shows that many people in the
small-income bracket needed this act because
it protected the debtor from being harassed by
his creditors. It also prevented the debtor
from going further into debt because after
this consolidation order had been filed, any
person extending credit to that debtor without making a check did so at his own peril.
Therefore, many of these small-income insolvent debtors were prevented by reason of
the act from becoming a liability to the
province.
To sum up, I would say that this amendment, although it may not go as far as some
honourable senators have suggested-that is,
a complete revision of the Bankruptcy Actat least goes part way in helping a certain
section of the community. It is simple; it is
inexpensive; and it will help the unfortunate
insolvent to start afresh. There will be no
embarrassment; there will be no publicity
in the papers about an order being filed in
the Land Titles office or the Clerk's office.
It must, however, be remembered that all

NOVEMBER 7, 1962

parties must have good intentions, and the
creditors must be prepared to agree to share
the payments provided weekly, semi-monthly,
or monthly, and they must stop harassing
the debtor.
For those reasons I would vote for second
reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: May I ask a question?
In Quebec, and I understand it is the same
in Manitoba, the Bankruptcy Act is administered by the Registrar appointed by the
federal Government. Under this proposed
legislation I understand that in our province
a deputy prothonotary would take charge of
the application of these consolidation orders.
I am under the impression that this matter
would have been simplified if the Deputy
Registrar were the person in charge. Prothonotaries in the province of Quebec are
quite a different set of officers from those of
the Bankruptcy Court.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, these
amendments apply only to debts of certain
limitations. If the debts are larger, resort
must be had to the Bankruptcy Court. Section 173 provides that the Clerk of the Court
in the province of Alberta is the Clerk of
the District Court, and in the province of
Manitoba he is the Clerk of the County Court,
and that in any other province he is the Clerk
of the Court that is designated from time to
time by the regulations.
I do not know what would happen in the
province of Quebec, but in Manitoba the Clerk
of the County Court has experience in these
matters and has already done a satisfactory
job.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: In Quebec it is the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy that has jurisdiction, and it is the Registrar of the Superior

Court, instead of a Clerk of the Superior
Court, who looks after the administration of
the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I suggest that this
matter be further discussed when the bill is
before the committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Kinley, debate
adjourned.
NATO PARLIAMENTARIANS'
CONFERENCE

ATTENDANCE BY SENATORS
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I shall be absent from the Senate
for the next two weeks while I am attending
the meetings of the NATO Parliamentarians'
Conference in Paris. I wish to thank all honourable senators for making my attendance
possible.
During my absence the work of the Senate
from this side of the house will be directed
by the honourable senator from Kennebec

senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
I am sure all honourable senators will agree
with me when I say that I am very fortunate
in having two such wise and experienced
colleagues.
The Hon. the Speaker: On behalf of all
honourable senators I offer to the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), and other members of the
Senate who are attending this important conference in Paris, our very best wishes.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded by Hon. Mr. Fournier (MadawaskaRestigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, to complete what I said yesterday
in connection with the Prime Minister's bill
to enact an age limit for the retirement of

senators, may I quote what was said on March
14 by the then Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on the
occasion of paying tributes to the late Senator
Hardy. I quote:
It would appear that Father Time, as
usual, is rapidly reforming the Senateif that is the proper term to use in these
circumstances. There are now ten vacancies in the Senate, which no doubt will
be filled in due course, thus bringing in
ten fresh viewpoints.
Unfortunately other colleagues of ours have
died since that was said.
With regard to a distinctive Canadian flag,
the suggestion of the Government is to invite
the provinces to a conference for consultation
regarding the choice of a national flag and
other national symbols. A provincial conference will achieve no more success than did
the joint parliamentary committee that was
appointed a number of years ago to study
this question. It will be a second Tower of
Babel. The only way for Canada to have a
distinctive Canadian flag is for the present
Government to follow the example of the late
premier of Quebec and pass an order in
council to decide what kind of a flag we
should have. I stand by what I said yesterday;
you heard me, and I will not repeat it. This
is the only way we can have a national flag
right now, and the Government must know
that the accomplished fact is accepted by the
Canadian population.
Honourable senators, I have one thing more
to add. It is that the leaders of the parties
say that they all favour a distinctive national
flag-period! 30! They add nothing. We do
not know what they intend putting on the
flag, and unless they say what kind of flag
they want it is useless to repeat the same
banality.
I come now to the main point of my argument today, and it concerns one paragraph
of the Speech from the Throne. It reads:
My Government will ask you, as a significant step in rounding out the concept
of Confederation, to consider a resolution
to provide for the "repatriation" of the
Constitution of Canada and to invite the
concurrence of the provinces to this end.
We should start at the beginning, and remember that Confederation, the British North
America Act of 1867, was inspired by fear,
the fear of a Fenian invasion. Nothing that is
done out of fear can be well done because
it is done in a hurry. The Fathers of Confederation thought of Canadians, ranging
from children to men of seventy. I suggested to you, my honourable colleagues, to
get the Debates of Confederation and you will

NOVEMBER 8. 1962
see that I do not exaggerate. If you have
the books you may verify what I have said;
and if you have not, you have only to order
them from the Printing Bureau, with the
index, and you will see that I am exaggerating nothing.
If you will permit me, I shall now explain
to you the meaning of the questions which I
have put with regard to the respective powers of the Parliament of Canada and the
provincial legislatures with regard to marriage. That inquiry stood on the Order Paper
of this chamber for some weeks before the
dissolution of the last Parliament. I placed
the sane inquiry, containing the sane questions on the Order Paper again this session,
and it continued to appear for a few weeks
until it was answered by the Acting Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Choquette), at
page 168 of Senate Hansard.
The inquiry is an obvious one. In the first
place, it refers to the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada relating to marriage and divorce by virtue of
subsection 26 of section 91 of the British
North America Act, with the exception of
exclusive powers of provincial legislatures
to make laws for the solemnization of marriage, by virtue of subsection 12 of section
92 of the said act. It means, in simple language, that this Parliament can do certain
things that the provincial legislatures cannot do and, on the other hand, the provincial
legislatures can do certain things that this
Parliament has not the power to do, each
one functioning in its own field.
That enactment of the Constitution was
interpreted by the Privy Council in the year
1912, and I have given copies of this judgment to Your Honour and to both the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) and
the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt).
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the reference,
may I ask?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: The reference is to the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
in 1912 regarding marriage, and that judgment
has been confirmed by the Privy Council. The
text of the judgment appears in the Appeal
Cases for 1912, and in the Constitutional Cases
published by Mr. Richard Olmsted when Mr.
Garson was Minister of Justice. The judgment
of the Privy Council was delivered by Lord
Justice Haldane. It is quite long, and I do not
want to delay the house by reading it at this
stage, but I have given the reference.
In its decision the Privy Council decided
that all legislative powers concerning marriage and divorce had been given to the
Parliament at Ottawa by the Constitution, and
it was only by way of an exception that the

provincial legislatures had authority to
legislate exclusively only as to the solemnization of marriage. That is the decision. Some
further explanation is to be found there.
The first and second questions of my
inquiry read:
1. Did the Government receive any
formal request from any province or any
specific representation from any one to
the effect that the B.N.A. Act, 1867, should
be amended by repealing subsection (26)
of section 91 of the said act?
2. If so, from whom and when?
What I am going to say does not apply only
to the legislature of the province of Quebec.
It applies to all the legislatures of Canada
indiscriminately, because they are all on the
same footing. The first suggestion was that
because the legislatures had no power to
legislate upon this matter the only thing to do
was to suggest to the Government that it
request the British Parliament to amend the
Constitution so as to transfer the rights of
the federal Parliament respecting marriage
to the provincial legislatures.
Do I make myself clear in that? That was
the first suggestion. They could have said to
the legislatures: "You can legislate validly
if the Constitution is amended in order to
give you the power to legislate upon these
matters." What else is there to do?
The only way for the provinces to have
valid legislation amending the Quebec Civil
Code of 1866 is for the attorney generalsall of them-to come to Ottawa and ask the
Government of Canada to sponsor some
legislation amending the Civil Code, as it has
power to do except with respect to the
solemnization of marriage.
I wonder if you understand my language,
honourable senators. I am trying to be as
clear as possible, and if you desire to ask
questions I shall be delighted to answer them.
There are precedents for what is suggested.
The Canadian Parliament has already
amended not the Civil Code but the civil
law concerning in-laws, permitting brothersin-law to marry their sisters-in-law. That
was the subject of a long debate which lasted
two years from 1880 to 1882. The sponsor of
that amendment was Mr. Désiré Girourard,
who was afterwards appointed to the Bench
of the Supreme Court of Canada. He said that
he had a petition signed by hundreds of
women of Montreal who wanted to have
legislation passed by the federal Parliament
permitting brothers-in-law to marry their
sisters-in-law.
That was the purpose of the legislation
which is referred to in question number 3,
at page 167 of Senate Hansard of October 31

SENATE

last. Afterwards, that amendment was included in the Revised Statues of Canada.
Further legislation was passed in 1932 by
the Parliament of Canada in order to allow
sisters-in-law to marry their brothers-in-law,
in order to give equality of rights to women.
This can be found now in chapter 176 of
1952, being intituled "An Act respecting
Marriage and Divorce".
The question continues:
... did the Government of Canada
receive any specific representation or any
formal request from anyone to the effect
that the Parliament of Canada, in virtue
of the exclusive legislative authority conferred upon itself by subsection (26) of
section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, should repeal article 1301 of the Civil Code of the
Province of Quebec and the second paragraphs of articles 1265 and 1422 of the
said Code, and amend articles 179 and
180 of the said Code concerning the rights
of married women in the province of
Quebec?
4. If so, from whom and when?
That citation or reference comes from a resolution passed by the Young Liberals of Montreal, and published in Le Devoir of Monday,
October 27, 1958, in which they said that
those articles should be amended. They did
not realize that the province had no authority to pass that legislation.
What is more remarkable is that since
then there has been a change of Government
but no amendment bas been made to the
Civil Code with respect to marriage.
Of all the amendments which have been
passed with regard to marriage, only one
is valid. It is an article in the part concerning
the solemnization of marriage and it is about
notices for the marriage of Hebrews being
given on the Sabbath Day. That is all there
is. That amendment is valid because it concerns the solemnization of marriage.
I have a report here which I should read
to you, with your permission, or which I
could suggest be published as an appendix

my seat here that he ran away from Parliament in order to avoid answering my questions. It was so much the case that I then
asked an insignificant-it was bait-question,
about the number of Q.C.'s and K.C.'s appointed since Confederation. Authority was
given then to answer this question. There
were many such appointments, especially
during the reign of our Gracious Sovereign
the late Queen Victoria.
One point is very important. It is that the
then Minister of Justice authorized the
answer to that simple question, whereas
there was no authorization for any answer
to the other questions. Since then there bas
been a change in the head of the Department
of Justice. I saw the new minister and told
him what I have just told you. He was very
gracious with me and gave me the answer
that I suggested be given last session, when
I was fed up seeing my inquiry on the Order
Paper day after day.
Now we have the answer which has been
given, and which is mine. I have no copyright on it, unfortunately; otherwise I would
have charged a royalty for it. The answer is:
1. No.
2. Answered by No. 1.
3. No.
4. Answered by No. 3.

Honourable senators, do not laugh. It is a
very serious matter.
The present Minister of Justice never got
the same information as his predecessor, because I presume that the chief justices and
the attorneys general have not made any
representation to him. Therefore, if the first
incumbent of those high functions knew
about the intrigues which were made to
prevent the Government from answering my
questions, the other one did not; and so he
answered candidly: "No, no, I have no
information."
Now, if we are to repatriate the Constitution we should start from the beginning
and correct all the wrongs that it contains,
and there are many of them. I read this from
to the Debates of the Senate.
the Speech from the Throne:
Before I proceed further, I must tell you

Justice was busy electioneering and was not solve the question. How many times have
in his seat, so much so that I declared from my honourable colleagues who belong to the

NOVEMBER 8, 1962
legal fraternity heard that the distinction
between civil law and common law is that
civil law is found in principles written in a
code, and that common law is simply the
jurisprudence of the land; but when we
have jurisprudence that comes from the
highest tribunal and is ignored, then where
is common law? If you pay no attention to
the decisions of the justices of the peace, at
least you should take into consideration
the jurisprudence of the Privy Council. That
is my point.
Honourable colleagues, I wonder if you will
allow me to quote an authority on the matter-an able gentleman who was on the
Bench for more than 30 years, who was
Chief Justice of Canada for 10 years and
who was in charge of the revision of the
Civil Code of the province of Quebec. In his
letter he declares that the amendments to
the marriage part of the Civil Code are null
and void, except for one as aforesaid. Then
he goes further and says that the matrimonial covenants should be put before the
marriage part of the Civil Code, for the very
good reason that those covenants should be
anterior to the marriage, because they take
effect by the marriage; if there is no marriage, there is no covenant.
If honourable senators are interested in
the matter, I shall read the letter which was
sent by Chief Justice Rinfret, in his capacity
as a commissioner for the revision of the
Civil Code, that letter having been countersigned by a notary, Emile Delâge, Quebec
city, former President of the Chamber of
Notaries, province of Quebec, and by the
senator from De la Durantaye in his capacity
as special officer for the revision of the Civil
Code. We were partners. The letter, entitled,
"Introduction to the amendments to the Civil
Code of the province of Quebec" was sent
by the commissioner to the Prime Minister.
Shall I read it?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: You could put it on the
record.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Shal I have it appended
to the record, or shall I read it?

My dear Premier,
This morning, at a conference with the
special revision officers, Mr. Jean François Pouliot and Mr. Emile Delâge, N.P.,
strong doubts were raised concerning the
legality of the amendments passed by the
legislature as regards marriage, separation from bed and board and marriage
convenants.
It was represented that, with the exception of the 1903 amendment to article
130 C.C. for the publication of banns in
the case of persons belonging to the
Jewish faith, which forms part of chapter
entitled "Of the Formalities relating to
the Solemnization of Marriage", the sixteen other amendments respecting marriage and separation from bed and board
might be illegal and ultra vires.
Apparently, articles 145, 146 and 147
C.C., as well as articles 121, 125, 138, 170,
176, 177 and 180 C.C., which are part of
the Title of Marriage, would come exclusively under federal jurisdiction, and
not provincial jurisdiction, in ail matters
concerning amendments to the original
version of the 1866 Civil Code.
The same thing could be said of the
amendments to articles 188, 192, 193,
194, 210 and 217 C.C., which are part
of the Title of Separation from Bed and
Board.
Sub-section 26 of section 91 of the
British North America Act, 1867, gives
the federal Parliament an exclusive legislative authority on marriage and divorce;
on the other hand, ail that the same act
entrusted to provincial legislatures concerning marriage, under sub-section 12
of the following section 92, is the exclusive power to legislate in relation to
the "solemnization of marriage in the
province".
It was also represented, for the same
reasons, that the legislature has gone
beyond its powers in amending several
articles of the title "Of marriage covenants and of the effect of marriage upon
the property of the consorts."
If there were a basis for the serious
doubts thus raised, it would be the
original version of 1866 of those articles
amended by the legislature which would
remain in force, notwithstanding the subsequent amendments which would be
ultra vires, illegal and void.

SENATE
The articles concerning marriage, separation from bed and board and marriage
covenants are of such importance, from
the standpoint of the family, and are
such a delicate matter, that I consider it
my duty to inform you of the objections
of a strictly legal nature which were
raised against the amendments passed by
the legislature in these matters.
Sub-section 21, section 91, of the B.N.A.
Act bestows exclusive legislative authority
on the Parliament of Canada in all
matters pertaining to bankruptcy and
insolvency; on the other hand, the exclusive powers of provincial legislatures
to make laws in relation to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects,
under paragraph 11 of section 92 of that
act, would permit to consider as legal the
provisions of section 1892 of the Civil
Code concerning the dissolution of the
company through bankruptcy, and of sections 371 and following of the Civil Code,
with regard to the forced and voluntary
liquidation of companies.
Such objections have not been raised
to the many amendments made to other
parts of the Civil Code, of which Mr.
Pouliot has drawn a complete list. In
addition, he indicated the source and
effect of each amendment on every
amended section of the Civil Code. The
transcription of the French version of
those amended sections is completed and
that of the English version is almost
finished.
Subject to the above-mentioned reservations, it remains for us to point out
which sections must be removed from the
Civil Code because they come under
federal jurisdiction as, for instance, those
pertaining to citizenship and naturalization, to maritime law, to commercial law,
etc., before making the necessary corrections required by the Civil Code revision
act, to every section of the Civil Code
amended or not, of which a great number
will have to be made also to the Code of
Civil Procedure.

If I may be permitted, honourable senators,
I shall read to you another document which
was signed by my partner, as a special officer,

Notary Emile Delâge. I shall read it in French
and it too will be translated in Hansard.
(Translation):
"In the course of the legal studies we
made over a period of years for the revision of the Civil Code of the province
of Quebec, we noticed, not without some
amazement, a general and complete lack
of interest in the close relationship that
exists between constitutional law and the
law in all other fields.
As special officers, we worked in cooperation with the Right Honourable
Thibaudeau Rinfret, C.R., former Chief
Justice of Canada, who revised the Civil
Code and who was the first to point out
to the government of the province of
Quebec the inadequacy of the amendments made by the legislature to several
articles of the Civil Code.
His letter of December 23, 1958 to the
Premier and Attorney General is based
on the crystal-clear text of the Constitution of 1867, as interpreted by the Privy
Council's jurisprudence. That is an official document which is the property of
the province of Quebec. I fail to understand why it has never been produced in
the legislative assembly because we feel
that this warning is probably the greatest
service the former Chief Justice of Canada did for the Canadian people and,
especially, for his compatriots of the
province of Quebec.
While we were working on the revision
of the Civil Code, we never felt for a
minute that we were working for any
provincial government in particular. We
just simply carried out our legal searches
conscientiously and objectively for the
benefit of the province of Quebec, in
the hope that sooner or later our efforts
would be of some use.
Finally, it is because we are firmly
convinced that law, as any other science,
has a relative degree of truth that one
cannot overlook, that we take the liberty
of calling to your attention the enclosed
letter which Chief Justice Rinfret wrote
to Dr. Duplessis, on December 23, 1958,
and the decision handed down by the
Privy Council, in 1912, and which defines the respective jurisdictions of the
federal Parliament and of the provincial
legislatures on the question of marriage,
both jurisdictions being exclusive.

NOVEMBER 8, 1962
(Text):
In order to familiarize my honourable colleagues with what I have read, it is that that
report belongs not to the Government of the
province of Quebec, but to the province of
Quebec and therefore it is important that it
should be made public.
My reason for complaint is that after that
report was made, according to the Montreal
Star of November 18, 1961, the present Attorney General of the province of Quebec
stated:
The old commission, named by the
National Union regime, failed to produce
a report.
That is untrue. The reports were there, and
at one time I sent by Canadian Pacific Express
a duplicate of the reports. I have the receipts
here. The parcel weighed nineteen pounds
and was nearly three feet high. The reports
were received by the Prime Minister of Quebec, who acknowledged them, and I appreciate that fact, and they were received by
the Attorney General who says that he received nothing. It was untrue with regard
to the Rinfret Commission established to revise the Civil Code, as it was untrue for the
commission presided over by the late Mr.
Auguste Desilets of Grand'Mère to revise the
Code of Civil Procedure.
Now, the point is this: certain people are
supposed to look after the revision of the
Civil Code, but they have no power to touch
the marriage part of the Civil Code. What
I say applies to the Pratte Commission for
the Revision of the Code of Civil Procedure,
as it also applies to the Nadeau Commission
for the Revision of the Civil Code.
We must face the facts as they are. The
jurisprudence exists. It is as clear as crystal
water, and there is positively no reason to
ignore it. But it has been ignored, not only
by the Department of the Attorney General of
the province of Quebec but by authors on
the civil law. If you examine the last book
published by Mr. Walter Johnson of Montreal, which is the second edition of his Conflict of Laws-a book about four inches thick
containing some 1,300 pages-you will find
that the only reference with regard to that
most important judgment of the Privy
Council is the reference to it in the index,
which refers to the Supreme Court only, and
the same quotation is in small type in a footnote to the text. He gives one no idea at all
as to what the judgment was, because had
he done so it would have destroyed most of
his book. Despite that, at the last convocation
of McGill University he was awarded an
honorary degree in law.
Mr. Johnson is not the only one. There is
also a gentleman named J. G. Castel, profes-

sor at Osgoode Hall who writes on the civil
laws of the province of Quebec. He has
ignored that jurisprudence completely. He
wrote an article in a recent issue of the
periodical Revue du Barreau, in which he
speaks about Quaestio Famosissima-themost
famous question-something that happened
during the renaissance four hundred years ago.
When I saw that I was very anxious to know
what it was. In fact, it is a matter of no importance at all, but he made it famous. He
repeated what was said at the time about
something that was insignificant, but the
main thing he does not mention. Those two
works are not worth a picayune. I am sorry
to say that, but they ignore facts that should
be known by all lawyers.
What about the university professors who
are responsible for teaching the law on marriage? With very few exceptions, their mortarboards should be changed for asses' caps.
They are pompous and they are supposed to
teach the law, but they make subtle distinctions of no importance at all, and when it
comes to the matters of great importance
they are not there.
Honourable colleagues, I have said enough.
I hope that the law will become a science
in Canada, just as it was at the time of
Cicero, 2,000 years ago. We have a lot of
work to do, but we have to revert to fundamentals. The trouble is that the teaching of
law in most of our universities is superficial,
which makes it most difficult for the students
as well as the practitioners.
Honourable colleagues, I thank you for
having listened to what I had to say about
this important matter. My purpose in bringing it before you is to plead for good and
sound legislation-legislation that will not be
attacked before the courts as being unconstitutional, legislation that will serve its
proper purpose. I hope that in future those
responsible for redrafting the Constitution
will remedy all the wrongs presently to be
found in it.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, debate
adjourned.
BANKRUPTCY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Higgins for the second reading of Bill S-2,
to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
while the amendments contained in the bill
now before the house for second reading are
meritorious, I think all will agree they are
not extensive or far-reaching so far as the
Bankruptcy Act as a whole is concerned.

SENATE
However, they deal with the personal relations and financial obligations of individuals,
and as such are important. The bill embraces
those in the salary and wage groups who
are not engaged in trade and business. People
in this category can get into difficulty because
of sickness, misfortune or prodigality; and
this legislation is designed to help those who
find themselves in such circumstances. It does
not create an easy way out. The debtor must
make himself subject to discipline, and must
be subject to the direction and control of the
.authority constituted to administer the act.
In the three years that he can take advantage
of the provisions of this legislation I think
he will learn that the old-fashioned virtue
,of living within one's means is salutary and
good.
Thus far only honourable senators with
legal training have participated in this debate.
That is natural, because the Bankruptcy Act
is a highly specialized piece of legislation
dealing with commerce. Because of their
training and experience, the lawyers in this
chamber should lead and direct us in matters
of this kind. I believe we have splendid
legal talent in the Senate. During the long
time that I have been in Ottawa I have
always had great respect for the distinguished
lawyers in the Senate. I believe we still
have honourable senators of outstanding legal
ability and that they are at their best in the
Senate, because here they pursue no special
interests-at least, they are supposed to have
none-and so speak with conviction. Thus
we know they are doing their best to help
us formulate laws that are in the best interests of the nation.
As a senator and businessman who has
been in industry all my life, it is a privilege
to be a member of the Senate and to be able
to listen to and participate in debates among
such able men. My experience as a member
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce has been a valuable lesson to me.
It is a school where every honourable senator
makes himself better equipped, even for the
business world.
Speaking generally, I think bankruptcy is
a most disturbing subject to have to deal
with. We who are in the field of commerce
must live with it, and it is always a hazard.
The road to achievement and success in the
business world is beset with lions, and these
lions are to be found even in the market place,
ready to destroy the weak and those who are
not strong or alert enough to maintain their
place in the face of competition.
This bill is simple and readily understood.
Its purpose is to correct abuses in the handling
of small estates. Much has been said about
such abuses, although we may hear more
about them in committee. There was criticism

with regard to the trustee, and some senators
were not satisfied with the way the trustee
might handle the details of situations coming
under his control.
I do not think any mention has been made
about the question of high overhead costs,
and the arrangement whereby time limits can
be set for the making of payments, but when
these costs get to be too high they can be
quite a burden. If this bill succeeds in lowering the overhead costs it will achieve something greatly to be desired.
There is in this bill provision for dealing
with debts not in excess of $1,000. I presume
that means $1,000 for each individual item.
There is another clause providing the procedure for dealing with future debts totalling
more than $200 while the debtor is in the
charge of a trustee appointed under this bill.
Section 175, subsection 2, of the bill says:
Upon an application pursuant to subsection (1), the debtor shall file an affidavit setting forth the following:
(c) the amount of his income from all
sources, naming them, and where he is
married the amount of income of his wife
from all sources, naming them;
(d) his business or occupation, and that
of his wife, if any, and the name and
address of his employer and of his wife's
employer.
It seems to me that this is something new,
and I do not know the significance of it, but
apparently the clerk must present that affidavit with his report. I think in committee we
should study that feature.
During the splendid debate we have had
on this bill there has been some criticism
as to whether the Clerk of the Court was the
proper person to be appointed, and to have
what was termed so much power in connection with administering this legislation. Well,
I think the Clerk of the Court is a proper
person to place in this position, and because he
is a permanent official he will handle all the
cases and he will have no favourites. All the
instruments of the court will pass through
his hands, judgments, writs, and so on, and
he is in close contact with the Registrar of
Deeds. I do not know of any man in a rural
community better equipped to fulfil these
functions than the Clerk of the Court. I know
there may be a difference in the significance
of the measure as applied to rural and to
urban communities. But this is an enabling
bill, and we in Nova Scotia need only accept
it if we so wish. However, I think the
Prothonotary or the Clerk of the Court is
the person best suited to discharge these
duties. From the point of view of economy, he
is not a highly-paid servant, he has a government office, and a little help, and if there

NOVEMBER 8, 1962
should be additional payment for these
services hie would welcorne if. Furthermore,
hie is always there, and the people know this.
The honourable senator frorn River Heights
(Hon. Mr. Haig), speaking yesterday, said
that the procedure provided for by this bill
worked well in Manitoba, and hie had found
that the Clerk of the Court was doing an
efficient job.
Another crîticism raised was that the Clerk
of the Court was not always a lawyer. For the
most part hie is in the cities. I know the clerk
in Halifax is a lawyer, but I ar n ot quite
certain about Sydney or the rural districts.
Anyway, even if he is not a iawyer, and if the
case is of any considerable size, there wili be
a sufficient; number of lawyers hovering
around to give advice and there sbould be no
problem in this regard.
It is said that the clerk in this capacity
would have too much authority. Weli, it is
like making up a budget. The budget is
made Up and we ail talk about it afterwards
-I think that is a good way of doing It Mfter
the application is made, an affidavit is filed,
he makes a consolidation order, and lie cails
everybody in. There is always the opportunity to appeal bis decision to the Court.
I consider that the Clerk of the Court is a
proper person for the job, and I arn mucli in
favour of the bill as it stands.
.The bigger cities may have some question
about this, but they are already pretty well
equipped to look after this work. Moreover,
we have heard from. the honourable senator
from River Hleiglits; as to how well it lias
worked In Manitoba.
This is an enabling bill, and it would appear to me that it is introduced to do what
I might cail a salvaging job for Manitoba
and Alberta. 1 think it will do a good salvaging job and it may be that many of the other
provinces wiil also accept it, although they
do flot have to. The attorney general of each
province can consider ifs application. Speaking for my own province of Nova Scotia, I
know it bas always been a place of wisdom
so far as jurisprudence is concerned and,
having considered the bill, the authorities
tliere can decide wlietber they really want
if or not. Speaking for myseif, I would pref er the Clerk of the Court to be the officer
wlio bas charge of administration.
I heard the lionouirabie senator from St.
John's East (Hon. Mr. Higgins) say that a
revision of the Bankruptcy Act was in contemplation for the near future. I might Mention that I was a member of the Standing
Comrnuttee on Banking and Commerce in 1949
when tbe act was last considered, and I think
the commlttee at that time did an excellent
job.
27511-5-15

To the new senators I say that they wiil
soon corne to learn the value of work done
by tbe standing committees of the Senate.
I have been in public if e for more than fortyfive years, and I do not tbink I have corne
across a committee anywhere that does as
good a job as do the standing committees of
the Senate of Canada.
However, honourable senators, it was
thirteen years ago that we revîewed the
Bankruptcy Act. They have been busy years,
years during which mucli bas bappened and
we bave learned mucb. We bave learned
much about credit, business, taxation, rnechanization and transport, and it seems to me
that wben we corne to consider the Bankruptcy Act we shall bave a great deal to
consider.
I mentioned a few minutes ago the expense of bankruptcy procedures. It is necessary to keep expenses as small as possible
in bankruptcies involving smail amounts of
money. The matters covered by these amendments are not really bankruptcies. The debtor
keeps out of the bankruptcy court by going
through these varîous proceedings. He is in
a mucb safer position. He knows that if he
does not obtain the benefits of tbis procedure
lie May be in a worse position in a f ew
years' time.
It is my opinion that wben a percentage
is used in reference to an amount of money
it is a deceptive terni. There is nothing specific in saying that an officiai gets 10 per cent
or 15 per cent. Sometimes the total amount
is large, and sometimes it is very small.
That is an extravagant way of calculating
these arnounts, and there should be a different way of doing it.
Even under this bill, creditors wlio bave
a mortgage or a judgment will stili want
interest on it. The state aiso wi want
interest. There wifl be some people wbo
are ciever enough to get a note froin tbe
debtor, on which they will w-ant Interest, but
there are many creditors who get nothing of
this kind.
It seems to me that in considering these
matters we should thlnk about deferring
interest until the end of the proceedings. I do
not like ail these preferred dlaims. The whole
system shouid be changed a littie to make it
iess easy for some creditors to get on the
inside wîth a preferred dlaim.
This week I have heard a lot about debtfree money-whatever that might meanand I do not know a better place to start
debt-free rnoney than under tlie Bankruptcy
Act. Debt-free money and bankruptcy go
together. As things are, there might be no
money lef t at the end of ail these proceedings,
and in that case the creditors will flot get
their interest. That would be salutary. If a

SENATE
creditor is lucky enough to get his money
he should feel pleased about it and he would
probably forgive the interest. After a period
of three years interest mounts up and it
means a lot of money to a poor debtor. It is
my opinion that if these proceedings could
be streamlined so that the overhead is smaller
and the red tape is less, and the whole thing
conducted in a businesslike way, all persons
involved would benefit. If the liquidation of
an estate is involved, the sale should not be
made in too much of a hurry, and a competent person should be placed in charge so
that the most is obtained frorn it.
Bankruptcy is a terrible thing for business
in Canada. It is bad for the citizen and it is
bad for the country. Apparently, casualties
in business are rife; we have been told here
of the thousands of failures in Canada. I
might mention that there are not many in
the place from which I come. I cannot
remember when we last had a real failure
in my own community, and I think that is
a wholesome situation.
It should be remembered that these unfortunate people who drive ahead without the
exercise of wisdom are always going to get
themselves into trouble, and if they keep on
we shall always have bankruptcies, which are
disastrous and mean a sorry end to any man
in business. I have always taken the view
that a businessman should so arrange his
affairs that he shows progress with stability.
That is the way we were taught to do things,
and we have been quite successful.
It is my opinion that when the Bankruptcy
Act comes before Parliament for revision
there will be many matters to consider so far
as the economy and business of Canada is
concerned.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Brooks, bill referred

Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF
CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. Harry A. Willis, for Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, moved the second reading of Bill
S-12, to incorporate Allstate Life Insurance
Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill to incorporate Allstate Life Insurance
Company of Canada.
The Allstate Life Insurance Company in
the United States is wholly owned by SearsRoebuck & Company, and in an arrangement
made some years ago between Sears-Roebuck

& Company and Simpsons-Sears Limited
there was an undertaking to have this company incorporated in Canada.
The late Senator Brunt moved in this
house in 1960 the second reading of a bill to
incorporate Allstate Insurance Company of
Canada to sell accident, sickness and automobile insurance. Allstate Life Insurance Company of Canada will be empowered, if incorporated, to sell life insurance in Canada.
The Allstate Life Insurance Company of
the United States received a licence to sell
life insurance in Canada in August, 1960.
It commenced business in Canada in June of
1961 and since that time has written over
$15 million worth of business. I do not know
that I can say more than that.
Two of the incorporators are very well
known in this chamber. One is a prince of
commerce in Canada, Edgar Gordon Burton,
President of Robert Simpson and Company.
Another is Norman Currie Urquhart who is
an industrialist and philanthropist of Toronto,
Past-President of the Canadian Red Cross
Society and currently Chairman of the Toronto General Hospital Board of Trustees.
Naturally Simpsons-Sears will have an
interest in this company doing business in
Canada.
I think the bill will be fully explained if
it is sent by this chamber to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. If there are
any questions, I should be glad to answer
them.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable senator
from Peel (Hon. Mr. Willis) mentioned SearsRoebuck & Company operating in 1960. Did
they sell life insurance in Canada without
permission or did they get a licence to
operate here?
Hon. Mr. Willis: What I said was that when
the late Senator Brunt from Hanover introduced a bill in 1960, it was with regard
to the Allstate Insurance Company operating
in Canada at that time for the purpose of
handling certain classes of insurance exclusive of life insurance.
Hon. Mr. Emerson: Does that mean there
will be two companies, the Allstate Life
Insurance Company and the Allstate Accident
Insurance Company?
Hon. Mr. Willis: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator give the names of the other directors?
Are the two he mentioned to be directors of
the company?
Hon. Mr. Wilis: Yes, the two mentioned
are to be directors. There are John Atkinson,
insurance executive, and Gordon McCalla
Graham, merchant. I do not know these men
personally, and therefore I did not refer to

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 8, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Haig, seconded by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Lionel Choquelie: Honourable senators, I am glad to be the first to have the
opportunity this evening to welcome our new
senator, the Honourable Jacques Flynn, to
this chamber. Because of his considerable
experience as a former Cabinet Minister, I
know he will make an excellent contribution
to the Canadian Senate.
(Translation):
On behalf of al the honourable senators,
whether they are present or absent, and
whether they are Conservatives or Liberals, I
welcome the new senator.
(Text):
In rising to speak on this motion for an
address in reply to the Speech from the Throne
may I, before proceeding to the substance of
my remarks, make reference to some of the
important changes which have taken place
in the organization of this chamber. My first
words must be of congratulation and welcome
to His Honour the Speaker. Senator White
is a man of vast experience in the ways

of Parliament. He was first elected to the
House of Commons in 1940, and re-elected in
the general elections of 1945, 1949, 1953 and
1957. This gives a clear and concise picture
of what his constituents thought of him.
In 1957 he was the first appointee to the
Senate by the newly-elected administration,
and events of the time since have shown that
the choice was a good one. Popular with his
colleagues on both sides of the house, our new
Speaker will, I am confident, bring further
distinction to his high office. We look forward,
Sir, to continuing the important work of the
Senate with you as its presiding officer.
Having said that, honourable senators, may
I add my word of appreciation of the splendid
contribution made to the Senate by his predecessor in office, the Honourable Mark Drouin.
I have said on previous occasions that Senator
Drouin, as presiding officer of this body, constantly added lustre both to his office and
to the Senate, whether he was presiding over
our deliberations or representing us beyond
these walls during two successive parliaments. Accordingly, we all rejoice in his recent
appointment to the Privy Council of Canada.
Let me be one of the first to refer to him as
the Honourable Mark Drouin, P.C.
Honourable senators, I do not wish this
tribute to lapse into an obituary. Senator
Drouin, young in years and in spirit, is still
with us in the Senate, and we look forward
to many years of co-operation with him in
the pursuit of our constitutional duties.
May I refer next to the newly-appointed
Leader of the Government in the Senate, the
Honourable Alfred Brooks, P.C., who is
unusually rich in parliamentary experience.
He was elected to the Legislature of the
province of New Brunswick in 1925. He was
first elected to the House of Commons in
1935 and was re-elected at every subsequent
general election until his appointment to the
Senate in 1960. Needless to say, and as all
honourable senators know, the honourable
Leader was a most distinguished member of
the cabinet as Minister of Veterans Affairs
from 1957 to 1960. He is thus highly experienced in the art of piloting legislation through
Parliament and, in addition, is a man of
uncommon courtesy and patience. His leadership of this house will be, I am sure, in the
highest traditions of this important office.
Honourable senators, I cannot let this
opportunity pass without paying a muchdeserved tribute to Senator Brooks' predecessor in office, the Honourable Walter M. Aseltine, P.C. Senator Aseltine's period of service
as Leader of the Government was not an
easy one, but he proceeded about his duties
in a co-operative, efficient and eminently
fair manner which won the admiration of
all senators on both sides of this house. He

NOVEMBER 13, 1962
was not spectacular. He did not pound the
table to get things done. He incurred no
enmities. The Senate and the country itself
owes him a considerable debt of gratitude,
and this is reflected in the esteem and affectionate regard in which he is held.
Here again, the tribute should not be
allowed to lapse into an obituary. Senator
Aseltine is very much with us. His active
mind, breadth of view and wise counsel will
continue to afford the Senate much aid and
comfort in the years to come.
Honourable senators, change is part of the
nature of things and we must accept it realistically, but everything, I am glad to say,
has not changed. There has been no change
in the leadership of the Opposition in this
house. The Honourable W. Ross Macdonald,
P.C., like Tennyson's brook, seemingly goes
on forever. I believe that those on the other
side of the chamber and, indeed all honourable senators, have been singularly fortunate
in having as Leader of the Opposition a man
of such quality of mind and heart. We look
forward to the future with anticipation in
the knowledge that, though skirmishes may
occur, the proceedings will be conducted on
the high level which has characterized the
deliberations of the Senate in the past.
Honourable senators, having said a number of nice things about the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) may I add one more. I
wish to say that I agreed with everything
he said in his lengthy speech at the beginning of the session, except in his expressions
of criticism of the Government and in his
pessimism about the fate of the nation. That
is to say, I agreed with about 5 per cent of
what he said.
There is no need to answer him in either
kind or detail. That has been done most
effectively by the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) and other
speakers on this side of the chamber. May I
simply say that I retain the utmost confidence
in the future of this country, in the good
faith and capacity of the present administration, and in the leadership of the Right
Honourable John Diefenbaker. Given a fair
opportunity, the Government wil overcome
the present temporary exchange difficulties,
as, indeed, it is overcoming them now, and
will lead the country into the economic abundance which is its manifest destiny. May I
add this, that I interpret the results of the
general election in a way quite different from
the interpretation placed upon them by the
honourable Leader of the Opposition. The
people may well have felt that the Government had too great a majority, an "embarrassment of riches," and as a consequence
the pendulum swung further in the other

direction than the electorate really intended.
They re-elected the Government, but with
a minority of members. This was a slight
miscalculation that the electorate is not likely
to make again.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: They did not elect a
Liberal government, but they came much
closer to it than they intended.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That will be corrected
too.
Hon. Mr. Choque±e: Honourable senators,
history has a way of repeating itself. Mr.
Diefenbaker had a minority Government in
1957. The people rectified that in 1958. Mr.
Diefenbaker has a minority government,
though a stronger one, now; and in the next
general election the people will rectify this in
the same way as before, by re-electing the
present administration with a clear working
majority.
It seems to me that the Prime Ministerand indeed the Government which he headshas gained added prestige throughout the
country by the manner in which he has
conducted public affairs since the opening
of the present Parliament. The difficulties
with which he is beset are manifest to everyone, and I venture to suggest that the party
which he leads, and to which I belong, is
the only one with a clean bill of health,
judging from parliamentary performances to
date.
Honourable senators, while I am still in a
reflective mood, may I with the deepest
respect, make mention of His Excellency
Major General Georges P. Vanier, D.S.O.,
Governor General of Canada, and of the
Right Honourable Vincent Massey, his immediate predecessor as Her Majesty's personal representative in Canada. I am sure
that we all have been impressed by the dignified and charming manner in which the
new Governor General, ever since his appointment by Her Majesty, has carried on his
official duties; and we have all been equally
impressed and charmed by the gracious
chatelaine who is by his side. Rideau Hall
is in distinguished hands and Canada is
indeed well served.
I am moved also to pay tribute to his
immediate predecessor, the Right Honourable
Vincent Massey who, after a lifetime of
service to his country, became our first nativeborn Governor General of Canada and who
served us in that capacity with great distinction for almost a decade of our history.
Recently a native-born Canadian of French
speaking origin has succeeded one of English
speaking origin in the high office of Governor
General. My object in mentioning this is not

SENATE
to speculate on whether or not a precedent is
being established, to the effect that Canadians
of French and English origin are invariably
to succeed each other in that high office. The
history of Canada is as yet far too short for
any far-reaching conclusions to be drawn in
this regard. It is clear, however, that we are
capable of producing, within the boundaries
of Canada, persons of whatever racial origin
who have the accomplishments and talents
necessary to act with dignity and ability as
the Queen's personal representative in Canada.
Honourable senators, I propose to take
advantage of the latitude which is traditionally accorded during this debate. Accordingly,
I shall not speak at length of all matters
adverted to in the Speech from the Throne
itself. These matters will come before us
seriatim as the legislative program proceeds,
and as the details come before us we will be
better able to deal with them at that time. I
feel constrained to comment, however briefly,
on several of the matters touched upon in the
Speech from the Throne. The first of these is
the matter of what has been called, rather
inaccurately, the "repatriation" of the Constitution of Canada.
At present, in respect of matters which are
of exclusive concern to the provinces, or of
common concern to the provinces and the
federal authority, any amendment to the
Constitution of Canada must be enacted in the
same way as the British North America Act
was itself enacted, namely, by an Act of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is true
that, by an amendment to the British North
America Act in 1949, constitutional amendments in matters of purely federal concern
may be dealt with now by the Canadian
Parliament without reference either to the
provinces or to Westminster. It is equally true
that the British Parliament, under established
practice, will amend the Canadian Constitution only if it is requested to do so by an
address from both houses of the Parliament
of Canada, and that it will invariably do so
on receipt of such a request. The unpalatable
fact remains, that in all matters of provincial
or federal-provincial concern-other than
the revision of provincial constitutions-the
United Kingdom Parliament is the only body
with legal power to amend the Constitution
of Canada.
Some have said that the situation is intolerable. I would not wish to go that far,
since we have in fact tolerated it for almost
a hundred years. However, I do suggest that
it is unpalatable to most Canadians. It is also
indicative of political immaturity and is
entirely misleading abroad, except to the few
who have a specialized knowledge of our
constitutional machinery. Furthermore, there

is every evidence that the United Kingdom
Parliament would willingly, and indeed
gladly, forego its inglorious role of mere
"recorder" in relation to Canadian constitutional amendment.
The St. Laurent administration took an
initiative in this regard some years ago: this
was commendable enough, but the conversations ended in frustration and were not
resumed. I am delighted that the matter was
not allowed to rest there, and I welcome, as
I am sure all honourable senators do, the
renewed and enthusiastic initiative exhibited
by the present Government. I hope that any
remaining differences of view-and I understand these are now very few-will be reconciled in a spirit of "sweet reasonableness",
and that our Constitution will, in its entirety,
soon be domiciled in Canada.
Perhaps I should now deal jointly with the
questions of a distinctive Canadian flag and
a national anthem for Canada. Some may say
that we are getting on quite nicely, thank
you, that the demand for these things is
impractical or idealistic, and that their realization would, in any event, "butter no
parsnips". On the other hand, there are very
few countries in the world that lack these
indicia of national identity; and it seems to
me evident that Canada, having in mind its
growing prestige and boundless future, should
not much longer be without these important
symbols. It is true that with regard to at
least one of these projects-that of a national
flag-efforts were made by the previous administration to reach an agreement on an
acceptable design, but these efforts also ended
in frustration. However, as I remarked earlier
in respect of constitutional amendment, I do
not believe that a philosophy of futility
should be adopted in respect of any of these
projects. The search for a solution or an
accommodation should not be abandoned, but
pursued with renewed vigour and determination.
In so saying, I must introduce a caveat.
The Fathers of Confederation had, it is true,
an ideal of Canadian unity, but it was an
ideal of unity in diversity. The proud complex
which is now Canada would not have come
into being without the fullest assurance that
the traditions, cultures and special interests
of the founding provinces, and particularly
those of the two founding races, would not
be jeopardized but allowed to reach full
flower. This may be called the "grand
strategy" of Confederation. We must not
forget this strategy, or fail to remember that
as times and conditions change it will be
necessary to change our tactics so that they
will be in conformity therewith.

NOVEMBER 13, 1962

Accordingly, the projects for a national flag
and anthem cannot, or at any rate should not,
come into fruition unless the end products
are acceptable to an overwhelming body of
opinion from all parts of Canada, and in
particular to both French-speaking and
English-speaking Canadians. To regard this
end as impossible is to take an unduly dim
view of the ingenuity and viability of the
citizens of Canada. For one, I cannot believe
that the difficulties with which we are confronted in the years immediately preceding
1967 are more formidable than those with
which the authors of Confederation were
faced in the years immediately preceding
1867.
I would not, perhaps, be so exercised by
these three problems were it not for the fact
that Canada will shortly celebrate one hundred years of Confederation. Again, I welcome the initiative of the present Government
in making appropriate and early plans for
the celebration of this historie event. And
still I wonder whether the erection of physical structures or monuments, the holding of
parades, or the promotion of spectaculars
would be enough to mark the occasion suitably. Could we not, in the time remaining,
reach substantial agreement in the three directions I have mentioned? Indeed, could not
these three happy eventualities be timed to
come into effect on the very centenary of
Confederation?
In conclusion, honourable senators, may
I make brief reference to the kind and encouraging remarks which have been made
concerning the fact that I am now sitting
at the immediate right of the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks). I am now
in the place formerly occupied by the late
Senator Bill Brunt. The deserved tributes
which have already been paid to his memory
indicate the great difficulty anyone would
have in following in his competent footsteps.
All I can say, in expressing my thanks for
your felicitations, is that I will do my utmost
to carry out my assigned tasks in a manner
acceptable to all honourable senators.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators,
in speaking in this debate I should like my
first words to be of congratulations on the
appointment of His Honour the Speaker. As
most honourable senators know, our new
Speaker and I are old friends, and it seems
to me that we must be good friends because
we wear well. As time goes on and we are
given more opportunity of knowing each
other better the result seems to be a closer
friendship.
I have had His Honour with me as a
travelling companion. A test of real friendship used to be whether a man was a good
enough friend to take on a fishing trip. I
believe the modern version of that, in this

age of jet travel, is whether he is a good
enough friend to take on a trip around the
world. And I have found him to be just that
kind of friend.
Most of us know that His Honour the
Speaker is a veteran of the First World War.
He enlisted as a teenager. He and I sat quite
close together in the House of Commons some
years ago, and although we were not on the
same side of politics we happened to be
on the same side of the house. Those were

the days of the Liberal rump, and I got to
know him fairly well. My observation was
that he was a very fair Conservative. When
he spoke in the bouse he spoke with
moderation and he always had something to
say. That was particularly true when he was

speaking on veterans' affairs, a subject which
he approached and dealt with most effectively.
As was pointed out yesterday by my friend

the honourable

senator from Ottawa East

NOVEMBER 14. 1962
<Hon. Mr. Choquette), His Honour the
Speaker is the fortunate possessor of a most
charrning chatelaine who, we know, adds
grace wherever she goes to the dignity which
he demonstrates in the performance of his
duty.
I shouid like to add just one more expression of esteem of our new Speaker. He is a
modest man and I wouid flot wish to embarrass hlm, but there are some things wbich
should be said and piaced on the record.
Perhaps the most remarkable evidence of
his desire ta serve us and the high office he
holds is the diligent effort he is making in
the use of the French language. I have heard
tributes paid to him-two of them oniy
today-by some of aur French-speaking coilleagues regarding his efforts in this regard.
Ail of us have noted that on two of our
three sitting days a week, His Honour reads
opening prayers in the French language. Sorne
may have wondered why he does so, for we
recognize that it would be rnuch easier for
hlm to do otherwise. I arn sure many of our
colleagues are appreciative .of bis efforts to
improve bis facility in la belle langue; and
I think that is why he prefers to read the
French version of the prayers on two of the
three sitting days.
Honourable senators, I know this debate
is a freewbeeling one, but I do flot expect
ta wbeel very far or very fast today. I should
like, however, ta take the opportunity of
saying a word or twa about the new Leader
of the Government in the Senate, the honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks).
Senator Brooks is another aid frîend of mine
from House of Commons days and one whose
name was familiar ta many of us before we
appeared on tbe Ottawa scene. He bas joined
aur ranks naw, and after a very short career
in this chamber he bas attained a command
position. May I say ta him. that his personai
friends rejoice in bis good fortune of recent
years. Mfter twenty-two years af discouragement in opposition the apportunity came ta
hirn ta learn for himseif just how difficuit
a task it is-and I arn serious about this-to
govern this country. It is wonderful that at
ieast for a short period in bis career bie bas
the opportunity ta be positive rather than
negative in discussing public matters.
Honourabie senators, 1 understand tbat
November 14 is a particular date in the life
of the honourable Leader. May I be the first
one publiciiy to wish bim many happy returns
of the day.
I would be remiss if I did not say something
concerning the honourable Leader's predecessor in office, Honourable Walter M. Aseitine.
I hope he wiil enjoy bis release from the
worry of the bigb office he heid for the past

few sessions. I wish ta pay him. a tribute for
the manner in wbicb he conducted the business of the bouse while he was the Leader
of the Government in the Senate. H1e was
efficient in the Government's interests, but
he was also kind and considerate ta ail of
us in this chamber during bis tenure of office.
I have personal. remembrances of those qualities, which I shail always retain.
Honourable senators, I also wish ta make
reference ta the mover (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
tbe seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier, MadawaskaRestigouche> of the address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne. Traditionaily,
the mover and seconder expect and do receive
tbe congratulations of allier senators who
speak in this debate. However, realizing that
the seconder is a feilow Maritimer, I extend
ta hîm first my warm congratulations. I.
feel warm-bearted ta ail Maritiniers. I do
not attach too mucb significance ta the fact
that I put the seconder first. 1 arn particulariy
glad ta make reference ta the mover of the
address (Hlon. Mr. Haig), because he is the
son of one who was with us for a long Urne
and whom we shall always miss. The
speeches of the mover and seconder were
good ones for severai reasons, perhaps not
the ieast being their brevity, a quality which
is always popular in this or any other chaniber, perbaps inciuding the church one
attends. These speakers were moderate in
the language they employed as weil as in
tbeir choice of materiai, which was rallier
apPreciated by those of us who were expecting a scalding.
I should also like ta congratulate the
newly-appointed senators, and wish theni ail
weil. Again I must single out two of them,
and for the saine reasons I singled out
another a few moments ago. I make special
reference and extend a special welcorne ta
the two new senators frorn Nova Scotia, my
native province. They are good replacements.
One of these, the honourabie senator from
Antigonisb-Guysborough (Hon. Mr. O'Leary),
is the replacemnent for the late Senator Felix
Quinn, wbo was rather regarded as the
traditionai spokesman for the Irish, at ieast
of Nova Scotia, in this chamber. But the
senator from Antigonisb-Guysborough wiil
have ta sbare the tîtle of spokesman for the
Irisb witb another ini this chamber. I therefore expect that on next St. Patrick's Day
we may be doubiy biessed.
The allier new senator from Nova Scotia,
Honourable Mr. Weich fram Kings, can be
regarded as a competent replacement for the
late Senator John A. McDonald, who was here
for many years, and those of us froni Nova
Scotia who knew him loved and respected
bim. H1e spoke in this chamber with great

SENATE
knowledge and understanding on agricultural
subjects. His replacement as I say, is a
good one. We shall expect to hear from him.
Honourable senators, there have been quite
a number of speeches so far in this debate.
I think all were skilful and purposeful.
Looking back on them I perhaps might be
forgiven if I regard some as being considered
partisan. I am not against partisanship, so
I welcome that feature. There are quite a few
other speeches which had some political
overtones, and therefore may be regarded as
in the category of political speeches. But,
after all, this is a political body and there is
nothing wrong with being political.
When I finish my speech today I would
rather hope that what I am about to say
will be regarded as being political rather
than partisan. I am sure my honourable
friends opposite will not expect me to join
in the chorus, in singing the songs of praise,
expressing almost infallibility in the Prime
Minister and his Government. They can
understand that. The lyrics I am about to
sing will no doubt be inharmonious with the
several stanzas of the chorus we have already
heard.
This afternoon I should like, no matter how
it is regarded or however it might be received, to direct your attention to the paragraph in the Speech from the Throne which
makes reference to the Atlantic provinces
and their problems. This is the paragraph to
which I refer:
You will be asked to authorize the
establishment of an Atlantic Development Board to advise on measures and
projects that will promote the economic
development of the Atlantic region of
Canada.
Particularly for the benefit of the newlysummoned senators, and of course I have no
copyright on my own speeches, I would direct
attention to and ask them to get copies of our
Hansard record of the several speeches I
have made in this chamber since I came here
a few years ago. I would refer the new
senators to the speech which I made on
January 29, 1959 on the address debate, and
to some remarks which I made on June 21,
1961 when I spoke on the report of the
Special Committee on Manpower.
I note from Hansard that in 1959 I referred
to the historical background of the problems
of the Atlantic provinces, and outlined suggestions which flowed from studies which had
been made of those problems. The record
is in some detail and I do not want to
repeat myself today.
In the debate on the report of the Special
Committee on Manpower, in 1961, I placed
on record the extent of unemployment and

under-employment in the Atlantic provinces,
pointing out that the average personal income in that area was 50 per cent lower
than in some provinces and that the employment index in that area was relatively low
as compared to the national index. A lot of
employment statistics were set out in that
speech. Once in a while I find myself reading
my own speeches-at least I can compliment
myself, if no one else does-and in this
instance I must say I am glad I bothered
to read that old material and put it into
consolidated form in my mind.
My reason for rising today is to point out
that in the past few years, and since I last
spoke on this subject, there has been no
change in the employment picture of the
Atlantic region. Unemployment in the Atlantic provinces is still double the national
average. Annually, it now averages about 10
per cent as compared with a figure of between
five and six per cent over the last few years.
The present rate of employment, when the
seasonal factor is adjusted, is about 10 per
cent. Let us for a moment compare that with
the situation in what is regarded as the
wealthiest province, Ontario, where the corresponding figure has been an average of
4.2 per cent over the last few years. And in
wintertime unemployment in the Atlantic
provinces gets worse. We expect it to be worse
in that area when the harbours are frozen
over, and the woods in the northern portions
are clogged with snow and it is hard to get
men to go into the bush even if there is wood
to be cut and marketed. We cannot blame
them for that.
The percentage of unemployed in wintertime, ranging from 18 per cent to 20 per cent
of our labour force is too high. We are not
all fishermen by a long shot, and we are not
all woods workers. There is chronic unemployment in the Atlantic area, and in the
wintertime it becomes a very serious matter
socially and economically.
Our fundamental problems in the Atlantic
region remain the same-in fact, conditions
in some parts of our provinces have worsened.
I do not wish to speak about those today.
Rather, I would hope that before this debate is
over we would have some information on the
prospects in the coal mining industry and in
the steel making industry brought to the
attention of this body by someone who is well
versed in that subject.
I can only say in passing that I believe the
unemployment in the coal industry has about
levelled off, and I do not expect that it is
going to be much worse, judging by the encouraging reports on prospects made recently
by the company and by other sources who are
examining into the coal industry.
Let us hope that these prospects turn out to
be as good as they now seem to be. But even

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
if there is a levelling off in the coal industry
and the steel industry, we still have serious
problems. When I mention the fact that we
have high unemployment in these areas, it
does not mean to say that business is bad. I
do not think it is bad in any of the Atlantic
provinces. The point is that so much of our
employment and business is related to service
industries. Service industries benefit from the
spending that goes on in that area, and we
should examine what kind of spending that
is. I have examined this subject in some detail on other occasions.
In the first place, a lot of the spending
which makes business good in the Atlantic
area is based on defence expenditures and
transfer payments-transfer payments being
the sum total of social security payments that
flow into the Atlantic provinces, just as they
do into other provinces. Defence expenditures
are very important to us, because a large
part of that spending is a basis for business
being good. I put a question on the Order
Paper a year or so ago which resulted in the
disclosure of information that was rather
startling to me. I just have the figures for my
own province in mind. The total civilian payroll in connection with defence expenditures
in Nova Scotia is equal to the combined value
of the products of the sea, land and forests.
That fact is most impressive to me.
It does not make sense for us to believe
that we are always going to have such defence expenditures, that we shall always be
preparing to fight the kind of war that will
require that kind of defence expenditure, and
that ail those army, navy and air force personnel, with their wives and familles, are going to be living in Nova Scotia, spending
money and providing thereby the basis for
our economy and good business. We have to
look a little further ahead. If we did not, I
believe we would see the Honourable Howard
Green sitting in this chamber some day, because he would be one of the most disappointed men in the world. No matter who may
be his successor in the Department of External
Affairs, for years to come the search for
peace will continue. Some day we will find
world peace, and it will have its effect on the
problems of Nova Scotia.
I am not going to labour this point, for I
feel strongly about it and am apt to become
too involved. To me it does not seem right
that payments from the public treasury should
play such a major role in the Atlantic provinces' economy. What our people should be
basing their good business on is full-time and
not seasonal jobs for greater numbers. Let us
get rid of this under-employment, and clean
up a lot of the chronic unemployment which,
although spotty, is serious and exists in a
large measure.

I would not want any honourable senator,
on either side of the house, to think for one
moment that nothing has been done or is
being done to help the Atlantic provinces
tackle their problems. Some attempt has been
made to scratch the surface. What has been
done has been just that, a mere scratch on
the surface. But no one can deny that what
has been done has also been necessary and
good.
To exemplify my desire to be fair in this
summary of our position, I believe some memtion should be made of the special grants
which go to provincial governments in the
Atlantic provinces. They have helped to maintain the service at a much higher level than
would have been the case had they not been
available. However, I have some criticism of
these special grants which have flowed into
at least my home province of Nova Scotia.
It is no fault of the f ederal Government, but
it seems to me that the provincial administration in Nova Scotia has made an error in
choosing to channel a large part of the newlyfound financial resources into such projects
as the construction of turnpike type highways
in areas where the traffic far from justifies
such large expenditures. I could take any
honourable senator into Nova Scotia, and he
could observe with me what I saw on several
occasions last summer-and I did not do this
as a test. We could drive a distance of 40
miles out on that highway and back, and I
would give him $5 for every car we met
over 10 if he would give me $5 for every car
we met under 10. And yet that highway is
high, wide and handsome. I believe it was an
awful mistake for us to make such large
expenditures of that particular nature. The
people served by the type of highway I have
in mind expect and need year-round paved
highways, but as they drive over these high,
wide and handsome straight stretches, at least
some of them must wish that part of the
money so expended could have been allocated
to the ever-increasing education costs which
are now an almost insupportable burden on
the municipal taxpayers, particularly those
in rural areas. These same taxpayers must
view with dismay the substantial resources
allocated to the construction of a palatial
palace for the administration of the Nova
Scotia Labour Commission. I use that phrase
because it was used by a friend to describe
the new administration building to me before
he took me to the north end of Halifax to
show it to me.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax Northh It is a
lovely building.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Yes,
it is a lovely building, but I should have
thought they would have preferred to build
technical schools at a faster rate than they
are building them at present. These are provincial government decisions, and perhaps I
may be considered out of order in discussing
them. It is just a matter of judgment, but I
think their judgment has been in error.
Along the same lines, another thing that
disturbs me is that a lot of this new money
is being spent on the building of new retail
liquor outlets all over Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Farris: "Outlets" or "inlets"?
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): "Outlets." The R.C.M.P. ruined our "inlets".
It is fine for Halifax to have a modern,
expensive, liquor commission administration
building. Perhaps it is pleasant for tourists,
and for my friends who come down to visit
me, that they should be able to drive up to
a beautiful building to buy liquor, wines,
beer, and so on. But the commission is
buying an expensive property right in the
heart of my town. They are tearing down
a fine, old huge residence, which must have
cost a lot of money, and they are going to
have a big building with all modern conveniences and an up-to-date front to attract
people to buy liquor. It is necessary to have
retail outlets; we have a system that permits
that kind of sale, but I say again that I think
It is unwise to spend money in that way at
this particular time. I cannot agree to giving
priority for that kind of spending.
I want to say a word about the winter
works program. It has merit, although I
think evidence brought before us when we
discussed the subject of unemployment in a
Senate committee a year or so ago amply
justified the statement that no new jobs are
provided by the winter works program; but,
it has merit in that it is an attempt to spread
construction jobs over a 12-month period,
and perhaps it has an effect on the economy
in that respect.
The winter works program has been made
more effective in at least one province of
which I have knowledge-Quebec-than in
my own province. No one can argue that I
am making a political speech to help Jean
Lesage because the election in Quebec is now
over and, in any event, I do not think my
voice is strong enough to reach that far. But I
think it is a wonderful thing that the
province of Quebec contributed 40 per cent
of the cost of the winter works program. No
such assistance is given in Nova Scotia.
As an instance of the ineffectiveness of
the winter works program in Nova Scotia,
it can be pointed out that in 1961-62 there
were 33,000 man-days of work provided. It

sounds like a lot, but when reduced to
meaningful terms it works out to about 110
full-time jobs. Very few, if any, of these
have come to rural municipalities where the
situation of chronic unemployment is growing
steadily worse. It does not seem to me to be
a very effective scheme which makes only
110 full-time jobs available while tens of
thousands are looking for work.
I do wish to say that some credit is due
to the present Government for continuing,
with some modification, the policies of the
previous administration with regard to the
cost of production and distribution of power
in, I think, two of the Atlantic provinces.
Credit is also due for the encouragement
given to the construction of vocational and
technical schools. This is a field in which for
some years we in Nova Scotia have lagged
behind the other provinces in taking on our
responsibilities. We have lagged far behind
our sister province of New Brunswick, and
far indeed behind the province of Quebec,
of which I have some knowledge, as well as
the province of Alberta.
Here again my province is not able to take
full advantage of the assistance offered, which
on the surface seems generous, when the
federal Government provides 75 per cent of
the capital cost of erecting a school. With
the municipal taxpayers overburdened as they
are at the present time with education costs,
some regions-and I happen to live in one
of them-cannot agree to a sharing of the
staffing and administration costs of such
schools, because the financial resources are
not available. This program must be made
more effective in a province where the
extent of personal incomes makes responsibility for the operation of new training facilities very difficult to assume. It seems to me
that some additional incentive might be provided so that technical and vocational education can be provided for the rapidly increasing
number of young people leaving school unprepared for today's and tomorrow's world
of work. This additional incentive might well
be in the form of additional federal grants
for the operation of such educational institutions. Let no one think that we in Nova
Scotia are going to raise any constitutional
issues about education. Such an incentive
would at least take part of the burden off
the municipal taxpayer, and it would spread
that prograrn over a province which needs
it as badly as, if not worse than, any other
province in this country.
In connection with our studies in the
Special Committee on Manpower and Employment, most of us who were on the committee will remember that unemployment was
broken down into several categories, one of
which was structural. Nova Scotia has been

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
affected by structural unemployment perhaps
more than any other province. This is the
era of the power saw when a man can go
into the woods-and cut much more wood than
could a man and his son some years ago.
It has reduced the time a man and his
son can be employed in the woods to complete a contract for a paper company or for
a pulpwood exporting company. The power
saw has also had its effect on unemployment
in the woods in areas where timber is cut
to be sawn into lumber.
Then again, structural unemployment is
caused by the fact that in my province a
year or so ago a start was made in using
chips from the waste in lumber mill operations. This by-product, I am now informed,
comprises about 20 per cent of the total
pulp that is manufactured or ground up by
the Bowaters Mersey Paper Company in my
own home town of Liverpool. This chipping
of the slabs of waste lumber is done by
machines, and there is less pulpwood being
cut by the men in the woods in, for example,
northern Queens county which can now be
almost described as a depressed area.
Merchants there have told me, and they have
been saying it for several years, that if it
were not for social security cheques they
would have to close their shops, and even
at that the people are not buying much more
than the essentials of life. Without social
security cheques I do not know what families
would live on in areas where a man can
no longer get a job that lasts any length of
time. This is the impact of automation and
new ways of doing things, which is referred
to by the general term "structural unemployment".
With respect to joint programs in general,
you may know that the federal Government
enters into many agreements on joint programs with provincial governments. The contribution formulae with respect to these
programs do not always recognize the difference in the abilities of provinces to pay.
One exception I can think of is the hospitalization scheme. That is a shared program,
but the cost-sharing formulae takes cognizance
of the differing abilities and standards of
incomes of the various provinces. Ontario
gets a grant of less than 50 per cent of the
total cost, whereas my province receives a
grant from the federal Governrment in the
order of 55 or 56 per cent of the total cost.
I think that principle of different formulae
applying to different provinces with respect
to cost-sharing should be followed more
often.
I do not have to remind the honourable
senators from Nova Scotia, or many others
here, that my own province presently has the

highest gasoline tax in Canada. I told one
person the other day that we pay 54 and a
fraction cents a gallon for premium gasoline,
and he thought I had made a mistake. In my
province there is a 5 per cent sales tax with
the usual exemptions, and municipal tax rates
have reached the point of repression. Yet,
my province's contribution to joint programs
such as winter works, the trans-Canada highway, technical education, and so on, is
calculated on the same basis as that of other
provinces with much lower rates of direct
taxation and higher average incomes-higher
sometimes by as much as 50 per cent-which
provide greater ability to pay.
In any event, regardless of what has been
done in the past, and whether it has been the
responsibility of this Government or a previous one, and whether old age security,
family allowances and unemployment insurance are good or bad, depending upon your
point of view, these measures I have mentioned have been of considerable help to my
province. But regardless of all that lias been
done in the past there has not been a serious
start made at solving our fundamental problems.
The same thing can be said about our national problems-and we do have national
problems, although we read about only one
these days. It is amazing to note that since
early last summer we have heard nothing
about our problems except the one concerning
our balance of payments. There are, however,
deeper problems that are just as important
and about which we should hear more.
It has been pointed out that during this
past year there has been a rather substantial
gain in the number of employed. It is interesting to observe, however, that the national
employment index has not improved. I inquired by telephone this morning as to the
latest figure of the unemployment index-the
index is based on the 1949 figures equalling
100-and was told that today the national
figure is 118.1, whereas in my own province
the figure is 94. We are losing ground in employment in relation to our population. If
1949 equals 100 then 1962 equals 94 in Nova
Scotia, and in the nation as a whole it equals
118.1.
I was not too surprised when getting this
information together to hear that one of the
greatest increases in the index of employment in Canada is in the province of Newfoundland. I do not know whether all the
credit should go to Joey Smallwood or not,
but I will give him plenty because I think he
has been the man of his time. He came along
at the right time to get his country, as it then
was, into Confederation, to get some federal
assistance to do things.

it is about fifth or sixth in circulation in
this country. It is a big and important newspaper with a circulation of the order of
125,000 or 130,000. A few years ago this
newspaper published a series of editorials
which were later incorporated in a booklet
entitled, " A Blueprint for Atlantic Advance".
That should be required reading for anyone
who is interested in the Atlantic provinces.
As I recall, those suggestions also formed
the basis of the platform of the Conservative
party candidates in the Atlantic provinces in
the year 1957. Therefore, the suggestions
must have been good ones.
Recently the Senate Committee on Manpower and Employment also made a special
study of the problem of the labour surplus
areas of Canada, which study revealed that
many of these areas were in the Atlantic
provinces. During the hearings by that committee, responsible witnesses made stronglyworded recommendations for the solution of
these problems. These views, reinforced by
a special study undertaken for the committee
by Dr. Judek of Ottawa University, led the
Manpower Committee, when dealing with
regional problems in its final report, to say
this:
Little can be accomplished with marginal and small scale remedies.
The report went on to say:
Sporadic incursions into this problem
and random flourishes are not going to
bring results.
In addition to the royal commission studies
and recommendations, and those of the Senate committee, others have been digging to
get at the roots of these problems. As has
been so well said by the honourable senator
from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), who
is presently attending the United Nations
meetings, the work done by the Atlantic
Provinces Economic Council in recent years
in the field of research and study has been
comprehensive and of immense value.
A distinguished gentleman from the United
Kingdom visited the Maritime provinces at
the invitation of the premiers of those provinces. I am not quite sure whether he confined his activities to one or more of the
Atlantic provinces, but I know that he made
a most intensive study of our general problems. I refer to Professor A. K. Cairncross,
a man of real ability, who is now one of the
principal economic advisers to Prime Minister
Macmillan. His material is on the record and
it is good material.
But, honourable senators, studies of the
nature I have referred to can go on forever
without producing results unless they are
followed by action. The Atlantic provinces
will always be faced with the serious social

and economic problems associated with an
unemployment rate at least double that of
the national average, unless something better
and more effective is done.
The people of the Atlantic region know
that advice by qualified individuals and
organizations has been available to the Government for some years. They will, therefore,
fail to see the need for further advice on, to
quote the Speech from the Throne,
measures and projects that will promote
the economic development of the Atlantic
region of Canada.
The people of that area may regard this
proposal, being placed before us at this session, as words without action and without real
meaning. To be meaningful, at least another
paragraph would have to be added to the
Speech from the Throne. Then the pertinent
and complete paragraph would read something like this:
You will be asked to authorize the
establishment of an Atlantic Development Board to advise on measures and
projects that will promote the economic
development of the Atlantic region of
Canada, through the use of federal
finances, to be provided from an Atlantic
provinces capital assistance fund and
from other sources.
Honourable senators, the ultimate goal in
solving our Atlantic regional problems must
be to attain a rate of growth of job opportunities which would reduce our unemployed at least to the national level, while
providing jobs which would hold our natural
increase in population in the provinces of
their birth. One half of this natural increase
are now moving outside the province. The
goal I project is difficult to attain. An A.P.E.C.
study which I read not long ago estimated
that this goal involves the creation of 155,000
new jobs by 1980. Considerable time and
extraordinary effort will be necessary to bring
about this economic growth. The annual unemployment rate for the last few years has
averaged about 12 per cent of the labour
force, while at the same time an average of
6,000 persons have left Nova Scotia each year
for the past five or six years. They have left
in order to make a life elsewhere. We do not
like to see these people leave; we prefer
that they stay at home, but they cannot do
so unless the rate of employment expands.
Where the task is great, the effort must
be equally great, and a start must be made
immediately. There is no time for further
delay and indecision.
All of us must be conscious that the winds
of change and reform have been blowing
all over the present-day world. There is a
need to accept changes and reforms in the

SENATE
political, social and economic fields and to
mould them to fit the modern world with its
tensions, anxieties and demands. This need
has been recognized by the governments of
many countries. Protestant observers report
that the winds of reform are being felt at the
Ecumenical Council in Rome.
The Government and the people of Quebec
are recognizing the need for reform. Al is
not well when such radical movements as
Separatism and Social Credit receive the support of over half a million restless people.
Just as the solution of the economic and
social problems of French Canada will contribute to national unity and national well
being, so will the solution of those problems
of Atlantic Canada. The pattern of increased
transfer payments and joint programs merely
provides a palliative and makes the Atlantic
patient feel temporarily better but does not
attack the basic disease. To take an expression which was used in the committee on
Manpower and Employment: "Random flourishes," and empirical remedies should be replaced by a bold and forthright attack on the
virus which causes chronic unemployment
and under-employment in Atlantic Canada.
The appropriate prescription was written
some years ago and endorsed by research,
study and experience both on this continent
and abroad. The ingredients include:
1. Tax incentives of major degree to encourage the establishment of industries and
the expansion of those already established.
2. Capital assistance in the form of public
works which are creative of a flow of employment opportunities.
3. A municipal development fund for lowcost loans for municipal works and undertakings.
4. Enlarged terms of reference of the Industrial Development Bank.
5. A "new look" for all joint federal-provincial programs which recognize the factor
of ability to pay.
6. New policies to reduce cost of moving
our goods to market to include a rejection of
the MacPherson Royal Commission recommendations for removal of the benefits of the
Maritime Freight Rates Act for traffic within
the region.
The patient may not need all these ingredients, or he may need more. He may
need a different kind of medicine from that
prescribed.
Honourable senators, at the outset I acknowledged that my remarks might be construed as political. If however, some honourable senators have detected a note of
partisanship, it is because I cannot truly be
other than partisan in my earnest desire to
advance the economic and social welfare of

the eastern provinces by the sea, and that
desire has nothing whatever to do with my
party affiliation.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape
Breton), debate adjourned.
FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 1, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Croll for the second
reading of Bill S-3, to make provision for
the disclosure of information in respect of
finance charges.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) was kind enough to adjourn this debate for me.
This is the fourth time a bill bearing the
title this one bears has come before the
Senate, and on the fourth time around one
endeavours more than ever to avoid undue
repetition. Since this seems to be "appreciation day" in the Senate, before I say
anything uncomplimentary about the bill I
should offer the highest marks to its sponsor
(Hon. Mr. Croîl) for his persistence and
industry. After all the fates have done to
him in the course of the three previous introductions of this bill in the Senate, one
might be less likely to be charged with lack
of industry and lack of perseverance than
if he abandoned the bill after even one try.
It seems as though almost everything bas
happened to this bill. It went to committee
the first time, and was never reported out.
The second time around, the Senate voted it
down on second reading. The third time it
was a race between getting the bill to committee and prorogation of Parliament. I believe the bill got to committee but Parliament
dissolved before the bill received any consideration. Now we have the bill here again.
My friend presents the bill, as he did
on previous occasions, as a very effective instrument for doing what the title of the bill
says, namely, to make provision for the disclosure of information in respect of finance
charges. My own view is that if the bill became law it would be completely ineffective
for that purpose-it would accomplish nothing. I propose to point out why, in my view,
that is so.

First, my friend has told us the purpose of
the bill. In one place he stated that it is
designed to require the purchaser to be given
the information and to be given the truth in
lending. In another place in his speech he

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
said the sole purpose of the bill is to require
credit financiers to tell the truth about
charges. Then he said:
This bill is designed to protect the
consumer from the harsh consequences
of easy retail credit, and to require those
financing such credit to disclose all their
charges whether they are called interest,
finance charges, carrying charges or
otherwise.
My friend makes the easy assumption that
the bill is constitutional-that question was
discussed on previous occasions-by simply
declaring that the bill in pith and substance
deals with interest. Well, of course, if the
bill in pith and substance deals with interest
then it is within the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament and within that jurisdiction
only. But one cannot dispose of the question
of constitutionality as easily and in such
an offhand manner as my friend would suggest it can be done in this case. It takes
more than the use of the word "interest" to
make the pith and substance of a bill relating
to interest and therefore be within the federal
authority.
My friend says that the issue is truth in
lending. Therefore I must conclude that he
joins ranks in this fashion, that it is truth
in lending versus deception in lending. I want
to disabuse his mind right away because if
I thought for one moment that this bill is
necessary in order to avoid deception, and
secondly, that it would aid one iota in the correction of this situation, I would support it.
My friend has no corner on desire to protect
the borrower against deception, or against
misinformation that a borrower might receive
as to the terms and conditions of the borrowing, or in the desire that fraud should not
be practised on the borrower.
No one takes the position that the borrower should get less information than that
which would inform him fully as to his obligations, the terms and conditions of the borrowing, and what he has to repay. The point
on which my friend and I disagree is as to
the value and necessity of this arithmetical
calculation of what he calls interest. He, in
effect, says that unless you make that calculation and express the finance charges as a
percentage in terms of simple annual interest,
then you have not told the truth in lending.
Now, on that basis let us have a look at
the bill. It has a few changes from the measure that we had before us in January of
this year. It has been boiled down and refined. My friend has now removed from it
any reference to services. He has added a
preamble which at the same time he disowns
as having any real purpose. My own feeling

is that he might have added a preamble because there is a preamble in the Small Loans
Act, and he may have felt that the analogy
which he thinks exists between the Small
Loans Act and this bill might also aid his
bill if it had a preamble.
This bill covers only new consumer credit
in the area where a vendor of personal property such as automobiles, furniture, radios or
refrigerators, enters into a transaction with
a purchaser as a result of which all the payments, or some part of the payments, in
respect of that purchase are to be made after
the transaction has been completed by the
delivery of the article to the purchaser. That
he calls consumer credit.
This field of consumer credit is where the
conditional sale agreement comes in. That is
where a vendor is selling a car and he wants
to retain title until such time as it has been
fully paid for. He can do it by following the
provisions of The Conditional Sales Act of
Ontario, and there are similar statutes in
many of the other provinces in Canada.
If he uses this instrument, a conditional
sale agreement, and it is properly carried
through in the terms of the statute, and
registered, then the vendor of the automobile
can retain title to it as against a third person who might acquire what he thought was
good title from the first purchaser.
In order to have a good conditional sale
agreement in Ontario the statute imposes the
requirement that the contract must be in
writing. This is provided for in chapter 61
of the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1960. The
contract must be evidenced by a writing
signed by the purchaser or his agent,
... stating the terms and conditions of
the sale and describing the goods sold;
and
(b) within ten days after the execution
of the contract a true copy of it is
registered in the office of the clerk of
the county or district court of the county
or district in which the purchaser resided
at the time of the sale ...
That is from Section 2. I now read from
Section 4:
The seller shall deliver a copy of the
contract to the purchaser within twenty
days after the execution thereof ...
When you look at the form of a conditional
sale agreement, which is standard in relation
to automobiles, refrigerators and radios, you
see the kind of information which is furnished by the form which I hold. I am reading from an actual form, the particulars of
an actual transaction, with the names, of
course, omitted.

Then it goes on to say this:
Payable in 18 consecutive monthly instalments of $112.60, payable on the
fourth Friday of each month, commencing in the month of January 1962.
Then there is a note at the bottom which
the purchaser also signs. There is also a statement on this conditional sale agreement indicating that it is being assigned to Traders
Finance Corporation, that the vendor guarantees payment by the purchaser in accordance
with the terms of the assignment, and that
the payments will be made to the finance
corporation. There is a similar form in connection with refrigerators and furniture.
I should point out to honourable senators
that at times this form also provides for an
insurance premium. In the example I just
gave the purchaser had his own insurance,
so there is no dollar amount filled in opposite
"insurance premium." Were the insurance
premium part of the deal and were it to be
paid for out of the financing, then it would
be added as a separate item. In the case of
furniture, refrigerators or radios that insurance might take the form of life insurance
as well as the other types of insurance in
connection with automobiles. This is the
information which the purchaser gets at the
time he completes his transaction.
Now, I ask you, can it be said that the
purchaser, under those circumstances, has not
been given every bit of the truth in relation
to the transaction? He is given full particulars of how the unpaid balance is made up;
he is told, on an instalment basis, if he wants
it for 12, 18 or 24 months, what the specific
payment is that be has to make each month,
and for what period of time. If that were not
so, if the purchaser were not given that information, how would it be possible for him
to make his payments? Or, if he started making his payments thinking they were so much
a month, how would he know when to stop
making them? He knows because he is
furnished with this information, and if the
law under the Conditional Sales Act of
Ontario has been complied with he has been

furnished with a copy of this document which
is registered. He also has it within his power
to demand and to receive, as a matter of law,
a copy of this document. Therefore, he has
in his possession all the information that he
needs in order to know what the financed part
of the purchase price of this article is costing
him, and how much he has to pay.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Is interest mentioned?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Does be know the
interest rate that be is paying?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend is anticipating.
The honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) speaks on this point each
time the matter arises. I am glad my friend
interrupted, as be will see in a moment.
Now I come to the bill. "Finance charges"
are defined under this bill as:
... the total cost of the credit to the consumer thereof, and includes interest, fees,
bonuses, service charges, discounts and
any other type of charge whether described as interest or not.
Therefore, within that definition of "finance
charges," if there are premiums on insurance
policies, they will be included; if there is a
registration fee for registering the conditional
sales agreement, it will be included.
In my discussion of this bill, I first want
to point out that I am discussing its provisions. Under my friend's bill "interest" is not
required to be stated as an item of interest.
It is included within the sum total of something that be calls "finance charges," and I
would direct my friend to the definition of
"finance charges." Then when the sponsor
comes to the point where he wants information furnished to the borrower before the
transaction is completed, what he wants is
this:
(a) the total amount of the unpaid
balance outstanding;
(b) the total amount of the finance
charges to be borne by such other person in connection with the transaction.
I say that at the present time the purchaser
receives that information; it is all exposed to
him. If it were not, be would not know how
to make his payments or when to stop making
them.
The third item is one which, according to
the sponsor of the bill, makes the difference
between telling the truth in lending and not
telling the truth. It is this:
(c) the percentage relationship, expressed in terms of simple annual interest, that the total amount of the finance
charges bears to the unpaid balance outstanding under the transaction.

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
What he means is this. If your finance
charges are $192.44, he wants you to relate
that amount to the balance unpaid. In the case
I cited it was $1,834.36. Then he wants you to
express these finance charges in that amount
by percentage in relation to the unpaid balance-he says, "expressed in terns of simple
annual interest." I take it by that he means
he wants the figure reduced to $100, and the
borrower to be told in relation to that $100
what is the percentage. However, when you
have done that, what have you got? What you
have is a percentage figure expressing the
relationship between finance charges and the
unpaid balance. You have not got a figure
that can be called "interest" as such, because in the finance charges my friend has included items other than interest. Interest is
only one of a number of items which he has
included in his definition of "finance charges,"
and he wants the percentage in relation to
finance charges and not in relation to interest. There are items in finance charges that
cannot, in any sense, be called "interest"
or "compensation" for the money borrowed,
whether it is called "interest" in fact. If I
pay a registration fee to register the document, that cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be called "interest." If I pay a
valuation fee or an insurance premium for
insurance, while it might be for the benefit
of the vendor as well, it is definitely for the
benefit of the purchaser and the user of
the car. If I pay a premium for life insurance it is definitely for the benefit of the borrower or his estate, though you might say
it is a benefit to the lender too. But all those
are payments that, by no stretch of the imagination, could come within the area of "interest" as we understand that term.

for an extra risk, or something of that kind,
or maybe an extra charge for no extra risk.
I do not know. It would include servicecharges, risk, discounts-and a discount might
very well come into the category of interest,.
and any other type of charge whether described as interest or not.
If you take that area you can let your
imagination run as to what might be included.
You could have insurance premiums, and an
infinite variety of things, but when I address
myself to the forrn in which the definition is
written I say there are more items included
in finance charges than those things which.

area you are dealing with finance charges.
The significant point as far as I am concerned is that to say I am not telling the truth.
in lending because I do not make that added
percentage calculation, is something that I
cannot understand. When the borrower is
told how much he owes, and told the total of
the finance charges, the registration fees and
the insurance premium, and then is given the
total of those as the unpaid balance, and is
told how much he has to pay per month,
depending on whether he wants financing for12, 18, 24, or 36 months, then I say he has
been told the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth in lending, and the
requirement of expressing this as a percentage
adds nothing more.
Even my friend went a long way when he
was speaking on this very point. As to the
basis of his bill, he had this to say:
... if people knew what they were being
charged they would be less likely to make
instalment purchases which would leave
them hard up or destitute, and at the
very least, would enable them to shop

SENATE
lending unless that percentage is given. Arising out of that point, I come to my next
proposition.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Before you
leave that point, may I ask what is the objection to giving the rate of interest? Admitting
what you say to be the case, why should
the lender not tell the borrower what the
money is going to cost, what it would represent in interest?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can answer my friend,
but the form in which the question is put
bothers me a little. Dealing with what the
borrower is going to payHon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Why not tell
the borrower what the money is going to
cost, with the rate of interest calculated?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let me first take my
friend the sponsor's position. He said it is a
simple calculation to make-and if it is such
a simple calculation I suppose the borrower,
as well as the lender, has some responsibility
for making it. But secondly, and this is my
strong point, if it means that the lender must
calculate the true effective rate of interest,
reflecting the monthly instalment payments
and their effect on the calculation of that
rate, then it is a complex and complicated
process to make that calculation.
My friend and I, on a case he presented
at an earlier session this year, differed by
about 80 per cent on what seemed to be a
fairly simple calculation, and I think we
finally compromised. I think my percentage
calculation was closer than his, but perhaps
I was off by at least 40 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You needed an interest
table.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I needed an actuary.
My friend is volunteering some interjection, but let me point out that the columnist,
Pierre Berton, did a lot of research and published column after column reporting on
what his operative found, but before he published the figures as to what he called "the
true interest relationship" he had his operative take all the figures to an actuary to do
the calculations and then be quoted the calculations which the actuary had made.
Remember, the bill demands a penalty for
not giving the true rate of interest. By clause
4 of the bill, if the lender fails to provide a
statement of this calculation to the person to
whom the credit is being extended, then the
credit financier has not the right or remedy
or cause of action either in law or in equity
in regard to any finance charges. In other
words, if his calculation is not correct, and

if he has not been paid the finance charges,
he cannot sue to recover them, and if the
finance charges have been paid the borrower
has a right of action against the lender to
get them back.
Now my friend provides for regulations,
by which a formula would be prescribed
for making the calculation, and for the degree
of accuracy or of tolerance in such calculation. But as far as I am concerned, in answering the question asked by the senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary), "Why not give
the interest rate?"-there are many other
ways I could answer my friend, in addition
to what I have said. First, the borrower, I
must assume, has equal capacity to determine
the percentage, when he is given all the
information that he needs. Secondly, the
calculation of this percentage, which is not
true interest, is not the effective rate of
interest. It is a relationship expressed in terms
of interest of finance charges to the unpaid
balance.
When the borrower is so informed, he
already has the information as to his cost in
dollars. He already bas the information in
dollars as to what he has to pay each month
until he has satisfied the obligation. I say
that is the extent, and that is the greatest
extent, to which this can be carried.
I may not have answered my honourable
friend from Carleton-I do not know-but
I refuse to assume that every vendor or every
lender is a shrewd businessman with a sort
of actuarial mind, and that every borrower
is exactly the opposite, and that therefore
it is the duty of the lender, after he bas
furnished every bit of information in dollars
in relation to the transaction, to make this
other complicated calculation.
I say "complicated" only if that is what
the bill means. Frankly, I do not know that
it means that. From the way my honourable
friend from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll)
spoke I would say that is what he thinks
it means. If all that section 3 asks the lender
to do is relate the finance charges to the
unpaid balance as a percentage in terms of
simple interest-if it means that and nothing
more than that-then I agree with my friend
that it is a simple calculation, and on that
basis I could not object as much to imposing
this burden or obligation on the lender. But
I say what I have said because of the fact
that my friend bas devoted so much of his
presentation to what be calls the true rate or
the effective rate which, I take it, means the
rate that would reflect instalment payments
each month and a reducing balance of principal and a reducing balance of finance charges
in that total unpaid balance.

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
However, whatever it is, once you come
to the conclusion that interest is only one element in finance charges, then in my submission, my friend's one hold on constitutionality
disappears because it is no longer interest.
May I just point out this: my friend says
the pith and substance of this bill is interest.
I ask you to look at the bill. The word
"interest" occurs three times. It occurs first
in the preamble, but my friend could not
possibly claim that one because it is part of
the phrase "in the public interest". That is
not the kind of interest that would be within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal
authority under the British North America
Act.
There are two other places where the word
"interest" occurs: in the description of finance charges, and in section 3 which provides that this percentage calculation must
be expressed in terms of simple annual interest. The bill does not say it is simple annual
interest, but the lender has to reduce the
figures to 100, and give the percentage rate
on $100.
The jurisdiction of the federal Parliament
is with respect to interest. My honourable
friend referred to the Small Loans Act as
suggesting some authority which would support his claim that this bill is constitutional.
This bill can only be constitutional if its pitb
and substance is interest. What the bill asks
the lender to do is to disclose his finance
charges, and "finance charges" is an expression the connotation of which is much
broader than the word "interest". If interest
is removed from the pith and substance of this
bill then what is left is simply disclosure of
finance charges, which is a matter of property
and civil rights within the province.
Though my honourable friend has referred
to the Small Loans Act, there is a vast difference between this bill and that act. The Small
Loans Act contains a definition of the cost
of a loan which says that it includes,
. . . the whole cost of the loan whether
the same is called interest or is claimed
as discount, deduction from an advance,
commission, brokerage, chattel mortgage
and recording fees, fines, penalties or
charges for inquiries, defaults or renewals or otherwise, and whether paid to
or charged by the lender or paid to or
charged by any other person . . .
But when you come to the operative part
of the Small Loans Act, and to the new section 3 which was enacted in 1956, it saysand I read only the words that I think are
pertinent to the point I am making:
No money-lender shall, in respect of
any loan, directly or indirectly ...

exact

... for the payment by the borrower of a
sum of money as a result of the payment
of which the cost of the loan exceeds
an amount equivalent to the amount or
rate prescribed by this section ...

Then subsection (2) of that section reads:
The cost of a loan shall not exceed the
aggregate of
(a) two per cent per month on any
part of the unpaid principal balance not
exceeding three hundred dollars ...
And then it goes on to say that it shall not
exceed one per cent per month on any part
of the unpaid balance exceeding $300 but
not exceeding $1,000, and then one-half of
one per cent per month on the remainder of
the unpaid balance exceeding $1,000.
What you have there is a maximum cost
of the loan fixed at two per cent per month
on any part of the unpaid principal balance
not exceeding $300, and you are told that
whatever charges go to make that up you
cannot get more than two per cent per month.
So, to the extent that there is interest in
those costs, then as the costs other than interest increase, the effect of this fixed percentage of two per cent per month is to reduce the interest element and, therefore, the
Small Loans Act deals with the rate of
interest. Alternatively, as the costs reduce,
the interest element increases and, therefore,
the act deals directly with interest and it becomes clearly within the jurisdiction of the
federal Parliament.
Mr. Varcoe, when Deputy Minister of Justice, gave an opinion on the constitutional
validity of this act by saying that the pith
and substance of the legislation had to do
with interest, and these other elements were
collateral to that.
It can be seen how the pith and substance
of the Small Loans Act might be said to be the
control of interest, because a ceiling is put
on what may be charged for a loan and,
therefore, either a miximum or a minimum
is being placed upon the rate of interest because what is received as interest will vary
dependent upon these other charges that
are poured into the cost of a loan. I understand that although the Small Loans Act
has never been challenged in the courts, it
might well be. If it were, it might be held
to be constitutional because its pith and substance is interest, and I have tried to illustrate to you how that may be so.
Just because interest is mentioned in this
bill before us does not create constitutionality in the federal authority right away. I
should point out to my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Croll) that there was a decision in
relation to a municipality with which he had

SENATE
a lot to do in his younger days, namely, the
city of Windsor. As a matter of fact, I think
this developed during the period when he
was closely identified with that city. It was
around 1935, and having regard to the position my friend occupied at that time he
might well have been the author or the coauthor of the legislation by which municipalities in the Windsor area that were in financial difficulties were dissolved by a special
statute of the province of Ontario and a new
municipal corporation was created. The creation of that new municipal corporation provided that the interest on the debenture
borrowings of the new corporation should
not exceed a certain percentage. That was
challenged in the courts as being unconstitutional and beyond the authority of the
provincial Government. The case went as
high as the Privy Council, which decided
that it was constitutional. In regard to the
dissolution of the four municipal corporations
which had existed up to that moment, the
Privy Council had this to say:
The result of dissolution is that the
debts of the dissolved corporation disappear. Amalgamation of municipalities
for the purpose of more effective administration, whether for financial or other
reasons, is a common incident of local
government.

.

.Where the former bodies

are dissolved it is inevitable that the old
debts disappear, to be replaced by new
obligations of the new body. And in
creating the new corporation with the
powers of assuming new obligations it is
implicit in the powers of the Legislature
... that it should place restrictions and

qualifications on the obligations to be
assumed.
Then they say:
It is of the essence of its control over
local government administered by municipalities that itthat is, the Government and the Municipal
Affairs Departmentshould have these powers of inquiry and
decisions. In other wordsAnd this is the cogent reason.
-the pith and substance of both the
Amalgamation Acts and the Municipal
Board Act, 1932, and the Department of
Municipal Affairs Act, 1935, are that the
Acts are passed in relation to municipal
institutions in the Province.
Further on, they say:
The question of interest does not present difficulties. The above reasoning
sufficiently disposes of the objection. If
the Provincial Legislature can dissolve

a municipal corporation and create a
new one to take its place, it can invest
the new corporation with such powers
of incurring obligations as it pleases, and
incidentally may define the amount of
interest which such obligations may bear.
Such legislation, if directed bona fide to
the effective creation and control of
municipal institutions, is in no way an
encroachment upon the general exclusive power of the Dominion Legislature
over interest.
That case was reported in 1939 Appeal
Cases, at page 468, and is the case of Ladore
et al vs. Bennett et al.
I refer to that case only to support the
proposition that I made, that the mere fact
interest is mentioned in a bill does not immediately vest the jurisdiction in the federal
Parliament to the exclusion of the provincial
legislature.
I say that in this case the mere mention
of interest in the two places it occurs can
only give the federal Parliament jurisdiction
if, as the result of what is said in the bill,
you can say, if asked, that the essential purpose is interest, control of the rate of interest,
or something of that kind. This bill does
not purport to control interest; it does not
affect interest in any way; it makes no attempt at regulation of interest. All it says is
that if this calculation is not made on the
finance charges, the penalty is that one may
not sue for the charges and, if they have
been paid, the person who has paid them can
sue for their return.
In my submission, that makes this bill
completely unconstitutional, because its pith
and substance is not interest.
The other day, the honourable senator from
St. John's East (Hon. Mr. Higgins), who sits
on the Government side, raised a question
when my friend the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) was speaking, in regard to a recent decision in Ontario.
It seemed to me that my friend indicated
he intended to deal with that in reply; in
other words, that he had something up his
sleeve that he was going to make use of
when the opportunity arose. This case was
that of a recent decision in Ontario under
the Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act.
The Court of Appeal unanimously declared
that that statute was ultra vires of the Ontario
Legislature, and therefore I had intended to
discuss the case. In the meantime, howeverwithin the past week-the province of Ontario
obtained leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada. Therefore, I feel that I should
not argue the merits or distinguish that case.
However, I should like to make some passing
reference to it so that one may see what is
involved in it.

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act
goes far back to early historical days, not
only in Canada but in England. It was designed to relieve a borrower from what would
truly be an unconscionable transaction. The
procedure was to give authority to a court
or a judge under which the contract could
be re-written, reducing the principal amount
and reducing the cost of the loan. The cost
of the loan is defined in the statute. The
statute goes so far as to say that "actual
lawful and necessary disbursements made to
a registrar of deeds", etcetera, are not included in the cost of the loan. The authority
that the statute gave was that:
Where, in respect of money lent, the
court finds that, having regard to the risk
and to all the circumstances, the cost of
the loan is excessive and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable, the
court may,
(a) re-open the transaction and take
an account between the creditor and the
debtor;
(b) notwithstanding any statement or
settlement of account or any agreement
purporting to close previous dealings and
create a new obligation, re-open any account already taken and relieve the debtor
from payment of any sum in excess of
the sum adjudged by the court to be
fairly due in respect of the principal and
the cost of the loan;
(c) order the creditor to repay any
such excess if the same has been paid or
allowed on account by the debtor ...
One can see that this legislation certainly
appears to bear directly upon rate of interest.
If there is authority to re-open accounts and
reduce them, that means affecting the rate
of interest. If there is also the power to reopen and reduce the cost of the loan, which
includes interest, that means dealing with the
rate of interest.
That was the position taken by the Court
of Appeal-and taken, as the Court of Appeal
expressed in its judgment, with reluctance,
since they thought it was a very meritorious
statute.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Did they reverse the
judgment?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The Court of Appeal
reversed the court of first instance. The appeal judgment dealt with the argument on
the law, that is, as to whether the statute was
ultra vires or not, and the parties had agreed
that the court should make the decision on
that point, because it was useless to argue
the merits until the court first decided
whether the province had authority to enact
such legislation.

Just to indicate the thinking of the court,
let me read from the judgment:
The statute is applicable to only one
kind of contract-a moneylending contract. Its essential purpose and object
is to provide a remedy to a borrower
to enable him to have the terms of
such a contract modified. The end result
of an application to the Court in accordance with its provisions, if the borrower is entitled to succeed, must be
that the interest, in the broad sense of
that teri, payable as compensation for
the loan will be reduced. It matters not,
in my opinion, whether this result is
achieved through the intervention of a
Court order or through the operation
of a provision in the Act itself fixing a
stated rate or scale of interest. In either
case it is unquestionably legislation in
relation to interest under the pith and
substance rule, and, in my opinion,
clearly invalid as an infringement of the
exclusive legislative power committed
to Parliament.
In commenting on what "interest" means
in this judgment-and it does make a historical review of the origins of interest and
the variations in purchase over the yearsthe court said:
The American authorities speak of
interest as the compensation allowed by
law or fixed by the parties for the use
or forbearance of money, or as damages
for its detention. Broadly speaking it is
regarded as compensation which may
be demanded by the lender from the
borrower, or by the creditor from the
debtor for the use of money.
The word "interest" is not, then, a
technical teri and it is not restricted
in any sense to compensation determinable by the application of a rate percentum to the principal amount of a loan.
It may be for a fixed sum of money
whether denominated a bonus, discount
or premium, provided that it is referable
to a principal money or to an obligation
to pay money. This broader and more
comprehensive meaning of the word is
recognized in the English moneylending
statutes. . .

Then references are made to the various
interest acts. But even the statute itself, the
Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, excludes from the terminology of the definition
of the cost of a loan those things which are
not in the nature of compensation for the
use of money, such as registrar's fees, and
matters of that kind, where the money is
being paid to some third party, and therefore

SENATE
it is not enjoyed by the lender as part of the
price that he includes for the use of his
money. The judgment draws that distinction.
I refer to that case only to indicate that
the pith and substance rule is the rule you
must follow, and you have to determine if
the pith and substance is interest, the regulation, control and rate of interest.
In my submission this bill does not deal
with interest in that aspect at all; it does not
attempt to regulate or control; it does not
define. Al it says is that you must make a
calculation, and the purpose of the calculation
is to expose in all aspects the finance charges.
My friend presumes that, although you tell
a man how many dollars he owes you and
the makeup of those dollars, and you tell him
how much he has to pay per month for so
many months until the loan is repaid, you
still have not told him the truth. These are
catch-phrases; and if there ever was a catchphrase, "truth in lending" is one, because it
conveys the sinister connotation that there
has been less than truth in lending, and that
the less than truth in lending is simply
because that calculation has not been made
relating percentagewise finance charges to
unpaid balance and expressed in terms of
simple interest.
It is strange how it catches on. I have been
flooded with letters from substantial representative organizations all across Canada asking me to support this bill, and their representations and letters indicate to me that they
have not read the bill or, if they have, they
do not understand it. However, I must take
them as they are. I know many of them and
I know that they are sincere, but they have
been fooled by the expression "truth in lending". I say that the information which is
given to the borrower and which is required
by the law of Ontario and by other provinces
in Canada, gives the truth in lending and
gives the whole truth in lending, and that
any person who is armed with that has all
the information he needs to know about what
his purchase is costing him.
To suggest to me that because a percentage
is expressed that that conveys more to me
as to what I am paying than if I know only
that I have to pay so many dollars is utter
nonsense. I know the value of dollars, and
so do all these other people. My friend suggests that some people are fooled because
they do not get the percentage figure. I say
that is just so much nonsense, because these
people are comparative shoppers as to the
price they are going to pay for merchandise.
Why would they suddenly cease to be able
to exercise the same ability and appreciation
when they are told what the dollar repayment
cost is, and why would they have to have
this additional stick to lean on, and why is

it likely to be of any use to them at all? Even
my friend will not go so far as to say it will
be of use. He says these people would be less
]ikely to enter into improvident transactions.
On that point I say to him that legislation
which is directed to people who have extravagant views and small pocketbooks, and who
will spend regardless of whether they can
meet future payments or not-in other words,
people who enjoy the present- is not sound.
I submit that the solid purpose behind
legislation should be that it must be in the
public interest, which means the lender as
well as the borrower, and that if the lender
gives the borrower everything that is pertinent to the transaction, then to require the
vendor to do the mental gymnastics-and
possibly he might have to engage more help
to do it-is enacting a piece of legislation
that has no useful purpose.
I say further that if the measure passes
into law it will be completely ineffective,
because all that the vendor will have to do
is to set up a finance company as a separate
company. Then if a man buys a car, some
furniture, or other merchandise from a merchant, he goes to the finance company, arranges
to get the money, takes the money and pays
for the merchandise in full, and that transaction is completely outside of this bill. I
point that out to illustrate how narrow this bill
is in its application and how ineffective it
is to accomplish anything. However, I must
thank my friend to the extent that he may
have contributed in part to the interest aroused
by a certain publication. I received many letters from people asking me to support the
bill. Several of the letters contained a clipping from a publication entitled, "WantedTruth in Lending". So you can see how
the catch phrase has got around. I am much
interested in one part of it, where it says:
Write your lawmakers. Let your senators, representatives and members of
Parliament know how you feel about
these bills. Letters, wires, phone calls
and personal contacts are desperately
needed. Unless we, the ordinary credit
union members, act now, these bills may
never become law!
It also helps to contact the committees
studying these bills. In Canada, write
Hon. Senator Salter A. Hayden, Chairman Senate Committee on Banking and
Commerce, House of Parliament, Ottawa,
Canada.
So that accounts for a lot of the mail I
have been getting and I suppose it arises out
of my friend's very happy catch expression
"truth in lending". I say that truth in lending,

NOVEMBER 14, 1962
in its application to this bill in the circumstances that exist, is a complete misnomer.
If it is the wish of the Senate that this
bill go to committee I am not going to oppose it, but I would direct your attention to
the fact that the Royal Commission on Banking and Finance has been sitting for some
time and submissions have already been
made to that commission in relation to this
very matter of disclosure of financial information. It well may be that in that broader
picture in which it is studying the whole
question of banking and financing and financial disclosure the commission could come
up with a real solid approach to this question
that would perhaps be general enough to include some regulation of credit, which really
seems to be the problem and the fact upon
which my friend draws support for his bill,
although his bill does not regulate credit.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I realize that it is difficult to enact legislation to protect the working man. For the
last four years, we of the caisses populaires
have been investigating conditions in this
field of consumer finance, and I hold here a
summary of our report. During our investigation we discovered some terrible conditions arising out of operations of finance organizations, involving interest and finance
charges. Many families in our province of
Quebec are affected.
We studied a little over 1,500 famillesnot wealthy people, not poor people, not
farmers, but only salaried people and wage
earners. We found that some borrowers were
paying 100 per cent for interest, fees and
other charges entering into the cost of a loan.
Over the last two months we have been
studying intensively about 400 families in
relation to their borrowings frorn finance
organizations, and we demonstrated to them
the high interest and other charges they
were paying. These 400 families were very
surprised, and with the exception of two of
them, all the families tried to pay off the
finance companies and thus save their families from discouragement and avoid losing
their homes.
They say it is difficult to calculate interest,
that they cannot calculate as a percentage the
charge made for a loan and so on because
in every contract the charges are different.
For instance, they tell us that if you buy
a new automobile the charge is so much a
month, but if you buy a two or three-year-old
automobile the terms are not the same and
the interest is not the same. In the operation
of our caisses populaires we use a book of
tables to calculate interest. I have the book
here. Let me take the example of a $100
loan repayable in 24 months. The charge

made by a finance company at 24 per cent
interest to repay the loan and interest
amounts to a monthly payment of $5.29. The
total interest for 24 months is $26.96. At
simple interest of 6 per cent to repay the
loan and interest calls for a monthly payment of $4.44, and the total interest for 24
months is $6.56. These tables have been prepared by accountants. This little book shows
what the monthly payments would be for any
loan from $100 to $20,000 at different rates
of interest from 4 per cent to 8 per cent.
Other books are available showing interest
up to 12 per cent. Interest is therefore easy
to calculate; just determine the amount of
the loan and the rate of interest and you
have the figures for interest and capital repayment and so on.
I can tell you that the situation is terrible
for working people, for they are paying as
high as 40 to 48 per cent interest. Our social
work organizations in Lévis have determined
that 75 per cent of cases of family troubles
between wife and husband have their beginnings in financial matters. Trouble is not
long coming when a family is obliged to pay
too high finance charges, more than they
can afford. These people never realize the
total amount that they are going to have to
pay. It is necessary for them to be shown
these figures, and that is the reason we contacted during the last two months those 400
families and discussed with them their problems, and I may say their problems were
absolutely terrible. We were obliged to have
these people come under the Lacombe law
and reorganize their affairs.
I realize we cannot educate people by passing laws. Perhaps we can organize an educational program to control these advertisements broadcast over radio, T.V. and so on,
that people are subjected to every moment of
the day and night-such as, if you chew a
brand of gum you will have good health, or
that people should use a certain type of
product to prevent cancer. I suppose a lot of
people believe everything they hear. People
are mere children, and because they are
children we are obliged to indicate the path
they should follow and, sometimes, we have
to build fences on both sides of the path to
prevent some people falling into the river or
other dangerous places.
My colleague (Hon. Mr. Hayden) is a
very good lawyer, and has explained very
clearly, according to the law, the difficulty of
protecting unwary people. However, I do not
agree that it is impossible to find a way to
protect such people against themselves.
We interviewed one family in which the
husband had an income of $90 a week, but

SENATE
stili that family is in debt to finance organizations to the sum. of $12,000. It is impossible
for him to pay off that debt, and so he is
obliged to go into bankruptcy. His wife is
neyer contented. He had a nice littie home
worth a littie more than $15,000, and bis
wife asked him to seli it and move into a
rented, second-storey apartment. Why? So
they could buy an automobile. The three
children now have nowhere to play, nowhere to breathe fresh air, but madame now
bas an automobile to use.
Very often we do flot realize tbe situation,
but, honourable senators, go amongst the
people, and if you come into contact with the
working class you will realize tbat the situation is terrible, and the economy of the nation
is in the same state.

If instead of paying out 24 per cent interest
a person could save bis capital, at the end
of one year be would earn some interest and
thus have more money. Then he could buy
merchandise to greater advantage, because
when be bas to take tbe money out of bis
own pocket he will be more careful and make
wiser purchases.
I cannot say whether this bill is or is not
workable, but I have explained the situation
as I see it and I cail your attention to the
necessity for educating our poor, working
people, to save tbemn fromn themselves.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate
adjourned.

THE LATE SENATOR BOUCHARD
TRIBUTES

Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,' we
were ail saddened yesterday by the news that
one of our coileagues had passed away. I
speak of the late Senator Telesphore Bouchard,
from Les Laurentides, who died last Tuesday
evening at his home i Montreal.
It was flot my good fortune to know Senator
Bouchard as intimately as many of you ini
this chamber, yet I often saw hlmi and heard
of hlm while I was a member of the House
of Commons. I knew of bis. splendid reputation
and the great respect in wbich he was beld
by his colleagues. He was first nominated to
this chamber in 1944 and, as you know, served
here for more than eighteen years.
Prior to being sumnmoned to the Senate oui
late coileague gave the greater part of his
years in public life to the service of the
people of bis native province and city, that
of St. Hyacinthe, as both a municipal and
provincial representative.
A journalist by profession, Senator Bouchard
was first elected as alderman for the city o!
St. Hyacinthe in 1905, and continued in municipal work until 1944, as city clerk from 1909
to 1912 and as mayor from 1917 to 1944. He
was elected president of the Union o! Canadian
Municipalities in 1918, and was a charter
member of the Union of Quebec Municipalities.
He was for many years a member of the
Legislative Assembly of the province o! Quebec where he occupied the Speaker's chair
and later held two cabinet posts that as
Minister .of Municipal Affairs and as Minister
of Trade and Commerce.
The late senator was widely known throughout the province as a wise and seifless contributor to the public weal of his province
and bis nation for baîf a centuiy. I know
he will be greatly missed by ail honourable
senators, particularly those who worked
closely with hlm over the past eighteen years.
I wish to express to his daughter, to his
relatives and ail his close frlends my deepest
sympathy and, I am suie, the sympathy of al
honourabie senators.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, death has again bereaved us of one of

our coileagues, Senator T. D. Bouchard. Senator Bouchard, Senator Daigle who has passed
away also, and myseif were cailed to the
Senate the same day, March 3, 1944. When
wiil my turn corne? Our Lord wiil decide but
one thing is sure, that day is not too far distant.
In his province, Senator Bouchard was a
controversial figure but he had a remarkable
energy, however, and if we did not always
share his views, we must recognize that most
of them were very sensible and that the proposais he put forth many years ago are being
put into effect today.
Senator Bouchard was o! humble origin
and was raised in a working-class district
tbat hie called tbe "haymarket" district.
He attended grade school at the Girouard academy in bis home town and received
his ciassical instruction at the St. Hyacinthe
seminary, but since his parents could not
afford to pay for his schooling, he had to
work in bis spare trne to earn some money.
He became correspondent for two newspapers,
La Presse and La Patrie, which. enabied hlm
to pay bis tuition fees. He entered the political field at a very eariy age; hie was barely
18 when he started making political speeches
and took Up simultaneously and, I migbt say,
jointiy, two careers, that is, journaiism and
poiitics. At the early age of 24, he was
eiected as alderman o! his city of St. Hyacintbe and he was the town clerk from 1909
to 1912, but that position was too quiet for
hlm, so he re-entered active politics, became
mayor of St. Hyacinthe and remained in office
aimost without interruption from 1917 to
1949. I said aimost without interruption for,
in 1919, he was defeated at the election in
St. Hyacinthe because be advocated pasteurized milk. He wanted ail tbe miik sold by
milkmen in bis city to be pasteurized; be
ralsed a generai outcry and was defeated.
However, be was re-elected two years later
and appiied what he had preached. St. Hyacinthe was the second city in North America
to order milk pasteurization. He was also
one of the first to municipalize the distribution of eiectricity; he bad thermal plants
bult in St. Hyacinthe and generators instaiied
to produce electricity for the city.
It may then be said that what bas just been
decided In Quebec marks the completion of
tbe first project advocated by Senator Bouchard. Hie also became the first chairman of
the Union of Municipalities of the province
of Quebec, and be spared no effort in working
for the Union of Canadian Municipalities, that
is, of ail municipalities in Canada.

SENATE
He was, as has been mentioned, a newspaperman his whole life through. For some
time, he was correspondent for two Montreal
newspapers, but he was also correspondent
for La Tribune, of St. Hyacinthe, and also
for L'Union. He became owner of the latter
around 1903. In 1912, he converted this daily
newspaper into a weekly and gave it the
name of Clairon Maskoutain. It still exists
and a few months ago it celebrated its
golden jubilee. It was perhaps on that occasion that Senator Bouchard made one of
his last public appearances. As a journalist,
he was a fiery polemist who vigorously
attacked his opponents and contradictors.
He was also a champion of free and compulsory education; he claimed that children
should go to school until they were at least
fourteen years old. This is another of the
ideas advocated by Senator Bouchard which
is being implemented even beyond what he
urged at that time.
He was elected to the Quebec legislature
for the first time in 1912 as successor to
another great Canadian, Henri Bourassa, who
had quit politics to found his newspaper
Le Devoir. Mr. Bouchard was re-elected in
1916 and then defeated at the next election,
but was again returned as member in 1923,
1927, 1931 and so on until 1944 when he was
appointed to the Senate. He was Speaker of
the provincial legislature from 1930 to 1936
and that year the Liberal party was defeated.
However, Senator Bouchard, re-elected as
member, became leader of the Liberal party
in the opposition. In 1944, the Hon. Mr.
Godbout became premier of the province
and appointed the Hon. Mr. Bouchard as
Minister of Roads and Public Works. He
proceeded with the plans for highway No. 9
between Montreal and Quebec via St. Hyacinthe and, it is on that route laid out twenty
years ago that the Trans-Canada highway
is being built today.
Called to the Senate, as I said, on March 3,
1944, he became chairman of Hydro Quebec
on April 14 of that year.
Through his death, the province of Quebec
lost an unusual politician. Although at times
our views differed, I must pay tribute to
his great capacity for work and his courage
in expressing his opinions, which he did sometimes with utter frankness.
Until a few years ago, Mr. Bouchard had
been an untiring worker; he would put in
fifteen to eighteen hours on a normal working day. When he was minister in Quebec,

he would arrive at his office at eight in the
morning and leave quite late at night.
We wish to express to his daughter, Cecile,
our deepest and most sincere sympathy.
(Text):
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I wish to join with the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) and the acting
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) in the tributes they have paid so
well and so graciously to the memory of
our late colleague, Senator T. D. Bouchard.
It is true that he suffered from severe illness
for the past fifteen years and so hardly ever
during that time took an active part in the
proceedings of this house; but during his
active career, as my colleague has pointed out,
he was a very vigorous proponent of the
views which he held.
I should like for a minute or two to touch
on some of the aspects of the late senator's
political career which were not mentioned
by my honourable friends. In the first place,
he was a man of great courage and forthright and independent views. Although a
practising Catholic, he was an anticlerical
in the sense that he strongly and steadfastly
opposed clerical interference in matters of
lay politics. In adopting that position he was
following the line laid down by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier in his famous address to the Club
Canadien, in Quebec, on June 26, 1877, in
which Sir Wilfrid set forth the liberal position as to the relative spheres of the Church
and the State. In using the word "liberal"
in that context I am, of course, not referring
to political liberalism but to the liberal
Catholic position as opposed to the extreme
pretensions of the clerical ultramontanes of
that day. These pretensions have long since
disappeared in their extreme form, but they
do crop up again from time to time.
In considering the career of our late colleague, I think this needs to be said: if anybody in the rest of Canada still holds the
view-in my opinion, an utterly mistaken
view-that in the province of Quebec politics
are dominated by the Church, let him reflect
on the career of T. D. Bouchard. Here was
a Catholic who openly fought clerical influence in lay matters and whom the overwhelmingly Catholic population of his own
city of St. Hyacinthe elected and re-elected
as their mayor for an unbroken term of
twenty-seven years.
He and his supporters were upholding-and
I suggest that priests and clergy of all

NOVEMBER 15, 1962
denominations should never forget-the admonition of Our Lord in the New Testament
with regard to the Roman tribute money:
"Render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and unto God the things that are
God's".
There was a second feature of the career
of our late colleague to which my honourable
friend referred a few minutes ago. He was
one of the first supporters of and believers
in public ownership of hydro-electrie power
in the province of Quebec. As my honourable
friend said, during his term as mayor of
his native city of St. Hyacinthe he municipalized the electric power and light distribution system in that community.
In the year 1944 when he retired from
the Godbout cabinet he was named to and occupied for a time the position of first head
of Hydro-Quebec. He was, as I say, a strong
supporter of public ownership of hydro-electric power in our province.
It occurred to me as most regrettable, that
it was not given to our colleague to live just
a few days longer to realize the overwhelming
endorsement of public ownership of hydroelectric power which his old electors of the
province of Quebec gave at yesterday's elections.
That thought brought back to my mind, and
I hope honourable senators will forgive me
for referring to it, an incident that occurred
many years ago when I was a boy in England. It was the time of the English general
election of December 1905, when the Conservative Balfour Government which had
been in power for ten years went to the
polls. I had a close friend who was a Liberal
candidate at that election in one of the Yorkshire industrial constituencies; and, as some
of my honourable friends are no doubt aware,
in Yorkshire-particularly in Yorkshirepolitical convictions run very deep and very
strong. I went to stay with my friend in
Yorkshire for a few days prior to the election
and I shall never forget an incident that
happened when I was accompanying him on
visits to his constituents. We went to a
modest house where there was an old man
lying in bed. He was ill with cancer and the
days of life remaining to him could perhaps
be counted on the fingers of one hand. When
we went into the room this old man took hold
of my friend's hand and said to him, "Sir, I
have only one thing left to wish for in this
life, and that is that I shall live long enough
to see you elected to Parliament next week."
Well, my friend was elected to Parliament,
but whether the old man had his wish or
not I never found out.
That recollection crossed my mind when
thinking how appropriate it would have been
27511-5-17

had our late colleague, Senator Bouchard,
been able to live for a few more days to
hear the result of yesterday's elections in
the province of Quebec, in so far as his
support of public ownership of electric power
is concerned.
There was a third feature of the character
of Senator Bouchard. He was in every sense
of the word a broad-minded Canadian.
Though proud of our province and tenacious
to its rights he could in no wise have been
called a nationalist, in the sense in which
we use that word in the province of Quebec.
Still less could he have been called a separatist, and I am quite certain that he would
have regarded the separatist doctrine with
unqualified horror. He firmly believed, as I
think all of us in this house do, that the
two great races from which Canada is sprung
should walk side by side in mutual tolerance
and understanding along the road that destiny
has opened for us. Indeed, for some years he
was the head of an organization-the name
of which now escapes me-the purpose of
which was devoted to increasing mutual
tolerance and understanding among the different sections of our country.
As my honourable friend has said, Senator
Bouchard was of humble origin. His grandfather was a water carrier, and at the time
of Senator Bouchard's death he was just completing, or it may be that he had just completed, his memoirs entitled, "Souvenirs d'un
petit-fils de porteur d'eau"--"Recollections of
a Grandson of a Water Carrier." But regardless of his origin, the example of the life
and career of Senator Bouchard shows what
courage, perseverance and sterling character
can do in the service of one's province. He
is an example to the young of our province,
and I can assure honourable senators that in
that province the name of Teddy Bouchard
will not soon be forgotten.
It only remains for me to join with my
honourable friends in expressing to his only
survivor, his daughter Cecile who nursed
him devotedly for the last fifteen years, and
who as a personality in her own right earned
the decoration of M.B.E. for service during
the war, our most sincere condolences.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
was among those who listened to the maiden
speech of Senator Bouchard in this chamber.
There were many in the province of Quebec
who were displeased with it, but he has
since been proved right. Just as the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Huges.
sen) has said, Senator Bouchard belleved the
two great races should work together. About
the time he was appointed there was a certain
movement of which he did not approve, and
he spoke out courageously against it in this

SENATE

chamber. As a result he was ostracized,
abused, and even accused of leaving his
Church, which he declared he had not done
and never would do.
Once when I visited him I remarked, "You
have made the most expensive and, perhaps,
the best speech that bas ever been made in
the Senate of Canada. That is the value of
the Senate. Were you seeking election, these
are things you could not very well say. You
spoke your mind." At that time he had just
been appointed chairman of the Quebec Hydro
at $18,000 a year, but as a result of that
speech he was immediately dismissed.
Those who knew Senator Bouchard only
after his health had failed saw but an image
of his former self. When first appointed to
the Senate he was as fine a figure of a man
as you could wish to find in all Canada.
Doubtless, he never developed his frame and
muscle by idleness.
Perhaps at the risk of being misunderstood,
I thought I should say just a word in remembrance of a man who, I believe, accomplished
much.

now, honourable senators. The removal of
tolls on the Welland Canal, in my opinion,
has nothing to do with the ports of Saint

and projects in a realistic manner, and advise
only after careful consideration had been
given to all the facts, and not on preconceived
ideas or prejudice.
In the course of his address he set forth
six recommendations or principles that he felt
the board should follow in its operations. I
believe they are good principles, and deserve
to be carefully studied by the board when it
comes into existence.
Yes, honourable senators, this proposed Atlantic Development Board can give valuable
service. It can be of real assistance in helping
to solve the economic problems of our area.
But, in itself it cannot, and should not, be
regarded as some kind of super agency which
can find an easy and quick solution to these
long-standing, difficult and complicated problems. I hope, and I believe, the proposed board
will be successful in its efforts, and it will
certainly deserve all the support that can be
given to it.
Honourable senators, in speaking of this
proposed board I would not want to leave the
impression that nothing has been done by
federal governments in the past for the Atlantic region. Let me acknowledge at once
that much bas been done. In Nova Scotia, for
example, our coal industry has been assisted
by federal governments for many years, and
so has our steel industry, our fishing industry
and, indeed, many others. We have benefited
also by the federal contribution to the building of the Trans-Canada Highway and other
federal projects. In recent years we have
benefited by the Roads to Resources Program,
by the special Atlantic Provinces Adjustment
Grants, by the increased coal subvention payments, by the Atlantic Provinces Power Development Act.
While acknowledging all these, I think it
can be rightfully claimed that the people of
the Atlantic area have been doing much to
help themselves. I give you again the example
of Nova Scotia where the people, through
their government, have made vigorous efforts
to attract secondary industry and to help
established industry. Some years ago the
Liberal government of that day established a
Department of Trade and Industry, which
was presided over at one time by one of our
colleagues, the honourable senator from Halifax North (Hon. Mr. Connolly).
In passing I will say, as one who is opposite
him in political beliefs, that he presided over
that department with vigour, and energy, and
he was responsible for establishing some industry in Nova Scotia.
When the Conservative government came
into office in that province it continued this
department, and tried to strengthen it. It also

set up a crown corporation called Industrial
Estates Limited to attract secondary industry
to the province, and it has had some success.
My point is that it is apparent strenuous
efforts have been made and are being made
by our own people to find solutions to our
economic problems. Just this year, at the
last session of the Legislature of Nova
Scotia, a new department of government was
established. The minister in charge is known
as the Minister of Finance and Economics.
As Minister of Finance he has taken over the
duties of the former Provincial Treasurer;
as Minister of Economics he is responsible
for economic planning. I should add at once,
that by economic planning is meant voluntary
economic planning, whereby all groups interested in any way in a certain industry
would be invited to come together to see
if they could not make plans for the future
development and good of that industry.
I understand this type of planning has been
tried in France with real success. The Nova
Scotia proposal is based on that French plan
and the experience gained under it. I further
understand that the first industry on which
this type of voluntary planning will be tried
is the farming and agricultural industry of
Nova Scotia. I am informed that the minister
bas invited to a meeting representatives of
all those in any way connected with the
growing, packing, financing and distribution of agricultural products in Nova
Scotia. I also am informed that he has been
highly gratified by the response he has
received so far.

I believe that this is a realistic and
practical effort to assist the promotion of
industry in Nova Scotia, a method which
bas much to commend it and which holds
much promise for the future.
Honourable senators, I mention this latest
development in Nova Scotia to show you
that we are making great efforts there to
help ourselves. I mention it also because
I feel that you received a very dismal
verbal picture of conditions in our province
in the speech delivered yesterday by the
honourable senator from Queens-Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Smith). Indeed, after listening to
him I felt sad and depressed. I asked myself
whether conditions in Nova Scotia were as
bleak as he pictured them. I left this chamber
in a gloomy mood. However, that mood did
not last long. When I went to my office I
read yesterday's edition of the Chronicle
Herald, published in Halifax. I should like
to read a few quotations from it. The first
thing I noticed was this headline on page 16,
"Japan's NYK Line opens Halifax Service".
The article commences:

NOVEMBER 15, 1962
The Far East has discovered Halifax
in a big way. Japan's biggest shipping
line-the NYK which commands a fleet
of 86 ships, all built since the end of the
war-Tuesday inaugurated a service to
Halifax.
Further on it says:
Japan in its search for export markets
has found the Atlantic provinces a worthwhile proposition. Even though there are
only two million people in the area, they
have a relatively high purchasing power,
and provide a steady market for Japanese
toys, radios, cameras, textiles and other
manufactured products.
At page 9 of the same issue there is a
story concerning the dynamic growth of the
Eastern Paper Products Limited, a Saint
John, New Brunswick, firm which has opened
a new plant in Halifax.
On page 3 I saw another headline, "Cape
Breton Miners lead in Savings Bond Purchases", under which these words appear:
Cape Breton coal miners, who have
a long-standing habit of capturing the
headlines, have done it again.
This time they show the way to most
Canadians in the matter of investing in
Canada Savings Bonds.
On page 2 of the same issue I see a dispatch
from Sydney, which states:
Sydney Credit Union assets increased

Having read that interesting edition of the
Halifax paper, I began to feel better. My
temporary mood of gloom, or of impending
doom, was lifted.
I looked at other items in other issues of
the same newspaper. In the issue for October
24 last, I notice this headline: "Halifax Unloads the Most". The article goes on to give
statistics of the amount of cargo unloaded
in Nova Scotia from foreign ports and loaded
also for foreign ports. It states that the vast
majority of the tonnage loaded and unloaded
was at the port of Halifax.
In the issue for October 19 there was
another interesting headline. "Pulpwood
Production in Nova Scotia Up". That news
item reads:
Pulpwood production in Nova Scotia
during August rose by 18 per cent over
the previous month and was up slightly
from production in the same month a
year ago, according to a Dominion
Bureau of Statisties report released

Production in August, 1962, stood at
28,779 rough cords, 4,463 higher than in
July, 1962, and 1,500 higher than in the
same month a year ago.

May I also read from the issue of October
24, under the caption, "Building Activity up

SENATE

Honourable senators, to make my record
complete I will read the Chronicle Herald
of October 6, 1962 under the caption, "More
People Working in Cape Breton":
A 10 per cent increase in placements
for the first nine months of this year
was reported Friday by Sydney Office of
the National Employment Service.
Honourable senators, I do not, of course,
contend that all is well with the economy
of Nova Scotia. We all know we have onerous
and difficult problems. However, I do plead
that we should face up to them and not
let them overwhelm us. I do not feel that
it serves any good or useful purpose to look
only on the dark side of things. We should
try to sec things exactly as they are without
being either too optimistic or too pessimistic.
Much as I dislike to have to disagree with
my good friend the senator from QueensShelburne (Hon. Mr. Smith), I feel he has
been taking too pessimistic an attitude, and
that in his speech yesterday he gave too
sad and melancholy a story as to the conditions in Nova Scotia. I feel he exaggerated
the difficulties and minimized our advantages.
Of course, it may be that he was speaking
only of the part he mentioned as being North
Queens; but if the conditions he pictured are
the conditions of that locality, then I say
I do not think they are true of the whole
of Nova Scotia.
I think I must also, in the most kindly
way, disagree with him in his criticism that
money spent on public highways in Nova
Scotia could better be spent on something
else.
Hon.

Mr.

Smith

(Queens-Shelburne):

I

wonder if my honourable friend will allow
me to make a comment. I did not say that
the money could better be spent on something else. Highways, of course, are necessary-and good highways. The point I tried
to make yesterday was that the kind of
highways that were being built in some areas
of which I had some knowledge were too
good and too high priced for the traffic they
carry now or ever will carry.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Cer-

tainly I accept the statement of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): It is

on the record.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Yes, it

is on the record, and I would not want to
give the impression that my honourable
friend said something which he did not say.
However, what he has just said points up
the difference in our respective attitudes.
Personally, I believe that the people of Nova

Scotia, no matter where they live, are entitled
to the best highways that can be given to
them.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): Hear,

hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I will

pass without comment the criticism he had
about the Liquor Commission in Nova Scotia
constructing new stores and a modern office
building. I suppose he refers to Halifax North,
but I must say, from my slight knowledge
of the people of Halifax North and those who
represent them in Parliament and in the
Legislature of Nova Scotia, that I agree they
are just as entitled as anyone else to the
finest buildings that can be constructed.
Honourable senators, as I have already said,
we in Nova Scotia have our problems and
difficulties but we have not lost faith in ourselves or in our province. We are not afraid;
we are not fearful of the future. I am confident that our people are determined to do
their best to make Nova Scotia a better place
for all who live there. Of course, everything
does not lie within their power to do so.
We seek assistance from the federal authorities, but we do not seek it on bended knee;
we seek it as a right, as our due, since we
are a part of Canada. Nova Scotia bas made
and is making ber contribution to Canada as a
whole. On three occasions we have given
Canada its Prime Minister and we have given
men and women to other high offices in the
state. We have made our contribution not
only to the state, but to the church, to finance,
to industry, to national labour unions, and
to education. We are proud and happy to
have done so, and we expect to continue to
make such contributions, but we do ask the
federal authority to help us find a permanent
solution to our economic problems, and we
believe we shall receive that help.
At the risk of being considered partisan,
I feel bound to say that we have received
much from the present Government. The
present Prime Minister has shown a tremendous understanding of our problems.
When I look back over the past five years
and recall the Atlantic Provinces Adjustment
Grants, the assistance given to our coal industry, the Atlantic Provinces Power Development Act, and the vast program of public
works which bas been carried on in Nova
Scotia, then, honourable senators, I am thankful that the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker bas been Prime Minister of Canada and
the Honourable George Nowlan, that great
Nova Scotian, has been the minister from our
province.

HON. CALVERT C. PRATT
WELCOME

ON RETURN TO CHAMBER AFTER
ILLNESS

Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: Honourable senators, I intend to deal only with the principal
provisions of the bill. One of its purposes is
to implement the resolution brought down in
April of last year by the then Minister of
Finance to increase the exemptions under the
Income Tax Act for dependent children by
$50 per annum, bringing the exemption to
$550 for children not entitled to the family
allowance and to a lesser figure for those
entitled to the family allowance. The bill
includes the appropriate provision for the
same exemption in respect to children of
immigrants who are not yet entitled to the
family allowance but who are entitled to
family assistance. It is estimated that this
will take some 80,000 taxpayers off the
Canadian tax rolls.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I am sure we are all very pleased and
happy that the honourable senator from St.
John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) is with us

NOVEMBER 20, 1962
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To which section does
the honourable senator refer?
Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: Commencing with
section 15. Honourable senators will observe
that there are provisions whereby research
can be done by one corporation for another
corporation, and the corporation that is paying for the research will obtain the benefit of
the tax relief.
Hon. Mr. Prai: If a newly-formed company,
just starting out, does research as part of its
process, but is not yet making any money, can
it in those circumstances get any allowance?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It has to earn the
allowance.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Yes, it has to earn
the allowance, but the carry-forward provisions in the bill will provide for the
research allowance.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Would the carry-forward
provisions apply for a long period?
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: For the normal
period. I think it is five years, but I am not
sure.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Only the capital part is
carried forward.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Yes; but the other is
lost anyway.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The current expenditures
are lost.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: The current expenditures are carried forward like any other
loss; and the capital account can be carried
forward in the saine way as depreciation can
and be taken in any year in which it suits
the taxpayer to take it, subject, of course, to
the maximum amount allowable in any one
year.
There are appropriate recapture provisions
included in the bill, in the event that research
facilities which have earned the 150 per cent
allowance are subsequently disposed of.
There is a provision in the bill to allow the
10 per cent allowance against corporation tax
in provinces which do not receive university
grants, the only one at the moment being the
province of Quebec.
The provincial logging taxes which heretofore have been allowed as a deduction from
income are now being taken care of in a
different form. Companies which are subject
to the logging tax in the two provinces which
now impose it will, in lieu of being allowed
a deduction from income, be allowed a deduction from tax equal to two-thirds of the
provincial tax or 10 per cent of their income
from logging operations, whichever is the
less.
27511-5-18

There are a number of quite complicated
sections commencing with section 19, providing for allowance of expenses for exploration for gas and oil, and making more
generous the allowances that are made to
companies engaged principally in those businesses. This is another incentive provision, the
purpose being to encourage development of ou
reserves particularly. No large oil discoveries
have been made in recent years, and it is
considered in the national interest that there
should be a special incentive for corporations
to step up their exploration policy.
The bill goes further, however, in that it
now makes provision, subject to certain limitations, depending upon the amount of income
derived from oil or gas wells, for the charging off of these expenses by corporations
not normally engaged in the petroleum industry. It is common in one other jurisdiction
at least for companies not normally engaged
in this industry to engage in it, and they are
entitled to the same tax benefits as those companies which are engaged principally in that
business. The bill makes provision for such
companies. It also makes provision for individuals to charge off, within the limits of
the bill, expenses incurred in their oil and
gas drilling operations. There is provision
that two or more companies operating a joint
venture may be allowed to charge off against
their income from the oil and gas business
their proportionate share of the expenses of
the joint venture. And there are provisions
dealing with successor corporations, and so
on.
The next important item in the bill is the
exemption of companies engaged principally
in the mining of iron ore from the 15 per cent
tax imposed on profits earned in Canada
by non-resident corporations. These companies,
by virtue of the very nature of their business
and the substantial amounts of capital that
have to be raised in order to put them in the
business, are unable to be incorporated in
Canada, and they, of course, pay the full corporation tax on their operations in Canada. It
was felt that they should not be subject to
this special tax which was imposed in December 1960.
Then there are several provisions which
merely extend benefits already in existence
and which, in effect, make provision for the
portability of pensions under certain circumstances. Heretofore, the law has provided
that if an individual withdrawing from one
approved pension plan deposits the moneys
that he has withdrawn-which otherwise
would be subject to tax in his hands-in
another approved pension plan within a certain period of time, they are not taxable.

SENATE
The bill provides the same exemption for
withdrawals from one deferred profit-sharing
plan credited to another deferred profitsharing plan, or withdrawals from one registered retirement savings plan credited to
another registered retirement savings plan,
or to a registered pension fund. In other
words, the self-employed individual, or the
professional man, who has been making provision for his retirement through a registered
retirement savings plan and who becomes an
employee, can take his savings out of the
former plan and deposit them in the company's pension plan without being liable
for tax.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is the number of the
relevant clause?
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is on page 19.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Section 17 commences on page 18.
Perhaps it is unnecessary for me to say
that the act includes a number of what are
called consequential
and administrative
amendments. I would be very happy to give
such explanation as I can to any honourable
senator, but I think the best explanations will
be obtained when the bill is before the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Could the honourable
senator explain the purpose of back-dating
this bill to April 1l?
Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: The purpose of
dating it back to April 11, or April 10, is
that the Budget Speech was delivered in the
House of Commons on April 10 and, as a rule,
amendments to corporate income tax and
personal income tax made when a budget is
brought down relate to the taxpayer's fiscal
year. Other amendments become effective as
of the date of the budget resolutions, and
these resolutions were brought down on
April 10, 1962. To give one simple example
with respect to the increased deductions for
dependants, people have all this year assumed
that that was going to be their tax position.
Deductions have been made at reduced rates
by numerous firms on the basis of the budget
resolutions, and all this bill does is to put
the law in the same position as it would
have been had this bill been introduced
in May 1962, and passed at that time.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, this is a very complicated bill. I have
seen many of them over the years that I have
been here, and they seem to become increasingly complicated. I hope I can demonstrate,
before I sit down, just some of the complexity involved, and possibly this very complexity might be the springboard from which

we could move into an era favouring a little
more simplicity in our tax measures.
Let me illustrate the point I am making.
My friend referred to the production incentive, which was budget resolution 2 in the
budget of last April, and when I read the
resolution I thought it was reasonably simple.
It says:
That with respect to income earned
after March 31, 1962 a corporation whose
principal business is manufacturing or
processing (not including a corporation
whose principal business is shipbuilding,
mining, logging or the operation of oi
or gas wells) be allowed to deduct from
its tax otherwise payable an amount
equal to 50 per cent of the tax on the
first $50,000 of its taxable income attributable to increased sales and an amount
equal to 25 per cent of the tax on the
remiainder of its taxable income so
attributable.
That made sense. Maybe it is my peculiar
type of intelligence, but I thought I understood that. But then when I read six or seven
or eight pages of this bill, and see what
really has been done in the way of complicating it, I might even be prepared to
support a rule that possibly we should adopt
the budget resolution dealing with this business of production incentive and forget about
the several pages of this bill dealing with it.
Let me illustrate further what I mean. You
will see by looking at the bill that its drafters
presumably considered you would not be able
to work out the formula, and so they decided
to give a couple of examples of how the
formula works. One such example appears
in the explanatory notes opposite pages 6
and 7. They took two companies, Company A
and Company B, and for Company A the
example deals with an increase in sales of
$100,000, and for Company B it deals with
an increase in sales of $1,000,000, to show
how the formula would work in relation to
the 50 per cent tax credit and the 25 per
cent tax credit. But then when they have the
formula evolved, and have applied all the
factors of the formula to the case of Company A, you get at the bottom of the page
what the tax saving would be under the
circumstances related to Company A. Dealing with an increase in sales of $100,000 in
the year, it would produce a tax saving of
$1,230.
Then in the case of Company B, where the
increase in sales is assumed at $1,000,000, if
you follow that through to the right-hand
side of page 7 you will see that the aggregate
of the tax savings, and therefore the incentive, is the combination of 50 per cent

NOVEMBER 20, 1962
of the tax attributable to those sales, and
also 25 per cent on the balance. There you
get an aggregate savings of $11,275 in relation to an increase in sales of $1,000,000.
Now, I would think that many people who
have a $50,000 increase in sales in a year
might find that the saving effected would be
perhaps $1,000, which would just about pay
the lawyer's and accountant's fees for making
the necessary calculations.
An Hon. Senator: You can't hire lawyers
that cheap.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was just going to say
I am not opposed to work developing for
lawyers, and I could not, of course, put
myself in the range of my friend, the sponsor
of the bill, who indicated he had a range
that $1,000 would not satisfy, and therefore
the client who wanted some help under this
section would have to go to a person like
myself or some other honourable senator here
who would not have that high a scale.
But to me the resolution, in the language
of the Minister of Finance when he was
explaining it, seemed simple. He said:
I am bringing forward in this budget
a plan to use tax incentives to induce
increased production and employment.
This will provide encouragement for
private industry in its search for new and
expanding markets.
I say that if an increase of $100,000 in
sales in a year will produce a tax saving of
only $1,230, it is not a tremendous inducement to go out and promote increases in
sales. My suggestion would be the most
simple approach to this. I think what has
happened here is that the drafters of this
bill have said, "We must go down a very
narrow line on what the real tax saving is".
They then produce a formula which ends up
with $1,230.
It would be a more realistic and simpler
approach, and one that would be a real
incentive, if they said that where sales are
increased by $50,000 or $100,000 over the
previous year or over the last two or three
years, or whatever period may be considered
the base, it is to be assumed that that extra
$50,000 or $100,000 is revenue from sales and
therefore taxable income. It would be more
realistic to forget all about the six or seven
pages of the bill as to how the revenue is cut
down until it becomes taxable income, and
just make the assumption that the revenue
from the increase in sales is taxable income,
and since we know that the corporate rate is
52 per cent it would give the benefit of a 26
per cent rate on that additional amount. That
27511-5-18J

at least has the virtue of simplicity. It may
be depriving lawyers and accountants of
some fees, but it is quite simple. It would be
a real inducement where you are looking for
expanding production and the creation of
more jobs, to take that kind of an approach.
We are not, in my submission, playing fast
and loose with the revenues of the country
in doing it because we hope to encourage a
larger volume of business. The taxpayer and
the treasury will benefit from the increase in
business. The taxpayer will benefit in a way
that makes the whole exercise something
worth while.
The only other comment I have to make
on this is that at the time of the Budget
Speech it was indicated that there would be
some special rules covering corporate reorganizations so that the resolution would
apply equitably in all circumstances, but to
date we have not seen what those are. Therefore, we accept this resolution which is now
in the form of a bill, and if it passes into law
we will accept it in that way, and we will
wait until a later date to see what are the
regulations that will deal with the infinite
variety of situations that can develop.
The other resolution that my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. McCutcheon) spoke about
was with respect to scientific research. This
does mark a departure from our approach to
taxation and to tax laws in Canada, for I
think this is the first time that provision has
been made for a deduction from income in
excess of 100 per cent of the expense. This
is the first time we have done it here, and
it is on a trial basis. It runs for a period of
four or five years.
We should know that what this really does
is to extend from 100 per cent to 150 per
cent the deductions which you may be
allowed in relation to scientific research. But,
for the extra 50 per cent, if you invest that
in capital assets for the purpose of working
your research, which you subsequently sell,
then there is a recapture. What you get goes
back into income to the extent of 50 per cent
of this deduction. So we are again faced with
this principle of recapture which runs through
our law now in relation to depreciation
whereby if you subsequently sell and make
a gain there can be recapture. There can be
recapture out of the gain to the extent of the
depreciation that you have written off.
Honourable senators, this recapture is dealt
with in respect of scientific research, and I
have the greatest difficulty in bringing myself
to a proper approach to this question of recapture. In my opinion, to make an allowance
by way of a write-off and then call that back
into income at some date in the future is, I
think, an entirely wrong concept of tax law.

SENATE
However, so far as scientific research is concerned, this possibly marks the beginning of
a policy or a plan that we may find applied
in other directions.
On that basis I should tell you that this
business of allowing in excess of 100 per cent
of the cost is something that has worked very
satisfactorily in many European countries.
Therefore, where we seem to be bogging
business down with high rates of taxation
and then trying to devise incentives to lighten
the load, and having the income tax authorities in their establishment of what the
law is in decided cases, whittling away at the
benefit you think you have under the law, I
suggest an interim solution lies in increasing
what I call the nontaxable factors recognized
as costs before profit is arrived at. This
method has a vogue in European countries,
and the popular forms, in addition to depreciation allowances and other write-offs,
are in investment reserve allowances and in
depreciation reserve allowances. I commend
them very much for the consideration of the
Government.
The investment reserve is a nontaxable
reserve permitted to be deducted before
determination of profit, subject to later use
by the company with Government sanction
for capital business investment without being
subject to recapture into income. Depreciation
reserve permits the deduction of some percentage in excess of the cost of the depreciable
capital asset.
These are really tax exemptions, but in the
result the taxpayer is provided with nontaxable reserves for expansion and replacement on a more realistic basis. Informed
sources suggest that these incentives contributed greatly to the resurgence of European
economies.
In Canada we have moved in that direction
for the first time in allowing in excess of 100
per cent of the amount of the cost in this field
of scientific research. I suggest that we should
not stop there, that we should examine very
carefully these other areas that I have
indicated.
I would point out that even our good
neighbour to the south bas now come to lean
in that direction, because it appears that this
depreciation reserve method bas gained
recognition in the United States where the
President's program before the last Congress
had two major means directed to the end of
achieving a more vigorous economy, namely,
depreciation reserve and investment credit.
I want to speak about investment credit.
Investment credit is a reduction in tax equal

to 8 per cent of the amount spent on machinery and equipment. The entire cost of the
asset may still be depreciated in the regular
way.
I was pleased to be able to find a peg on
which I could hang those observations, because they have been views I have held for
some time in trying to find an approach to
this heavy burden of taxation. This is one
way. If we cannot have tax reductions as
such, then possibly in the area of nontaxable
factors and the creation of benefits of this
kind by allowing these special reserves, both
investment credits and depreciation reserves,
we may give some relief to industry so that it
will have the resources and the ability within
itself to finance more of its operations.
I want to speak next about Budget Resolution 6 to which my honourable friend referred.
My friend suggested, as I have it noted, that
the purpose of this resolution, and the several
pages of the bill that covers it, is to encourage
development of oil reserves, and that this is
a special incentive. I think a careful analysis
of these provisions-that is, if you get into
them and really understand them-will convince you that they do not quite accomplish
that end. I think the singing is in a much
higher key than that of the actuality.
Resolution 6 is alleged to assist the oil
industry by granting the right to a corporation in computing its income to deduct
exploration expenses incurred in exploring
or drilling for petroleum or natural gas in
Canada and in exploring for minerals in Canada, not exceeding its income for the year
from oil or gas wells in Canada. Companies
whose principal business was and is oil, gas
or mining have always had the right to write
off their exploration expenses. Therefore,
there is nothing new in this particular aspect
of it.
However, the proposed change in the law is
that these amendments are not confined to
oil, gas and mining companies whose principal
business is the production of oil and gas.
These provisions are extended by this bill
to allow a company which has income from
oil and gas operations-even though that is
not its principal business-to use the income
from those sources and write off against it
the cost of exploration and development work
in oil and gas fields. However, a mining
company which has no oil or gas income but
which wishes to do some oil and gas exploration may not use any of its income to take
care of those exploratory expenses.
Honourable senators, I do not see how these
proposed amendments give any assistance to
the oil companies whose principal business
now is in the oil and gas fields; but it enlarges
the area of those who may make use of oil

NOVEMBER 20, 1962
and gas income for purposes of exploration
in oil and gas. Perhaps that assistance can
be demonstrated in committee, but it is difficult for me to see it now.
Honourable senators, there are some features of the bill which may cause grave concern. For instance, if I acquirea lease or a
right to explore for oil and gas, after this bill
becomes law what I expend on the acquisition becomes part of my exploration and development cost, and therefore I write it off
against my income from oi and gas operations. On the other hand, if I dispose of it
at some later date, the proceeds of the disposition are brought back into my income. This
is another illustration, similar to that which
I cited earlier this evening, of giving with the
one hand and, years later, taking away with
the other hand.
It seems to me that where there is a gain
on the sale of oil and gas leases, whether that
gain is a capital transaction or an income
transaction, it should be determined by the
situation as it exists at that time. The position should not be that in all cases the acquisition cost is considered as part of the exploration and development and that, if at
some later date the holder disposes of any
part of the lease the proceeds of that disposition must be brought into income.
Since there may be some merit in this
proposal, which I fail to see at the moment,
and since I think there is merit in the existing law on those points, my suggestion is
that there should be a right of election to the
company, either to proceed on the basis that
the acquisition cost is an expense and deductible and that the proceeds of disposition
are income and are included in income, or
to proceed on the basis that the company may
treat it as a capital expense.
Honourable senators, from what I have
said, you can see that this is a complicated
bill. I think it is too complicated for the
purpose which it seeks to accomplish. In
other words, we are attempting so many
refinements in the many pages of this bill
that they block out every avenue of possible
advantage to the taxpayer in relation to what
was intended to be given by the bill. So far
as I can see, the oil companies whose principal business is oil and gas operations are not
being given much and yet it has taken many
pages to circumscribe it.
Honourable senators, those are the three
main resolutions on which I wish to comment. The only other point on which I wish
to touch at this time is that to which the
honourable senator from Gormley (Hon. Mr.
McCutcheon) referred, namely, the section
which deals with the transfer of credits under

a registered retirement savings plan to another registered retirement savings plan or
registered pension plan. We know that
amounts received out of a registered retirement savings plan prior to maturity are subject to a minimum tax of 25 per cent, whereas
amounts received under a pension plan
usually are subject to a tax at very beneficial
rates under section 36-that is where the
averaging of the tax rate over a period of
three years comes in.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: It may be more or
less than 25 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, but I would say
that, with respect to most of the people who
would be in this area, it would be substantially less than 25 per cent. In view of the
fact that I could transfer from a registered
retirement savings plans to a registered pension plan and then afterwards take the money
out of the pension plan, I would get the
benefit of a lower rate.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: It demonstrates what
I said about the ingenuity of the taxpayer.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I feel this is so obvious
that I could not credit any exercise of ingenuity as being responsible for that answer.
In my opinion, it would make good sense
to allow payments prior to maturity from
a registered retirement savings plan to be
subject to tax under section 36, rather than
make an apparent attempt to impose what I
would call a punitive payment under section
39. I submit that also for the consideration
of the Government.
Honourable senators, it would only add to
confusion if I attempted any further elaboration of the provisions of this bill. For some
time I have thought about many other matters relative to income tax, but rather than
use this bill as a peg on which to hang them
I think I should discuss them on some other
occasion. I think there is a correlation in tax
reduction, tax incentives, and the enforcement proceedings for the collection of income
taxes but that the three are puilling in opposite
directions, and that the tug-of-war is at the
expense of the taxpayer. The taxpayer, by
this bill, appears to gain something as a
matter of law and the production incentives
provided look as though a great opportunity
were held out for the manufacturer to increase his sales, but then you find that he is
boxed in and cut down. On the other hand,
one finds at least two provisions in the bill
which in my view turn out to be not what
the taxpayer may have thought they meant,
or perhaps not what his legal adviser may
have told him they meant. The result is that
the taxpayer finds that what he thought was
a benefit is cut down.

SENATE
At another time, when it becomes more
opportune, I should like to develop in more
detail the view I hold with regard to those
three forces pulling in opposite directions,
but perhaps for the present I have said
enough, or possibly too much.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think we are indebted to the minister (Hon.
Mr. McCutcheon) for his explanation of this
bill and that we are also indebted to my
honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) for the remarks which he has just
made.
I have little to say, but I want to reinforce
what the honourable senator from Toronto
said about the difficulty in understanding
income tax legislation as it comes to us year
by year.
Here, as the minister said, were a few
fairly simple and easily understood budget
resolutions-nothing very much, no great
changes to be made in the Income Tax Act,
a few minor matters, which I think have
merit in themselves; additional allowances in
certain cases for expenditures for production
of petroleum or natural gas, and additional
allowances for incentives for increased sales.
Yet here, when we come to put into legislative form these comparatively simple resolutions we are now faced with a bill of 37
pages. The provisions dealing with this comparatively simple production incentive for
increased sales cover six pages, pages 6 to il.
The provisions relating to the allowances for
expenditures for petroleum or natural gas
cover all of twelve pages, pages 19 to 30.
Well, we all know the old adage about the
mountain labouring and producing a mouse.
In this case, I think it has been exactly the
reverse-the mouse has laboured and produced a mountain.
It is difficult to know how we can avoid
getting continually greater complexity into
our income tax legislation. I do not know
what we can do about it, but I am wondering
whether something might not be done in
that direction by the Royal Commission on
Taxation, which commenced its sittings fairly
recently, and is in very competent hands. It
would be a great help to the people of this
country as a whole if our income tax legislation could be redrafted in such a form that
it was reasonably easy to understand, without the necessity of the poor taxpayer running, on all occasions, to his accountant and
his lawyer to ask just what it means.

length but ta deal with it as well as we can
at the time, and in greater detail in the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. I am quite sure that that pracedure
will be followed again with respect ta the
present bil.

NOVEMBER 21, 1962
As all honourable senators know, the Estate
Tax Act was passed in 1958. It was the
successor to the Succession Duty Act of that
time. It received much attention in both
Houses of Parliament, and particular attention was given to it by the Senate Banking
and Commerce Committee. I was not a member of the Senate at that time, but I knew
that careful study was given to the bill by
the committee. Many recommendations were
made by the committee at that time, some
of which were then adopted, and I believe
others have since been adopted. Most honourable senators, therefore, are quite familiar
with the nature of this particular bill.
In 1960 other amendments were introduced
in the Senate, and again there was a careful and thorough discussion by members in
this chamber and also in the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
There are not many changes proposed by
this present bill, and I think it speaks fairly
well for the operations of the Estate Tax Act
that there have not been many recommendations for change. It evidently indicates that
the act is a good one. However, as we all
know, experience teaches us that with respect
to all acts passed by Parliament, as time goes
on, changes are needed to meet changing
conditions, recommendations are made for
amendments, and amendments are introduced
to improve the act, to give relief in certain
situations, to clarify others, and to plug loopholes in certain clauses which perhaps are
being abused. This is exactly the purpose of
this particular bill. Most of the changes are
to give relief. There is some clarification and
there are a few loopholes which need to be
plugged, as it were.
This bill, like the income tax bill, will be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce where there will be a
thorough study made of it. The officials of
the department and possibly others will be
there, and if there are any difficulties I know
they will be fully explained at that time. So
in my review of the bill this afternoon I shall
simply make some general remarks and, like
other members, I shaH look forward to a more
detailed study when the bill is before the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
With the consent of honourable members
I would like to take the bill section by section.
Section 1, as you will see from the marginal
note, is to declare the extent of beneficial interest in an annuity arising by survivorship.
The proposed new subsection carries an explanatory note in which it is made clear that
the value of the beneficial interest in any

annuity or other interest purchased or provided by the deceased is to be ascertained
without reference to any interest in expectancy, that is, that the assessed value will
be measured as an interest in possession only
at the time of the death of the deceased.
Section 2 deals with charitable organizations. This section puts an organization which
makes gifts to government at all levels in
the same category as any other charitable
organization, so that those gifts can be deducted from the taxable estate.
As honourable senators will note, subsection
2 simply extends the existing one-year time
limit to two years, as is indicated in the
underlined words. Subsection 3 makes it clear
that the words "two years after the death of
the deceased", as stated in subsection 2, apply
to the estate of persons who die after the
coming into force of this act. This subsection
is a retroactive provision and makes it clear
that cases where death occurred after January
1959, when the act came into force, will also
be included.
Section 3 bas to do with situs. This bas
been a most difficult matter, as all honourable
senators who have had anything to do with
the Estate Tax Act well know. Though from
merely reading it over the meaning seems
quite difficult to understand, I think I am
safe in saying that its effect is that if the
deceased was domiciled anywhere other than
in those provinces which have a succession
duty-that is, other than Ontario and Quebec-the estate tax on securities is reduced
by 50 per cent abatement, if the securities
have to be transferred in Ontario or Quebec.
If they can be transferred in his own province-that is, if the deceased were domiciled
in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, or any
place other than Ontario or Quebec-the
estate bas to pay the full tax. I think honourable senators will find that is the effect of
clause 3.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What does the word "situs"
mean?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: "Situation" or "the place".
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The place where it is
situated.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Clause 4. This amendment
makes it possible for the taxpayer, before an
assessment is issued, to file a waiver permitting the minister to re-assess after the
four-year limit on re-assessments has passed.
A four-year limitation period is provided by
the law at the present time. If the taxpayer
waives the minister's four-year limitation the
minister will give the estate notice of assessment at once, and the portion of the estate
not in dispute can be distributed. One of the

SENATE
reasons for this is to assist the administration
of estates where pending litigation might extend over the four years.
Clause 5 is a simple clause, though it is
quite extensive. As we all know, diplomats'
estates are not taxed as property owned in
Canada as regards possessions required for
their work here. This amendment affords the
same courtesy to a foreign official or representative working in Canada for one of the
specialized agencies of the United Nations. A
good example of that, I believe, is the case of
an employee of the International Civil Aviation Organization which has its headquarters
in the city of Montreal.
Section 6 is one of the most difficult sections in the bill and probably one of the most
important. Under the present act the department has a statutory lien on the real estate
of a deceased person. In many parts of Canada, I understand, the registry office officials
in the different provinces found it difficult to
give a clear title to property on account of
this lien, and they have requested that a
change be made. Hence, this section provides
that a lien only exists against real estate for
estate tax if the registry records show it
belonged to a deceased person or that he had
an interest in it.
Now subsection 3 on page 5 is, I think,
in response to representations that have been
made from certain provinces, as well as
from the desire to alleviate this difficulty in
the department. Its effect is that where any
province agrees not to allow transfer of
real estate of a deceased person until the
tax office has released its interest in the
same, the minister's lien does not attach.
That is, if the province or the registry office
will guarantee that no transfer of property
will be recorded until a release is obtained
from the department, the statutory lien will
not attach. I believe Manitoba, Alberta and
British Columbia have on their own account
already agreed to this informally in practice,
and it is to be hoped that the other provinces
will also be in agreement.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How can you safely
purchase real property from an estate if you
are not sure you are going to get a clear
title to it?
Hon. Mr. Croll: If you ask the department
for title they will give it to you.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: This is the difficulty we
are trying to correct, and I think if the
honourable senator will look into it carefully
he will see that his own province was one
of the first to ask for this particular section.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: We have had trouble
out there.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: This will help, I am sure.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not know whether

it will or not.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Section 7 simply provides
that, whereas presently only a person who
is on record as an appellant or objector may
obtain information under this clause, any
other person who is entitled to be interested
in the estate can in contemplation of an
appeal get information concerning it from the
minister. It just broadens the provision.
The last section has to do with corporations controlled by a deceased. In the committee, no doubt, we can get much information
as to why this section has been included.
I understand it is on account of abuses
which have arisen. The new definition
is to the effect that if the deceased actually
controls a corporation that is all that matters.
How he controls it, whether by holding a
majority of the corporate stock through a
parent company or in any other way, makes
no difference. The definition of "control by
the deceased" is satisfied if at the time of
his death he is in actual control of the
company.
Honourable senators, there is nothing
further I wish to say regarding the bill, but
I shall endeavour to answer any questions
honourable senators may have.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 15, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Haig, seconded by Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable sena-

tors, while in Vancouver I wrote to my leader
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) stating that
I would like to make a short speech in this
debate, but since arriving in Ottawa and
having a little time on my hands I have discovered so many interesting things that I
think ought to be discussed-things that are
contained in the Speech from the Throne, and
things that are not-that I fear I may trespass on your time longer than I promised my

NOVEMBER 21, 1962
leader I would. However, I have this fact
to plead, that while I make speeches that are
too long I do not make them very often.
First I wish to extend to the new senators
my congratulations on their appointments
to the Senate. I have been a member of this
-chamber for 26 years, and in my opinion a
xnember of the Senate of Canada holds the
finest position it is possible to occupy in the
public life of Canada. It gives one great
responsibility; it gives one much freedom;
and up until the present time it gives one
some security.
I extend also my congratulations to His
Honour the Speaker. It has not been my privilege to know you, Sir, as well as I knew
previous Speakers, but I look forward with
pleasure to developing that acquaintance. I
am sure, from watching you perform your
duties as presiding officer of this chamber,
and from what I have been informed of by
others who know you better, that we can
all look forward to a most satisfactory performance on your part.
In this connection I would like to say a
word about our previous Speaker. He was,
Sir, as you will find, a shining example, and
I know of no member of this chamber who
having sat under his jurisdiction did not
appreciate his ability and his extreme fairness.
Next, I want to congratulate the honourable Leader of the Government in this
house (Hon. Mr. Brooks). He has some outstanding qualifications, the first of which is
that be comes from New Brunswick. Not only
does he come from New Brunswick, but he
was born and brought up in the little shire
town of Gagetown in Queens County, which
is only nine or ten miles from where I was
born and brought up. Gagetown was a fine
little place.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It still is.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, and if I had not such
a long list of things that I wish to speak
about I would tell you a little story about it.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The old bouse is still
there.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, and the Dingee Hotel
is not "dingy" in the sense of that word.
Another qualification that my honourable
friend has is that he is the successor to a
host of leaders, all of whom have been excellent men. In saying this I am drawing on
my knowledge of this chamber over 26 years.
Only three honourable Senators have served
here longer than I have.
The honourable Leader of the Government
was for two years a member of the Government while then a member of the House of
-it

Commons. He showed real ability in his position there, and I know he will show it in this
house. When I say "ability" honourable senators, I do not mean merely an intellectual
capacity; I mean all those factors that go
to make up a satisfactory leadership, including courtesy, thoughtfulness for others, and a
willingness to co-operate with the other side
and conduct affairs in a way that has been
appreciated for many years in this house.
I should like to mention the leaders I have
known in this chamber. There were senators
Dandurand and Meighen. They were two
champions when I came here, and they were
mighty champions. Then there was Dr. King,
who also came from Queens County in New
Brunswick, Senator Ballantyne, Senator Wishart Robertson from Nova Scotia, and my
good friend the late John T. Haig. I am
glad to see his son here succeeding him.
Then there was my distinguished friend,
Senator Aseltine, who led this bouse so successfully, and, of course, I do not overlook my
own leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford)
who sits here to my left.
To the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) I say, we are proud
to have you here, and I think you are entitled to be proud that you are holding this
position in this chamber.
Next I would like to speak about our new
member of the Government without portfolio.
He is, I suppose, what you might call a freelance minister. I congratulate him on being a
senator, and I do that very sincerely, and
I congratulate ourselves that we have him
here as a senator. However, I am not quite
sure about congratulating him on the job he
has on his hands, because it is obvious be has
been put here to help rescue a floundering
government. In addition to his appointment
as senator there is one other thing upon
which I do congratulate him, and that is
his appointment as senator and as a minister
has caused Mr. Diefenbaker to perform the
only intelligent reform of the Senate that,
to my knowledge, he has ever proposed. I
say that most seriously and after considerable
thought.
For four years this house bas been without
a member of the Government. I think that is
contrary to the spirit of the British North
America Act which, in its first recital, has
declared that in principle the Canadian
Parliament is founded on the principles of
the British Parliament. While we do not have
some of the peculiarities, which would be
highly undesirable here, of inheritance in
matters of appointment to the Senate as it is
in the House of Lords, we do know that the
Lord Chancellor, who is one of the most
important members of the British Parliament

SENATE
and Government, always sits in the House of
Lords. Although I have not checked the point.
I have no doubt that there are other members
of the cabinet who always sit in the House
of Lords.
It is most important that we should have
cabinet representation in the Senate. I have
no hesitation in saying that the practice which
has been adopted has not gone far enough.
I submit that the Leader of the Government
here should also be what his title would
imply, that is, a member of the Government
itself. The situation of no cabinet representation in the Senate has existed for almost four
years, during which time my good friend
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) was the leader. During that
time we refrained from making any criticism
on this point, as we did not wish to embarrass
him on the curtailment of his powers. I feel,
honourable senators, that that reticence of
ours would be applicable also today in the
case of the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) if it were not for
one thing, that it now threatens to be an
established habit, a precedent. In my opinion
the Senate should no longer continue without
protest a precedent under which the Leader
of the Government here is not a member of
the Government which he purports to lead.
Honourable senators, I leave it to you to
figure out why the Prime Minister has so deliberately slighted the Senate in this way.
It is beyond my comprehension.
If I may be a little critical, in the most
friendly spirit, I would like to refer to the
speech of the new Minister without Portfolio
(Hon. Mr. McCutcheon) and to that of my
longtime friend, the new senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary). Both have criticized
the statement of the leader of the house on this
side (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), which
contained advice to us in regard to our duties
respecting legislation coming from the other
house.
As I understand it, the honourable leader
on this side laid down some general principles as to how far the Senate should go in
questioning or opposing legislation coming to
us from the other place. He stated the limitations of the Senate in challenging legislation
for which the Government has a mandate
from the electors. I emphasize that word
"mandate", as that seems to be the point
which has not been properly considered by
those two new senators.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
added to those general principles his own
opinion that the present Government, which
is a minority government, had not a clear
mandate and consequently the Senate had a
duty to make a more critical examination of

that legislation than it would make in the
case of a government having a clear majority.
Relying on my own experience of 26 years
in the Senate, I thought, and I still think,
that the opinion and advice given by my
leader was sound and well formulated. Furthermore, I am conscious of his wide experience. For some considerable time he was a
respected Speaker in the other place and I
believe he gave great satisfaction in the
performance of his duties there.
He was Leader of the Government in this
chamber and at the same time was a member
of the Government, as Solicitor General.
Since the change of Government he has performed his duties as Leader of the Opposition
in this house. It will be seen therefore that
he has had wide experience in these matters.
Having heard or read what he said, and
considering it from my experience, for what
it is worth, I believe his attitude was a
perfectly sound one. Therefore, I was indeed
surprised to read the speeches of two of our
new honourable senators, the senator who
is now Minister without Portfolio (Hon. Mr.
McCutcheon) and the senator from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. O'Leary). Undoubtedly these two
honourable gentlemen have been very distinguished in their own lines of business,
but neither of them has had any experience
either in the other place or here. That made
all the more surprising to me their challenge
of the opinion and advice given by the honourable senator from Brantford (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) to the members of this house.
In my own humble opinion-and I say this
most respectfully because of the high esteem
in which I hold both of these honourable
gentlemen-their reasoning was confused and
their conclusions were wrong. The challenge
these two distinguished new senators have
made as to the powers and duties of the
Senate is one of much importance to the
Senate and if accepted would, I think, change
the whole course of our responsibilities and
opportunities to criticize legislation from the
House of Commons. It is for that reason I
propose to discuss their statements at some
length. First, I want to read from the speech
of the leader on this side of the house in this
connection, which is the subject of this
criticism. I read from Senate Hansard of
October 4 last, at page 39:
We should not-and I am expressing
my own opinion-automatically resist
every government measure which comes
before us. To do so purely out of party
considerations would be to hamper any
effective government of our nation.
Secondly, I have asserted in the past,
and I do so again, the right of the Senate
to amend money bills whenever the

NOVEMBER 21, 1962
amendment will not increase an appropriation or any charge upon the people.
While maintaining the prerogatives of the
Senate in this regard I have often expressed the opinion, which I still holdand the honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate last year brought
this forcibly to my attention-that the
Senate should, not lightly or without the
most mature reflection seek to alter the
terms of a money bill in such a way
as to affect substantially the balance
of ways and means.
Thirdly-and now I come to the more
difficult question of mandate.
I want to emphasize this, because the discussion I am raising is really on the issue of
what is the effect of a mandate and the lack
of a mandate in regard to our jurisdiction,
and not only our jurisdiction but our rights
as to what we may do within our jurisdiction.
He continues:
I said these words in 1957, I repeated
them in 1958, and today I again repeat
them:
I think that we would all do well
to remember that the Senate has not,
traditionally, resisted the adoption of
any piece of government legislation
for which a government has received
a clear popular mandateThat is certainly not this case.
-whether
as the result of a general
election or otherwise. Nor would it, in
my view, be inclined to do so in future
in the absence of the most compelling
reasons for believing that the issue
should be referred once again to the
electorate.
Then I quoted a classic extract from
the speech delivered by the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen when he
was Leader of the Opposition in this
chamber.

I do not need to read the rest of it, for it is
all there for honourable senators to read.
That is the text of what my leader advanced
when he spoke on October 4 last, and it is one
that I adhere to.
He went on to say:
Honourable senators, in consequence of
the recent general election, the statement
I have just quoted no longer stands. The
government has now been elected by a
minority of members to the House of
Commons and these were elected by a
comparatively small percentage of the
popular vote.
Hon. Mr. HOLLETT: Thirty-seven per
cent.
If that was any consolation to Senator
Hollett, he was welcome to it. The honourable
leader continued:
In addition it elected only a minority
of members from the two most populous
provinces of Canada. Nor has it indeed
been demonstrated that the Government
can command the support of the House
of Commons for any appreciable length
of time.
Accordingly, I feel that I should be
just as frank now as I was in 1958. The
Government remains in office by sufferance of those members of Parliament
who, during the election, opposed the
policies and program of the Government.
And those minorities, honourable senators,
not only did it prior to the election, they
are doing it today at every chance they can.
They do it every time, except when it comes
to the question of whether there is going to
be another election or not, and particularly
since the elections in Quebec, the by-election
in Saskatchewan, and the elections in Newfoundland, except that they will still be more
subservient, but nonetheless not be a part

NOVEMBER 21, 1962
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): You were
discussing an unholy alliance, and the best
example of the unholy alliance is when the
Liberals got up and voted for the Social
Credit policy.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I shall deal with my
honourable friend from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary) before I get through. I see he is
still confusing two different issues, as he
did in his speech: one is the question of how
long a minority government should survive
by the vote of those who are not in favour of
it, and the other is how far we should be
handicapped on our mandate. That is the
real issue and it cannot be confused with the
issue that my learned friend has so skilfully
sought to confuse in his speech and in his
interruption of my remarks at this time.
The honourable gentlemen, both of them,
have mixed up these two issues. I could discuss them separately but I would rather take
them mixed up as they have been presented.
One is the assertion that once a bill passes
the Commons this establishes a mandate.
It has been stated that there is no such
thing as minority legislation. In my submission
that is only a play on words. It is pure sophistry.
Of course there is no minority legislation
coming to us from the Commons; it could not
come here unless it was passed by a majority
vote. But the question is not how it got here.
The question is, are those who have supported it in the Commons standing on such
common ground that it can be considered a
mandate from the people which we are bound
to accept. Now, I would like to hear my
honourable friend from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary) say whether it is a sound proposition, for the minority Conservative Government with the help of a Social Credit
minority, to say they have a mandate from
the people, especially when that party opposed
this Government at every step before the election and even now. Why, as recently as a
couple of weeks ago Mr. Caouette said, "I
will give this Government two weeks to
reform and do certain things, otherwise we
are going to help to kick them out." Is that
the kind of mandate my honourable friends
say the Tories have in the Commons that is
going to tie our hands?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A marriage of convenience.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I have it down in my notes
in stronger language than that and I have
debated whether to use the expression or not.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Does my friend suggest
that because there is a minority government
in the other place, it should not send any
legislation up here?

Hon. Mr. Farris: Of course not. I never said
that. What I am saying is that I am supporting the position of our Leader (Hon. Mr
Macdonald, Brantford), that when it comes
here we are going to look it over, and if we
see that there is a public mandate for it then
there have to be strong grounds on which we
should challenge it; but if that mandate is
nothing but an unholy alliance or, as my
honourable friend has said, a marriage of
convenience, if it is a dishonest combination
for purposes other than the country's benefit,
then I say our duty is to regard it as suspect
right fron the start. This nonsense about
there being no minority legislation should be
brushed aside. Of course there is no minority
legislation. When legislation comes to us fron
a minority, or from a combination of two
minorities so absolutely opposed to one another that it should be brushed aside as not
an honest union, our hands should not be tied
in any shape or form.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): With great
respect, it comes to us frorn a majority of the
House of Commons. Are you saying that the
Senate should sit down and examine the
political labels of the people who voted for
that legislation in the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Farris: You bet I do. I would
not do that if it was passed by one party;
I would not do that if the situation was one
which I am going to deal with in a moment.
I refer to the problem Mackenzie King had.
But when we know that this legislation-and
it has not come yet; they have been fiddling
around so far-comes from a minority government, passed under the gun of another minority, then if you say our hands are tied
on that, you are making a fool of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, did
anybody on this side of the house suggest
that the hands of the Senate should be tied?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am sorry, I do not follow
you.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I believe the honourable
senator made the statement that the suggestion was made from this side that, in these
circumstances, the hands of the Senate would
be tied. I think that was the phrase he used.
I am now asking him if he will tell honourable senators when and where anyone on
this side of the house made any such statement or one whose meaning might approximate that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If you listen to the interruptions of my honourable friend from Carleton you will hear that.
Hon Mr. Grosart: Does the honourable
senator intend to answer my question?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Farris: I did answer it, and I have
told you where you can obtain the information. Of course I do challenge that statement. The honourable the leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) was not
speaking of legislation which has already been
passed, but of legislation which might be
anticipated, not from a united party but from
some alliance of Conservatives and Social
Creditors or Tories and New Democrats. If
the legislation is the child of the union of
two unmarried parents it comes from an unholy alliance, and there is a well-known word
to describe the offspring of such a union.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Is the honourable senator
applying that word to the legislation that
comes here from the other place?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do without any hesitation, if it appears to come as a result of an
alliance between Conservatives and Social
Creditors, and is legislation concerning which
we know there is no common belief between
the two, and when it is obvious that the only
reason they are joined together is to hang
on to office. Since the recent election in Quebec that is even more the situation than
it was before.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Why did the Liberals
join them the other day?
An Hon. Senalor: I think investigation will
show the Liberals have not challenged third
reading of any bill so far.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There has not been any
legislation that amounts to anything so far.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): You
had better read yesterday's Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) was pointing out to the house what our
position will be with regard to amendment,
and you cannot drag into that the question
of the precedent of Mackenzie King. That has
been raised here, and it is a useful way to
point up the distinction.
In 1921 the Liberals had 117 seats, the
Conservatives 50 and the Progressives 64.
The Progressives and Liberals together carried on the Government, and there could not
be any question of the kind I am raising
now in regard to them. Who was the leader of
the Progressives? One of the greatest Liberals we have in this country today, Tom
Crerar.
Hon. Mr. Willis: He was not then.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: He became that
later on.
Hon. Mr. Willis: He was not then.

Hon. Mr. Farris: He was. My honourable
friend to my left was associated with Tom
Crerar, and he will agree that regarding
general principles these Progressives and
Liberals were in concert. Has anyone the
nerve to suggest in this house that the union
between those two, for the purpose of keeping the King Government in power, was
comparable to the union between the Conservatives and Social Credit today? Honourable senators, that is just a blinding of yourselves to the actual facts.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Read Mr. Crerar's
speeches in western Canada in 1921.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I have something to say
about my honourable friend, and I shall deal
with him later.
Hon. Mr. Willis: I just want to say that

Hon. Mr. Farris: I am glad to see that I am
getting under their hides.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think we are

An Hon. Senator: Go on, senator.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am going on. I have had
this sort of experience for a long time. I
used to be in the legislature of British Columbia where this sort of thing was very
common.
How long ago was it Mr. Caouette stated
that he was giving the Conservative Government about two weeks to amend its austerity
policy? What a humiliation it must be for
a Prime Minister, who had the great majority
Mr. Diefenbaker had at one time, now to
have to sit in a minority Government and submit to that kind of dictate or else go out of
office.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Has the honourable senator any evidence that the Prime Minister has
submitted to such a dictate?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am talking, as my leader
was, about future legislation. Does my honourable friend say that his Government-one
of which he seems to be such an enthusiastic
supporter-can stay in office without the support of these men who have defied them and
every principle they stand for? That is the
question we have to face at this time; that
is the question the public of this country is
going to consider, and not the interpretations of my honourable friend. That is all I
want to say on that question. I think the
members of the Senate at least understand
what my position is on it, and the limitations

Hon. Mr. Farris: Let him go on.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: This legislation comes

parties have supported this legislation before

pass such legislation, and does he also dlaim
that we alone should decide whether such
legislation cornes within the framework of the
popular mandate that was given by the people
of Canada to its representatives?
Hon. Mr. Farris: 1 say that the answer to
that is a very simple one. If it appears that
legislation cornes over here supported only
by two conflicting groups, groups that we
know have no sympathy, no principles in
common, then we are entitled to treat that
legislation as suspect and not approach the
examination o! it as we would where there
was a dlear mandate. We do flot put ourselves
in the position of judging what the mandate
of the mai ority of the people is, but we put
ourselves in the position o! recognizing what
are the actual facts. Does my honourable
!niend suggest for one minute, if we see
legisiation coming here and we know it cornes
from a minority Government which has the
support of Caouette, that simply because they
both want to stay in office our hands are
therefore tied? If he does, then it is a new

BIe goes on and quotes from every reporter
who was there, and I invite honourable senators to look up this article by the editor of
the Citizen and see what complete unanimity
there was in these reports as to the conduct
of Mr. Hees and Mr. Fleming at the Accra
conference in attacking the policy of Great
Britain. I will not read them all because
time is passing, but I suggest to honourable
senators that if they have not read the article
they ought to do so.
Of course, that does not stand alone. We
come next to Mr. Diefenbaker's recent visit
to the conference of Commonwealth Prime
*Ministers in London where, strange to say,
for the second time there is sharp conflict
between what the Prime Minister said he
said there and what the press understood he
said. In that connection there has been a
great disturbance of the minds of not only
the "illiterate" people of Canada but also of
the "illiterate" people of Great Britain. You
will recall, honourable senators, how indignant Mr. Diefenbaker was at the unfair
reports of what he said and did which were
contained in newspapers in both Canada and
England.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): He had a
right to be indignant. The reports were disgraceful.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think some of them were,
but there must have been an awful provocation for them to be made.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Some journalists in London brainwashed our correspondents.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The honourable senator
can make his speech later on; I will make
mine now.
Senator O'Leary quoted some of these
rotten statements made in England-and I
agree with him they were rotten. Honourable
senators will find them in his speech contained at page 97 of the current Debates of
the Senate:
But what was happening over here
while Mr. Diefenbaker was in London?
Over here an effort was made to stab
Mr. Diefenbaker in the back. Everybody
knows that.
I would not have thought so.
I have the proof of it right down in my
office.
And my honourable friend kept it there. He
did not bring it here. He went on to say:
I can show you that on the very day
when two scurrilous journalists in London,
one unfortunately on the old London
Observer, the old organ of J. L. Garvin,

and the other the London Daily Telegraph-what were they saying about Mr.
Diefenbaker? The London Observer, of
all papers, said Mr. Diefenbaker was
speaking for "yokels on the prairies".
Honourable senators, those "yokels on the
prairies" are the people of whom Kipling
wrote after the First World War:
From little towns in a far land
we came,
To save our honour and a world
aflame.
My honourable friend should have added to
that another quotation from Kipling:
If blood be the price of empire,
Lord God, we have paid in full!
I do not want to get into any comparisons of
that kind, and I certainly say that a statement
such as this coming from those English
papers was a rotten statement, and it was an
unjustified statement.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I say it is not typical of
what Englishmen do and say, and it would
not have been said unless there was very
great provocation. So, we have two illustrations. But did my honourable friend tell us
in his speech what Mr. Diefenbaker did say
and the position he did take at this conference? If he did, I could not find it.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: The press release
issued at the close of the conference sets out
Mr. Diefenbaker's complete statement, and I
shall see to it that the honourable senator
receives a copy tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Perhaps it does, but I say
that that kind of resentment could not have
come from decent English people unless there
was grave provocation. I think that Englishmen, of all the races that I know, are the
most self-restrained people in their outbursts
of resentment. They are more self-restrained
than are Canadians, and more so than my
honourable friend is, but when they are provoked to make statements of this kindrotten as they are-you cannot expect but
that there was some provocation.
So, we have two instances of provocation.
We have what was said at Accra and what
was denied by the men who were there after
they found it was unpopular, and the statement of Mr. Young repudiating that and giving actual quotations from what had been
said and done there; then we have the instance in which Mr. Diefenbaker was so
incensed at the misrepresentation of his
speeches contained in both the British and the
Canadian press, There must be some justification for it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Does the
honourable senator think there was justification for what Mr. Chamberlain said about
Sir Wilfrid Laurier when the latter was
opposing Mr. Chamberlain's Empire Union
proposals?
Hon. Mr. Farris: What has that to do with
it?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): In speaking of
these people he was so restrained. Were they
all restrained? As an old Fenian, I say "no".
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend has
paid me the compliment of interrupting me
several times.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable senator does
not like it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In regard to this terrible
condition of "illiteracy" in Canada, the honourable senator from Carleton has a double
responsibility. He is responsible as a senator
and also as president and assistant editor of
one of the biggest newspapers in Canada,
published right here in the city of Ottawa.
I invite honourable senators to read carefully
his speech and see how much of this illiteracy
he has wiped away. I could not find it. Perhaps I too am illiterate.
I have no criticism of the Conservative
party or of Prime Minister Diefenbaker in
presenting Canada's side to the Government
of Britain. It was their duty to do so. However, they talk about "partnership". It was
also their duty to realize that this partnership
involves joint obligations and a recognition
of the problems of both sides on this question. That is where the honourable senator's
speech falls down and that is also where
Prime Minister Diefenbaker's attitude has
fallen down.
The honourable senator from Carleton (Hon.
Mr. O'Leary) in his speech spoke often about
promises the Prime Minister of Great Britain
made and which, he says, were not kept. I
do not agree with that. When this question
was being discussed by partners, it was Canada's duty not only to point out our position
but also to recognize the problem facing
Great Britain and to consider how far we
as Canadians could be of assistance. We know
that the financial sacrifices Britain made
during those wars far exceeded those that
Canada made. While it is no reflection on us
in any way, we know that sometimes Canada
prospered under the war conditions while
Britain was going down financially and being
ruined.
I remember once after the first World War
going into a bank in London and saying to
my banker: "I am concerned about the expression in the faces of those I watch in the

line-up to get buses; they look unhappy,
they are not talking to each other; there is an
air of distress about them." My banker replied: "Mr. Farris, before the war Britain was
a wealthy country; today she is a poor country; and the poverty of Britain is due to her
efforts in saving the Empire." Do I find
any recognition, in the speeches of Prime
Minister Diefenbaker or the honourable senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary), of
the financial sacrifices Great Britain has
made? Is there any recognition of the difficuties Britain may have if she goes into the
Common Market or of the disastrous results
that may occur if she does not go into the
Common Market?
I have written down here rather hurriedly
some of the questions I should like to ask
those honourable gentlemen opposite. First,
do they believe that Britain is facing a serious economic crisis? Also, I ask them if they
believe that there has been great prosperity
in the countries of the Common Market?
Furthermore, do they believe that if Britain
joins the market she will share in that prosperity? Again, do they deny the grounds of
belief of Mr. Fowler? I mentioned him in my
previous speech. He is President of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association in this country, representing one of our leading industries and one of the largest exporters to
Britain. In a speech which had nothing to do
with politics, Mr. Fowler, when addressing
his own men and entirely in the interest of
trade, warned that it was in the interests of
Canada and of the pulp and paper industry
and the shipping industry to disregard the
dire threats being made at present against
Britain. He pointed out that it was better
to have friendly competition with a prosperous Britain than to have a protected market
in a decadent Britain.
Honourable senators, there is a host of these
quotations, and I should like to give some
of them. Sir Eric V. Bowater, president of
the Bowater Paper Corporation, said that
unless Britain joins the Common Market
she faces a decline in her economy. He told
the company's annual meeting that he shares
the views recently expressed by a leading
British businessman that the Commonwealth
will be better off with a rich Britain in the
Common Market than a Britain made poor
because she stayed out.
I ask honourable senators opposite, do they
believe in that, and if they do, would they
still insist, if they had the power, on stopping
Great Britain from joining this great market
at ber door?
We have a great market at our door.
Britain may talk about breaches of promise.

what Diefenbaker was going to do.
I know, or I believe I know, that
Honourable senators, I have said that as
Britain is going to join the Common
Market. I think it is a sad thing that I see it the weakness of the position of my
ministers of a British government should honourable friend and of his leader, the

SENATE
Prime Minister of Canada, is that they have
not by their attitude given proper consideration to the problems facing Great Britain.
It is all very well to say what the effect is
going to be and what the benefits are. It
reminds me of the story of the little boy
who went to his Dad and said, "Dad, little
brother Willie has taken half the bed." His
father replied, "Go back to bed. Of course,
Willie is entitled to half the bed." To which
the little boy rejoined, "But he has taken the
half which is right in the middle."
So, my honourable friends in their dealings
with the British Government are not entitled
to make their claims regardless of the problems that are facing Britain. In this connection, I have not heard in their speeches or
read in Conservative editorials any indication
whatsoever of a philosophical appreciation
of the problems that confront both Canada
and Great Britain, nor any sympathetic consideration of what Britain must do for her
own salvation.
I have before me, taken from the Globe and
Mail of October 12 last, the text of the
Common Market pamphlet, in which the
Prime Minister of Great Britain says:
We were able to explain in detail to
the other Commonwealth leaders the
reasons why, in our view, British membership of the European community
would be a source of new strength, not
only to this country but to the Commonwealth as a whole; and conversely, why
a Britain detached from Europe would
mean inflicting permanent injury on our
common cause.
In the Globe and Mail of October 15 last
is a column by Drew Middleton in which,
referring to Prime Minister Macmillan, he
says:
The Prime Minister also expressed the
Government's conviction that Britain
would not leave the Commonwealth behind, once in the Community. Britain's
power and value to the Commonwealth
will be greatly enhanced . . .
Then I have before me press clippings
from the London Times-an outstanding
paper, which I think even excels the reputation and knowledge of the Ottawa Journal.
It gives a complete report of Prime Minister
Macmillan's speech, and I have marked one
or two statements which he made:
A new bond of common purpose has
united our old ally France with our
former enemy Germany. This in itself
has greatly strengthened the prospect
for peace.
That is part of this Common Market.

Have any honourable senators heard any
discussion by the Opposition about Mr. Macmillan and the fact that this Common Market
will be a contribution to peace? Yet, today
we are wasting too much time here over discussions about paltry affairs of the world,
with the gloom that hangs over it from day
to day.
Then I ask you to turn to the last page of
the report of the British Prime Minister's
speech, which is carried practically in full
in the Times. It reads as follows:
If, as I trust, we are able as the result of further negotiations to make the
great decision to enter Europe, Britain
in Europe will be economically stronger.
There cannot be any doubt about that.
Britain in Europe will have a double
influence, both as a European country
and one of the world-wide interests.
Britain's power and value to the other
Commonwealth countries, old and new,
will be greatly enhanced.
And we can hope that our European
associates will share with us that outward-looking attitude by which alone the
prosperity and so the peace of the world
can be secured.
That is the kind of thinking that ought to be
going on. Instead, we have had this attack on
Mr. Macmillan and, as termed by my honourable friend, his simple attitude in regard to Canada and his breach of promise, which I say was
not a promise in any sense but an assurance
that they were going to do what could be done
to protect the interests of Canada and the
rest of the Commonwealth. They have done
that.
Now, just one word more about my honourable friend from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
O'Leary). I have picked him out more than
anyone else. There is a Chinese proverb, the
exact words of which I have forgotten, but
which in effect says this: you find the most
sticks and stones under the best apple tree.
So, you will find the most controversial opportunity for debate with a man who is making the most provocative and, from my standpoint, the best speech. It is on that basis that
I want to congratulate him. I want to express my sentiments in support of his admiration for Mr. Meighen. I regarded Mr.
Meighen as a man who stood out for his convictions against the necessities of meeting
an opportunity by shaping or changing his
policy. I am glad that my honourable friend
admires him for that position. I think, now
that Mr. Meighen has gone, my honourable
friend is the only real Conservative left.
In Victoria some three years ago, at a
time when Mr. Meighen was still in good
health, he addressed the Canadian Club there,

NOVEMBER 21, 1982
and General Clark, who was at one time a
member here, asked me to move the vote of
thanks. I was delighted to do so. The first
thing I did was to read again Mr. Meighen's
book, because by reading it I would know
what I had to answer in his speech, for I knew
that he always adhered to the same convictions. I ended my remarks by saying, "Ladies
and gentlemen, he stood here tonight as we
have always known him, unrevised and unrepentent." He came over and shook my hands
and said, "I will never forget." I am sorry I
never saw him again.
But I do congratulate my honourable friend,
(Hon. Mr. O'Leary) for his principles and
his capacity for making a fine speech. It is
disturbing to me, as it must be to us all and
to him, to realize that if his leader, the
Prime Minister, is right, he bas only a year
and a half left in which he will be mentally
competent to be a senator.
Now a word or two about my senator
friend whom I have not had the pleasure of
knowing too well, Senator Willis. I find that
he made a speech, in which commencing at
the bottom of page 164 of Hansard, he says
two things:
I would like to say in closing that
never in my life, and I have been interested in politics for a long time, have I
seen a more determined effort to detract
from a great man, a great leader, and a
great Prime Minister, than bas been done
in the case of the Right Honourable John
G. Diefenbaker. I say to the honourable
members of this chamber that the election campaign which culminated on June
18, in which the name of the Prime Minister was ridiculed by the use of the
word "Diefenbuck", was a disgrace to
Canada. But, as I was told by one of the
members of my own constituency, they
would sooner have "Diefenbuckers" than
"Pearsonitis".

Brockville as making a personal attack
on four gentlemen, whom he namesI did not put their names in my letter, but
one was Walter Gordon and I think another
was the man who pretty nearly defeated
Finance Minister Fleming in Toronto. There
were four of them, and as far as I know they
were all responsible gentlemen taking a
strong side against the Government, which
they were entitled to do and indeed was their
duty to do.
I continue the letter:
-and says are "the same old bunch
of Pearson advisers who were back of
the former Liberal Government." He
continues-"They are your potential
masters, a conglomeration of hopeless
and hopefuls, a veritable Cave of Adullam-where all the misfits in creation
are collected together, a cacophony of
jargon."
I commend this to my honourable friend
who was weeping so much about the expression "Diefenbuck."
That the Prime Minister of Canada
should himself indulge in such "jargon"
seems incredible. If the tide of criticism
and resentment against him and his Government is having this effect on him as
the campaign starts, his friends should
be alarmed about what his mental condition will be before the end of the
campaign.
Mr. Diefenbaker in consigning Mr.
Pearson and his alleged advisers to the
Cave of Adullam doubtless obtained his
information about this Cave from the Old
Testament, 1 Samuel, Ch. 22 (1) and (2).

And that of course was the choice. I have
not much sympathy for this abuse of a public
man. It reacts very seriously against those
who make it.
Back on May 10 of this year I wrote a
letter which was published in the Vancouver
Province, a Conservative paper, and which,
like some other Conservative papers, the
Gazette and the Globe and Mail as examples,
find it necessary at times to be pretty critical
of the Government, and I don't see how they
can help it. The newspaper did me the honour of printing this letter in a prominent
place on the editorial page, with my name at
the head of it. I will read the letter:
Today's Province (Thursday May 10th)
reports Mr. Diefenbaker's speech at

escaped to the Cave of Adullam . . . and

Of course, Mr. Diefenbaker being, as I am,
a Baptist, would naturally be familiar with
the Old Testament. The letter continues:
"David therefore departed thence and
everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that
was discontented gathered themselves
unto him and he became a captain over
them."
If Mr. Diefenbaker intends to substitute
Pearson for David, to make him the captain of everyone in distress or in debt
or discontented under the Diefenbaker
Government, he will need a mighty big
Cave to hold them all.
So I say to my honourable friend who is
a new member of the Senate that you do
not get far by these wailings over attacks
on public men. If they are not merited, the
rebound is far worse than the attack.

SENATE
My honourable friend concluded his speech
iwith these words:
I close by saying that I am grateful to
have been appointed by the greatest
Prime Minister Canada bas ever had.
That kind of stumped me.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Do I hear applause on
that? Was the applause directed to my remark
or the quotation?
Anyway, honourable senators, I put the
thing in my pocket, and at lunch time I was
walking up the street in Vancouver and saw
a prominent Conservative who was a good
friend of mine, and I stopped him and asked,
"Do you agree with this?" I could not get
an answer. Then I continued on to a club
where I was going to lunch, and saw another
distinguished Conservative, a member of a
large organization, and I knew he was a
strong Conservative. I read this to him and
asked, "Do you subscribe to that?" He replied,
"I plead the fifth amendment." I quit there.
Honourable senators, I want to say this in
all seriousness. I was brought up a Liberal;
my grandfather was the first member in our
county after Confederation; and my father
was in provincial politics most of his life, and
was Minister of Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Were they bitter?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, they were bitter. I
can leave that to my friend in Queens county
to verify. We fought over our politics.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: There are different degrees of it, and you seem to have inherited
a little more.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I have read and studied
the life of Sir John Macdonald, and I do not
agree with the old-timers view of him. I
believe that Sir John Macdonald had one of
the greatest imaginations a Canadian ever
had, that he was one of the men who made
Canada, and that he had a vision of which
every Canadian today ought to be proud.
Then we come to Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I
have a big picture of him hanging in my
Senate room, and he looks down upon me.
In the words of one of the authors of distinction, "This was the noblest Roman of
them all". Indeed, the parties of Canada have
been fortunate in the type of men they have
had.
Then there was Dick Bennett, another Conservative. When I was at Regina, Dick was
the member from Calgary in the territories
legislature and leader of the opposition. I
was a boy several years younger than he, and
we used to walk out on the Prairies at night

and talk. I had the utmost admiration for
him then, and have always had. He was a
fine man, and I think the Conservative party
made a grave mistake when they did not insist on his remaining as their leader.
I could go on to mention others. Mackenzie
King had a great deal more criticism than that
which my friend is worrying about concerning
Diefenbaker, but I want to tell you that, in
my book, Mackenzie King contributed something to the unity of Canada that no other
man in Canada at that time could have done.
While it may have looked as if he were
circuitous at times in the way he brought it
about, he always had his mind set on one
objective-as did Laurier and St. Laurentthe unity of Canada. Had it not been for the
bravery and skill with which he did it, there
might have been a cleavage in this country
from which we would never have recovered,
and then the doctrines of Caouette might have
had a lot more force. Since he has been out
of Parliament St. Laurent has received unanimous tributes from the Canadian Bar as a
great statesman. I do not suggest any personal attack on Mr. Diefenbaker; I would
not bemean myself by calling him "Mr.
Diefenbuck", but I would certainly hesitate
to say that he is the greatest Prime Minister
Canada has ever had. I do not think his
record justifies such a statement, and I do
not think that the public of this country will
ever give support to such an extravagant
suggestion as that.
Honourable senators, I have spoken at considerable length, and I assure you that I am
just about through. There are a lot of things
I would like to talk about, were I not tiredand I know that you are too. However, I will
not do so at this time.
One of the things I would like to talk about
is the harm that is done to this country by
the existence of too many parties. I think
my friends opposite are in agreement with
me on that. I know my friend the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary) is,
and that he is a believer in the two-party
system. So am 1, but how are we going to
accomplish it? I am going to make a suggestion. I have not the least idea that anybody
will accept it at this time, but it is worth
thinking about and I may have an opportunity to develop it a little more later. I refer
to the single transferable ballot which, I
think, would solve the problern to a large
extent. It is not an untried device. I understood from the late Senator Haig, when we
talked about it, that they had it in the province of Manitoba, and maybe my friend, his
son, can tell me whether they still have it in
that province.

NOVEMBER 21, 1962
Under the single transferable ballot, if
there are three candidates running, you have
on the ballot two columns for the first choice
and the second. If anyone bas a clear
mai ority when the ballots are counted, then
that is the end of it. However, if no one bas
a clear majority then you discard the firstchoice votes for the third man and he is
wiped out, and you take the second-choice
votes for the third candidate and apply them
to the two competitors for first choice. That
has two effects. In the first place, it prevents
the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of voters.
I wonder how many voters there are in
Canada today who voted for a third party.
They have not had a single word to say about
who is going to be elected because it is one
of the other two parties Who, under this
system, would have the support of ail the
voters who wanted to vote-you would flot
compel them to vote-in the final decision.
I say that would have two results: it would
give a final representation to ahl voters, and
it would tend to do away with the splinter
parties, which would be a good thing for
everybody.
I understand from a recent article in the
Globe and Mail that somethîng of that principle is now being adopted in France where
two elections are held, the second being to
determine those who do not have a clear
majority on the first vote. A much better way
is to have it ahl in the one ballot instead of
two. We had this system in British Columbia
in one election, and 1 helped to have this
legîslation passed. My frîend Gordon Wismer
was the attorney general at the time and I
pestered him that this should be done, and hie
in turn persuaded Boss Johnson. The result
of that election was that on the first ballot,
if the old system had been applied we would
have had a socialist government, but on the
second ballot the Bennett group, being the
largest group, became the government.
I arn not saying that that is proof that it is,
of necesýsity, a good thing for the country,
but at least it illustrates how the system
works, and its soundness in principle. 0f
course it is flot popular with the Government
in power. I know that because when 1 was
a member of the government in British
Columnbia there was nothing we liked better,
as a government, than a number of opposition
parties; the more opposition parties there
were, the better off was the government.
Once Mr. Bennett had been elected on the
single transferable vote, the first thing he did
was to kick over the ladder on which he had
climbed to power.
I arn not trying to convince the Senate that
this ought to be done, but I arn saying it is a
27511-5-19

sound principle, and I believe some day, it
will be adopted in this country. I only mention it as something to think about.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I thank
you for the consideration that you have given
me. I thank my honourable interrupters for
the demonstration they have given of how
illogical they can be, and 1 say to you ahl that
the tragedy of life is that ail these things we
are thinking about must fade into insignificance when the great problern of the security
of the world hangs over us like an ominous
cloud from day to day. One day we hear Mr.
Khrushchev making promises that sound
good, and the next day we discover that hie
is not honest in keeping these promises. That
keeps going on and on. However, I think we
can congratulate ourselves that this Government is now, and I emphasize that word
"now", working in co-operation with the
Government of the United States, and I say
let us neyer forget that our hopes must always
be for co-operation with the Presîdent and
people of that country.
In the Cuban controversy I cannot criticize
the policy of this Goverrnent, but 1 should
like to have seen it act a little more quickly.
You know there were at the beginning one
or two days when nobody knew what Khrushchev's response would be to the intentions
President Kennedy had expressed, and I have
no doubt that for those two days Khrushchev
was thinking about what the rest of the
world was doing. I would like to have seen
our Government act just a little more quickly,
regardless of whether they had been consulted
or not, but I arn glad they did corne through,
and as Mr. Green said, the Americans are
thankful to us for what we have done. I think
they would have been more thankful if we
had been a little quicker.
1 only mention these things because, after
al, one does flot want to be too partisan. Even
my; honourable friend, who seems to be a
dyed-in-the-wool partisan, is not, I know, as
partisan as he would pretend to be. I know
that we are ail concerned with the welfare
of the world and of Canada.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Drouin,
debate adjourned until Tuesday, November 27.
PRIVATE BILLS
THE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN SYNOD 0F
WESTERN CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. John Hnalyshyn moved the second
reading of Bill S-9, respecting The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of Bull S-9, an Act respecting The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western Canada, is,

SENATE
as the explanatory notes state, to give effect
to an Agreement of Consolidation, effective
as of July 1, 1962. If the bill receives second
reading I intend to ask that it be sent to the
committee dealing with private bills, but
although the hour is late, I would like to give
a little explanation as to the reasons for
this bill.
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western Canada was incorporated under special
act, being chapter 65 of the Statutes of 1953.
This entity was one of the Synods of the
United Lutheran Church in America. The
United Lutheran Church in America and
four other branches of The Lutheran Church
in the United States and Canada, namely,
The American Evangelical Lutheran Church,
The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of
America, The Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church and The United Lutheran
Church in America, by Agreement of Consolidation effective as of July 1, 1962, agreed
to consolidate under the name of "Lutheran
Church in America". The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western Canada was one of
the Synods of the United Lutheran Church
in America.
The territorial jurisdiction of The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western Canada,
as set out in the private act of incorporation,
included the provinces of British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and that
part of Ontario lying west of the 86th meridian of longitude, and the Yukon Territory
and the Northwest Territories.
Under the terms of consolidation, this
synod is to be known as the Central Canada
Synod of the Lutheran Church in America,
and the territorial jurisdiction is to be
limited to the provinces of Saskatchewan
and Manitoba and that portion of the province of Ontario lying west of the 88th meridian. It was considered that the words "western Canada" would be somewhat misleading
in view of the fact that the provinces of
British Columbia and Alberta will be in
another synod.
Clause 2 of the bill amends the objects
of the corporation to provide that the synod
shall, in ecclesiastical matters, adhere to the
Lutheran Church in America. This was felt
desirable as there are other Lutheran Church
bodies in the United States.
With reference to clause 3 of the bill, as I
have mentioned, the Agreement of Consolidation changed the territorial jurisdiction of
this synod, and it is therefore necessary to
request an amendment of the incorporating
act in this respect.

I hope that this short explanation will give
honourable senators some idea of the purposes of this bill, and any question that honourable senators may have with respect to it
will, I am sure, be answered in committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hnatyshyn, bill
referred to Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
THE UKRAINIAN CANADIAN FOUNDATION OF
TARAS SHEVCHENKO-SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. Hnatyshyn moved the second
reading of Bill S-10, to incorporate The
Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras
Shevchenko.
He said: Honourable senators, I would like
to give a brief résumé of why this body wants
incorporation.
Prior to 1940 there existed among the
Ukrainian people of Canada various cultural,
religious and political organizations which
carried on their particular activities independently of one another. In 1940 leading
citizens representing these various organizations decided that all activities should be coordinated in order that maximum assistance
might be given in all fields of the Canadian
war effort. The Department of National War
Services welcomed this move and assisted in
bringing about the formation of the coordinated body which became the Ukrainian
Canadian Committee.
In the initial stages only five major organizations joined to form the committee which
made a substantial contribution to the mobilization of the armed services during the
last war. After termination of the war, the
committee was charged with the responsibility
of rendering assistance in demobilization and
rehabilitation. The efforts of the committee
in providing guidance and assistance to immigrants in displaced persons' camps and in
Canada are well known.
By the time the challenges of war and
post-war problems had been met the name of
the Ukrainian Canadian Committee was well
known, not only among Canadians of Ukrainian origin but also among all Canadians who
had an opportunity to witness the activities
of the committee.
In due course all political, religious, cultural
and educational organizations among the
Ukrainian Canadians, with the exception of
the communist group, joined the committee.
This committee now stands as the representative organ of over half a million people in
Canada.
Many distinguished members of the various
component organizations are convinced of

NOVEMBER 21.1962
the necessity of a united effort and have

proper management of the funds for the
propagation of Ukrainian culture in Canada,
it was feit necessary to incorporate a foundation.
This procedure was endorsed by the aid

In the past the Department of National
Revenue has taken the position that liability
for sales tax existed without time limit where
the article purchased for a tax exempt use

not qualify for the exemption. The amendment would fix a time limit of five years. The
amendment also removes the liability from
the manufacturer or original vendor who sold

SONS OF FREEDOM DOUKHOBORS
IN CANADA
MOTION TO APPOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEEDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, November 6, the debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Croll:

That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to inquire into and report
upon the continuing problems presented
by the Sons of Freedom Doukhobors in
Canada and any problems related thereto;
That this said committee be composed
of twenty honourable senators to be
named later;
That the committee be empowered to
send for persons, papers and records; and
That the committee be instructed to report to the house from time to time its
findings, together with such recommendations as it may see fit to make.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators,
by way of introduction, and following that
most interesting and forceful speech to which
we listened yesterday, may 1, as one of the
junior members of this assembly, express the
hope that some of the rest of us will have the
same vigour and vitality displayed by the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) in the course of his address
yesterday. May I extend the same compliment
to my friend the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), because
these men should be an inspiration to those
of us who still have some years to serve in the
work of this assembly.
I make one other observation, also by way
of introduction, in connection with the kind
of discussion which has characterized this
session so far. I am, as I have said, but a
junior member here, having come in 1955,
but I have heard more political discussions
in this chamber in the last seven weeks than
in the previous seven years. Now whether
or not that is a good thing, I am not too
sure. Frankly, although I am classified as an
Independent, I hold quite strong political
views, and I admire people who stand up
and express their convictions with clarity,
firmness and vigour. That has been done, but
I would hope that the time has not arrived
when we will see too much of a narrowly
partisan discussion in this chamber.
I think that some of my new colleagues
who sit on the Government side have invited and deserved the kind of treatment
they received yesterday, and maybe they are
all the better for it.
Now, to pass on to my subject, and this
is a rather difficult one, I am reminded of
some years ago when I was in Stockholm.
On that occasion I spent a number of days
with two or three other Canadians in the
company of a Polish professor of philosophy
at the University of Stockholm, who acted as
our guide, philosopher and friend. He was a
most interesting character: he spoke nine
languages, his wife spoke six, and their nineyear-old son spoke five.

SENATE
In the course of our acquaintance we
discussed labour, government, politics, management and education. While taking a delightful stroll through the Kungsgarten one
afternoon this man said that in politics he
believed in anarchism, the theory that formal
government of any kind is unnecessary and
wrong in principle. He thought the ideal
society was one in which there was no need
for law, that people would be so happy
and satisfied with life that they would not
need police and only a modicum of government.
When I asked him what he would do if
someone walked up to him as he strolled
in the park and proceeded to pilfer his watch,
he replied that in this ideal society no one
would want his watch because everybody
would have one and would have no need
for his. This seemed to suggest a pleasant
although somewhat naïve kind of society, and
one which would be a bit out of touch with
reality as we ýordinary mortals know it.
During the past few years Canadians
have watched with growing concern the
activities of a small Doukhobor sect known
as the Sons of Freedom. They form a group
of between 1,300 and 2,000 people who have
developed a penchant for public mischief and
the infringement of our laws, which would
indicate that we have a rather serious problem on our hands. It suggests to me that so
far as this group is concerned our program
of education for citizenship of new Canadians
has failed, that our school system has been
unable to reach these people, or that our
social welfare services have failed, or that
our law enforcement has broken down. It
may be that there has been a measure of
failure on the part of all these services. At
the same time, I think it only fair to state
that our law enforcement officers have shown
amazing patience, tolerance and restraint in
their dealings with these people.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I should probably have
added one more factor to those already enumerated, namely, that apparently the leadership of this group or this militant sect is
matriarchal. I have always heard that the
female of the species is more deadly than the
male, and the fact that the acknowledged
leader of the present trek is a doughty female
warrior called Big Fanny Stroganoff would
suggest that the men in this group play but
a minor and subservient role. This is literally
the fact, and I shall say more of it later.
It has occurred to me, as we live in a
city that has gained fame because of its
redoubtable feminine leader, that one of the
ways of providing a national task worthy of
Mayor Whitton's steel, and one that would

at the same time contribute to the public
welfare, would be to ask Ottawa's mayor as
a public service to go out and deal with this
very real and complicated problem. Mayor
Whitton has many of the qualities that would
stand her in good stead in performing such a
national task. If she should succeed where
the rest have failed we might give her not
only the keys to the city but the keys to all
Canada as well.
We may laugh and joke as much as we
like, but the situation so far as the Sons of
Freedom are concerned is one that reflects
on our ability as Canadian citizens to solve
a problem which, unless solved or mitigated,
will grow worse, and which could contain
many elements of disaster.
We have only to think of the risk to public
health that these people pose in the event of
an epidemic, be it Asian flu, scarlet fever or
any other sickness. Thirteen hundred people,
ill-housed and without medical services, could
cause havoc not only in the community in
which they live temporarily but throughout
the nation. Apropos of that, in yesterday's
Globe and Mail there was a story which described the kind of conditions which could
lead to this situation. It said:
Rain and warm winds, melting light
early snow, flooded the Coquihalla River
during the night and forced the 1,000
Sons from their cheerless riverside campsite.
It took them until 5 a.m. to complete
the move to a Seventh Day Adventists'
camp on higher ground near this town
100 miles east of Vancouver.
Their tents and tarpaper-and-plywood
shacks were dripping. Already short of
food, the Sons lost more of the precious
commodity in the confusion of mud and
rain. A total of 3.09 inches of rain fell
in the area yesterday and more early
today.
That is a situation about which any health
officer must be gravely concerned.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has drawn our attention to the fact that the lawlessness of these
people has already cost the country over $17
million in cash.

Other losses have been brought about in
the added cost of law enforcement and in
special housing for hundreds of people who
had to be locked up or segregated, and losses
by reason of the general atmosphere of un-

certainty and insecurity which these people
have created by their seemingly inexplicable
behaviour.

NOVEMBER 22, 1962
I referred a moment ago to my anarchist
friend in Stockholm. His beliefs would seem
to have been of a kind with those of the
Doukhobors. The following quotation from the
report of the Research Committee of the
University of British Columbia in 1952 is
descriptive of their beliefs and challenging
in its implications:
Their beliefs centred on direct revelation and guidance, which denied the need
for a church organization and by extension included a denial of governmental
authority and of the right of anyone to
use force in human affairs. The attempt
to construct complete and logical systems
of belief took them even farther, and the
translation of belief into action was pursued without compromises which are
usually labelled "common sense". In order
to protect their existence, however, they
developed ways to evade, mislead and
passively resist the inquiries and requirements of the authorities.
The first Doukhobors arrived in Canada in
1889, and there were 7,427 of them. A few
hundred more came in 1919, 1920 and in
1927, the last group coming with Peter
Verigin, the son of the first Doukhobor leader
in Canada.
The 1901 census recorded 8,858; the 1941
census 16,878; 1951, 13,175 and 1961, 13,234.
The decrease in the total numbers is explained
by the fact that many of them have broken
away from the sect and have been assimilated
as independent and self-supporting citizens.
As the honourable senator from Lumsden
(Hon. Mr. Pearson) said, many of them have
become successful and law-abiding farmers
in Saskatchewan and in British Columbia. We
even have a few in the Lundbreck and Cowley
areas of southwestern Alberta.
Fortunately the large majority of these
people present no problem; but the small
Sons of Freedom group, variously estimated
as being somewhere between 1,200 and 2,000
people, present one of the most complicated
problems a tolerant and humanitarian community has ever been called upon to solve.
It is one which, as the senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl) said in his address,
calls for tolerance, education and understanding. It is from this angle that I shall deal
with the matter.
I said that any effective solution to the
problem of the Sons of Freedom would require
a great deal of understanding and knowledge
of their background, their customs and their
beliefs. I think it is safe to say that we have
never had a more complicated group of
people with which to deal.

These people have had a long history of
conflict with established authority. In Russia
it was conflict with the church, the state and
the aristocracy. They were a poor, simple,
peasant people and, over the centuries, as
their conflict with authority continued, they
rationalized their conflict as so many people
do. Those who sought to repress them were
the privileged classes, those who possessed
wealth in material things. Therefore, not
having wealth they made a virtue of their
poverty. They were the dispossessed and those
who oppressed them, in their eyes at any
rate, were the landholders, the owners of
wealth; so, in their eyes the holding of land
was wrong.
One of their fundamental tenets and that
from which much of the basic conflict stems,
is that they, the Sons of Freedom, do not
believe in the ownership of land. They believe
that the land is a fundamental resource the
same as the water and the air we breathe and
should be free for the use of all people,
everywhere. The Doukhobors who are assimilated into our Canadian way of life have given
up this basic tenet of the Doukhobor faith
and are looked upon by the fanatical Sons
of Freedom as traitors to the true faith. The
attitude of the Doukhobor to the ownership
of land is one of the outstanding characteristics of this particular group-having neither
land nor much in the way of material goods,
they have made a virtue out of the circumstance.
There are a number of distinct personality
qualities which, while being possessed by all
people in some degree, are present in an
almost exaggerated form among the Sons of
Freedom. The first one, their feeling about
the ownership of land and material goods, I
have already referred to. The other basic
characteristics are passivity, dependence,
hostility, insecurity and difference.
It has been said that the typical Sons of
Freedom Doukhobor is a quiet, passive,
pleasant and agreeable person who is easy to
work with. These qualities are liked by employers, by the police and in fact by all those
who have had any dealings with them.
Schulman, one of the university team which
made a special study of this problem, in his
book The Doukhobors of British Columbia,
states:
The most passive Doukhobors are
severely disabled in their capacity to
handle many of the problems of living.
In the first place their security and selfesteem is seriously impaired by the lack
of anything that might be called a
"masculine" characteristic. In our society
forthright aggression is a male prerogative
and it is customary to include masculinity

SENATE
with aggressive competitiveness. The
passive Doukhobor cannot do this and
there is no specifically masculine set
of Doukhobor characteristics that he can
adopt to delineate his sexual role. Other
factors of Doukhobor behaviour further
undermine his concept of sex. In our
society, women not uncommonly use
their bodies and their clothing in a
seductive way to attract and interest
men.
This is Schulman talking, not me.
The Sons of Freedom women use
their nude bodies as desexualized objects to browbeat others. This custom
of desexualized nudity, with its implication of complete indifference of the feelings of men, therefore diminishes their
security in their sexual role.
It has been said that one of the reasons
why Doukhobor men wear beards is that this
distinctly masculine aspect was extremely
important to them. It was something that
women could not do. Similarly, be takes pride
in his physical vigour and health, his capacity to do heavy manual labour, and he
has a tendency to look down on work that
women can do.
Because the passive Doukhobor suffers
from an inhibition of self-assertion, it is
difficult for him to take responsibility or to
assume the duties of leadership. He is likely
to say, "I am just a follower and I do what
I am told". This, in part, explains the role
of leadership in a Doukhobor community.
It explains why they will follow people, even
bad leaders, because it represents the easy
way out from asserting themselves. Of course,
this is a characteristic that is not always
peculiar to the Doukhobors. Other people
have been known to follow bad leaders in the
history of the world.
Strangely enough, it has been suggested
that this passivity, or lack of assertiveness, is
the partial result of the matriarchal society
in which be grew up. In the typical Doukhobor family or community children are under a severe discipline at all times. This does
not mean they are treated unkindly. They
are usually well treated, and are kept clean
and well fed, within the limits of the resources of the home. But there is a code of
absolute obedience to parental authority
which bas been typical of Doukhobor life
for many generations; and it is a simple
transference, so far as the individual is concerned, from the authoritarian regime in the
home to the authoritarianism of a group or
a leader.
It has been suggested that one of the reasons the women dominate the Doukhobor

society, or the Sons of Freedom society, is
that from a very early age the little girls
are treated as young adults. At the age of
eight or nine they are given responsibilities
for household chores, minding younger children, minding the geese, and doing other
things which would not be normal in our
society until a much older age. They do
everything in co-operation with their mothers
and under their direction. Consequently, they
mature earlier so far as their assertiveness
is concerned. The little boys, on the other
hand, are left on their own to a much greater
extent. Most of the fathers find their employment away from home, sometimes coming home weekends and at other occasions
not for months at a time. Under the circumstances, where these little boys were not
in school, as the majority were not until
recently, they did not grow up with a feeling
of mastery of even the simple skills the
father may have possessed. They grew up
not only illiterate but unskilled as well, and
this meant as a rule that their only opportunity in the labour market was in the uncertain and intermittent opportunities of the
unskilled labour market. This situation, in
turn, has aggravated the individual's sense
of insecurity and dependence.
Dependence: Those who have studied the
Doukhobors carefully state that the more
passive Doukhobor male has little or no
capacity for self-direction and no confidence
in his own ability to make decisions. This
explains why be so readily turns to some
authoritarian figure, whether it be his wife,
or mother, or some appointed leader, for
support or direction in all affairs of importance.
The Doukhobor feels a tremendous need to
belong to a group and often will do things
which he knows to be wrong, or in which he
does not believe, rather than risk expulsion
from the group. One of the reasons for the
antagonism of the Sons of Freedom to the
public schools is that they believe a group can
only remain stable if it is not subjected to
disturbing outside influence, such as represented by public school education. When it is
realized that education can be a disturbing
factor, even in an educated society, it is not
hard to realize how an illiterate dissenter,
intensely jealous of ingrained beliefs and
prejudices, should see in education a major
threat to his way of life. Generally speaking,
it can be said that the group is held together
by fear arising out of ignorance. The
Doukhobor feels that if his society was disturbed or changed through education, one of
the main props of his dependence and
security would be removed. This fact underlines not only the importance of educating

NOVEMBER 22. 1962
these people, but also the difficulty in providing a type of education which can achieve
its results gradually and without driving the
people into themselves.
Hostility: It is a striking coincidence that
the Doukhobors who have succeeded in
Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia
are those who have gradually lost their
Doukhobor characteristics. They have lost
their sense of dependence. Those who have
not been so successful, or who, for one reason
or another, have failed and are drifting
around rootless in society, are usually the
ones who can be found within the folds of the
Sons of Freedom. These men, some of whom
are just plain failures, or who are excessively
passive individuals, do not cause too much
trouble, but within this fold can also be found
many who possess bitter and destructive feelings and impulses against society. They are
frustrated by the restrictions of community
living, by the moral code of the Doukhobor
society and by the insecurity of their financial
position. This fear and bitterness and distrust often expresses itself in burnings and
dynamiting and other hostile acts. The
hostility is expressed against the more successful members of the community, whether
they be Doukhobors or others, against the
Government and against established authority.
Many of the attitudes of the Sons of Freedom
towards education, industry and commerce
can be explained in terms of the desire to
express their bitterness and frustration
against outside people or objects. They like to
make people feel uncomfortable as a complement to their own insecurity and discomfort.
This explains, in part, their addiction to
nudism. They have found that removing
one's clothes is a most effective device for
making other people uncomfortable and
angry. Yet it is typical of people like this, that
women, particularly, rationalize this act as
an expression of their own purity.
Insecurity: Little need be said about this
characteristic of the Doukhobors' life. Their
religious tenets, which have made a virtue
out of a lack of possession of material goods,
are bound to make them insecure. On the
one hand, their illiteracy and lack of skills
assure that they will always have an inferior
position in society. One of the difficult tasks
of the educators of these people is to bring
them to understand that they will never
improve their lot until they do train themselves to be competitive with other members
of society.
Difference: It is one of the characteristics
of our society that many people tend to look
down on those who are different, who have
different beliefs, who act and dress differently
27511-5-20

and, in the case of the Doukhobors, this feeling of difference has been transformed into an
exaggerated feeling of insecurity and this in
turn makes them want to hit out at established society.
One could go on at length in emphasizing
the psychological differences which motivate
and separate the Doukhobors from what
might be called a normal society. I have
simply outlined these characteristics in order
to emphasize the fact that while the only
road to the salvation of these people is
through education, it can only be done
through an instructional program that is
adapted to their peculiar needs and circumstances and which is carried out under the
direction of people who have been carefully
and especially trained for the task.
Numerous experiments have been tried. At
the time of the Piers Island separation of
1932, and the more recent occasion when the
children were taken away from their parents
and sent to school at New Denver, the hope
was that by taking the children out of the
parental climate and giving them a normal
Canadian education it would help them to
become better adjusted and more readily
accepted in our way of life. However, I think
it is recognized now that the New Denver
experiment resulted only in making these
children more confirmed, more literate rebels
against our way of life. In other words, there
was a hardening process which took place
there and the tendency toward rebellion
seemed to crystallize in that group more than
others. All of which serves to underline the
fact that if we are to rescue these people
from their present maladjusted course, the
commonly suggested plan of taking the children away from the parents is definitely not
the answer.
Our answer must be found through the
establishment in the Doukhobor community
of some form of vocational training. This
could be a combination of agricultural and
trades training for the boys and household
management for the girls, but such training
must be carried out with the children living
with their parents. It must be carried out
with people who are especially trained for
this particular task; it must be carried
out with sympathy and understanding, and we
must not expect spectacular results in a short
period of time.

Generally speaking, it is my view as one
who has had some experience in education,
that it will be necessary to employ both
teachers and social workers, and there must
be several of the latter, to discover the good
and constructive qualities of these people,
and they have many. They are peace-loving

FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, November 14, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Croll for the second reading
of Bill S-3, to make provision for the disclosure of information in respect of finance
charges.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I rise at this time to support the general
principle of clearer and simpler disclosure
of the costs of consumer commodity financing
in Canada. By "clearer and simpler" I mean
clearer and simpler than the methods of
disclosure practised generally in business
today. I am not going to suggest that this one
step will solve all the problems of this most
complex matter.
During the last few days I have made an
attempt to familiarize myself with this subject, and if it is wondered why I venture
into these deep waters I can only say that
I thought it my duty to inform myself on a
subject which appears to me to be of considerable general and individual public interest.
I certainly do not want to minimize this
problem. Much has to be done to make sure
that the present charges in this field, which
we sometimes call "instalment finance
charges," are neither excessive nor exorbitant. However, I am not going to suggest
what might be done in that larger field.
The bill before us suggests one specific
step that might be taken. I am sorry to say
that I do not think it is quite the right
step. If I believed that this bill would achieve
its objective, I would support it without
hesitation and do everything I could to help
see that it was made law.
I must admit that for some years before I
was appointed to this chamber I read of the
earlier bills of a similar character introduced
by the sponsor of the present one, the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon.
Mr. Crol), and I had a good deal of sympathy for his endeavours and felt that it
was good legislation. I felt much the same way
when I heard his speech on the introduction
of the present bill. Then I began to do a little
studying and I changed my mind.

SENATE
Perhaps I should indicate both the extent
and the limits of that study. I do not pretend for one minute that I have gone into it
as exhaustively as many honourable senators
have. I have merely tried to inform myself
as best I could in the short time available
to me, and I have reached certain conclusions.
Naturally, I have looked at the various acts
-the Bank Act, the Small Loans Act, the
Interest Act, and also those acts which provide for financing out of public credit by
Government agencies and boards and through
Government guarantees for various systems of
financial assistance to extend credit. I looked
at the Dominion Bureau of Statistics publications, the leading brochures and presentations
of credit unions, sales finance companies,
credit loan companies, and so on, all of
which represents a large volume of literature.
I have been particularly interested in reading the presentations that have been made
to the Royal Commisison on Banking and
Finance. The subject is quite exhaustively
discussed in some of those presentations,
particularly those of the sales finance companies-a term which I use to include all
who are more or less exclusively engaged in
that business.
I might say at this point that the terminology on this subject is confusing. All sorts of
terms are used loosely, and one of the recommendations made, which I am sure will be
considered by the commission, is that of
reaching some degree of uniformity in the
use of the these terms in common use, not
only in business practice but also in legislation on the subject. Of course I have read
the speeches made here recently, and some
of those made on an earlier occasion.
At this time I think it proper for me to say
that I am expressing purely personal views.
I have not consulted anyone directly interested in this subject; I have not talked to anyone in credit unions, or anyone who is specifically in the business, nor have I talked to the
sociologists who have become deeply concerned with this problem.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): This is
not to be a political speech.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I thank the honourable
leader for his interjection. I do not know
whether that is an expression of relief on
his part. I can assure him it is not to be a
partisan speech; it will not be a party speech;
and it will not be one of those speeches in
which the speaker begins by saying "This is
not a party speech; I don't believe in party
speeches in the Senate," and then proceeds to
make a rollicking and decidedly partisan
speech, such as we heard yesterday. That is
the difference between my assurance that this

will not be a partisan speech and the assurances given by some others. However,
there will be one small area of partisanship,
because when you look into the facts of the
economy of Canada today it is difficult not to
say, "Something must have brought this
about; perhaps it was the Government in
power". When you consider the facts it is
sometimes difficult not to reach that conclusion
-difficult for me at least, if not for others.
One of the first names I came across when
I began to look into this matter was that of
the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt)-and I am sorry he is not
here today-who bas had long experience in
one particular aspect of this problem, and,
indeed, a vast knowledge of the whole subject. I am sure all honourable senators will
agree with me that we are fortunate in having him and others like him who are equally
well informed. However, I first came across
his name as an expert witness before the
Banking and Commerce Committee of the
other place when it was studying this problem in 1937 and 1938. I was interested to see
that the chairman of that committee was the
late W. H. Moore, M.P., and I have no doubt,
having known him and something of his
literary reputation, that be was the author of
the rather brilliant report of that committee
in 1938. I mention his name because he was
the member for fifteen years-1930 to 1945,
I believe-for that part of Ontario in which
I spent much of my life, Ontario county,
known federally as Ontario riding. He was a
neighbour of mine, and in the short time I
had the honour of his acquaintance, I came
to regard him as a great man, and my respect
for his memory is considerable. I mention that
because he is buried in a little cemetery in
Pickering, from which area I have the honour
to have taken my Senate designation.
The Small Loans Act, of which Mr. Moore
may be said to have been the author, deals
of course with only some parts of this larger
problem of the extension of credit. It is true
that all areas of credit are fairly closely interrelated, and perhaps the small loans area and
the area that this bill brings into discussion
are more closely allied than most. I think
perhaps that may be the fact which bas led
the honourable senator who moved this bill
(Hon. Mr. Croîl) into some degree of error.
The bill, as it comes before us, is a simple
bill and has merits that apparently are not
attributable to some of the bills that came
before us the other day. It is simple; it is
clear in its language; and it has just five sections: No. 1 is the title; No. 2 is the definitive
section; No. 3 the operative section, No. 4,

NOVEMBER 22, 1962
what somebody has called the "penalty section"; and No. 5 the regulations. I think
section 3 describes very well the purpose of
the bill. It says:
Every credit financier who enters into
a transaction extending credit to another
person, as referred to in paragraph (a)
of section 2, shall in accordance with
regulations made under section 5, and
before the transaction is complete, furnish such other person with a clear
statement in writing setting forth
(a) the total amount of the unpaid
balance outstanding;
(b) the total amount of the finance
charges to be borne by such other person in connection with the transaction;
and
(c) the percentage relationship, expressed in terms of simple annual interest, that the total amount of the finance
charges bears to the unpaid balance outstanding under the transaction.
Every credit financier is covered. Having
reached that stage I began to ask myself,
"who is a credit financier? To whom does
this term refer?" In section 2, the definition
section, paragraph (a) explains that:
"credit financier" means any person who
in the ordinary course of his business,
whether operated separately or in conjunction with some other business, enters
into a transaction with another person
arising out of a sale or agreement for
the sale of personal property to such other
person whereby the whole or part of the
price therefore is to become payable after
the transaction is complete, and in respect of which finance charges are to become payable to such person.
Now, it is clear who is to become a credit
financier. And, if my reading of the bill is
correct, we are going to have a nation of
credit financiers, because this refers to any
person who in the ordinary course of his
business enters into a transaction for the
sale of personal property and charges any
finance charges whatsoever.
Am I incorrect in assuming that these plain
words would cover a situation such as this:
A customer walks into a hardware merchant's
store in a small town and says, "I want to
buy a vacuum cleaner for my wife. How
much?" The hardware merchant replies,
"That will cost you $70 cash. If you do not
want to pay cash I will have to charge you
$80." That merchant then becomes a credit
financier. He is doing this in the ordinary
course of business. He is entering into a
transaction with another person arising out
of a sale. There does not have to be a written
agreement for sale. This man is a credit

financier, and under this bill he would be
required to set forth in writing the percentage relationship of the extra charge in terms
of simple annual interest.
For that reason and others, although I approve the principle, I think this bill is impractical. With all due respect, honourable
senators, I think there is a very great danger
in going too far with legislation that will
not work. We have had noble experiments
in the history of legislation before, and by
and large I think most will agree that they
have done more harm than good. I think this
is a noble experiment, but I would respectfully suggest that the bill in its present form
is not realistic in terms of business as it
is conducted today.
Honourable senators, this is big business.
I have tried to work out the figures by means
of my own amateur arithmetic, because nobody seems to have come up with total figures.
I have had these figures checked by an
economist. It seems to me that the total annual credit business in Canada is about $8
billion, of which about $5 billion comes
within this field of what I call consumer
commodity financing. Those are the total annual amounts, and about 60 per cent is outstanding at any one given time. That gives
a figure of about $5 billion of ail credit, and
about $3 billion of consumer finance credit. If
we take the gross national product as $40
billion, then it can be said that about 12j
per cent of credit in this particular field is
outstanding. I have used approximate figures
for the reason I gave, but I think they are
reasonably accurate.
Looking at it in terms of people, I think
it is correct to say that about 4 million of
the 4.8 million families, according to the
latest census, are in some way involved in
buying consumer goods on credit.
I am not one of those who hold up their
hands in horror every time they are told
that Canadians owe a lot of money for the
goods they are using. I think that the use
of personal and individual credit is just as
important in the maintenance of a rising
standard of living, and a continually rising
standard of living, as is the use of commercial
credit and government credit which is necessary for the increase in gross national productivity. I see no reason for going around
blaming people because they are getting the
immediate use of goods by having confidence
in their own ability. I do not think you can
blame them any more than you can blame
a business for going out and buying machinery on instalments, or a government

SENATE
which in certain circumstances finds it necessary to borrow money to carry on the business of government or to provide for the immediate generation public works which will
be used for a long time.
I had intended to give a short rundown of
the various areas in this business, because it
is very interesting, but in view of the hour
I will say to anyone who is interested that
the information is summarized in the D.B.S.
bulletin on Credit Statistics as of August
1962 (revised). I will merely read the names
of some of the companies so that the whole
picture can be put in focus.
There are sales finance companies which
are in both the consumer goods credit business and commercial credit business. There
are small loan companies which are in the
cash loans business and, to the extent of $38
million, in the instalment credit business.
There are the department stores, and the
furniture, appliance and other retail stores.
The chartered banks are in the business; the
life insurance companies are to some extent
in the general credit business, although not
in the general area under discussion. The
Quebec savings banks are in it. Also in the
general credit business we now have the
service field which takes in credit cards of
oil companies and hotels, and we are all
aware of the continual problems with respect
to doctors' and dentists' bills, and other such
bills.
I spoke a moment or two ago about the
presentations made to the Royal Commission
on Banking and Finance, and in that respect
three things stand out. One is this tremendous diversity of interest that I spoke of.
The second is that the people in the business
are not altogether happy about each other.
It is amazing to consider how many of these
presentations filed contain complaints about
competition from somebody else. The credit
unions would like to see something done in
this respect, and others would like something
done about the credit unions. The loan companies would like something done about the
way the banks are operating in this field.
There is a general worry about competition.
In itself I think this is a good thing because
this is a competitive business. While I am
far from convinced that there are not excesses
and abuses in this business I think from my
study-which is not exhaustive-it is fair
to say that competition is working to hold
rates down. It certainly is so in what one
might call the more respectable and legitimate
elements in business.
The third complaint, and you have all
heard of it, is about government credit. All
these institutions say that in the last few
years they have been faced with something
new and very different with the entry of the

federal Government into this field of credit.
They say that the federal Government is
competing with them. They mention home
improvement loans, farm improvement loans,
and they speak particularly of the activities
of the Industrial Development Bank. In the
presentation by one of the major companies
there is mention of business that they tried
to develop and which they had at the point
of closing when suddenly the borrower went
to the Industrial Development Bank. Perhaps
I might be allowed to quote from one
presentation without mentioning the name of
the company, because I prefer not to:
Naturally the lower cost of money was
more attractive and where choice was
available, the I.D.B. loan was accepted...
This is where I might say to the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald, Brantford) I take some satisfaction from this indication that the Government
of Canada is operating in this field of consumer credit, and is thus bringing down the
rates for the people of Canada. Whatever else
may be said, I think it is clear that something is being done at the government level
with this problem of tight money.
Perhaps I should add that there is some
evidence of results. Just before I came in I
was handed the current issue of Newsweek,
which is an American magazine. I will read
a few words from it, honourable senators,
because I think it is good news:
Worldwide industrial expansion is 7%
over last year with the U.S. (coming out
of a recession) and Canada registering
the top gain of 10%.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I am glad
to have the information, but I am wondering
what it has to do with this bill.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I was speaking of the
result of this particular element in this area
of credit. I am suggesting that Government
action had something to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): It may
have.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: There is always a reason
for good news and it is well if somebody can
suggest the reason for the good news.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Pass it along.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: In regard to the relationship of this credit to the overall national
fiscal policy, I do not intend to deal with
that now, as it is a big subject, further than
to say that on two occasions, at any rate,
the whole business was put under wartime
controls-in World War Il and in the Korean
War.

NOVEMBER 22, 1962
The second area in which this impinges on
the public interest is in its effect on the
individual who has to borrow money. The
bill before us provides an interesting suggestion. I believe that clearer and fuller
disclosure, which seems to be the intention
of the bill, is a proper starting point. I have
indicated why I do not think this particular
method of insisting that the disclosure be in
terms of simple annual interest is a practical
one. I gave one reason why I thought it
impracticable and I now give another. It is
an example taken from the literature of one
of the finance companies. If a departrnent
store makes an instalment sale involving an
unpaid balance of $30, repayable at the rate
of $10 per month, that would make the outstanding loan payable over three months.
The store then decides it had better get $2
over and above the $30 to cover its cost of
processing the transaction. I understand that
that comes to 40 per cent if expressed in
terms of annual interest. On the other hand,
a $10,000 mortgage on a home at the rate of
5î per cent over 25 years, would yield $9,000.
This makes it look like a case of apples and
oranges.
My experience in business is that if any
merchant simply says: "I have to get $2 on
$30 credit for three months at $10 a month",
it is not possible to force him to put in writing: "This sale is in terms of 40 per cent
interest". This is where we come into the
area of impracticability. If it will not work,
there will be evasion. I am sure that there
is tremendous scope for evasion in this field.
I should like to give as another example
the case of one who finances an automobile.
If I were to finance the purchase of an automobile tomorrow, I would say "Forget the
insurance; I will transfer it frorn my present
car to the new car". Somebody else may say
to the dealer: "I am buying a new car; you
look after the insurance". It is a normal
transaction. Comparing those two transactions, adding the cost of insurance in one and
not in the other, and expressing it in the
terms suggested in this bill, although the
two transactions are essentially the same, the
interest in the purchase in which the cost of
insurance is financed would be two to three
times greater than in the other case, depending on the total amount.
Honourable senators, I have a suggestion
to make which I believe is a sensible one,
and the honourable sponsor of this bill (Hon.
Mr. Croil) might find it possible to agree with
me regarding it.
I am not satisfied with the present situation. I suggest that we decide on some minimum, along the lines in the Small Loans Act,
to take care of cases such as that of the
hardware merchant I mentioned. I do not

believe that everyone can be put under the
necessity of expressing in a written contract
what is being done. There would have to be
some escape clause, as in the Small Loans
Act. It provides that one does not come under
the licensing clauses of the act unless one is
charging in excess of one per cent per
month. I do not suggest what the escape
clause might be; that is not pertinent to my
argument. In the case of those who are
actively engaged in this type of business, the
financing of commodity goods, such as department stores and perhaps banks, which is a
tricky field but perhaps it should be brought
under this, I suggest that provision be made
whereby they must disclose not just the three
figures mentioned in this bill, which does not
go far enough, but all the information. I
suggest that a standardized form be used
which would clearly and separately show
certain things in figures at least twice the
size of the body type. One of the common
complaints is that people do not see these
figures, as they are hidden in the fine print.
I think that is a legitimate complaint. We
should insist that on the front page, on the
face of the contract, in a box, there should
be a standardized form which would clearly
and separately show the following; the selling
price of the goods, the down payment, the
first balance owing, the total cost of all
finance charges, then the second balance
owing-in some cases, after the down payment, the borrower might owe still more;
if so, let it be disclosed-and then the number, dates, and amounts of the instalments.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask a question just
to clarify the situation? What would you do
with a revolving account?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: When the previous question was asked, I said I was glad that it was
asked; but as to this one, I am sorry it has
been asked because having looked into the
matter only briefly I regret to say that I do
not know the answer. There are many kinds
of financing. I am stating a principle. I am
not introducing a bill, and I would not want
to draft one. It is an extremely difficult
subject, and I am neither a lawyer nor a
financier.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Perhaps
this matter could be worked out if the bill
goes to committee.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I am quite sure it could.
There are six or seven different types of
accounts now in use by various department
stores, but they all come down to the one
essential principle. It might be necessary to
keep sending out statements in connection
with a revolving account, but that sort of
thing is done every day in business, and it
would have to be worked out.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I do not want to take
up any more of your time. I trust I have made
my suggestions clear, and also made it clear
that I am not opposed to the principle of this
bill. I am well aware of the concern of the
honourable senator who sponsored it. I have
deep respect for his interest, integrity and
purpose. I merely say that I do not see how
it could work. I wish the bill could work,
because then I would support it. I am not
doubting the constitutional issue.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Might it not be a question as to whether it should come under
provincial or federal legislation?
Hon. Mr. Grosari: It is a very big question.
I have given it some study, but I am not competent to say. The suggestion has been made,
of course, that whereas interest is within the
federal jurisdiction, other charges may be
within provincial jurisdiction, and the two
might somehow be telescoped together. However, as the sponsor of the bill pointed out,
the two are lumped together under the Small
Loans Act. I understand that Mr. Varcoe, an
eminent civil servant, learned in the law,
felt that somehow these things could be
brought together. I am one of those who believe that where there is a will there is a way.
If the principle is accepted, if it is decided
that something should be done to protect the
public interest, I am quite sure that both the
federal and provincial governments will get
together. As a matter of fact, provincial
legislation is coming a long way into this
sphere, as in Alberta, and by recent legislation in Manitoba which, by the way, has not

yet been proclaimed. I do not pretend to know
any secrets, but it appears to me that the
problem is being re-examined for the very
reason I am mentioning, that they want it to
make sense.
Thank you for your attention, honourable
senators.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I put a question to
the honourable senator? I understood him to
say that there is a problem here, but that it
is possible for progress to be made. Under
those circurnstances, can we not agree
that this bill should be sent to a committee
where these ideas can be promulgated, examined carefully, and perhaps the suggestions
he has made, if found acceptable to the committee, might be written into the bill? In that
way we might make some progress, rather
than kill a measure which has been in our
hands for the past three or four years. I do
not agree with the honourable senator's
objections, but if the bill were referred to a
committee it is possible that such amendments
as he has suggested could be made.
Hon. Mr. Grosar: I would say this to the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), that if my views have
any weight, I would certainly support that
suggestion.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, debate

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 7, 1962
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-86, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service for the financial year
ending the 31st of March, 1963.
Bill read first time.
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move that this
bill be read the second time now.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Before the bill
is read the second time, may I ask the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) if there
are any copies of the bill available.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes; there should be 25
or 30 copies available.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Will they
be distributed?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes. Bill C-86 has just
arrived, and I regret that honourable senators
have not had more time to review it. The
bill has just received third reading in the
other place.
Honourable senators will recall that we
passed three supply bills in the spring before
the last Parliament was dissolved, and then
again released supply Bill C-68 on October
24 last to provide for financial requirements
to November 30. The present bill, which is
in the usual form for interim supply bills, is
to meet the necessary requirements for the
public service up to December 31. It asks for
one-twelfth of all items voted in the estimates except those set forth in section 2(a).
These latter items have already received
eleven-twelfths of the supply and are excepted from the present provisions. The
amount to be released by this general request for one-twelfth is $303,189,049.67.
In addition to the one-twelfth which is
sought in general, an additional two-twelfths
is required for three votes in the Department
of Public Works, and three votes in the Department of Transport. These items are set
forth and dealt with in Schedule A of the
bill. Honourable senators will note that this
amount is $3,652,166.67.
Section 2(c) provides for an additional onetwelfth for certain items that will be found
in Schedule B. The amount is $12,122,533.34.
Honourable senators will have noted that I
tabled the Supplementary Estimates (A) for
the fiscal year 1962-63, and I trust that copies
of these have been received by everyone.
Interim supply is also being requested with
respect to the supplementary estimates. The
general request is for nine-twelfths of the
supplementary items to a total of $121,079,360.25.

Passage of this bill will mean that practically the same proportion of supply will have
been released in regard to the supplementary
estimates as to the general estimates.
An additional two-twelfths is required of
the supplementary estimates in respect of
one vote in the Department of External Affairs and two votes in the Department of
Transport, the details of which appear in
Schedule C of the bill.
The net total amount of these estimates
is $9,430,166.67, and the total amount provided by this measure, Bill C-86, is $449,473,276.60.
In no instance is the total amount of any
item, in either the general estimates or the
supplementary estimates that I have tabled,
being released by this bill. The passage of this
bill will not prejudice the rights and privileges of honourable senators to criticize any
item in the estimates when the main supply
bill comes forward. The usual undertaking
is hereby given that such rights and privileges will be respected, and will not be curtailed or restricted in any way as the result
of the passing of this measure.
I have here a summary of the supply bills
of the fiscal year 1962-63 which I now ask
leave of honourable senators to place on
Hansard.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The statement sets forth
the total estimates for the year 1962-63 as
revised, plus the supplementary estimates,
and also the amount voted on previous appropriation bills together with the amount
that is provided for by this bill. With leave,
I place this summary on the record.

1962-63 is $3,932,775,068.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, it is obvious that we are dealing
with quite a large surn of rnoney tonight. It
is impossible for us to go into the details of
all the items, but I would point out that in
the space of perhaps haif an hour we are
disposing of the surn of $449,473,276.60practically haîf a billion dollars. The Leader
of the Governrnent (Hon. Mr. Brooks) has
kindly agreed that in voting this money so
quickly tonight we will not prejudice our
rights to discuss any item at sorne future date.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Can the honourable senator
tell us what would happen if we defeated the
bill?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: We would not get paid.
Hon. Mr. Brook.: 1 was quoting the remarks of rny honourable friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) when he was speaking in 1956.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is a
very good precedent and I hope the honourable leader follows me in many other respects.
I rnay say to my friend the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) that I arn not suggesting we should
defeat it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not refer to this bull,
but to a later bill, when we are to be given

the privilege of considering these items. What
would happen if, in our wisdom, we were to
def eat such a bill?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Then the
Senate would have to accept responsibility
for that action. 1 arn not even suggesting that
we should do that.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It would be quite a
precedent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, we should consider rnost carefufly bis involving expenditure presented to
us here. We are prevented frorn going into
thern in detail, since they corne to us at
almost the last hour of the day on which they
are required to obtain royal assent. There is
no use in rny saying that we are going to
consider thern ini the future. I do flot think
we will give cons ideration to thern, 1 rnay say
very frankly. It seerns to me that the final
appropriation bill will corne to us at the close
of this session, on the very last day, when it
will be impossible for us to give due consideration to it.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: May I ask a question? As
one who is relatîvely new in this house, I
arn wondering how the Liberals proceeded
when they were on this sîde of the house?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In the same way.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): The only
difference, when we were on the other sîde
of the bouse, was that we cornplained to the
Governiment of the day about the lateness of
the hour that the bils carne to us.

SENATE
the whole procedure again? It is, to say the
least, monotonous. About a month ago we
went over the same ground that we are
going over now. I ask, is that the way the
business of the country should be managed
and our affairs conducted? I say to honourable senators on the other side that the
conduct of the aff airs of this country is in
the hands of the Government and I do not
think it is being done in a businesslike
manner.
I do not intend to go over the items one
by one. However, I should like to point out
that we are going to save $228 million this
year because of the revision of the estimates.
Someone said that that did not include supplementary estimates. The original estimates for
this year were $6,276,211,594.
Now, those
estimates were revised-they were shoved
aside. The new estimates were tabled amounting to $6,048,214,560; that is a reduction of
$227,997,034. That is the saving. If the government was not considering supplementary
estimates, why not? I can understand when
estimates are prepared in January, as the
original estimates were, that the Government
could not foresee additional estimates that
would take place in October, November, and
probably January and February of the next
year; but these revised estimates were prepared in September this year. Now in November the Government finds that it did not
include items amounting to $148 million. I
can
understand how there would be
some amounts left out, but surely this is a
substantial amount.
Honourable senators will remember having

Hon. Mr. Drouin: And you were never
listened to.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I think
that on one occasion we got the bill three
days before prorogation, which was something. It was better than has been done by
this Government. If the present Government
aimed at that, they might get these bills to
us even earlier. We did not sit idly by; and
I do not think we should sit idly by now.
Honourable senators, tonight the question
is a different one. This is an interim supply
bill. The Government must have money to
carry on the business of the country during
the month of December. One may ask why
the Government has not got the money. It
does not get it until this bill is passed by
Parliament. The revised estimates for this
year have not been considered in the other
house, with the exception of one for the
Department of Agriculture. So the Government cannot get any money unless it comes
in this way and receives it, and I do not think
we are going to prevent the Government from
getting it.
Honourable senators, what amazes me is
that the Government is asking for money
for only the month of December. What is
going to happen in January? We shall not be
here much after December 15, at least I hope
not. If that is the case and we have gone
home, how is the Government going to pay
its bills in January?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By warrants of the
Governor in Council.

NOVEMBER 27. 1962
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Well,
maybe the spring thaw. I suggest it will be
the Spring breakup.
I am not going to delay the house longer,
but I felt I should bring to its attention
the large amount involved and that we are
not going to save any $228 million. I hope that
in future we shall not have to deal with
interim supply every month, or every two
weeks, as will be the case for the remainder
of this year.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: To which item is the
honourable senator referring?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The allowances are
said to be recoverable. From whom?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I will be very glad to

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I move the adjournment

Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
wonder if I may speak to the amendment for
a minute.
This interim supply bill is for the month
of December. This is the 27th day of November; the month will be over in a few days,
and we will then need the money to cover
the expenses for the month of December. I
say to honourable senators that personally I
have no objection to any criticism that the
honourable senator opposite may offer. However, I have gone back through Hansard for
a good many years and this is the first time
I have ever heard or read of anyone moving
an amendment to a bill of this kind.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): No amendment has been moved.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The honourable senator
from Rigaud moved an amendment a moment
ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): But he
is now asking that the debate be adjourned.
Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: He was corrected
by the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): It was
his mistake.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I have no objection, but
in 1956, for instance, when the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) was in the same position
as I am now inHon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): In the
same difficulties.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes, but they were not
made so difficult-that is what I wish to point
out to honourable senators.
An appropriation bill was introduced in
this place on March 22, 1956, and there was
no objection made to that bill at all, except
that the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) did object to
what he thought was a transgression of some
of the rules. On that occasion the late Senator
John T. Haig came to the defence of the then
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), and said that the bill
should be allowed to go through as in the
case of other such bills from time immemorial.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): That is
a bad precedent.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: If I may refer honourable
senators to the interim supply bill, Appropriation Bill No. 3, which was given first reading
in this place on June 12, 1956, as reported at
page 705 of Senate Hansard,the only remarks
made were by the then Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford). On

NOVEMBER 27. 1962
that occasion bis introductory remarks were
very short, no objection was raised by anyone, and the interim supply bill was passed
later than day.
Three or four other interim supply bis
went tbrougb in 1956. In that year Parliament prorogued on August 14, and the hast
Appropriation Bill was introduced in this
place on that day, just an hour or so before
prorogation.
I simply point out these matters to honourable senators to illustrate wbat I consider
to be inconsistency on the part of the Opposition tonight. As 1 say, I amrn ot complaining,
but I could point to other occasions during
other sessions wben there was no debate on
interimi supply.
0f course, it wouid be impossible for the
Leader of the Government in the Senate to
answer ail the questions that migbt be asked
on supply. As bonourable senators know, in
the other place there are twenty departments
and twenty ministers in charge of their
supply. In supply a staff of civil servants sits
in front of the minister responsible and feeds
him the necessary information. I do not
think it was ever the intention that these
interimi suppiy bills sbould necessitate prolonged debate or answers to numerous inquiries regarding different estimates.
Hon. Mr. Croil: Honourable senators, I
agree witb everything the honourable gentleman bas just said, but let us be fair. The
objection taken by the bonourable senator
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) was that be
did flot bave a copy of the bill.
Hom. Mr. Drouin: That was not bis main
objection; that was only incidentai.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It may bave been 'Iaccidental", but he did not receive a copy.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: I can give bim my copy.
Hon. Mr. Croli: I can give bim mine, but
the point is be did not bave it at the desired
moment. It makes sense that the least that
couid be done is that eacb bonourable senator be provided with a copy. I did not complain, but 1 do appreciate wbat the honourable gentleman is saying. Ever since I bave
been a member of this bouse-and I have
sat on both sides-we have always complained, about such a tbing, but no one bas
ever stood up and said: thus far and no
furtber. Not for a moment would I wisb to
prevent tbis bill being put tbrougb. However,
I would be deiigbted if at some time someone stood Up and said: thus far and no furtber. Perbaps the matter could tben be
rectifled. Ail I say is that any bonourable
senator is entitled to see a copy of tbe bill
before bie is asked to vote baif a billion
dollars.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, in
connection with tbe question that bas been
raised as to circulation of copies of the bull,
may I say my understanding is that despite
the fact tbis bill bas already been considered
for two days in tbe other place, there were
only about 20 copies of tbe bill made available to the wbole House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Do you approve of that?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: No. I personally endeavoured to obtain a copy of tbe bill for every
bonourable senator tonigbt. This is flot the
first time that 1 bave been in toucb witb Dr.
Ollivier's office. I am told that only a small
number of these bills are printed before the
bill comes before the other place.

SENATE

Instead of having special committees constituted for such purposes, the Finance Committee has remained dormant, and unable to
carry out the functions that were assigned
to it in the beginning.
I would suggest to my friend the honourable the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Brooks), that early in the session, when
the estimates are available, they should be
assigned to the Finance Committee for consideration. Then the departmental heads, or
any other officials who could throw some
light on these matters, could be called before
that committee and inquiry made so that in
future we should not be faced, every time
supply has to be passed in this house, with
interminable recriminations as to why we
did not know about individual items earlier.
By resuming the work of the Finance Committee the members of this chamber might
become more intimately acquainted with supply bills before they are required to vote.

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, if
my memory serves me right, the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) is
in error if he attempts to maintain that the
Finance Committee, headed by Senator
Crerar, was concerned with unemployment
and the cost of government at all levels. I
remember well that, because of the opposition
from the people on his side to Senator Crerar's
report, I had to go to his defence in no uncertain way to enable him to make a report
that was of any value. He was accused of
injuring his own party and I don't know
what else, and I had to support him and
declare that he was working in the best
interests of Canada and endeavouring to perform a public service on that committee. Even
then he was not allowed to bring in the report
he wished to present. But that committee had
nothing at all to do with what we are talking
about tonight, the general financial picture of
Canada and the provinces.

Hon. Mr. Brooks: I am grateful to the
honourable senator for this suggestion, but
I should like to ask him this question: is it
not true that on many occasions it proved
difficult to obtain a quorum for the sittings
of that committee because other committees
were sitting simultaneously?

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable Senators, I would point out that the motion now
before the house is, after all, a motion to
adjourn the debate on second reading of Bill
C-86 and, as I interpret the rules, this motion
is not debatable. Therefore, I should put the
question on the motion.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would like to assure
my friend that there was never any trouble
in obtaining a quorum for that committee.
The published reports of its proceedings, when
my friend the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), was chairman
of it, are not only on record but received
more attention from the press of this country
than the reports of almost any other committee
of the Senate. And those reports, while they
were prepared by a special subcommittee of
the Finance Committee, were only prepared
after thorough discussion and good attendance
by the members of the committee. Senator
Haig was one of the most active on that
committee, and I could name the others if
necessary.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: With unanimous
consent, and seeing that His Honour the
Speaker has allowed so many to speak, I
suggest the debate should not be cut off so
peremptorily.
The Hon. the Speaker: I shall hear the
honourable gentleman.

Hon. Thomas Vien: I can bear witness to the
fair-mindedness and reasonableness of the
Honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Brooks). I have known him for a number of years both in the other place and here,
and I am pleased to give that testimony.
I am sure I can appeal to that reasonable
fair-mindedness when I say to him tonight

out of a study of it.
I would, for instance, request an explanation as to why some items are for nine
months, others are for one month, and others
for a different number of months. It is reasonable to request such information from. the
Goverrnent, and 1 appeal to the Leader of
the Government to agree to do this. I do flot

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
crave the indulgence o! the house for one
minute. I arn sure the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) does not want to
rush this bill through, although 1 can appreciate the fact that the Governmnent probably
would like to have it receive royal assent
tomorrow, since Wednesday is apparenthy
a more opportune day than Thursday for
receiving royal assent.
It occurred to me that we should toniglit
give consent to the bill receiving second
reading without notice, If we were to adhere
strictly to the rules, the bll could not; receive
second reading until Thursday. If this bill is
allowed to stand over for second reading
until tomorrow, couhd we not now agree
that when it receives second reading it can
also be brought forward tomorrow for third
reading? Thus, there would be no danger
of any delay.

Vien, that the debate on the motion for

pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt, the

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I think

under the present section of the Income
Tax Act dealing with lump sum payments.
Honourable senators, I think that this may
be representative of the circumstances in
which many widows find themselves in connection with settlements of estates, and I
believe that in such circumstances a widow
should be entitled to the provision which is
available in certain instances whereby the
lump sum of income is assessed over a period
of three or more years.
I realize that it may be too late to deal
with this matter in the present bill, but I
feel that it is timely, when honourable senators are considering the provisions of the
bill, to bring to their attention this obvious
failure of the Income Tax Act to extend what
I consider fair and equitable treatment to
many widows.
I respectfully suggest to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
that he bring this matter to the attention of
the Government with a view to correcting
what I am sure all honourable senators will
agree is unfair discriminaiton.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I want to add a word in connection with
the production incentive, which is part of the
bill before us.
In speaking in the debate on the motion for
second reading I referred to the complex
character of the calculations which cover seven
or eight pages of the bill, and I made a suggestion as to an alternative method which would
appear to achieve the same results. It pays to
reflect, and having reflected upon the suggestion
I made, and after putting questions to witnesses when the bill was before the committee, I
want to state now in brief and clear form
what I hope is an alternative method which
is, in its essence, simple and would accomplish
the same results.
My suggestion is that the increase in net
sales, which is the basis of the production incentive, be determined in the same way as
it is proposed under this bill-that is, by
comparing it with the past year-and, secondly, that the Government determine what
is the reasonable amount of incentive in
dollars that it is prepared to give in relation
to dollar volume of increase in sales.
Let us assume that you are dealing with
an increase in sales of $50,000, and that the
Government establishes a rate of 3 per cent
of those sales, which would be $1,500. They
would say: that should be sufficient in the
way of production incentive to spur the
person to increase his sales. Instead of having
all the calculations which are in the bill for
determining how you are going to affect

tax in that regard, my suggestion then is
that you take that 3 per cent-in this case it
is $1,500-and permit it as a deduction directly from tax otherwise payable.
This has the virtue of absolute simplicity.
It does not constitute any raid upon the
treasury or upon the financial resources of
the country to any greater extent than the
plan which covers six or seven pages of this
bill, because an increase in sales of $50,000
by the formulae which are contained in this
bill provides a tax saving of $1,230. Why go
through all these complications when it
can be related directly to sales and the deduction made directly from tax otherwise
payable?
My suggestion is very simple, and I am
emphasizing it at this moment because I am
hoping that when we come to another round
of amendments to the Income Tax Act-and
they are just as inevitable as is the passage of
time from year to year-we shall find these
seven or eight pages suddenly repealed and
replaced by a simple amendment along the
lines I have suggested.

SENATE
I also congratulate the Honourable the
Speaker on the atttainment of his high
office; and I extend to the new senators my
felicitations on their being sumnonsed to the
membership of this house.
As honourable senators know, I have
always been a firm believer in the Senate
and will continue to be. I expect to be around
for some time and I hope to be able to continue to take an active part in the work of
this house.
Bill C-71 is designated an Act to amend the
Farm Credit Act, which is chapter 43 of the
Statutes of Canada 1959, and was proclaimed
and brought into force on October 5, 1959.
I have always been a lover of the
soil and I have been vitally interested in
farming in the province of Saskatchewan for
over 40 years. Farming has been for me more
than a hobby: it has been a serious business.
I have been described sometimes as a farmer
and other times as an agriculturist. A
"farner" has been defined as a person who
lives on the farm, makes his money on the
farm and spends it in town.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: My impression is that
the honourable senator is a lawyer. I hope he
is referred to as a lawyer also.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: On the other hand, an
"agriculturist" has been defined as a person
who lives in town, makes his money in town
and spends it on the farm. I note that my
remarks meet with the approval of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). Perhaps I am partly a
farmer and partly an agriculturist. As the
honourable senator from St. John's East
(Hon. Mr. Higgins) has said, I am also a
lawyer. At any rate, these are my qualifications and no doubt the reason why I have
been requested to sponsor Bill C-71.
I wish first to remind you that the federal
Government has been in the farm loan business for a long time. The Canadian Farm
Loan Board was set up in 1927, when the
Canadian Farm Loan Act was passed. It began
lending money to farmers on first mortgages
in or about the year 1929, and continued
to lend money until that board was abolished
in 1959 upon the passing of the Farm Credit
Act. That act set up the Farm Credit Corporation as the successor to the Canadian
Farm Loan Board, taking over all the assets
and liabilities of the board. The passing of
the Farm Credit Act and the setting up of
the Farm Credit Corporation was part of the
Government's program to assist farmers
across Canada to attain a higher standard of
living.
The Farm Credit Corporation was given
power to lend money to persons whose principal occupation is farming in the general

sense, and to enable the farmer to use the
money borrowed from the corporation for the
purpose of completing and setting up an economic family farn unit.
The money borrowed was to be used for
the following purposes: To acquire farm
land; to erect or modernize farm buildings; to
clear, drain, irrigate, fence or make permanent improvements; to purchase basic herd
livestock; to buy necessary farm equipment;
to purchase fertilizers, seed, et cetera; to pay
debts, and for any other purpose which the
corporation considers fit to establish an economic family farm unit. These powers or
objects will be found in section 16 of the
original act passed in 1949.
The Farm Credit Act sets out two different
kinds of loans that can be made to persons
whose principal occupation is that of farming.
The loans that can be made under Part I of
the act are not new. We have been making
such loans for a long time. Briefly, under
Part II a loan could be made by the Farm
Credit Corporation upon farm lands not exceeding 75 per cent of the appraised value or
$20,000, whichever is the lesser, for a single
farming enterprise.
Part III is new, and provides that a loan
can be made on land and chattels. It is designed to cover immediate and long-term
credit needs of capable, experienced young
farmers between the ages of 21 and 45 years.
Loans must not exceed the lesser of $27,500
or 75 per cent of the value of land and the
value of basic herd and necessary farm
equipment.
Part III also provides for supervision by the
corporation until the loan is reduced to 65
per cent of the value of the farn land which
is held as security.
It also requires life insurance on the borrower to cover the outstanding amount of the
mortgage loan. Under Part II life insurance
was not required but could be obtained. In
1961-62, 56 per cent of borrowers applied for
and obtained life insurance. I will deal with
that more fully a little later, because there is
an amendment which refers to it. The time
for repayment is 30 years, and the interest is
five per cent.
The corporation consists of five members
appointed by Governor in Council, one of
whom is the chairman, another vice-chairman, and the remaining three are members
of the board. There is also an advisory conmittee of ten appointed by the minister.
The head office is at Ottawa. Branch offices
have been established at Kelowna, Edmonton,
Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ste. Foy, and
Moncton.
At the end of the fiscal year 92.1 per cent
of all loans were in good standing, and loans

NOVEMBER 27, 1962
have been approved in the last fiscal year
to, the number of 5,885 for a total of
$68,574,850.
I wish to refer to the capital of the
corporation because there is an amendment
in that connection. The Farm Credit Corporation had an original capital of $8 million,
and it was allowed to loan 25 times that
amount, or $200 million. In 1961 an amendment to the act increased the capital to $12
million, and the lending power of the corporation to $300 million. This capital is
provided by the Minister of Finance out of
the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The corporation borrows the money from the Minister

of Finance at the current going rate of interest
and lends it to farmers at the statutory rate
of five per cent. It finances its operating costs
out of the difference between the borrowing
rate and the five per cent lending rate.
Honourable senators, in order to provide
more detailed information, I ask leave to
incorporate in the record as part of my
remarks three documents or tables which I
have before me now.
Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. AseI±ine: The first is a statement
of boans disbursed and outstanding by fiscal
years to March 31, 1962.

NOVEMBER 27, 1962
Next I wish to dcai briefiy-with-the-amea-ments. I have already referred to an amendment in the amount of the capital of the
corporation. There has been a large increase
in the volume of lending, and the balance
of the $300 million will ail be committed by
June next. It is therefore necessary to increase
the capital to $16 million so that the corporation can borrow up to a total of $400 million
froin the Minister of Finance. That amendment appears in clause 1 of the bull.
Certain amendments will be found ini clause
2 to allow farmers more leeway in the use
of borrowed money. These amendments may
be stated as follows:
(a) To make improvements to any part of
the land the fariner is operating, including
land such as that on long-termi lease, which
is flot covered by the mortgage to the corporation.
(b) To pay the farmer's operating and living costs during the first year or two, while
he is developing his faim to the point that it
will produce the income necessary to meet
these costs.
(c) To help the fariner develop non-agricultural enterprises on his f arm, such as
camping grounds, tourist cabins and so forth,
if he can make any profitable use of bis
land and resources in that manner. This will
be a great help to the snail farmner.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What part of the bill is
my friend reading froin? What is the reference in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltin,: That is Clause 2. There
is an amendment to Section 19(1)(f), covered
by Clause 3 of the bill with respect to the
maximum charge that can be made by the
corporation for an appraisal. There was quite
a lot of argument about the charge for
appraisals and inspections when loans were
applled for, and it was finally agreed in the
other place to fix the maximum in the act
rather than leave it open to, be fixed by the
corporation by regulation.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would my friend permit a question? I notice the use of the
expression "secondary enterprise not being
a farming enterprise". Is there any definition
of that or any indication as to the area covered by it, because any enterprise not being
a farming enterprise in relation to farming
would be secondary so long as it -was not
more substantial than the farmtag?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I admit I ran tato that
saine difficulty, and I have flot been able to
find anything in the bill which defines
"secondary enterprise".
Hon. Mr. ]Roebuck: And there is no limitation.
27511-5-21

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Would it include allowing the money to be used, for instance, for
the purpose of enabling a fariner to build a
motel on his property?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The explanation I received was that it was to help the fariner
develop a non-agricultural enterprise on his
farin. If it were a small farin it might, for
instance, lend itself to the erection of tourist
accommodation.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Could he set up a law
departinent?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The last time I travelled
through British Columbia I noticed that sinail
farms along the highway froin Hope to
Penticton had a lot of these enterprises and
it seemed to me that those sinaîl farmers
were doing well.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What is the meaning of
"secondary" there?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It would mean, not pertaining entirely to agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Does it?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hie could build a hotel,
I suppose.
Hon. Mr. Craîl: And he could get a licence.
What is wrong with that?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Would it taclude
building a motel?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I wouid rather leave
that for the vice-chairman o! the Faim. Credit
Corporation to answer when he appears
before the comimittee, perhaps tomorrow or
some time in the near future.
The other ainendinents are for the purpose
of eliminating certain anomalies and restrictions. One amendinent makes certain that
there is power to, make life insurance available to ail borrowers so that a borrower
may obtain if e insurance as additional
security for a Part IIl ban. That will be
found in Clause 4.
Another amendment removes the restrictions where a father mortgages part of his
farmn for one son and wishes to do the saine
for another son. That will be found in
Clause 5.
Clause 6 provides that if a boan is approved
by the corporation before the applicant has
attained the age of 45 years, such boan can
be made.
Clause 7 (1) fixes the amount of the supervising fee on a Part III boan as prescribed
by the corporation by regulation, but flot to
exceed $25. That was added by way of
amendinent in the other place.
Clause 7 (2), provides that a loan may be
made to joint tenants.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To husband and wife?

-

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, they will be able
to apply jointly for a loan. Under the act
as it stands they are unable to do so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Could a
father and son apply?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I just gave an example
of husband and wife applying.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is the only case
provided for.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Yes, the only case.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Clause 8 permits the
corporation to forgo supervising of a farmer
who has borrowed under Part III when the
debt is reduced to 75 per cent of the appraised
value of the farm.
The last amendment is covered by Clause
9. This amendment makes eligible an applicant for a farm improvement loan when
the debt incurred under the Farm Credit
Act bas been reduced to 75 per cent of the
value of the land.
Before concluding I wish to make some
general remarks. The corporation bas carried on its service to the farmers by establishing full-time resident credit advisers in farming communities throughout the country.
The total amount of loans this year is running about 27 per cent above last year's figure. The amount is $65,948,000 as of October
31, compared to $51,853,100 at the same date
last year.
The Government believes that the proposed
amendments to the act, particularly those
respecting off-the-farm income and the development of non-agricultural income from
the farm, would permit much closer co-operation with ARDA in tackling rural development in many areas of Canada. ARDA director A. T. Davidson is a member of the
corporation.
These amendments, together with the current amendments to the regulations under the
act, considerably enlarge the scope of the
legislation by extending loan eligibility to
many smaller operators and specialized producers who heretofore have been excluded.
They are expected to be of considerable and
particular benefit to the farmers of British
Columbia, parts of Ontario, Quebec and the
Maritime provinces.
Honourable senators, that completes my remarks with respect to this bill. If it is given
second reading tonight I shall propose that it
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce for further consideration.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, it is not my purpose to delay second
reading of this bill this evening, primarily

because it bas been so clearly explained by
the honourable senator from Rosetown that
not very much can be added. However, there
are a few observations I should like to make
in connection with the legislation itself and
the amendments that are proposed.
Generally speaking, I am in favour of the
terms of the act as it now stands and the
purpose of the proposed amendments. There
are certain suggestions I intend to make in
relation to the bill now before us which,
honourable senators will recall, has been
slightly amended in the other place. There
are some amendments to which I should like
to refer, but I shall omit the first I had in
mind because that bas already been clearly
explained by the sponsor of the bill. That
amendment is contained in the first clause,
in which the capital that is required for
the proper functioning of the board during
the next year is increased.
The second amendment I should like to
refer to is contained in clause 2. Part of
that is a further amendment. It has to do
with subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (a) of
section 16 of the act, and reads as follows:
to erect farm buildings or to clear,
drain, irrigate, fence or make any other
permanent improvementAnd these words are added:
-to the mortgaged farm or to other land
used by the borrower as part of his
farming enterprise.
If I understood the sponsor of the bill cor.
rectly, he made the statement that this applies
to land under a long-term lease. Nowhere
in the bill have I found any reference to a
long-term lease. I intend to refer to that a
little later on.
The third amendment I should like to
mention is also in clause 2, page 2 of the
bill, and is noted as subparagraphs (iva) and
(ivb). I need only refer to the last part of
it. Of course, both these subparagraphs are
new. Subparagraph (ivb), states:
to assist in the development on the mortgaged land of a secondary enterprise not
being a farming enterprise...
Some questions have been asked in relation to this, and I shall have a few words
to say about that too.
The fourth amendment I should like to
refer to appears in clause 3, where it will
be found that paragraph (f) of subsection (1)
of section 19 is repealed and a substitution is
made. That anendment provides that the
amount of fees charged for the application
and the amount of charges in connection with
the loans granted shall be expressly set out in
this section. I believe this is new and was

NOVEMBER 27, 1962
not in the former act in relation to Part Il
thereof. It was, and still is, in Part III of the
act. That is, in the case of each application
for a loan the fee shall be $10, and in the
case of each loan made under this act half of
one per cent of the amount of the loan.
Again, I shall refer to that briefly later.
Another reference I wish to make has
pretty well been covered by the sponsor of
the bill. I refer to the amendment to section
27 of the act which has to do with the reduction to 75 per cent of the outstanding loan
in relation to statements and information
respecting the farm operations of the
borrower.
Clause 9 is a similar recommendation in
relation to the loan under the Farm Improvement Loans Act where loans will not be
granted until at least 75 per cent of the
original loan under this act has been paid
back.
In order that I may not repeat some
of the things that have already been said,
I have made a few notes and, if I may, honourable senators, I should like to be permitted to follow them closely.
I think it is significant to note that all
legislation, regardless of its nature, requires
amendment from time to time. The Farm
Credit Act was passed, I think, primarily as a
result of a recommendation emanating from
the Special Committee of the Senate on Land
Use.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): That committee recommended the liberalization of the
provisions of the Canadian Farm Loan Act
and the transfer of the administration of the
act from the Minister of Finance to the
Minister of Agriculture. I believe that as a
consequence of this recommendation the
present act was introduced by the Minister of
Agriculture during the session of 1959, and
was given royal assent on July 18 of that
year.
Since the new act was based on farm credit
needs at that time, including the transfer of
administration to the Minister of Agriculture,
at the same time as I gave it my support I
made certain recommendations in relation to
the original act which I thought would improve the legislation, and I intend to make
them again now. I also supported the amendment presented in this house and passed during the 1960-61 session, namely, provision for
an increase in the capital structure of the
corporation which would increase its borrowing power from $12 million to $16 million and
thus its lending authority from $300 million
to $400 million.
As I understand what the former Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said,
27511-5--211

and from a statement by the minister, by
June of next year the funds that are now
available will be gone. I maintain this
amendment is a "must". Again, may I say
that one of the reasons the amendment is
essential is because of the rapid changes in
the industry which, in part, are due to mechanization, changes in production and marketing methods, automation and the establishment of larger units of operation, as well as
many other factors.
I trust it is in order for me to refer to a
statement made by the Minister of Agriculture which I mentioned a moment ago, in
relation to the fact that now only about $63
million is available for the coming year.
At this point may I say a word about the
criticism offered in relation to the original
Canadian Farm Loan Act and its administration, much of which is fully justified. May I
point out that while the number of loans
granted has increased since the present act
has been in operation, generally speaking,
the main reason for the larger amounts loaned
during the last three years is due to the
larger individual loans.
As an illustration I should like to draw the
following comparisons. For the fiscal year
1936-37 the number of loans disbursed was
5,385, and the amount loaned in round figures
was $7,423,000, an average of $1,379 per loan,
whereas in 1961-62, 6,027 loans were granted
for a total of $68,886,875, which means that
the average individual loan reached an ailtime high of $11,430 against slightly over
$1,300 for 1936-37. It is significant to note that
for the two comparative years there were only
a few more loans granted in 1961-62 than in
1936-37, whereas the total amount loaned was
more than ten times greater.
The second important amendment provides
for increased flexibility in the use of the
money so loaned, and to which I have already
referred, such as the drainage of land, erection of buildings, the improvement of land
other than the mortgaged farm, to pay operating costs and maintenance costs of the
farmer and his family for such period as may
be necessary for the establishment of a farming enterprise, and to assist in the development of a secondary industry on the mortgaged land. With all of this, I agree in
principle; and I am sure it will be of considerable assistance to many farmers, if
properly administered, as I have every reason
to believe it will be. However, I am of the
opinion that this provision will require very
careful supervision.
Going back to the first part of this amendment which provides that a loan may be
used by the borrower for permanent improvement to the mortgaged farm or to other land

SENATE
used by the borrower as part of his farming
enterprise, this I support, provided the land
used by the borrower is held under a reasonably long-term lease. This is not provided for
in the present amendment, and I would suggest to the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Brooks) that such a provision be inserted
so that where any loan is used for this purpose the borrower as well as the board will
be protected.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I was just giving an
example.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): I am saying that this is not only for the protection
of the borrower but also for the protection
of the board, and I mention as an illustration that a farmer quite often leases extra
land in close proximity to his own farm. This
land may not have been operated for a few
years and may need fertilizers and irrigation
to produce a crop. Under this act he may
borrow money to provide those things necessary for the production of such a crop. The
lease may only run from year to year and at
the end of one year the land may be turned
back to the owner. In that case there should
be provision in the act for the protection of
the borrower as well as the board.
The two new subparagraphs of this clause,
namely, (iva) and (ivb) are substantial provisions, and I am hopeful they will not interfere with the proper functioning of the
program envisioned under ARDA, but that
they will be supplemental to it.
It may well be that this may lead to the
development of a program which I can visualize for the building of a sawmill or a small
furniture plant or maybe, as someone suggested, a tourist industry.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or maybe a blacksmith
shop.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): It may be
a blacksmith shop or anything else, but I am
sure the Board will use their judgment in
reference to this.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why are you sure?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): I am sure
because of my association with the heads of
various institutions concerned with such matters over the years. I have a lot of confidence
in the members of the board and its supervisors in my province, and I know something
about the difficulties of getting loans for
farming enterprises. I say, after a good deal
of consideration, that unless some assistance
is granted to the small farmers in some of
the remote areas of the provinces they are
not going to be able to remain there. There
must be some other provision for increasing
their earning capacity. I hope this will

develop it, and I hope there will not be too
much overlapping between this Board and
ARDA-rather that one will supplement the
other.
The next reference I would like to make
has to do with clauses 27 and 28 and applies
to Part III of the Act which provides for
supervised farm loans, namely, loans over
$20,000 to the present maximum of $27,500.
It will be noted that the borrower under
Part III of the present Act must submit a
plan of his farming operations to the board
for approval. In other words he is required
to allow supervision. While the suggestion
made in the new amendment is more in line
with Part III of the act, I think grave consideration should be given to this aspect of
the suggestion, because in my opinion there
is need for supervision in connection with the
larger loans. I would hate to see the supervision removed because they may just not
be able to carry on in the manner they have
in the past.
I can only refer, as an illustration, to the
Veterans' Land Act under which there has
been a combination of good administration
and supervision down through the years. I
think one of the reasons they have been so
successful has been the close supervision and
close contact between the board members
and the borrower.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Might I interrupt the
honourable senator? Is he aware that the
same supervisors are acting with the Farm
Credit Act? There were some 300 taken over
by the Farm Credit Act and they are now
operating for both.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wes±morland): Yes, I
am ýaware of that. All I am saying is that
under the present act loans must be reduced
to 65 per cent of the appraised value of the
land before the supervision ceases. Under
this provision if they get down to 75 per cent
supervision ceases. I think great care should
be exercised before the supervision is removed because most of thern need it and
probably would like to have it.
Honourable senators, there is also provision
in the act for the application or the setting
out of fees. I am not too sure that this amendment is in line with Part III of the act. In
Part III the amount is set out. I believe it is
to be found in section 26, paragraphs (c) and
(d), particularly (d), which provides:
(d) the borrower shall pay to the corporation an appraisal fee of two per cent
of the amount of the loan or one hundred
dollars, whichever is the lesser.
Under this amendment to Part II of the
act the amount has been reduced to onehalf of one per cent of the amount of the

NOVEMBER 27, 1962
loan in relation to the charges made for that
part of the supervision.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I don't think that has
anything to do with the supervision.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): No. Part
III has to do wholly with supervision on
loans over $20,000.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: My interpretation is
that it bas to do with appraisal costs.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Under
Part II the appraisal costs are now $10, and
if a loan is granted, then for the appraisals,
the supervision and legal work carried out,
it is one-half of one per cent, whereas under
Part III it is two per cent or $100, whichever is the lesser.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This clause was debated
at considerable length in the other place, and
I believe they finally arrived at this solution
because of the criticism that the appraisal
costs were too high. Some persons applied
for a loan which was turned down and then
had to pay the $25, $50 or whatever it was.
That fee is now fixed at $10, and that is all
he can lose if his application is not accepted,
but if it is accepted and the loan is granted
then it is one-half of one per cent. Is that
not so?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): That is
right, but that applies only to Part II of the
act. Part III of the act states definitely that
there shall be a charge. That can be found at
page 279 of the Statutes of 1959.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: What is the section?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Section
26(c) and (d).
Honourable senators, it is not my intention
to say anything further with respect to this
bill. I think the amendments are necessary,
but they can be improved, and I am going to
make a further suggestion before I close.
While I hesitate to discuss agricultural
matters other than the subject matter of this
bill I hope I may be permitted to do so.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Go right ahead.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): It seems
unfortunate to me that an industry worth
over $3 billion per year should get so little
attention in both bouses of Parliament, and
in the country as a whole. This great industry
stands at the top of all other industries in
Canada as far as dollar value is concerned.
I was very surprised when I read recently
in the press a statement by the Minister of
Agriculture in which he suggested certain
curtailment might be necessary in the production of milk. The following is one of his
statements:

No government wanted to compel producers to reduce production but the
Federal Government may quite properly
tell producers that the time has come
when they must agree to voluntarily
restrict production or accept reduced price
supports. Furthermore, since a moderate
reduction in price support would not
likely reduce output significantly, a
drastic reduction might be necessary.
Then later on under the same heading,
"Limiting Production seen Inevitable", he is
reported as stating as follows:
When we come right down to it any
real solution to the surplus problem is
bound to require production curtailment.
Later on he stated as follows:
The usual way to get people to produce
less of anything is to offer them a lower
price.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Who made
these statements?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wes±morland): The Minister of Agriculture.
Honourable senators, it seems unbelievable
to me that the minister is concerning himself
with reducing the production of the best food
on earth, and making very little if any effort
to increase the consumption of this food. The
only reference he made to increased consumption of milk was that his department was
studying the possibility of instituting a nationwide school milk program.
You may recall, honourable senators, that
that was a program I advocated in this chamber almost two years ago. I am convinced
that if that, and the other suggestions I made
at that time, were put in effect, together with
an adverising program carried out jointly
with the provinces and the two major dairy
organizations in Canada, namely, the Dairy
Farmers of Canada and the National Dairy
Council, whereby every Canadian would be
conscious of the true value of milk and milk
products, we would not need to threaten or
talk about curtailing production.
At this point may I say that in some
instances it may be possible to effect a changeover from. dairy farming to beef farming.
In this respect, and using myself as an
example because b know whereof I speak,
having regard to the investment I had in my
dairy farm I could not change over to beef
or anything else. I had to stay in the dairy
business.
Returning to the present bill, may I again
make the suggestion I made when the Farm
Credit Act was passed in 1959, that the interest rate be reduced to 3 per cent which is
more in line with the earning power of farm

SENATE
investment, particularly at this time when all
farmers are caught in the so-called cost-price
squeeze. I believe that the farming people of
this country are worthy of that consideration,
and I am appealing to honourable senators
and to the Government to give consideration
to this suggestion.
Before I finish, honourable senators, I
would like to pay a tribute to the former
chairman of the board, Brigadier T. J. Rutherford, and to his staff for the excellent manner
in which they have carried out their duties
over the years. I am happy to note that

Brigadier Rutherford has consented to serve
the board in the capacity of an adviser. I
am satisfied that his advice and supervision
will be a tremendous asset not only to the
board but to the farming people of Canada.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

FLUORIDATION
EFFECT ON WATER SUPPLIES
Hon. Donald Smith inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
1. What year did communities in Canada and the United States commence the
addition of fluorides to their water supply
for the prevention of dental disease and
what are the names of these communities?
2. With respect to such communities
in Canada,
(a) Is fluoridation continuing?
(b) What steps have been taken to
observe the effects of artificial
fluoridation?

(c) Were comparisons made with other
communities using a water supply
of low and of high natural fluoride
content?
(d) Did the Federal Department of
National Health and Welfare participate in these observations?
(e) What were the results of such observations with respect to, (i)
dental health, (ii) general health?
3. What is (a) the maximum permissible level for fluorides added to water
supplies?
(b) the level established in water supplies presently fluoridated in Canada?
(c) highest and lowest known level
in naturally fluoridated municipal
water supplies in Canada, and
where do these levels exist?
4. What is the estimated annual cost
per capita of fluoridation of municipal
water supplies?
5. At the present time is there an
equally effective practical alternative to
the fluoridation of municipal water supplies?
6. How many municipalities in Canada
and the United States are presently
fluoridating the water supplies and what
is the estimated total population involved?
7. Have the health authorities of any
of those municipalities reported any ill
effects from fluoridation?
8. In Canada, what provincial and national associations of the dental and
medical profession have recommended
fluoridation?
Hon. A. J. Brooks: The answer to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
1. One community in Canada, Brantford,
Ontario, and two in the United States, Newburgh, N.Y. and Grand Rapids, Michigan
began to add fluoride to their water supplies
in 1945.
2. (a) Brantford continues to fluoridate.
(b) Two independent dental studies have
been made of the dental conditions of Brantford children; one by the Brantford School
Dental Officer and one by National Health
and Welfare.
The health authorities and the medical
profession at Brantford have kept the population under close scrutiny.
(c) Comparisons were made among the
child population of Brantford and that of
Stratford where the water is naturally fluoridated, and that of Sarnia where the fluoride
content of the water is negligible.

NOVEMBER 28, 1962
(d) The Department of National Health and
Welfare organized and directed the study in
which the dental conditions of the child populations of Brantford, Sarnia and Stratford
were compared.
(e) (i) The statistical findings indicate that
about one (1) part per million of fluoride in
a water supply either added mechanically or
derived from a natural source reduces the
prevalence of tooth decay among those consuming it from birth by about two-thirds.
(ii) The health authorities of Brantford and
of Stratford report no medical ill-effects from
the water-borne fluoride in either place.
3. (a) The permissible level of fluoride in
a water supply is determined by the province
concerned. One (1) to one decimal five (1.5)
parts per million is regarded as a suitable
range.
(b) The level in common use in Canada is
about one (1) part per million.
(c) Fluoride analyses have not been made
for all community water supplies. Known
fluoride levels range from insignificant traces
to four decimal eight (4.8) parts per million.
Levels from two (2) to four (4) parts per
million are known to occur in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Newfoundland.
4. The annual per capita cost of fluoridation
ranges from 3.8 cents upwards to about 10
cents depending on the kind of fluoride compound used and shipping costs. The average
is probably below 10 cents per capita.
5. There is no equally effective and practical alternative.
6. The most recent reports show ninetynine (99) Canadian communities fluoridating.
The total Canadian population involved is
1,780,354.
In the United States two thousand two
hundred (2,200) communities are reported as
fluoridating. The total American population
involved is about forty-two million (42,000,000).
7. No ill-effects from fluoridation have been
reported by the health authorities of any
of the municipalities fluoridating.
8. All ten provincial Dental Associations,
the Canadian Dental Association, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian
Public Health Association have approved
fluoridation.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,

would ask for leave of the Senate to proceed
with Orders Nos. 2, 6, and 7 respectively before the other Orders.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 7, 1962
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Brooks for second reading of Bill C-86, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial
year ending the 31st of March, 1963.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I thank my colleagues in this house for
joining with me in trying to preserve the
principle of responsible government in this
country. I asked the favour yesterday that
second reading of this bill be postponed until
today because I did not have the opportunity
-nor had the majority of honourable senators-to see what it was all about. It was
certainly an important matter because the
bill deals with about half a billion dollars.
I have been in the Senate for over seventeen years and I know very well that we all
do the best we can to give second thought
to legislation, as Sir John A. Macdonald said,
by studying it in an objective way. We are
appointed to this house for life and it is
our duty to ask ourselves whether or not
proposed legislation is in the interest of this
country. On that account, honourable senators, I thought I had the right to ask for and
obtain a postponement of the second reading
of this bill.
Now that I have had time to read the bill,
I agree with the distinguished Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) that it is generally agreed that these appropriation bills
are well studied in the other place and that
here we readily accept them, unless some
honourable senators object to particular items.
As far as I am concerned, I have no more
objection to passing this bill.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, there is one item to which I desire
to draw your attention. It concerns the statement made in the other house by the Prime
Minister regarding the translation of Beauchesne's book ParliamentaryRules and Forms
into French. This is a book of 900 pages.
According to the Constitution, each parliamentary paper should be published in both
official languages. Sometimes, due to certain
difficulties, such as too few translators, the
reports of committees which sit in the winterand which are printed first in English-are
delivered in French to the members of both
houses the following summer or late fall,
months after the session has been prorogued
or adjourned. At that late time such a translation could not be of any use to anyone; it
goes where it belongs, into the wastepaper
basket, which is unfortunate.

For instance, after having been attacked by
the Social Crediters, I had the unquestionable
right to rise on a question of privilege, as
I had done before on numerous occasions, and
the index shows how many precedents there
were recognizing my right to defend myself,
but I had to wait several months until the
Budget Speech was over to say what I had
to say. And it was then that Mr. Speaker
Beaudoin ruled that it was only what was
said in the house that could be complained
of on a question of privilege.
My contention was that each member of
Parliament, in either house, has the right to
claim privilege for any injustice that was
done to him anywhere, inside or outside the
land, and the place to claim his privilege is
always from his seat in either house. He
changed the practice which had existed from
time immemorial.
What I have told you about the Social
Crediters happened in May 1955, during the
session before my appointment to the Senate.
Another case was when I said in the house
something that was parliamentary about Mr.
Bennett, the former Prime Minister. The
Honourable George Drew, who was Leader
of the Opposition at the time, had used most
unparliamentary language about myself. That
was on February 17, 1954. I rose to claim my
privilege, which was denied me. That is why
I did not have much consideration for the
practices of the House of Commons.
The Government should not be afraid to
postpone the translation of Beauchesne's Parlia.mentary Rules and Forms in order to give
more time to the translators to complete the
translation of the official papers, reports of
committees and all that. Incidentally, I must
congratulate them for the immense work they
do in translating the debates of both houses
in order that we may have the French and
English versions on the morning after. The
work they accomplish is considerable. In
addition to the translation of debates, they
have to translate all the committee reports,
all the biHs, and so on, and I do not see why
that very important and essential work which
is capital in importance should be delayed
for a translation of Beauchesne's book, which
nobody will read and which will only lead
everyone into confusion.
On one occasion I attended a parliamentary
conference in London and spoke about parliamentary rules. I had a work in progress
about Standing Orders of the various legislative bodies of the Commonwealth. I went
to see a reader of manuscripts at Longmans,
Green and Company, in the shadow of St.
Paul's, and I showed him my notes. He told
me to return to see him later on. He was
such a clever, bright fellow that I did not
even have to finish my sentences; I had only
27511-5-22j

to say a few words and he understood the
meaning of the whole phrase. I returned to
see him three days after and he said to me,
"In this you have a very good idea but
nobody will read the book. To publish it you
would have to have the help of a foundation,
otherwise you would lose money with it."
During the same period of time I discussed
the matter at a meeting of delegates in Westminster Hall, at which there was a delegate
from New Zealand named Mr. Schramm.
I mentioned to him that there were more
standing orders for the Quebec legislative
house than for our own house, and it should
be better because there were more rules. He
said there at Westminster Hall, the great
Westminster Hall, "What is the use of rules
in debate?"
It is a question of good company, good
manners and following each other in turn
and under the guidance of a fair Speaker.
A fair Speaker we have now, and I am
very thankful for that, as are the members
of the House of Commons, as Mr. Badanai,
the member for the northern Ontario riding
of Fort William expressed himself not long
ago.
I have perhaps made more speeches in
both houses than has any other member of
Parliament. I am thankful for the leeway
which has been given to me at times and for
the kind attention which is given by my
colleagues in this bouse. But, Sir, and honourable colleagues, I must tell you that there is
a paramount rule in parliamentary practice.
It is that a debater should be in a position to
tell the Chair at any time the relation that
exists between what be says and what is
before the house. That is the main rule and,
besides that, one shall not abuse another. One
shall not be covered when be addresses the
house except during a vote, which is the practice in Westminster. There is not much more
than that.
Therefore, to come to a practical conclusion,
my suggestion is that you, Mr. Speaker, his
Honour Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, the Clerk of the Parliaments, whom we
have here, the present Clerk of the House of
Commons, and the law officers of each house
should be called together-and there will be
three English-speaking and three Frenchspeaking representatives-in order that if
there is any disparity between the rules of
both bouses they may be ironed out. All difficulties should be ironed out so that we may
have a small book like this copy of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, 1962,
clearly drafted and containing only the essential standing orders or rules.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH
AND WELFARE ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan moved the second

reading of Bill C-4, to amend the Department
of National Health and Welfare Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I would
first like to make a few prefatory remarks.
Two weeks ago the honourable senator frorn
Queens-Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Smith) said that
he believed in brevity. I can assure him that
as a surgeon I accept that philosophy in
full. I had anticipated and hoped that I would
have the privilege of discussing Bill C-3 before
Bill C-4 came before the house. Bill C-4 is
an anticlimax to Bill C-3, and when we come
to the consideration of Bill C-3 I propose
going into it in detail. That has to do with
the two drugs, lysergic acid diethylamide and
thalidomide. Due to the widespread publicity
given these drugs I feel that Bill C-3 is owed
an explanation along different lines from those
I have heard so far in the other place.
As we are dealing with health and welfare,
it might be well to refresh our memories
on the definition of these words. You will recall that when I discussed a bill in this
house under the subject of physical fitness
I found it most difficult to give you an exact
definition of the term "physical fitness". In
defining "health", Webster states:
Sound state of the mind: natural vigor
of faculties.
Might I add: Though health may be enjoyed without gratitude, it cannot be sported
with without loss, or regained by courage.
Now we come to another word that has
had widespread use in the last 20 or 25
years, "welfare." What do we mean by "welfare"? It is,
Exemption frorn misfortune, sickness,
calamity, and the enjoyment of the ordinary blessings of civil government.
I believe that during the last 20 or 25
years many Canadians have taken that definition too literally.
Before I leave these two words I should
like to give you my definition of the fourlettered word, "work." It is: The exertion of
oneself, both mentally and physically.

In my humble opinion Bill C-4 is selfexplanatory. It is a bill providing for a National Council of Welfare, a high-level advisory body patterned on The Dominion
Council of Health. Like the health council,
it would be a federal-provincial organ. This
council will re-assess present welfare measures and recommend the direction of new
social security measures.
If honourable senators will refer to the
explanatory note to clause 2 of the bill,
they will see the crux of the whole measure.
It reads:
. . . The purpose of this amendment is
to establish a National Council of Welfare. The wording of the new section
follows closely the wording of the present
section 7 of the Act, under which a
similar council in the field of health was
established. It is intended that the functions and duties of the National Council of
Welfare shall be to consider matters
relating to welfare activities in Canada
and to advise the Minister thereon and
thus perform functions in the field of
welfare similar to those performed by
the council established under section 7
in the field of health.
Honourable senators are aware that the
Government has long had at its disposal a
top-level advisory council in the field of
health, consisting of deputy ministers of
health as well as non-government representatives. This council has had a distinguished
record of service to the nation stretching over
a period of some 43 years. As the minister
stated, in view of this council's contribution
to Canada's health progress, the Government
has felt that it would be equally helpful to
have a similar body established in the field
of welfare. This is the major purpose of the
legislation.
The proposed National Council of Welfare
would be in the nature of an advisory body
to the Minister of National Health and Welfare, with duties and functions paralleling
those of the health council, with its membership drawn up on a comparable basis. The
new council will afford social welfare the
status which is its due, and will exert significant influence on future developments in
this field. I might add that the provinces have
also expressed the view that these joint programs should be re-assessed.
At the Dominion-Provincial Conference in
the fall of 1960 the Prime Minister indicated
the need for further study in order that
measures might be simplified and, if possible,
consolidated to some extent. The new National Council of Welfare will provide a
vehicle through which these matters may be
considered.

NOVEMBER 28, 1962
Two examples could be mentioned of the
sort of problem that will be referred to this
council. There is the question of additional
aid to the blind, which has been raised by
organizations representing the blind in Canada. Then there is the question of the most
appropriate approach with respect to the provision of aid under our federal-provincial
assistance program.
Frankly, I think this is an excellent move.
There is no denying the fact that for far
too long welfare has been much too dependent
upon the political whims of the politicians
who, in the long run, so often evaluate these
matters by the number of votes that might
be secured. We cannot deny the inequality
and the variations that exist in this area
today.
Honourable senators are well aware that
this bill received unanimous endorsation in
the other house. However, i would simply
like to reiterate what was so well expressed
by a physician in the other place particularly
as it pertains to older people. It will help
these older people to remain in their own
homes as long as possible. Many of these
people deteriorate mentally at a more rapid
rate when they are transferred to old people's
homes than they would if left in familiar
family surroundings. They become problems.
From the humanitarian standpoint I believe
this is of the utmost importance. Problems
such as this will, I believe, come to the fore
with the enactment of this legislation.
The council would be expected to consider
an old age, survivors, and disability insurance
program. It would help with the national
contributory pension plan once the constitutional amendment has been obtained, and in
fact no facet of the Government's extensive
social justice program would be exempt from
its scrutiny.
The deputy ministers of the federal and
provincial governments are to be members
of the council and will bring to its meetings
many years of experience in technical problems relating to the administration of social
welfare measures in Canada. In addition, provision is made for ten representatives from
outside of government. This will provide an
opportunity to bring to the council the
experience of many persons who have made
a substantial contribution in the voluntary
welfare field and to provide for citizen participation as well as geographic representation.
The council might be constituted somewhat as follows: the deputy ministers of the
provinces, as stated, will be appointed to the
council as representing the public sector of
welfare circles. There is a great deal of a
voluntary effort in the welfare field and it is
anticipated that several members will be

chosen from it. It is also anticipated that there
will be a representative from labour, agriculture, and the business community. That,
I think, pretty well covers the ten members,
apart from those representing the public welfare field.
Honourable senators, I might mention very
briefly the other amendment to the Department of National Health and Welfare Act. It
is merely of a routine character and, as
explained in clause 1 of the explanatory notes,
it provides for the repeal of paragraph (g) of
section 5 of the act. As it stands now, the
paragraph lists a number of statutes which at
the time of the introduction of this Act were
within the duties, powers and functions of
the minister. This has become out of date and
must either be changed or deleted altogether.
The decision of the Government pertaining
to this particular paragraph is that it should
be deleted altogether. If it were retained this
would necessitate opening up the act for
amendment whenever changes occurred in
the programs. As the minister stated, it is
merely a step toward tightening up the existing legislation.
After some careful study of this bill I have
no hesitation in recommending it to the house,
and I sincerely trust it will receive the complete endorsation of all honourable senators.
If that approbation is given, naturally it will
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Public Health and Welfare where members
of the department could be interrogated.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am sure we are all grateful to the
honourable senator from North York (Hon.
Mr. Sullivan) for his explanation of this bill,
and we are glad to have his enthusiastic support of it. He has not only explained the bill,
he has added to it.
I read the bill and came to the conclusion
that its purpose was to appoint a national
council on welfare comprised of the persons
set forth in clause 2 of the bill, but I cannot
find anything in the bill which would give
any powers to the council. Although the honourable senator who introduced the bill told
us what the powers and the duties of the
members of the council would be, there is
nothing set out in the bill to this effect. There
is already a similar council in existence in
connection with health, and apparently it has
functioned satisfactorily. However, it did occur
to me that there should be something more
definite in this bill with regard to the functions of the council.
Honourable senators will note that the only
intimation of the functions of the council is
in subsection 2 of the new section, which says
The National Council of Welfare shail
meet at such times and places as the

SENATE
minister may direct and shall be charged
with such duties and powers as the
Governor in Councit may prescribe.
I suppose we will have to wait until we
see what the Governor in Council does. The
honourable senator who introduced the bill
has intimated what that might be but, as I
say, it is not set forth in the bill. I feel that
we should not have to rely on what the Governor in Council may prescribe, but that it
should be set forth more fully in this bill.
I am also somewhat confused as to where
the duties and responsibilities of the Department of Health in Ottawa cease and where
the responsibilities of the various departments
of health in the provinces commence. It has
occurred to me that there may be considerable
overlapping, as is the situation with other
departments.
Honourable senators are aware that we have
a Department of Agriculture in Ottawa, and
each province has a Department of Agriculture. We have a Department of Fisheries in
Ottawa and a number of the provinces have
a Department of Fisheries. We have a Department of Forestry in Ottawa and a number of
provinces have a Department of Forestry. Just
where does the responsibility of Ottawa cease
in connection with health, and where does the
responsibility of the provinces commence? It
seens to me that one of things which this
council might consider is whether there is
any overlapping in the field of health and
welfare, because if there is such overlapping
it certainly should cease.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: I think that is the purpose of the bill, to differentiate between the
functions of these two branches, health and
welfare.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Let us
take welfare, for instance. Is there overlapping in this field between the federal and
provincial authorities?
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: I would think so.

which states that paragraph (g) is being repealed. In that notice of repeal I read that
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act will not
be included if this bill goes through, and as
I have to travel to the west coast in connection with fisheries, I shall not be here to deal
with this point when it comes up in committee.
I am rather interested in that act by reason
of the lengthy examination by the Senate into
the serious question of use of narcotics, and
I would like to know if this provision is repealed by this bill will it be covered in some
other act or omitted entirely.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: I think it will remain
under the Department of National Health and
Welf are.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I would like the sponsor of this bill to
tell us what powers will be given to the individuals who are to be appointed, if the
measure goes through. I do not object to giving people duties because they can always refuse to accept them if they are not acceptable
or not in the public interest, but I do not like
legislation which delegates to individuals unspecified powers. Governmental responsibilities and powers so given to individuals are
frequently abused, and I think we in this
house should know exactly the special privileges we are asked to confer, whether it be in
the realm of health or anywhere else.
Why, may I ask the sponsor, does not the
bill set out exactly what powers we are giving to the people to be appointed later?

Hon. Mr. Sullivan: I am afraid I cannot
answer that question.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Honourable senators, I
notice that the functions of this new council
are to be similar to those functions in the
field of health now performed by the council
established by section 7. Can the honourable
sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Sullivan) tell
us just what are the functions of the Dominion Council of Health so that we will then

SENATE
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it may be you will remember that when
similar legislation came before us on previous
occasions I objected to it. If my memory
serves me correctly, I twice voted against
similar bills. I did that for the reason that
the Combines Investigation Act has been a
standard for this country for many years, and
it has prevented actions detrimental to the
public welfare over the entire period during
which it has been in force. The Criminal Code,
as all honourable senators know, protects
every individual in the entire nation. It is an
exceedingly important statute, and one of its
most important provisions is that competition
shall not be unduly restricted by combinations of people. This bill seeks to set aside
the provisions of both the Combines Investigation Act and the Criminal Code with respect to an agreement between the fishermen
and their employers.
This is vicious legislation, honourable senators, and it should never have been passed
in the first instance. The last time a similar
bill was before us we were told that it would
be in force for just a few months while certain negotiations were taking place. I remember that I was asked if I wanted to bring
about a strike in the industry. The same question could be asked, of course, in connection
with all relations between employers and employees. Are we to set aside the Criminal
Code, of all statutes, and the Combines Investigation Act, in order that strikes shall not
occur or to facilitate some agreement that is
not before us and as to the terms of which
we know nothing?
In my judgment this is positively vicious
legislation that should never have been
brought before Parliament in the first place,
and should not now be extended again after
the previous three or four extensions, on the
ground that only a short time is required. I
shall vote against this measure.
Hon. Sydney J. Smith: Honourable senators, as this bill relates to a matter which is
of interest only to the province of British
Columbia, I think those from other provinces
should be reminded of the circumstances
which brought about this legislation in the
first place and the many extensions which
have been made. I wish to compliment the
honourable senator from Cape Breton (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) who explained the bill. He
covered the ground which I had intended to
cover, and he gave the house a pretty good
review of the circumstances leading up to
this legislation and also the reasons for the
various extensions since it was first introduced.
At the same time, I sympathize with the
stand taken by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). This is

a case where the strict letter of the law, had
it been adhered to in the first place, would
have brought disaster. We must accept the
situation, that it was to prevent a strike at
that time. We must give due consideration to
the fact that during the period covered by
these various extensions there has been peace
in the industry there.
The fishing industry is one of the important
industries to our province. Naturally we wish
to see the peaceful conditions in that industry
continue, if all other things are equal and if
all parties affected are satisfied, and that has
been the case. The fishermen and the processors are quite happy with the moratorium or
exemption which was granted with respect
to anti-combines legislation.
This is not a permanent solution, and it is
unfortunate that each time a renewal of
this exemption has come up it has been freely
expressed, and I think unanimously agreed,
that each extension should be the final one.
I do not want to see conditions in the
industry disturbed in our province, as satisfaction has been expressed on both sides with
this temporary solution. It really is not a
solution at all, for it is not permanent and
is only a temporary expedient. We have been
faced with failure on the part of the appropriate bodies or persons who might have
done something to bring about a permanent
solution. That has not been accomplished, so
I do not think we have any choice but to
accept an extension.
The fact that Parliament has condoned what
has been in effect for the last few years continues to strengthen the case that a permanent solution should be sought. I cannot
impress on the Government too strongly the
necessity to find a permanent solution before
the extension provided for in this present
bill expires.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it is moved by the Honourable Senator Macdonald (Cape Breton), seconded by the Honourable Senator Emerson, that this bill be

to adopt the motion?

MOTION

FOR

BILL

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINIUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 22, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Croil for the second reading of Bill S-3, to make provision for the
disclosure of information in respect of finance
charges.
Han. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, in speaking to this motion I have divided
sentiments. I recognize the menit of my
honourable friend's bill, yet I intend to vote
against it. I shali try to justify that position.
We are all agreed that the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croli) is entitled to commendation for his
desire to grant relief in connection with
people who sometimes involve themselves in
contracts in which they incur expenditures
they did not appreciate. We also give hlm
credit for the persistence with which bie
keeps renewing his proposai. On the other
hand, 1 feel that it is my duty to oppose this
bll, because I do not think it cornes within
the jurisdiction of the Canadian Parliament.
I think it comes within the jurisdiction of
the provisions of the British North America
Act, under section 92, Property and Civil
Rights in the Province.
I propose to be as brief as I can in my
discussion of this subject. I am afraid that
hast Wednesday I made what seems to have
been one of the longest speeches in the
Senate, and I shahl try to even things up by
rnaking a short one now.
Honourable senators, I shahl divide my
argument into three parts. The first part wîll

SENATE
contain my reasons, as a lawyer of some experience, for thinking that it is not within
our jurisdiction. Secondly, I shall endeavour
to point out the harm I think would be done
to the cause with which we are all in sympathy and favour, if it so happens that I
am right in my contention and if we pass
this legislation. In the third place, I wish
to offer what I think is the remedy which
should solve this problem effectively.
Honourable senators, first I should like to
give my reasons for saying this legislation is
not within our jurisdiction. At the last session, when this matter came up, Mr. Hopkins,
the Parliamentary Counsel charged with
advising us on various matters, gave an
opinion that this would be within our jurisdiction. He based that opinion on two grounds:
first, that of criminal law and, secondly, that
it related to interest.
In the criminal law aspect, he cited the
Proprietary Article Trades Association case,
which has been referred to in the courts as
the P.A.T.A. case.
I know something about that legislation. It
came up before Lord Atkin in the Privy
Council and he held that that legislation
was valid under the Dominion. At a later
time I was in another case before the Privy
Council and I tried to convince the court that
my case could be supported notwithstanding
this previous decision. Unfortunately, I was
appearing before the same judge who gave
the previous judgment, so I did not get very
far. However, I got this far, that I know now
what I was talking about then. Lord Atkin
said to me, with a little bit of menace in the
tone of his voice, "Are you suggesting that
I was wrong in my judgment?" I replied,
"Oh, no, my Lord; I am trying to get around
it by distinguishing this case from the other."
He smiled, but I didn't.
The basis of that judgment was this: In a
previous case it had been suggested that the
test of the criminal law was whether it was
contrary to public morals. So when it comes
to Lord Atkin's judgment in the P.A.T.A.
case, we must read it in its context. Lord Atkin, in dealing with the suggestion that
criminal law must be decided by its morality,
said that that was not a sound theory at all,
because public conception of what is right
and wrong keeps changing continuously. He
stated:
The criminal quality of an act cannot
be discerned by intuition, nor can it be
discovered by reference to any standard
of wrong. There is only one test: Is the
act prohibited with penal consequences.
Many lawyers, in my humble submission,
have misread that statement by Lord Atkin.

It must be read in its context, and its context is that he was replying to the theory
that it was only those things that are malam
per se that are criminal. In that sense, his
judgment makes good sense. But I want to
point out to honourable senators that if he
was making a broader statement than that,
it might be right according to the English law,
but not according to the Canadian Constitution. If he was laying down a principle that
applied to all cases, and not in the special
circumstances he was dealing with, then of
course it could not possibly have been right,
because in the British North America Act
we have two clauses that determine the respective jurisdictions of the provinces and the
Dominion. Section 91 deals with the powers
and jurisdiction of the Dominion, and section 92 deals expressly with the powers of
the provinces. Criminal law is within the express powers of the Dominion. Section 92
says:
In each Province the Legislature may
exclusively make Laws in relation to
Matters coming within the Classes of
Subjects next hereinafter enumerated;
that is to say,13. Property and Civil Rights in the
Province.
Without elaborating, it is my opinion without question that the making of a contract
and the terms which must be in that contract
come within the expression, "property and
civil rights".
Another important provision, item 15, says:
The Imposition of Punishment by Fine,
Penalty, or Imprisonment for enforcing
any Law of the Province made in relation
to any Matter coming within any of the
Classes of subjects enumerated in this
Section.
So you have two kinds of criminal law in
Canada. In England, where Lord Atkin was
familiar with the law, you have only one
kind. All criminal matters are criminal within
the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The
law there does not question whether it is
provincial criminal law. Here it is different,
where lawyers have become accustomed to
calling it provincial criminal law, and they
are right. Under Lord Atkin's decision the
criminal law is something that is prohibited,
and for which a penalty is provided. Maybe
it is not only federal but provincial criminal
law, and this is a fine illustration. If it is
property and civil rights there may be the
imposition of punishment by fine, penalty,
or imprisonment, and that does not make it
criminal under section 91 of the British North
America Act. It makes it criminal under the
limited provisions of criminal law, termed

NOVEMBER 28, 1962
rather loosely but effectively "provincial
criminal law". So when Mr. Hopkins held
that that P.A.T.A. decision was the guiding
one, I cannot agree with him.
I am not here to suggest or to give an
opinion. To begin with, I am not retained,
and no lawyer can be regarded as giving a
sound opinion unless be is retained to give
it. I am here as a senator, and I expect to
exercise my own opinions about matters of
which I know. I do not claim to know much
about criminal law, but what I do know is
part of my profession, and I say that so far
as I am concerned this legislation does not
come within the category of criminal law.
That being my belief, as a member of the
Senate, I must govern my actions according
to my own beliefs, and if that is of any
assistance to any other senator be is welcome
to it.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), when I
discussed the matter with him the other day,
said that we should follow the opinion of
Mr. Hopkins, because he is our legal advisor.
I am not so sure about that. It is perhaps
true up to a point. A private citizen may
seek the advice of his solicitor, but he does
not have to accept his opinion. We in the
Senate should seek the advice of our same
Parliamentary Counsel, but if we feel in
doubt we are not obliged to accept his opinion.
I do not intend to be arbitrary or to suggest
that I am right, but I want to say that at
the most it is a highly debatable question.
The next question that comes up is Mr.
Hopkins' suggestion that this matter comes
within our jurisdiction because it is in respect to interest. My honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) made a careful
analysis of this in the house the other day.
I listened to him with care, and I am in
complete agreement with his opinion. This is
not, in my opinion, legislation in respect to
interest. It is legislation in respect to the
form that contracts must take and the information that the contract must give to the
person who is purchasing the goods on credit.
It is true that in the form of the contract
one of the things that must be set out is
what the interest is or what the total cost
would be in terms of interest, but there is no
suggestion whatever to limit or fix the terns
of interest.
Mr. Hopkins, in following Mr. Varcoe's
opinion when he was deputy Minister of
Justice, said that in this connection be would
be governed by the Small Loans Act. The
Small Loans Act, as my honourable friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) said the
other day, purported to fix a rate of interest
or to limit the amount of interest. There is
nothing of that kind here, not a word as
I follow it, that fixes the rate of interest.

All the bill says is that if you make certain
kinds of contracts you must set out all the
facts and show each item of cost that the
purchaser has to pay in the end. That is not
legislation in relation to interest. In my
judgment the law is pretty well settled on
that question.
In the province of British Columbia, just
about at the turn of the century, there arose
the question of provincial legislation which
prohibited Chinamen from working underground. I got in wrong once in this house by
using the word "Chinaman", but on this
occasion I do not use the word myself, I
merely quote it. The legislation I refer to
used the word "Chinaman", and said, "No
Chinaman shall be employed underground
in coal mines." The question came before
the Privy Council, which at that time established for the first time, I think, the principle
that the test must be what is the pith and
substance of the legislation; and that expression has come down through the cases
for the past 50 or 60 years, following the
decision of the Privy Council of that day.
While that case purported to involve legislation in regard to the safety of the mines,
the argument was that the Chinamen-and
again I am quoting that expression-did not
understand English very well and were not
trained in the niceties of taking care, and
therefore it was not safe to have them working underground in the mines. The Privy
Council rather brushed that aside and did not
take it very seriously; they said the real pith
and substance of the legislation related to
immigration and naturalization.
Lord Watson, I think, presided in that case,
and, in his judgment, if he used the word
"Chinaman" once, be used it many times.
He said: the test here is that the people of
this race are immigrants, or are the children
of immigrants, and they also become naturalized, and this legislation in its pith and substance is in relation, not to the safety of the
mines-they would not accept that-but is in
relation to immigration and naturalization,
and is therefore within the federal jurisdiction
under section 91 of the British North America
Act and not within the jurisdiction of the
provinces, and they held it was ultra vires.
Now, honourable senators, if I were in court
I could go on for probably half an hour at
least to develop my views on this matter.
But I would not convince anybody here by
my argument. All I want to convey to bonourable senators is the idea that, whether you
regard this from the standpoint of criminal
law or from the standpoint in relation to
interest, whether that is its pith and substance or not, it is a highly debatable subject
and in my opinion, for what it is worth, in

SENATE
either case it is not within federal jurisdiction. It does not purport to legislate in relation to interest. It purports to regulate a form
of contract.
All lawyers present will appreciate this
comparison. We have, coming from the
English law, what we call the Statute of
Frauds in which certain provisions are made,
one being that no contract shall be enforceable if it is in relation to a debt, promise or
default of another, unless it is in writing.
Nobody has ever suggested that this provision
was criminal law or related to anything
except to a contract between the parties. I
say that this is the pith and substance of this
proposed legislation: it is in relation to the
dealings between two persons and is not legislation the pith and substance of which is in
relation to either criminal law or interest.
I say that much, honourable senators,
admitting that I may be completely wrong.
I have had that experience more than once,
but at times I found I was right. In this case
I think that at the very most the problem is
so uncertain that no one can at this time say
with authority whether Mr. Hopkins and
those who take his view are right or whether
I and those who accept my view are right.
The most one can do is point to the harm
that might result should we pass this legislation at this stage. The law is well established
that in relation to the same subject matter
you cannot have provincial jurisdiction that
is good and federal jurisdiction that is good.
One or the other is bad. If we at this time
pass this legislation and later on the courts
hold that it is bad, we will have done a lot
of harm to the cause my honourable friend
supports.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The provinces
know what are their rights.

will

Hon. Mr. Farris: I am coming to that.
But they won't know them until the legislation is before the courts, and that is one
of the harms that I say we may do at the
present time.
I do not think that we should pass this
legislation and throw the burden on private
individuals to carry it to the courts. It may
take one, two or three years before anybody
does so. But what happens in the meantime?
If we are right in passing this legislation,
the existing provincial legislation, or intended
legislation, will be in the minds of most
people invalid. If our legislation is good,
existing provincial legislation is invalid. That
would be a highly undesirable situation, and
I do not think we should contribute to that
when there is an obvious remedy.

The remedy I propose to the Senate is a
very plain one. I have before me the Supreme
Court Act, and I refer you to section 55,
headed "References by Governor in Council".
55. (1) Important questions of law or
fact touching
(a) the interpretation of the British
North America Acts;
(b) the constitutionality or interpretation of any Dominion or provincial legislation;
. . . may be referred by the Governor
in Council to the Supreme Court of
Canada . . .
And it is the duty of that court, if a reference
is made to it, to give to the Government of
Canada the opinion of the court as to whether
the legislation is valid or invalid.
Now we do not need to pass this legislation, to keep it on a teeter, to have that
accomplished. This proposal is now before
us for the fourth session. There is no question about its importance, and there can be no
doubt about the honest and proper concern
not only of my honourable friends who support this measure but of the people of
Canada as well. This question more than any
other requires the implementation of the
suggestion I am making, namely, that the
federal Government, under section 55 of the
Supreme Court Act, should refer this question to the Supreme Court of Canada for its
opinion. And as I have said, this legislation
does not have to be passed by us in order
to force that issue. If it is passed by us
it will be a very unfair imposition on
private persons concerned in such contracts
to have to carry this question to the courts.
If section 55 is invoked, it will then be a
high issue between the provinces and the
Dominion, and under the rules and procedures it will then follow that the Dominion
will take one side and the provinces will take
the other side. If private interests wish also
to appear they will have the right, but there
will be no need to do so. The issue will then
be settled, and settled finally.
I submit that is what ought to be done in
this case, and I say to the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) that he
should urge the minister in this house-I am
sorry that he is not here to get the benefit,
if there be any, of what I am saying-to
suggest to the Government that this is what
ought to be done. I say to others, both in the
Senate and elsewhere, and to the press, that
recognition should be given to this suggestion.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, with leave of the Senate, I move
that this bill be read the third time now.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Is there any
special reason why this bill should be read
the third time now?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): The
reason I had in mind, honourable senators, is
that there is to be royal assent this afternoon
and I thought, if there is no objection, we
might include it with the bills to receive royal
assent.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I have already expressed myself
rather forcibly in connection with this bill,
but I would not like it to pass third reading
without some further comment on my part.
I attended the meeting of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce this
morning, and along with a number of others
I asked questions of the departmental representative who was present to explain and, if
he could, justify the bill. The explanation
given was that the purchasers of fish have
stated that unless we relieve them of the
liability of the penalties that might be involved in an infraction of these two statutes
they would not buy fish, and if they did not
buy fish the entire catch would be lost.
It seems to me an easy statement to make,
but why they would want to go out of business because of the application of a section
of the Criminal Code or the Combines Investigation Act, I do not know. At all events,
this argument was not convincing to me. But
whether it is convincing or not, I am opposed
to the waiving of certain provisions of the
Criminal Code of Canada to facilitate the
business of anybody, particularly in view of
the fact that these gentlemen have not yet
told us just what crimes they propose to
commit and which they are asking us to
justify in advance.
They could, of course, have brought to us
a form of agreement that they propose to
enter into, and ask us whether it would be

NOVEMBER 29, 1962
satisfactory under the circurnstances. Then,
knowing just what the circumstances are we
might, perhaps, have validated the agreement.
That would be a reasonable thing to do, perhaps, under certain circumstances, but to set
aside the Crirninal Code in advance to validate what somebody else proposes to do is,
to my mind, subversive. To say that it is
bad principle is rather an understatement of
the situation. I do flot know why they did
flot throw in the Scriptures and the moral
law at the same tirne. Then they would have
been free to do alrnost anything, and their
consciences would have been free as well.
I do not know how this has worked out
in the past. I do not live in British Columbia.
I ar n ot an expert in flshing, but I arn
something of an expert in crirninal law and,
perhaps, something of an expert too in the
general law of Canada. I say that this is
subversive; it is the worst of bad principle;
this is an act that we should not continue and
that we should neyer have passed in the first
place.
There are ways of getting around dîfficulties
that do flot involve amendments of this kind.
It is sornething we just do flot do in this
conununity. We uphold legisiation necessary
to protect the public, to protect those who are
flot able to protect thernselves, and by the
provisions that are necessary to maintain an
orderly comrnunity.
Argument to the contrary does flot help us
at ail. When we are convinced of the necessity for rules of this kind in a civilized cornmunity we just do flot set thern aside in
individual cases. Under special circumstances,
one can usually find a way of achieving results
which are legitimnate, without subversive
actions such as are contemplated in this bill.
I arn opposed to such methods. I note that we
are apparently about to pass the bill, so that
I stand once again in splendid isolation. So
far as I can see, you are about to continue
this immunity. Well,
If it were done when 'tis done, then
'twere well
It were done quickly.
So, go ahead, but please record the fact that
I arn opposed to such legisiation.
Han. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, having considered this matter and
having listened to the honourable senator
from. Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
who has just spoken, I have only one thing
to do, that is, to share his views and concur
in what he bas said with regard to the
legislation before us. I find it unjust.
If there is sornething wrong in the Combines Investigation Act or in Section 411 of

the Criminal Code, there is only one thing
to do, that is to repeal that legîslation. To
make an exception of the kind suggested in
the bill before us cannot be accepted by any
one. There should be no exception to the provisions of the Criminal Code. If they are
good, let us keep themn for all; and if they
are not, let us repeal them, once and for ail.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, it is moved
by the Honourable Senator Macdonald (Cape
Breton), seconded by the Honourable Senator
Buchanan, that this bill be now read the third
time. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: On division.

company has always been used on the company's French policies, forms and notices.
At the present time the company does
business in all provinces of Canada, in Great
Britain, Jamaica, the Bahama Islands and
Trinidad. Roughly 13 per cent of its ordinary
outstanding business and more than 19 per
cent of its investments are in the province
of Quebec.
The directors and officers of the company
now feel that their operations in Quebec are
such that they require a more appropriate
official French name. It is desired that the
company be known in French under the following designation: L'Impériale, compagnie
d'Assurance-Vie. The proposed new French
name contains only three words, whereas the
former one, which has never been used, contains seven.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Section 1 of this bill
appears to be somewhat different from that
contained in other bills of a similar nature.
For instance, in the case of the Merit Insurance Company it is somewhat different.
Perhaps I am mistaken.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: This bill is a little
different from the Merit Insurance Company
bill because here there is a French name

fits very well. So it would appear that your

An Hon. Senator: Some more wishful thinking?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: To our new leader (Hon.
Mr. Brooks), I express my hearty congratulations on his appointment. His natural affability and his vast experience as a seasoned
parliamentarian are a guarantee of his success in the high functions to which he has
acceded. He is a man whom everyone respects
and his friends are many. The affairs of the
Government could not have been entrusted
to a better man. He will, I am sure, follow
in the footsteps of the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and in
those of all our past leaders from both sides
of the house. I offer him my fullest co-operation in the expedition of our legislative work.
However, the pleasure of greeting our new
leader does not in any way tarnish the fond
memories we entertain of the leadership given
to us for the last five years by the late Senator Haig and the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
The first honourable senator who warmly
welcomed me in the Senate the day of my
arrival was the late Senator Haig. His greeting was gracious indeed and almost fatherly.
He proffered very sound advice which I religiously followed in the execution of my
duties. It was always a pleasure for me, on
the numerous occasions he rose in the house, to
hear him deliver eloquent speeches on the
most varied subjects. He often called on me
in my Chambers to have a chat, and he invariably started the conversation with the
words: "Well, son, how are things going with
you?" His visits were always for me moments
of relaxation and enjoyment. I was sorry
when he had to resign due to bad health, and
soon after that he passed away. We all miss
him very much. He was a great man and so
human. To his son, our new colleague, and
to his family, I express my deepest sympathy.
Honourable senators, I would not like to
miss this occasion to tell the honourable

Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) how pleased we all were to
learn of his reappointment to his high post. As
we say in French: "C'est un parfait gentilhomme". He has earned the respect and admiration of all his colleagues, to whatever
party they belong. I am sure that during the
current session he will continue to lead the
Opposition forces of the Senate with his usual
sagacity and understanding.
May I reiterate to him, on my behalf and
that of my wife, our most sincere and heartfelt condolences on the sudden and unexpected passing of his most charming and
beloved wife. Not long ago, just a few weeks
before her death, we attended together an
official dinner at the Country Club. It was
a happy occasion. We drove out together, and
she looked so well and was in such high
spirits, the news of her death soon after
was a great shock to us both. You have all
my sympathy, Honourable Sir, and we know
that it will take much courage to carry on
without her.
May I add my congratulations to those
already expressed by previous speakers to
the mover (Hon. Mr. Haig) and seconder
(Hon. Mr. Fournier, Madawaska-Restigouche)
of the motion for an address in reply to the
speech from the throne. They both acquitted
themselves with rare distinction in this onerous task. Their speeches were both eloquent and comprebensive. We did not expect less from these men. I had heard many
nice things about the new senator from River
Heights (Hon. Mr. Haig), both as a lawyer
and as a Canadian. His speech confirmed the
reputation that had preceded him here.
The new senator from Madawaska-Restigouche (Hon. Mr. Fournier), I have known for
some years, and I was most pleased to hear
of his appointment to the Senate. When I
first made his acquaintance, he was Commissioner of Hydraulic Resources in the New
Brunswick Government with the rank of
Minister. Our business relations were most
pleasant and we soon became very good
friends. He is a parliamentarian of great
experience and his contribution to the debates will I am sure, be much appreciated.
I am pleased to join in welcoming both these
honourable gentlemen to the Senate.
I also join in congratulating the other recently appointed senators, including my brilliant deskmate (Hon. Mr. McCutcheon) and
my good friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Flynn), whose political career I was to some
extent instrumental in launching. We are
proud that he has succeeded so well and has
risen so fast. He will go much further, I am

SENATE

sure, and I wish him well. I also congratulate two old friends on their respective appointments, the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. O'Leary) and the honourable senator from Pickering (Hon. Mr. Grosart), whom I have known for many years and
whom I was always proud to count among
my best friends. The words of praise that
were so eloquently expressed about all these
honourable gentlemen were well deserved,
and I am pleased indeed to concur in them.
(Translation):
I wish to take this opportunity of expressing once more my most heartfelt congratulations to the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Choquette) on his recent appointment as Deputy Government Leader in this
house. I am sure he will be of valuable assistance to our leader. His eloquence, his intelligence and goodnaturedness will be important
assets to our proceedings. I wish him all the
success he deserves in his new capacity.
However, my satisfaction over his appointment to this important office is unfortunately
marred by the sorrow I felt at the untimely
passing of a very dear friend, Senator Brunt,
his predecessor in that office. Senator Brunt
and myself were born on the same day of the
same year. About sixteen months ago we
celebrated our birthday together in Jerusalem, which we visited as members of a delegation to Israel. On that evening we
exchanged presents and, naturally, there
were speeches. It was a happy event and no
one then could have foreseen his sudden
passing. He will be missed in the Senate; we
have lost a great parliamentarian who unstintingly devoted time and effort to insure
the progress of our sessional business and of
everything related in some way to the Senate.
He was immensely active and we had been
used to rely on him for difficult and delicate
missions which he always successfully accomplished. Nothing could stand in his way.
Nothing could resist his enthusiastic drive.
He was our best public relations man. To his
wife Helen, to his two children, and to the
Prime Minister who has always been his
closest friend, I wish again to offer my most
sincere condolences and those of my wife.
(Text):
I should like now, honourable senators, to
make certain comments on the general condition of the Canadian economy. To better
situate matters which I particularly wish to
discuss, may I be permitted to quote a
reference made by the Honourable George
Hees, Minister of Trade and Commerce, which
I believe to be very significant and indicative
of the action being taken by the Government
to meet the challenges arising from changing

conditions in the world today. I refer to a
statement made by the minister in a speech
delivered in Ottawa on September 7 last, when
he spoke as follows:
The advent of the Common Market, and
the trend towards freer world trade, as
spelled out in the Kennedy Trade Expansion Bill, indicates that the pattern
of world trade is rapidly changing, and
that Canada must adapt herself to these
changing conditions. If we do not, our
economy will slow down.
We have a responsibility to assure that
the adjustment into whatever trade pattern may evolve is accomplished with a
minimum of dislocation. With this in
view, Canada has adopted a flexible trade
program.
We have, for several years now, been
closely studying markets around the world
where our collective knowledge tells us
Canadian producers can compete. We
have been developing trade in those areas
through the combined efforts of government and our more aggressive industrialists. What we need is a bigger team.
That statement, honourable senators, considered in conjunction with the action that
was taken by the Department of Trade and
Commerce, both on its own and in co-operation with management, labour and the provincial governments, indicates the degree to
which the Government of this country is
alerted to the challenge that lies ahead in the
field of trade, both domestic and export.
I am sure that members of this house recognize that in this changing world of trade the
economy of Canada faces a number of basic
structural problems which are unique among
the highly developed nations of the western
world. Our wealthy endowment of natural
resources and relatively small population has,
over the years, resulted in a pattern of industrial development which involves the production on a very large scale of basic products
and raw materials for which we must find
sales in the export markets. At the same time
we have experienced a limited amount of
secondary manufacturing within this framework, but we have in the past few years
found our products caught in the squeeze
between foreign tariffs in overseas markets
and high production costs related directly to
our limited domestie market. Nevertheless,
we have in the main developed a capacity
to export which is rivalled by few countries
in the world.
Despite our tremendous capacity to export
for a nation of our population, our proximity
to the United States and the availability of
products from that country, to say nothing

NOVEMBER 29. 1962
of the influence of advertising and other promotional techniques to which we are subjected, has resulted in our purchasing from
abroad goods and services that have exceeded
by a wide margin the earnings of our own
export capacity. This has led at various times
in our economic history to our being faced
by a heavy imbalance which we are called
upon to meet of our own resources.
I will not attempt to analyze the reasons for
the change in our capital account position in
the first half of this year. Many explanations
have been advanced for this phenomenon,
each with its own particular emphasis. What
is clear is that capital movements in or out
cf a country can change quickly, unpredictably, and for a wide variety of reasons.
However, it is important to keep clearly in
mind the exact nature of these recent developments. For a number of years large annual
deficits on current account have been covered
by an approximately equivalent inflow of
foreign capital funds. In the early part of
1962 this inward movement of capital funds
slowed down, which resulted in a sharp drain
on our foreign exchange reserves. Quick
action was taken to contain this downward
pressure on the reserve position, and a substantial build-up in reserves has subsequently
taken place.
This type of financial problem is, of course,
by no means new. In recent years many
countries have had to adopt remedial measures to deal with balance of payments problems, including such major industrial nations
as Britain and France. Nor are these difficulties new to Canada itself. In 1947 balance
of payments difficulties were encountered,
and the Government of the day met the
problem by introducing an exchange conservation program that included import
restrictions, restrictions on pleasure travel in
the United States, and arrangements with the
Export-Import Bank in Washington for credit
to be made available in the amount of $300
million (U.S.).
There is a tendency in some quarters to
conclude from the recent developments in
Canada's balance of payments that the economy is going down hill. The actual facts of
the situation point in quite the opposite direction. When the identical type of problem
presented itself in this country in 1947 the
then Prime Minister pointed out that there
was no relationship whatsoever between
prosperity and such a situation arising suddenly. The important thing to recognize, then,
is that a sudden shift in capital account, such
as occurred here earlier this year, is not
indicative of underlying deterioration in the
economy generally.

As a matter of fact, there has been a sharp
acceleration in the rate of growth in the
Canadian economy, the strength of which is
illustrated by the substantial year after year
gains now evident in virtually all comprehensive measures of general activity.
Looking at figures available for 1962 to
date, as compared with the same period of
1961, we find that the gross national product
is up by 8.6 per cent. Only a small part of
this increase is the result of higher prices.
The total national output, in real terms, is up
by 7.7 per cent. Where higher prices are
taken into account the increase in the gross
national product is 8.6 per cent, but without
taking into account higher prices the increase
is 7.7 per cent, which is quite a rise. Personal
income is up by 9 per cent, and labour
income by 7 per cent. The index of industrial
production, which measures real output in
manufacturing, mining and utilities, has
increased by 9 per cent. Manufacturing production alone bas also risen by 9 per cent,
while durable goods production is up by 12
per cent. Merchandise exports are up 8 per
cent, construction contract awards 7 per
cent, and retail sales 5 per cent. Trends in
Canada's major industries give a similar
picture.
Honourable senators, I give all these figures
to make sure that everyone understands, and
is in agreement with, the Right Honourable
Mackenzie King who in 1947 said that there
is really no relationship between the outflow
of capital funds and imbalance in our export
trade.
Especially encouraging has been the improvement in the employment situation. In
the first ten months of the current year
183,000 more persons were employed than in
the same period last year. The rise in employment has exceeded by a wide margin the
growth in the labour force. By October there
were 35,000 fewer persons unemployed than
in the sane month last year, and 85,000
fewer than two years ago. These figures
show, in undisputable terms, the strength of
the advance underway in the economy of
this country today.
We all recognize, in the present changing
pattern of world trade, that competition is
going to be more extreme than we have
experienced in many years, both in export
and domestic markets. I doubt, however, if
Canadians fully recognize, or have stopped
to enumerate, the many and varied fields in
which government, both the federal, and the
provincial in co-operation with the federal,
provide services and assistance to business.
In the federal sphere, eleven departments,
with ten government agencies, offer services
in more than forty separate fields, ranging
from financial assistance and management

SENATE
training for small enterprises to advice on
government
procurement and industrial
development.
The major part of the activities of the
Department of Trade and Commerce is
directed towards supporting and fostering
the growth of Canadian business. In the field
of external trade promotion, the federal
Government, through the department, maintains a large group of highly-trained trade
commissioners in all major world markets,
who investigate and report on sales prospects
abroad, assist in securing agencies and buying
connections for Canadian exporters, and personally assist Canadian business visitors to
their territories.
Two years ago the Government realized
that the full extent of services available to
business was not widely enough recognized
or utilized by business, and in order to
meet this situation the department, in cooperation with management, labour and provincial governments, embarked upon the
greatest trade and industrial development
program in the history of this nation.
Two years ago there was held at Ottawa
the first National Export Trade Promotion
Conference, to which Canadian businessmen
were invited to discuss with trade commissioners from around the world the possibility
of their entering export markets. Over 10,000
interviews were held at that time with Canadian businessmen from coast to coast.
This was followed by a series of conferences in each of the ten provinces of Canada,
all of which were held in co-operation with
provincial governments. As a result of the
knowledge acquired from these discussions
with representatives of business firms in Canada, the federal Government organized a
program of "Samples Shows," to which
buyers were flown to Canada from the United
States. Approximately 250 carefully selected
buyers were flown to these "Samples Shows"
in the cities of Toronto and Montreal, and
the results of this promotional effort to encourage Canadian sales in the United States
exceeded expectations.
As a result of the experience gained from
these various projects for the expansion of
export markets and industrial development
at home, the minister bas recently announced
an even bigger program, which has been
aptly called "Operation World Markets".
Under this program, upon which the department has now spent close to one year's preparation, it is proposed, commencing on
March 23 of next year, to fly as many as 250
buyers of heavy equipment from countries
around the world to Canada, as guests of the
Canadian Government. These buyers will be
accompanied by our Canadian trade commissioners in their respective countries. Arrangements have been completed for them

to visit, on arrival, various industries across
this country and see at first hand the quality
of our products and our capacity to produce
and deliver.
On the completion of this project, which
will run for one week, these buyers will be
returned to their respective countries and a
further 750 purchasing agents and officials
of foreign countries are to be flown to
Toronto, again accompanied by our trade
commissioners from around the world. Arrangements have been made to hold a Canadian National Samples Show at Toronto, at
which it is expected over 600 Canadian producers will exhibit their wares. On the completion of this operation, these buyers will
be flown back to their respective countries
with a better knowledge of the productive
capacity of this country, and, more important, a first-hand knowledge of the ability
of Canadians to produce goods that are competitive in design, quality and price with
those produced by other countries.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Are they to come as guests
of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: They are to come as
guests of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): All expenses paid?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: I am sure their travelling
expenses and hotel bills within Canada will
be paid by the Canadian Government, but
I am not sure that they will be flown in at
our expense. However, I can find that out.
I am under the impression that all their expenses will be paid.
The third stage in the "Operation World
Markets" project is to bring to Canada the
remainder of our trade commissioners across
the world for a one-week departmental conference with departmental officials at Ottawa.
The purpose of this is to provide a first-hand
opportunity for our trade commissioners to
familiarize themselves with the expanding
Canadian productive capacity, and for our
commodity officers at home to exchange
views and ideas with our trade commissioners
from abroad.
On the completion of that one-week conference, the Government is arranging to hold
another National Export Trade Promotion
Conference in Ottawa, to which Canadian
businessmen will be invited to come and discuss with Canadian trade commissioners from
around the world the possibility of expanding Canadian export markets in the various
territories which they represent. Present plans
call for holding from 20,000 to 25,000 interviews during the ensuing three weeks, or
month if necessary.

NOVEMBER 29, 1962
In my opinion, no country in the world
today offers such an aggressive program to
assist businessmen. I am confident that with
the wholehearded co-operation of business
and labour, this program can be successful
to a degree that will not only bridge our
economy over the transitional period now
being experienced by practically all countries
in the free world, but will provide us with
the instrument under which we may assure
ourselves of a high level of economic activity
and a high standard of living, both of which
are very essential to our well being as a
democratic country in a free enterprise
economy.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, I do not intend to deal
in detail with the important legislation foreseen in the Speech from the Throne. In my
opinion, it would be premature to try to make
a brief analysis of the excellent legislation
set forth in that historic document.
When it is introduced in the Senate I shall
try to make as valuable a contribution as
I can to the debate.
Consequently, at this time I should like to
limit myself to a few comments of a general
nature with respect to the finest of the Canadian provinces.
Quebec is not like the other provinces,
thank God! Three cheers for the difference!
Our language and our religion are different.
Our way of life is quite different since it is
truly French. Yet, we are Canadians and we
love our country just as much as our fellow
citizens. We have shown just as much courage and eagerness in her defence. The only
thing we ask is that our autonomy be respected in accordance with the Confederation
pact.
We neither want to become independent nor
to separate from the rest of Canada. We wish
to remain an integral part of Confederation.
However, it is useful to recall that without
the province of Quebec, Confederation would
never have been possible. Without our province, Canada would have been divided, both
economically and geographically, in two or
three areas, according to the way you look
at it. Without Quebec, the rest of the country
would inevitably become a satellite of the
United States. I proclaim highly, therefore,
that the Right Honourable Mr. Diefenbaker
is entitled to our gratitude for ail he has
undertaken in the last five years in order to
comply with our most legitimate claims. During this short period of time, he has accomplished more for the province of Quebec,
for the French cause throughout the country, than any other prime minister since
Confederation. I do not wish to make what

is commonly called a political speech, for this
is neither the time nor the place. Nevertheless, even if Mr. Diefenbaker and I did not
share the same party affiliation, I would still
take pleasure in telling him how much he
is entitled to the appreciation, not only of
the people from the province of Quebec, but
also of all our compatriots from the other
provinces. His contribution to national unity
has been tremendous, and I am convinced that
he will go down in history as one of the best
prime ministers Canada ever had.
May I point out some of his achievements
in that field? First and foremost, he recognized
in a positive way the bilingual characteristics
of our country. A simultaneous translation
system, which had been requested for so many
years, and which two prime ministers from
our own province had been unable to give
us, was set up in both houses of Parliament.
Simultaneous translation of debates is of
paramount importance in Parliament. The
atmosphere in Ottawa and, indeed, throughout
the nation has completely changed. Our Quebec friends feel much more at ease in the
capital city, and all the more since many
English-speaking members, following the example set by the Prime Minister and several
members of his cabinet, are learning French
and speak it in a very commendable way. We
congratulate them, as well as the Leader of the
Opposition in this house and the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
who are now both able to speak our language,
even with a certain elegance.
The Right Honourable Mr. Diefenbaker
also gave us bilingual federal Government's
cheques. Moreover, all official documents will
be printed simultaneously in both languages
from now on.
In addition, the Government is giving us
back our taxation rights, of which we were
deprived since 1942 by a mere letter from
a Liberal provincial government. That had
been demanded for a number of years. The
Diefenbaker Government is giving us back
our taxation rights. And all that has been
accomplished in five years!
Some may say that it is too little and too
late. But I shall ask you to whom that reproach should be directed: to Mr. John
Diefenbaker or to the other prime ministers
who preceded him?
I said it earlier and I say it again that if
the separatist movement is now on the wane
in the province of Quebec, it is due in great
part to the present Government which turned
a sympathetic ear to our just claims.

SENATE

The Speech from the Throne also provides
for the passage of joint resolutions of both
houses to obtain from the British government the repatriation of our constitution.
Since the British government is sure to
accede to the request contained in those
resolutions, this will remove the last traces
of our old colonial ties with Great Britain
to which, nevertheless, we shall always remain devoted in heart and in spirit. We shall
then become in fact and by right equal partners in the large Commonwealth family.
The Government informs us also in the
Speech from the Throne that a conference of
the ten provinces will be called with a view
to choosing a distinctive national flag. I welcome this initiative which will enable us, I
hope, to hoist throughout the country and at
the world's fair in Montreal, our very own
flag during the centennial celebrations in
1967. What a happy day, honourable senators,
when we can all sing together our national
anthem "O Canada" under our flag floating
gently in the breeze of our beautiful country.
(Text):
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
before I put the motion, I wish to say a word.
During the course of this debate honourable
senators who took part made many kind
references to myself on my appointment as
Speaker of the Senate. I would have to be
made of ice not to feel an inward glow from
the warmth and sincerity of your good wishes
and offers of assistance, for, as Mr. Speaker,
I can only preserve and maintain the dignity
of this honourable chamber with your cooperation. So I say a simple but most sincere
"thank you" to each honourable senator.
(Translation):
To my French-speaking colleagues, my sincere thanks for their courtesy. Thank you
very much, honourable senators, for your
kind words of encouragement in my efforts
to speak French.

INTERPARLIAMENTARY

UNION

FIFTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONFERENCE
BRASILIA-DEBATE ADJOURNED

AT

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson rose pursuant
to notice:

That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Fifty-first Annual Conference of the Interparliamentary Union
held at Brasilia, Brazil, 24th October to
lst November, 1962, and in particular to

the discussions and proceedings of the
Conference and the participation therein
of the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, it has now
become customary for me, among others who
have been members of the Canadian delegation to various meetings of the Interparliamentary Union, to report briefly to the Senate upon the Annual Conference of the Union,
which I have had the privilege to attend as
one of the representatives of Canada. Canada
became a member of the Interparliamentary
Union in 1960, and since then I have had the
honour of leading the Canadian parliamentary group, first to Tokyo in 1960, then to
Brussels in 1961 and now to Brasilia, Brazil
in 1962, where was held the Fifty-first Annual
Conference of the Union. The other representatives of our country were Senator Dessureault, Senator Beaubien (Provencher),
Senator Méthot and Mr. Maurice Coté, M.P.
We were accompanied and ably assisted by
Mr. Alcide Paquette, First Clerk Assistant of
this house.
I have on other occasions referred to the
organization and purposes of the Interparliamentary Union. Although this body has been
in existence since 1889, our knowledge of it
in this Parliament is meagre because of our
brief association with it.
However, it is a union of the parliaments
of sixty-one countries. It has its headquarters
and permanent staff, that is, a secretariat, in
Geneva, Switzerland. It elects a president,
an executive committee of nine members,
including the president, and a council on
which every country is represented by two
persons. Our representatives on the council
are Mr. J. A. Habel, M.P. and myself. The
executive committee is the administrative
organ of the union and is made up so as to
ensure a fair geographical distribution of its
members.
The former president of the union was Mr.
G. Codacci-Pisanelli, of Italy, and the new
president, who was elected at the conference
in Brasilia to which I am referring, is Mr.
R. Mazzilli, who is the Prime Minister of
Brazil and also a very distinguished LatinAmerican statesman.
The union has an official organ called the
"Interparliamentary Bulletin" which is published four times a year, in both English and
French. Each year the secretariat prepares
an annual report which is a concise, yet most
complete and objective review of world-wide
political developments as well as a review of
political and parliamentary changes that have
occurred in various countries of the world
during the year.
The union maintains regular official relations with the United Nations Organization
and its specialized agencies and with the

DECEMBER 4. 1962
Secretary-General of the United Nations. Also
the Director-General of the U.N. specialized
agencies is regularly represented at the annual
conference of the Interparliamentary Union.
I recite these things to indicate that cooperation takes place between the secretariat of the Interparliamentary Union and
the secretariat of the United Nations, as well
as other international bodies.
Furthermore, there have developed within
the union regional groupings of states, one
of the more important of which is the LatinAmerican group which includes the United
States. Indeed, at each of the conferences
that I have attended the leaders of this group
have made representations to our delegation
urging our acceptance of an invitation to
join their regional union.
If my colleagues on the recent visit to
Brasilia agree, I propose to suggest to our
parliamentary group when it is reorganized,
to carefully study this suggestion. It will
perhaps bring us somewhat closer to the
Latin countries south of the Rio Grande.
As is well known, Canada is not a member
of the Organization of American States, which
formerly was known as the Pan-American
Union and, consequently, I think it would
be a gesture of goodwill, especially to Latin
America, to develop this additional contact
with these states. However, that is a matter
that should be decided by our own parliamentary group.
As is so well known, the democratic-minded
people south of the Rio Grande have continually to fight against heavy odds to maintain their parliamentary institutions intact,
and any encouragement that Canada can give
in that respect may be of some help to those
countries.
Honourable senators, let me now say just
a word about the broad objectives of the
Interparliamentary Union. Originally, apart
of course from working towards the end of
the rainbow in the elusive subject of universal
disarmament, in its early stages the union
concerned itself with the promotion of arbitration between states. That is a long time
ago. This union of parliaments was founded
in 1889, and the subject of arbitration was
the first of the problems dealt with by it.
Thanks to its activity, it was instrumental
in bringing about the foundation of the Permanent Arbitration Court at the first Hague
conference around the turn of the century.
Then, throughout the years it worked continuously to support official international
organizations and studied the question of
codification of international law, neutrality,
unequal treaties, the limits to state sovereinty and a myriad of other problems involving a respect for law and human freedoms.
27511-5-23J

Indeed, it appears to me that much of the
basic groundwork and theories in regard to
international relationships, which became embodied first in the documents of the League
of Nations and later in the charter of the
United Nations, were developed over the years
in the work of the Interparliamentary Union.
I would say that at present one of the main
objectives of the union is to assist in the development and improvement of the representative system of government.
I might add here, as is well known, the
Interparliamentary Union does not exclude
the so-called people's democracies of eastern
Europe, including the U.S.S.R. All these
countries became members of the union in the
1950's. Let us have no doubt on this point,
that all the representatives of these countries
are wholly convinced that it is they and not
we of the west who possess the better type of
parliamentary institution. Be that right or
wrong, this matter comes up between us from
time to time at these gatherings, and with
the greatest conviction and vehemence these
people plead the cause of their system of
representative government against ours and,
as I say, maintain that it is they and not we
who have the better system of representative
government.
This brings me to another point I wish to
deal with briefly, although it is a problem
which, next to the prevention of war, is of
fundamental importance to western democracies; that is, the future of parliamentary
democracy itself. Of course, we are all aware
of the parliamentary crises which have occurred in recent years in important countries
like Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia, the Argentine and Peru, where parliaments have been
dissolved or become meaningless. At the time
of their occurrence those events made newspaper headlines for days and weeks. Consequently, it was of interest to me to pick up
today's Montreal Gazette and read Arthur
Blakely's column in which he refers to an
interview he had with Mr. Winch, the member of Parliament for Vancouver East, who
recently attended a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Nigeria. I
quote just a couple of remarks which apparently Mr. Winch related to Mr. Blakely.
One of them reads:
Democracy was faring badly in African
states which were trying to convert themselves from savagery into modern societies in five years or a decade. In many
countries, democratic practices were being
trampled underfoot. And in the world at
large, the African states were cynically
playing off the East against the West and
vice versa, to advance towards their own
objective.

SENATE
I quote another remark from the report of
the interview:
There was a noticeable trend towards
dictatorship.
This problem is, of course, more noticeable
in Africa than in most other parts of the
world because of the inexperience of these
countries in the workings of democracy. It
was very apparent in Asia a few years ago,
because after the second world war various
democracies were established in Asia, most of
which do not now exist.
However, I referred a moment ago to the
Secretary General's report on the Interparliamentary Union. This report is issued
once a year by the secretariat of the Interparliamentary Union in Geneva, and I deem
it, as I am sure anyone who reads it will
deem it, to be as authoritative a document
as you can find in relation to the parliamentary and political events of the countries
of the world during that year. I want to read
from page 25 of this report a few paragraphs
under the heading "The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy". This particular report
covers the period from October 1961 to
November 1962, and was prepared for the
most part by Mr. André Blonay, Secretary
General of the Interparliamentary Union,
which office corresponds roughly to that of
Mr. U Thant of the United Nations organization. He writes:
After a period of time in which parliamentary democracy regained its place in
countries which had fallen under dictatorships of various types, it has suffered
new setbacks in the Western hemisphere
over the past year.
Mention has already been made of the
difficult situation in Argentina. In Venezuela, there have been various attempted
coups d'etat, opposition to the Government stemming both from left and right.
In Peru, the Parliament was dissolved
following presidential elections whose
results were contested by the armed
forces.
Indeed, at the moment the number of
Latin American Republics where constitutional regimes function normally and
without restrictions is very limited. As
so often in the past, military power is
again wielding influence on the political
scene.
In almost all capitals, opposition movements, whether legal or illegal, show increasing activity. There is scarcely a
single State where the effects of this
crisis have not been felt and where
stability can be considered as assured.

This tends to prove that the present
crisis is deep-rooted and that it is due
to grave maladjustments characterizing
the social structure of many Latin
American countries.
Next I would like to quote a few more
paragraphs from page 127 of this report:
In the East, the representative systemThat is behind the Iron Curtain or under the
communist system.
-is
seen as a method whereby the
people, led by the Communist Party, that
is to say, the avant-garde of the workers,
participate in the strengthening and development of the Socialist regime. The
primary concern is that of efficiency in
the realization of the egalitarian objectives of Marxist-Leninism. An election is
not a contest between different political
ideas, but is rather a manifestation of
unity, and sometimes even of unanimity,
by a people no longer divided by class
interests. It is undeniable that such regimes have achieved some remarkable
results in the economic, social and scientific fields.
Between the two blocsThat is between the eastern bloc and the
western bloc of which we are a member.
-the "third world" is today seeking the
political means and methods for its own
development. Certain countries, particularly in Latin America, are trying to reconcile a multi-party political system with
economic and social efficiency. Their
democratic institutions risk, however, becoming a target both for reactionary
forces linked to the privileged classes and
for revolutionary tendencies. It was precisely this combination of pressures
which, as has been seen, brought about
the Argentine parliamentary crisis and
has in recent months imperilled the Venezuelan regime, at a time when it was
engaged in an unprecedented agrarian reform program.
On the other hand, certain newly independent countries, desirous of obviating
the tensions which are intrinsic to Western parliamentarianism, have opted for
a single-party system. Cambodia and
Chad, which are mentioned later, are
good illustrations. In Africa alone, Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Guinea, Upper
Volta, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Niger, Central African Republic, Congo (Brazzaville),
as well as Tunisia, the United Arab Republic and, quite recently, Algeria, have
also chosen this method. For the moment,
it is difficult to predict which of these
various types of institutions will prove to

DECEMBER 4, 1962
be the most effective. Nor is it possible to
say ta what degree the countries in question will find new ways of resolving in
their own fashion the eternal dilemma between freedom and authoritarianism.
So, honourable senators, ail does flot go
well for parliamentary institutions throughout
the world. As part of this process, we will
recail what happened recently in Ghana where
Mr. Nkrumah has seen fit to abolish opposition parties. So now I make boid to express
the point of view that perhaps even we are
smug and self-satisfied with the operation
of our own parliamentary institutions.
My own observation indîcates that when a
parliamentary body becomes only a forum for
debate, often seemingly ill-mannered, ill-tempered and overly partisan, where the opposition, whether individuals, groups or parties, deems its function to be merely that of
obstructing and frustrating the passage of
legisiation, and, indeed, the estimates of the
expenditures required to carry on the business of the nation, then there are 'present
conditions which, in most of the countries
to which I have referred, have induced them
to adopt the one-party system. Those are the
conditions whîch would induce such measures
to be taken there. Those are also the reasons
why parliaments have actually disappeared
in so many countries in recent years.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: This is not a political speech. I am simply stating a fact. I am
sure the honourable senator will agree with
the next statement I intend to make, as I
am sure the honourable Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) will agree. T am going to say this
without any apology whatsoever.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not know where
divorce comes into this.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I might
say that it is well divorced from the subject
under discussion.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: You will see where
it comes in. I say that, coming closer to home,
even in our own Parliament-and my friend
must admit that this is the first time I have
referred to our Parliament-when either
individuals or groups take it upon themselves
to use the very rules that are designed to
secure the utmost of freedom in our institutions, when they use those rules that have
been developed over the years to obstruct and
frustrate legislation which has overwhelming
support in Parliament, such actions are of the
very essence of irresponsibility and deserve
the censure of all who are interested in perpetuating the parliamentary tradition.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): This is a
fine lecture to the other house.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I do not know of
anything that bas a greater tendency to bring
parliamentary institutions into disreputeHon. Mr. Macdonald (Bran±ford): And a
quite improper lecture.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It is time there was a
lecture to a few individuals in the other
house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Mr.
Speaker, we have no right to refer in this
chamber to what is taking place in the other
house, and I submit the honourable senator

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators, perhaps I might saySome Hon. Senators: Order, order.

remarks he has made about our Parliament,
or any other parliament, that could cause
offence to anyone.
After all, this discussion would appear to
embrace a subject of this nature, and reference would be made to other parliaments
besides the one in Brasilia.
I am sorry to have to say to the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) that from what I have
heard I do not think I would consider what
the honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) bas said as a lecture.
Therefore, I do not think I can rule that he
is out of order.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Mr.
Speaker, may I be permitted to say that the
honourable senator from Winnipeg South has
not referred to other parliaments; he has referred to our Parliament-to the other branch
of Parliament in this country, and I submit,
Mr. Speaker, that a reference of that nature
is completely out of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) was referring to a
large number of parliaments which have set
up, as I think he called it, one-party systems,
and to others.
I would ask the honourable senator to
proceed.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators, let me come closer to the official proceedings of the conference. I note that the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) has objected to
a slight deviation from its proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I understood the honourable the Speaker to say
that there was no deviation. Now my honourable friend stands up and says that there
was a slight deviation from what he called
the ordinary proceedings, as I understood
him.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Only from the conference proceedings. There was no deviation
whatsoever from the question of parliamentary institutions, but there was a deviation
from the work of this particular conference
in regard to the special agenda, which I now
come to. I suggest there was no deviation
whatsoever from the principles of the Interparliamentary Union which I am speaking
about tonight.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, Inquiry No. 1 clearly sets out the purpose of this debate. As we all know, Canada
is a member of the Interparliamentary Union.
I have followed very closely what the bonourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) has said, and it seems to
Hon. Mr. Croll: I understood the honourme that his comments are quite in line with able senator to say that there was a deviation
the nature of a report that would be expected from the resolution that appears on the Order
of him, and that he has said nothing in the Paper.

DECEMBER 4, 1962

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Oh no, I did not
say that.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Then I am mistaken. Let the
honourable senator proceed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Well,
there was 'a deviation anyway.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I understood him to say
that.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators, I thank you for allowing me to proceed.
This conference met in that most wonderful city, Brasilia. May I express the hope
that any of my colleagues who speak on this
subject will refer to that city. As usual, the
convention opened in the presence of the
heads of state of the host country, Brazil
namely, the President of Brazil, Senhor Goulart, and the Prime Minister of that country.
Incidentally, and with particular reference to what I have been speaking about during the last ten minutes, I want to remark
that two years ago it was arranged that the
host country for this convention in October
of this year was to be Argentina, which had
extended an official invitation to the Interparliamentary Union to meet in Buenos Aires.
I have referred to what happened to the
Parliament of Argentina. It does not exist
at the moment. Consequently, it was deemed
to be most incongruous to have a meeting of
the Interparliamentary Union in a country in
which a parliament did not exist.
As a result of that decision, Brazil, despite
the fact that it is presently in the throes of
what might be called a parliamentary crisis,
very kindly extended an invitation to the
Interparliamentry Union to hold this conference in its capital city of Brasilia.
Honourable senators, after the opening
ceremonies, the next event was the beginning
of a general debate. This is similar to the
general debate in the United Nations Assembly each year and, in practice, every
country takes part. Generally, each delegation emphasizes the main points of view
adopted by that country in its international
relations during the year.
As honourable senators will recall, this
conference continued throughout under the
shadow of the Cuban crisis. This lent a sense
of urgency to the proceedings, as well as
giving the conference a sense of helplessness
and frustration. There we were gathered, an
international parliamentary conference, most
of us having felt-that is, before the Cuban
crisis-that some progress had been achieved
in relieving the cold war since the days of
the crisis concerning the Berlin wall a year
ago. Also, honourable senators will recall
the untimely death of Mr. Hammarskjöld in

October 1961, which for a time actually
threatened to destroy, or at least seriously
maim, the United Nations organization. As
I have said, this conference began in the very
shadow of nuclear war.
The agenda items of this conference were:
1. The role of international trade in
promoting balanced economic and social
progress in developing countries.
During this debate there was considerable
reference to the European Economic Community. As honourable senators are aware,
certain African countries are associated with
the European Economic Community, and consequently there was quite a body of criticism
by Latin American countries which felt that
there was some possibility of their being
discriminated against in the European Common Market.
The second item of the agenda was:
2. Draft convention on measures to be
taken in the international field against
those guilty, in the exercise of public
office, of fraudulent enrichment prejudicial to the public interest.
This is a problem which, of course, does
not concern countries in the western democracies but which is of tremendous concern
to the newly-developing democracies. We all
have heard of the numbered bank accounts
in countries like Switzerland. We have read
about the things which have been done by
dictators like Trujillo and others, in sending
tremendous amounts of wealth out of their
countries into other countries. The governments of the countries where those people
live find no method, under present international law, of following those funds, in
the same way as we do through our domestic
law and our treaties with other countries.
Consequently, this is a problem of the utmost
importance, and the International Parliamentary Union is only this year beginning to
try to find a solution to it.
The third item was:
3. Methods and prerequisites for general disarmament.
This subject matter, which is the most important one before us in the world today, was
discussed under three headings, namely:
(a) Measures for the lessening of international tensions;
(b) Constitution of an international
force to meet immediate needs;
(c) General acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International
Court of Justice in the settlement of
disputes between states.

SENATE
I am sure all honourable senators will
recognize these as being extraordinarily important problems facing the countries of the
world today.
The problem of measures for the lessening
of international tensions is a very obvious
one which is continuously and persistently
before us.
Then there is the question of the constitution of an international force to meet our
needs as contemplated by the original United
Nations Charter. As everyone here knows,
this is one of the objects of the United Nations which bas not been possible of achievement up to the present time. It is true that
Canada and other countries have supplied
police forces to various countries, such as we
have in the Middle East today, and such as are
present in the Congo. However, that is entirely outside of the real objective of the
United Nations Charter, which contemplated
the development of a world-wide police force
under the United Nations. Consequently, that
is one of the problems which was under discussion before the Interparliamentary Union.
Then there was the problem of the general
acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice in the settlement of disputes between states. I think most
of those who have followed that subject are
aware of the present position. Canada and
many other countries have become members
of the International Court of Justice, and we
have accepted its compulsory jurisdiction. On
the other hand, many countries, including the
United States of America and the U.S.S.R.
have refused, up to the present, to accept the
compulsory jurisdiction of the court. I think
it is obvious to anyone that until these two
great giants among us do accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the court, that that
court will not be of any real value to the
world as a whole.
Those were the subjects under discussion
in the Interparliamentary Union, and I may
say that all members of the Canadian delegation took part in the debates. In regard to
discussion in the Interparliamentary Union,
the discussions there, like their counterpart in
the United Nations, are continuously afflicted
by the ideological differences between East
and West. Consequently, voting on many
resolutions becomes a contest between the
communist countries on the one hand, and
the western democracies on the other. In this
particular conference, however, I think it may
be said, and I think my fellow delegates will
agree with me, that the communist delegates
became isolated. I think perhaps the presence
of the Cuban crisis during the conference was
a reason for this condition. When there was
a clear conflict on ideological grounds the
communist delegates were only able to muster

about 25 per cent of the votes cast. Certainly,
in previous conferences I have attended they
had a considerably larger share of the vote.
May I now say a word or two as to the
personnel of the various delegations. I want
to say, for instance, that the United States
delegation was a particularly strong one. It
consisted of seven senators, all from southern
states who were not involved in the recent
elections there, and seven or eight members
of the House of Representatives. The Japanese
delegation was the largest, consisting of thirtysix persons. The British delegation is always
a strong one, and the representatives are
generally eminent members of the House of
Lords and the House of Commons.
The next conference of the Interparliamentary Union is to be held in the fall of 1963
at Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The 1964 conference
is to be held in Copenhagen. For 1965 our
delegation, with the approval of the Government, have extended an invitation to the
union to come to Canada in the fall of that
year. The invitation bas not yet been accepted. It bas been considered by the council
but it will be further considered, and I expect that it will be accepted at the next
meeting of the council which will be held
in Lausanne, Switzerland next spring.
There is obviously a great interest in Canada wherever one moves among the delegates.
Particularly to the Africans, "Canada" seems
to be a magic word. They like to talk about
Canada, to learn more about it, and they
evince a friendly attitude towards us.
I have no doubt that more than 500 delegates and many of their wives will come to
Canada in 1965. I am sure that it will be a
distinct pleasure to us to be the host to this
gathering, and I am also sure it will be an
inspiration to many of them to come to this
comparatively new country.
Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien (Provencher):
Honourable senators, my speech will be
brief. My honourable friend from Winnipeg
South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson), who was
leader of the delegation at Brasilia, bas outlined the objects of the Interparliamentary
Union and mentioned many of the questions
that were discussed at the conference held
in the latter part of October. All that is left
for me is give my own impressions, because
it was the first time I attended an Interparliamentary Union conference.
We arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday
morning, and were fortunate in meeting His
Excellency the Canadian Ambassador and his
charming lady. One of the ambassador's officers took us on a sight-seeing tour of Rio de
Janeiro. The next day we met in the ambassador's office and he briefed the delegation
on the economic, social and political situation
of Brazil.

DECEMBER 4. 1962
It was most instructive and helpful to us
to learn about the conditions there from our
ambassador who, as representative of Canada,
is well acquainted with the conditions in that
country.
The next day we flew to Brasilla, the new
capital of Brazil. It will be a long time before
the new capital will be what it is intended
to become, for only a certain amount of work
has been done toward its development.
The conference was well attended by delegations from forty-six countries. There were
delegations from behind the Iron Curtain,
the Far East, the Near East, as well as from
countries which are more or less undeveloped,
and from others which have come into their
own in the last few years.
These delegates discussed subjects of concern to the different countries, and described
the difficulties which were faced in their
own countries, economically, socially and
otherwise, all of which was most interesting.
As to Canada, we did not have much to complain about because, after all, we are a fortunate country.
The Iron Curtain countries tried to appear
as powerful as they could, not only in their
speeches but in their actions. According to
the information I had, and which I believe
was authentic, they held caucuses almost
every day to find out what action they should
take on any question coming up before the
meeting.
Many of the countries which I might call
borderline countries are hesitant about doing
anything against Iron Curtain countries or
the people behind the Iron Curtain. They
hesitate to do things they would like to do
themselves, for they are afraid of the consequences. However, when President Kennedy in his television speech some time ago
announced the blockading of Soviet Union
ships bound for Cuba loaded with missiles
and aircraft, there was a tremendous change
in the attitude of what I call these borderline
countries, so much so that the communist
bloc was left almost by itself. Many of these
countries felt that the blockade was an action
which might bring about conditions in the
world to prevent any future conflict or invasion by communism in their countries. That
was one of my impressions.
When you find anywhere from forty to
forty-six countries-my friend says there are
sixty-one in the union-assembled together
to discuss their problems, the delegates must
in the course of doing so intermingle and
fraternize with each other. Having attended
such a conference my impression was that
this fraternization naturally creates an atmosphere which leads to the understanding
that, after all, we are fellow human beings,
27511-5-24

that each of us has his own particular
problem, but that surely we ought to be
able to get along without continued conflict.
I want to pay tribute to my honourable
friend from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson), who was leader of the delegation.
There were only five delegates and we worked
well together. We met every day and discussed our own affairs, land played our part
at the conference in a dignified way, properly
representing Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): I want to
say to honourable senators that we should
give all the support we can to the Interparliamentary Union, to try to build it up to
the point where every nation in the world will
belong to it, for I am sure that the union
can make a tremendous contribution to future
world peace.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dessureault, debate
adjourned.
RULES OF THE SENATE
AMENDMENT

ADOPTED

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved, pursuant
to notice:
That the Rules of the Senate be
amended by striking out Rule 32 and
substituting therefor the following:
"32. A senator desiring to speak is to
rise in his place uncovered and address
himself to the rest of the senators."
He said: Honourable senators, my explanation for moving this resolution will be brief.
All it proposes to do is to strike from the existing rules the last few words which now
read:
...

and is not to refer to any senator by

name.
If there is any senator present who has
lived up to that rule, I would like him to
stand up and admit it. And, Mr. Speaker,
if I might presume to give Your Honour some
advice, it would be this: It was said, I think
by a learned judge, that if you have legislation
that is wrong the way to bring about its repeal
is to enforce it. I am of the opinion that if
His Honour the Speaker would literally and
strictly enforce this rule it would not take
long to get a unanimous vote to have it repealed. I hope to get it repealed anyway.
First, I ask, why is this rule here? I am sorry
to say that I do not know. I have gone over it
in my mind in search of possible reasons
and I have not been able to come up with
any. This is not the practice in the House of
Lords, from which we get many forms and
precedents. I have here a copy of the Hansard

SENATE
of that House, in which the honourable Lords
refer to each other by their titles, which is
one name.
I have also in my hand a copy of the Hansard of the Australian Parliament, and the
Senate there does not have any rule of this
kind.
My first suggestion as to why this rule
should be repealed is that it does not serve
any useful purpose. My second reason is
that nobody follows it.
I listened to quite a long debate the other
night and I think most senators who spoke
referred to their colleagues by name. After
all, why do we have names? We have names
to designate who we are. And why we should
submerge that designation and pick up one
that really does not designate us, to me does
not make common sense. My designation
probably is easier to remember than most,
and yet I venture to say there are many senators here who do not know it. I am looking
at my honourable friend opposite whom I
have known for many years. If I may
violate the rules, I am referring to Senator
Grattan O'Leary. I have not the least idea
what his other designation is. My friend
Senator Roebuck and his deskmate Senator
Croll each come from some place in Toronto,
but the fog I saw there yesterday was not a
patch on my fog when I try to identify these
gentlemen by their designations.
So, all I am suggesting is-and if honourable senators do not agree, it is of no more
importance to me than to anyone else-that
this rule has not much sense to it; it does not
serve any useful purpose; it is never carried
out, and we ought to be rid of it.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliol: Honourable
senators, my purpose in rising now is twofold. In the first place, it is to extend to the
honourable senator who has just spoken
congratulations on his recent birthday. We all
rejoice that he looks so well and that he is
so alert in mind and body. I wish him many
happy birthdays.
In the second place, I wish to congratulate
him for starting the weeding of the rules of
this house. We need to put an axe in the
old stump and get rid of all rules that belong
to a past age and which are useless, cumbersome and embarrassing.
One reason given for using another name
than that of a senator referred to dates back
to the feuds which existed hundreds of years
ago between the big barons and the little
barons; and the reason why senators are not
referred to by their own names is the very
same reason why we call the other house
"the other place". We do not use the words
"House of Commons," which is proper and
which could not shock the ears of the ladies.

It is good English language, and it is found
in the Constitution. In England centuries ago
the little barons were jealous of the big
barons, and it was decided that they should
not call each other by name because they
were abusing the privilege. They were adding
names of their own to the precise name of the
person concerned.
If we look at the appendix to Hansard
for the first day of this session we see the
list of names of senatorial districts. I shall
start with the province of Quebec. The first
senatorial district in that province is De la
Vallière. Now, De la Vallière is a nice name
and easy to pronounce, but who was he or
she? She was a duchess, the mistress of King
Louis XIV, and she ended her days in
repenting in a monastery. This is the name
of that senatorial district, and if I wished
to address this gentleman, who has not attended here for a long time, I would say,
"the honourable senator from De la Vallière."
Anyone who did not know the beginnings
of such a designation would think that he
was the illegitimate descendant of a mistress
of the great King Louis XIV. I do not say
it is a fact, but it could be presumed by a
learned person sitting in the gallery who
knew the history of France.
The next designation for the province of
Quebec is Inkerman. Where is Inkerman?
Hon. Mr. Choque±e: Hull.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I do not want my honourable friend, who has a wrong turn of mind
tonight, to make any insinuations. Inkerman
is a place in the Crimea, where in 1854 there
was a famous battle in which the Russians,
the English and the French were involved.
And it is the name of one of the senatorial
districts of the province of Quebec.
The third one is Wellington. Well, I make
no point about it; it is the name of a great
general.
Then, to make things even, the next district
mentioned-the senator for which I see right
across from me-is De Salaberry, the name
of a great Franch-Canadian hero of the war
of 1812. That is not too bad. It is the first one
that I bow to.
Then comes De Lorimier. De Lorimier was
a patriot who was hanged during the troubles
of 1837, and naturally it is a nobler ancestry
than that of a mistress of Louis XIV. I would
prefer to be the descendant of a patriot who
was hanged for his convictions and his love
of country than to be related to that lady,
even a distant relation.
Then we come to The Laurentides. The
Laurentides is a designation of a district
which must be on the north shore of the
St. Lawrence River. It was given to our

DECEMBER 4, 1962
late colleague Senator Bouchard
from
St. Hyacinthe. And thinking of St. Hyacinthe in the Laurentides is an anachronism.
Then there is Kennebec, which is an Indian
name-I cast no reflection upon Indian names
-and it looks like "Quebec". But I wonder
what it means.
Then there is Rigaud, a geographical name.
Then Stadacona, being the old Indian name
of Quebec City.
Next is Grandville. Grand was the name
of a French draftsman, and Gran was a
famous English statesman, but when it is
written as it appears in this appendix to
Hansard, it means that the honourable senator from Grandville takes his designation,
not from the great British statesman but from
the French draftsman, and you have only to
look in the dictionary to check it.
Sorel and Lauzon are both geographie locations. De Lanaudière was the name of Madeleine de Vercheres, a courageous woman who
fought the Iroquois a long time ago. Alma is
the name of a lady and there is a district of
that name in the Lake St. John area, but this
designation should apply to a lady senator.
When we say "the honourable gentleman
from Alma", it makes no sense but if we
referred to a lady senator from Alma it
would have some sense.
Then we come to Gulf. Gulf is a vast area
that extends from Grandville to the St.
Lawrence river, but giving to such a vast
area of land the description of a vast area of
water seems to be an anomaly.
Then we come to De la Durantaye, and
here I think there should be a prize given to
any English-speaking colleague who can pronounce it properly. They seem to have a lot
of difficulty with it. They could pronounce
Temiscouata much easier.
Next we have Repentigny; I don't know
its meaning, but there is a village of that
name. Then, of course, La Salle is the name
of a famous explorer.
Shawinigan is the name of a town. Mille
Iles is, of course, a thousand islands-it is
confusing. Victoria is the name of a great
queen, and Bedford the name of a duke. And
that is that.
It would be much simpler to adopt
geographical names or the names of wellknown constituencies, and not hyphenated
names, for the description of our senatorial
districts.
I would like to add that these appellations,
these names, date back to the time of the
election of the first Legislative Council of
Quebec in 1829. At that time the population
was not at all what it is now. It was sparse
and there was no means of communication.
I think it is important to have a change made
27511-5-24j

in those names. It may be said they are difficult to change for two reasons: because they
are found in the Constitution and they are
the designations or names of the districts of
the Legislative Councillors of the province of
Quebec.
Some of the rules are just as amusing as
the names of the senatorial districts, and it
is time for a change there too. I congratulate
very warmly the honourable senator who has
just spoken for having brought this matter to
the attention of the Senate.
Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable
senators, I think there is probably little I
can add to what my colleague from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has already
said; in fact, as to the matter of rules it
might be more appropriate for me to remain
silent and listen to our colleagues who are
learned in the law and accept their views as
our guide in this matter. However I think
there are one or two points I might make.
My attention was drawn to this rule a short
time ago, and I feel it is one of those rules
which we should examine to ascertain
whether it serves any useful purpose. In
doing this we should adopt the principle that
if a rule of the Senate is either not workable,
or if it is honoured only in the breach, its
retention is no longer desirable. It seems to
me in dealing with the rules of this place,
or indeed of any other place, the principle
that should apply is that a rule which is not
consistently followed and adhered to should
be changed, since there seems to be no valid
reason for retaining it.
Consideration of Rule 32 causes us to look
closely at our book of rules-I wonder how
frequently we do so.
On looking through the rules I think it
becomes obvious that what the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) said is true. There are a few more
of our rules that bear close examination. If
it is true that many of them are out of date,
then I suggest to honourable senators that
it might be well worthwhile to consider
changing some of them.
I do not suggest that we should undertake
such an examination at this moment. I am
merely seconding the motion of our honourable colleague from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris). However, I do think that in
recent years many of the rules of this house
have not been strictly observed, to put it
mildly. I have no intention of lecturing my
honourable colleagues-I respect them too
much to do that-but I do claim that if once
in a while we look through our book of
rules we will find that at many places we
are not adhering strictly to them.
Rule 32 states that a senator desiring to
speak shall address himself to the other

SENATE
senators. We have deviated slightly from that
specific rule in that it is not uncommon for
honourable senators to address themselves to
His Honour the Speaker.
There is little more that I can add. I do,
however, express this one further thought,
that designating honourable senators by electoral division, or the district in which they
live, had more meaning at the time of
Confederation than it has today. The only
members of this house who have to comply
with the regulation of having their property
within their electoral constituency are senators from Quebec. For the rest of the members
of this house these appellations are not really
effective any longer.
For these reasons I have pleasure in seconding the motion of the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris).
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the honourable senator from Vancouver South if there
is a similar rule to this in the House of Commons, or is this rule peculiar to this chamber?
Hon.
is such
perhaps
because
certain

Mr. Farris: I understand that there
a rule in the House of Commons, but
there is more reason for it there
a member is elected to represent a
constituency.

This rule can produce doubtful results.
Take, for instance, the trinity of senators who
come fron that city which is the farthest
east and the oldest inhabited city in Canada.
One of the three represents one portion of
the city; another-myself--represents another
portion; but the third comprehends all. One
is designated as being from St. John's East,
another from St. John's West, and the third
from St. John's.
If a senator wishes to refer to one of the
senators from St. John's and he does not
know whether he is from St. John's East or
St. John's West, then in all probability if he
refers to him as the senator from St. John's,
the real senator from St. John's will get up
and deny whatever is being imputed.
It is time, honourable senators, in my opinion, that this practice was dropped. If any
senator wants to refer to me, then let him
refer to me as Senator Higgins, and to the
honourable senator from St. John's West as
Senator Pratt, and to the honourable senator
from St. John's as Senator Baird. At the
moment Senator Pratt and I represent only
a portion of the total, and Senator Baird coinprehends the whole. I am fully in accord
with the motion of the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris).

There is a reference to naming a member by

DECEMBER 4, 1992
the Chair for unruly conduct, but that has no
application in this debate. So f ar as I can
find, Bourinot has nothing to say on the
question.
Sir Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice
contains practically nothing on the point, except that under "Rules of debate" I find this
statement:
The rules observed by the House regarding order in debate are followed in
a standing committee, as also are the
rules relating to the preservation of order,
decency, and harmony among the members. Accordingly, members of a standing
committee address the Chair standing,
and may not refer to other members by
naine, or smoke or read newspapers or
distribute propaganda literature.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is
in the house?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is in the committees
of the House of Commons of England. That
is the only reference I can find to it in this
book.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is there a reference to the
House of Lords?
Mon. Mr. Roebuck: There is nothing in the
index about the House of Lords.
I arn perfectly sure that i this chamber
there is no need for a rule to prevent our
members from distributing propaganda literature.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): What
about propaganda speeches?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It does flot say anything
about speeches.
Hon. Mr. Maison: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? The rule has a reference

senator take that into consideration?

it as a fact.

Reference to namnes cornes into the samne category. In preserving decency, there is no need
here of a rule prohibiting senators from
calling each other by surnames.
I find in Bourinot, page 390, this statement:
Recording of naines-The naines of
members who vote in a division always
appear in the Votes and Proceedings and
j ournals of both houses-this practice
having been followed in ail the Canadian
assemblies since 1792. The naines were
not recorded, however, in the legisiýative
council 0f Canada until 1857, when it was
made elective. The practice of enabling
the people to know how their representatives vote on publie questions was adopted
in 1836 in the English House of Commons.
The Lords have published their division
lists regularly since 1857.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that
when you refer to a senator by his designation
there are few outside this house, and not
ail within it, who know the person to whom
you refer; but I am perfectly satisfied that if
I refer to the senator from Vancouver South
as "Senator Farris" it would be recognized
throughout ai British Columbia and perhaps
nearly ail the rest of Canada.
I think it is an artificial regulation. It conveys the impression to me of a rather childish
restriction.
I have neyer conformed to the supposed
rule that we must refer to the House of Comnmons as "the other place". 1 think that is siily.
Everybody knows what you mean when you
say "the other place" and you might just as
well use the English language as applied to it
and say the "Hlouse of Commons".
1 know this was a rule which was adopted
many years ago in England, where there was
continuous conffict between the two houses.
The rule was adopted, if my memory serves
me aright, in order to soften the asperity
of the reference by members in one house ta
the other house and what took place there.
That is not necessary here.
It is true that we do not refer to the
debates of the other house while they are
in progress. We carefully avoid making
quotations from the current session of the
house. But that has nothing to do with the
language which one may use in referring ta
that house.
I amn all in favour of abolition of this
artificiality, both as a matter of convenience
and as a matter of forin, and to maintain the
respect with which we are held by those who

SENATE
look to us to be common-sense businesslike
people in the carrying on of the business of
the house.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: May I ask the sponsor
of the motion (Hon. Mr. Farris) a question?
I am wondering about the several Macdonalds, the several Taylors, Smiths, Beaubiens-and Robertsons now. When there is
more than one senator with the same surname, what should be added when one of
them is referred to by name only? Should
we refer to "Senator Beaubien, Provencher"
for the convenience of the bouse and of the
reporters?
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is a very simple
question to answer. If this motion is carried,
there will be nothing in the rules to limit
how one may designate a man. If there were
a couple of Kellys, one may refer to one as
"Kelly with the green necktie" and it would
not be out of order. There is nothing to suggest that you cannot add to your designation,
just as now, if there are two senators of the
same name.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: You might have "the
old Senator Kelly", or "the young Senator
Kelly".
Hon. Mr. Choquette: If I may be permitted,
there appears to be a word in Rule 32 which
is superfluous. The rule says:
A senator desiring to speak is to rise
in his place uncovered .....
I have not seen many senators wearing hats
in this chamber, in the five years I have
been here, and I am therefore wondering if
the word "uncovered" is not superfluous.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That has always been the
rule.
Hon. Mr. Choquetie: Yes. I think this motion
should be referred to a committee. There are
several suggestions that could be made and
discussed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Perhaps it should go to
the Committee on Standing Orders.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes, to the Committee
on Standing Orders.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I am already convinced by the argument of
the sponsor of this motion (Hon. Mr. Farris)
and the other senators who spoke on it, all
of whom seem to be in favour of the amendment. Being so convinced, I want to say that
the sponsor, the honourable senator from
Vancouver South, is the Honourable Senator
Farris, so that everyone will know to whom
I refer.
However, I rise to my feet for another
reason, namely, to justify the amendment, in

that the British North America Act regarding senatorial designation applies only to
Quebec. In 1867 there were, Upper Canada,
Lower Canada and the Maritimes. At that
time there were twenty-four members from
Upper Canada, twenty-four from Lower Canada and twenty-four, I believe, were suggested for the Maritimes.
Under the B.N.A. Act it is only in the
province of Quebec that a senator is designated for a special district. For instance,
I am the senator from Rigaud, which is a
district including the western part of the
Island of Montreal and Vaudreuil-Soulanges;
but in the other provinces a senator is, for
instance, a senator of New Brunswick, a
senator of Nova Scotia, a senator of Ontario,
or of whatever province it may be. He is not
a senator of a particular district. In order
to abide by Rule 32 which is sought to be
amended, when we speak of an honourable
member from any province other than Quebec, we should mention the name of the place
where he lives, otherwise it would lead to
confusion.
Therefore, honourable senators, I intend to
vote for the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, may
I be permitted to answer a question asked
by the senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Choquette) about the covering of the head?
The reason it is mentioned is that when
a senator rises he is supposed to be uncovered, as the thing to be done in good
company. At Westminster a member who
speaks during a vote must be covered. I read
in the paper a few years ago that a member
of parliament who wanted to rise to speak
during the vote had to borrow the hat of a
lady to put on his head in order to follow
the usage. Members may remain covered
when they do not speak, and so the rule
requires that they uncover themselves when
they speak. This was on account of the cold
draughts at Westminster 300 years ago-there
has never been any hot air.
Motion agreed to.

I read in the newspapers of Friday, November 23, that the social justice award was
to be given to Senator Croll, and during the
weekend I saw on television the bestowal
of the award upon him in a ceremony before
a large gathering. Senator Croll is very
active in Parliament, he has done a lot to
promote his ideas; whether we share them
or not, he is deserving of recognition and I
am very glad that the award was given to
him.
With regard to social justice, we must take
it with a grain of salt because it exists only
relatively. Social justice is not perfect but
it is an aim, and a very honourable aim,
which is a good thing to have in life.

Hon. Arthur M. Pearson, Chairman o! the

He said: Honourable senators, with leave

Proceedings of the Senate o! this day,

Honourable senators, with your indulgence,
1 should like to make a few comments on this
report. I assume that it will be approved at
the next sitting or on Tuesday next, but I
shail be away and therefore will not have an

opportunity to say anything about it then.
With your permission, I should like to make
my comments now.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators,
this report of the Land Use Committee is
from the last session of the Twenty-Fourth
Parliament. The object of the committee was
to stimulate and promote initiative and to
interest administrators and local groups in
the ARDA program in order that they might
get an insight into the program and the
direction of the economie rural extension and
organization o! local commîttees. I propose
to say a few words on certain parts o! the
report which I have underlîned.
The witnesses who appeared before the
committee last year were of great number, and
are listed in the report. During the four sessions that the committee met the witnesses
were requested to present briefs dealing with
basic land use and the economic and social
problems o! their respective areas. They were
also asked to discuss the institutional and
organizational aspects in their provinces, with
the idea o! encouraging local rural leadership, to stimulate rural planning and development and, in particular, the rehabffitation of
the low income areas.
The commiittee itself was particularly concerned with assuring support by rural people
in the development of these projects. The
committee felt that the major work done by
ARDA was in the promotion o! the self-help
idea o! the rural areas. Rather than pursuing
the program from the top down, it was hoped,
and it is still planned, to work front the local
level up tbrough the upper echelon on the
scientific studies o! the experts of the rural
extension group.
The briefs that; we received stressed the
need of a tremendous research program, to
make a needed survey in ail rural areas of
the value of the soil, the quality of the soil,
and the possibility o! putting the lands to
other uses. Having in mind the need for
extensive research, it is felt that another
look has to be taken at the provincial extension departmnents. The provinces have their
own extension deparients and for the most
part they are engaged largely in finding ways
to produce more of a certain product in their
areas. They are engaged in finding ways to
produce more grain and a better way to
reap more bushels per acre, rather than trying to figure out how a fariner can make a
success!ul living on a small acreage or famfly
!arm. There will also have to be a more
extensive study made by the combined forces
o! the federal technical people engaged in
agriculture and the departments of government in the provinces engaged in agriculture.

SENATE
Honourable senators, it was the intention
of the committee last session to go into the
question of incidence of taxation in the rural
areas, but as our studies were cut short in
April before we had completed our program,
that question did not get taken care of. However, the committee is planning to look into
that question this session. In this connection
we expect to have the assistance of an economic expert and the help of the Economies
Division of the Federal Department of Agriculture, working through and with the provinces, to examine this question of rural taxation in relation to income of farmers.
Mr. A. T. Davidson, director of the ARDA
program of the federal Department of Agriculture, appeared before the committee and
gave a precise outline of what he anticipates
doing. At the present time he has a small
staff, which is working through the P.F.R.A.
in western Canada. I understand that the
P.F.R.A. is being developed to undertake a
program different from that which they have
been working on in the past, and to deal with
new subjects. They are also working through
the M.M.R.A. organization in the Maritime
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Could the
honourable gentleman tell us who is the
economic expert the committee is retaining,
and something about him?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The committee is negotiating with him, and has not actually come
to an agreement with him yet. Therefore, I do
not know whether it is proper for me to disclose his name at the present time, before we
have formally engaged him.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): You are
quite right; I agree.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: One of the main problems the ARDA program runs up against is
how to increase the productivity of rural
areas, to try to overcome the disproportion of
income existing between rural areas and their
counterpart in urban areas. Of course, in the
case of some rural areas the level of the
economy is high, but in others it is considerably below that of urban areas, thus giving
such rural areas the appearance of being depressed. It has been found in certain areasfor instance, in Quebec and the eastern provinces-that many people are abandoning their
land because it does not afford an opportunity
to make a good living. One factor that was
stressed all the way through was that they
were interested more in the family farm,
and raising the income of the family farm,
than in creating larger units throughout the
country. The idea then was that the research
groups of the federal Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labour, and

their counterparts in the provinces, should
work together to try to arrive at some means
of increasing family farm income.
Honourable senators, that is all I wish to
say at this time.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Has your committee
taken into consideration the variation in profitability of individual crops from year to
year? For instance, in certain districts one
year durum would be more profitable than
red wheat, and probably in your district this
year flax is the most profitable crop. Has your
committee taken that into consideration, with
the intention of advising the rural areas what
is the best crop to grow?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I know there is quite a
variation in that respect throughout the
country, but the committee has not studied
that problem at all.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I want to add a few words to the chairman's remarks. The committee on land use
which has been functioning for the last four
years, mainly tries to ensure that the natural
resources coming from the soil be used with
the utmost efficiency by our Canadian farmers to enable them to increase farm production and income.
The committee was formed at the request
of the former Prime Minister of Canada, the
Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent who,
because he realized that people were leaving
the land and that farm income was steadily
declining, particularly in the East, wanted
this committee to examine the means which
might bring about a change.
In the few remarks I propose to make, I
shall more particularly deal with the eastern
farmers, especially those established between
the city of Quebec and the ocean, including
the Maritime farmers, that is, those in New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
First of all, I would like to rectify something. Almost every day I meet city people
who tell me that farmers are privileged
people as only some of them pay income tax.
Really, anybody who says that farmers are
lucky because they do not pay taxes must be
very unfamiliar with the farm problem.
According to the statistics of 1961, 75 per
cent of the eastern farmers in Canada have
an average income of $1,200 a year, and
when we say an average income of $1,200
this amount cannot be compared to that

DECEMBER 5, 1962

which a city worker might earn, because the
farmer's food is priced much lower than the
city dweller's.
The farmer's incomne, should we assess his
food and hîs lodging on the samne level as
that of the city employee, would be from
$300 to $400 a year. With such an incomne,
how can you expect the farmner to pay his
taxes and live decently, without hardship, on
his land? We need not be surprised if the
young people abandon the farms. It is a
tragedy and I wonder where the population
of the cities will get its food to-morrow if
the rural areas are completely deserted.
To this argument, somebody replied:
"Before long, we will find ways and means
to replace a meal with a single pili". I wonder how healthy human beings will be when
we shall have reached that stage, because
many people believe today that the high
incidence of cancer is due to, this artificia]
feeding through synthetie products. Besides,
we would deny ourselves a very legitimatE
pleasure which has its value, that of enjoying a good meal in good cornpany. It is often
arounci the table that a lot of problems are
solved.
The problem affecting the Eastern farmers
is nothing new. It goes back quite a long way.
I remember that in 1929, when I was in the
Quebec Department of Agriculture, the then
Minister o! Agriculture, the Honourable Mr.
Perron, used to say: "Agriculture today is in
a depressed state"'. Mr. Gerard Filion, in an
article of a real convincing realism published
in Le Devoir, on November 7 last, is in complete agreement. And Mr. Filion knows what
hie is talking about, for he cornes from a rural
locality and ho has been for many years secretary of the Union catholique des cultivateurs.
Agriculture has changed in the hast 30
years; so have methods of production. However, in spite of the spectacular decrease in
the number of farmers, the agricultural situation is stili more precarious that it was 30
years ago. Prices are going up everywhere.
The fariner has to pay much more than a
few years ago for everything he needs. Only
one line of products is showing little or no
increase in price-that is, agricultural coinmodities. The eastern farmer could not remain
on his farm. if it were not for the support
prices on butter, pork and eggs. If f armers'
sons abandon the farm, the reason for this is
that they get a better incomne in the factories
than they would on the farm.
* In order to be able to remain on his
farm, the farmer must develop his unit and
mechanize his means of production. Ail these

machines are terribly expensive and a great
number of farmers cannot afford this luxury
-it
is really a luxury for some of themof rnodernizing their lands. There is only
one thing lef t to do: leave the farm.
There are at present throughout the country thousands of abandoned farms for sale.
Their owners can-not find any buyers, and
they will not find any until we have solved
that disquieting problemi of the dying land.
In 1941, there were in the province of
Quebec 150,000 farnilies living on f arm incorne. Could we find 100,000 today? I doubt
it. We should not assume that the agricultural problem, will be solved with subsidies
or by printing ýpaper rnoney distributed right
and left. No. Those are artificial remedies
which may extend the life of a dying land,
but for a very short while only.
What is important, said Mr. Filion, is not
so much that we should have 150,000 or 200,000 agricultural familles in Quebec. What is
more important is the fact that those already there should live decently.
How can we solve that problem? That is
what the committee on land use should try to
solve. The solution does not rnerely consist
in telling people how to produce, but also in
telling them. how to find markets for their
products.
It is pointless to tell our eastern farmers:
"You are going to produce grain today as
cheaply as western farmers are able to". I
think that would be an illusion, because our
soil does not lend itself to grain growing on
a large scale. Now, we must find more economnical means, by water for instance, to
transport western grain to eastern Canada, at
more reasonable prices.
The Government subsidizes the transport of
western grain to eastern Canada, but it is
so costly that, even with those subsidies,
eastern farmers pay more for a bushel of
grain than European counitries.
For eastern farmers, there is, furthermore,
the problem. of the dairy industry. The
Minister of Agriculture has just warned eastern farmers to cut down their daily production, otherwise the goverrnment will be obliged
to reduce those subsidies. Now, if eastern
farmers mnust cut down further their dairy
industry, there is only one thing left for
them, and it is to leave their lands and go
out of business.
The solution, it seems to me, would be to
increase the consumption of this natural
product, this healthy product, which is vital
for ail citizens. We see and hear in the papers
as well as over the radio and television advertisements about artificially sugared soft

SENATE
drinks, in which it is said that it is enjoyable
and that it makes us think young to drink
those beverages. For my part, I believe that
with a healthy food like milk, not only could
we think young, but we could think soundly,
and our health would be improved.
The farmer, left to himself, is unable to
promote milk consumption. It seems that it
should be the responsibility of the Government authorities to undertake that campaign,
and that advertising would cost them much
less than all the subsidies at so much per
pound.
To increase production, on the eastern
farms particularly which are older and which
have been farmed for hundreds of years
before the western lands, the land which has
become acid must be improved with an addition of limestone. Formerly, the provincial
government used to pay a subsidy at so much
a ton on limestone, but in the last few
months it has been reduced.
The committee also studied the possible
change in the farming pattern of the lands
of the eastern farmers-the size of these
farms should be increased. It is impossible
today to mechanize the small farms in the
east in order to operate them at a profit. It
is going to be difficult, but even so, it seems
to be one of the means which we shall have
to resort to in order to lower the cost of
production. It will even be necessary to pay
for the relocation of certain farmers from
their farms to some other places where they
will settle. This will perhaps in effect reduce
the number of families in each community
but, as Mr. Filion said, it is better to have
50 farmers living decently on their farms
than 100 who are hungry.
In other communities it will be necessary
to plant trees, to reforest lands which should
never have been logged. It will also be necessary to consider land tax reforms, both
municipal and school, and that is not the
least of our problems. I believe that our
committee, this year, will particularly consider the problem of taxation. Besides, the
whole set-up of rural taxation must be reconsidered and reshaped. The landowner cannot be held solely responsible for municipal,
school or district debts.
As was said by the man from whom I get
almost all the core of my remarks, Mr. Gerard
Filion, "to tax the land under cultivation is
to tax a profession", then, "why burden the
farm with taxes when the worker's tool box,
the physician's bag, the lawyer's briefcase,
the lumberjack's axe, are free from municipal or school taxes".

Finally, there is also another problem that
must be studied. The farm workers-and
often those people work only for a certain
number of months during the year-cannot
draw unemployment insurance benefits. That
is another problem that keeps young people
from working on a farm. If they work in
the city during five or six months, they are
sure of getting unemployment insurance
benefits during a certain number of weeks.
But if they want to work on a farm, they
know beforehand that, when they stop working, they will be at a disadvantage-because
some people can get insurance benefits,
whereas others who have worked harder,
cannot get anything-if they stop working,
the temptation becomes too strong; they take
what impresses them most, what looks best to
them. That is another matter that will have
to be looked into.
In order to evaluate the whole problem
adequately, some senators who sit on the
Land Use Committee will have to travel
throughout Canada so as to see on the spot
what is happening and to decide how the
problem could be settled, because a number
of those farmers have suggestions to make
and want to tell us their difficulties so that
together we might try to find the right
answers.
Therefore, I suggest that one or two senators, accompanied by experts, be sent to every
province, and attempt to find a solution.
However, we shall not find that answer at
a moment's notice and thus transform the
agriculture of a whole area, because it is
not just a matter of turning on a switch;
but we shall at the same time have to rebuild
our whole farming industry.
In concluding, I shall quote the last part of
an editorial by Gerard Filion on November
7, 1962:
The alarm sounded by the farmers is
serious. Political parties must ask experts to reconsider the whole problem
of the agricultural economy in order to
offer something new instead of cure-all
solutions. It is serious, because farmers
deserve a decent standard of living. If
their requests are turned down, they
will get rid of one government after
another even if they have to fall in the
arms of quack doctors such as the Social
Crediters.

Thus the recent catastrophic appearance of

basic fact, all becomes clear. The professional
denigrator will have a hard task refuting
this statement.
The problem of predictability of this and
other forms of toxicity of drugs continues to
be subject to intense scrutiny by medical and
pharmaceutical research scientists. Thousands
are at work in consultation with the industry,
or independently, or under government or
university auspices.
Testing of drugs before they are marketed
is extremely thorough. For example, the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association in
the United States estimates that its member
firms made use of nearly nine million animals in 1961. Beyond a certain point the
testing of a drug in animals may be of little
help in determining its safety and effectiveness for man. Untoward effects in humans may
appear only after several years of use, and
adverse reactions in man may not be demonstrable in animals. As a matter of fact, Dr.
F. C. Fraser, Professor of Medical Genetics
at McGill University, Montreal, speaking recently at a seminar at Ann Arbor, Michigan,
pointed out that animal tests alone cannot
tell conclusively whether a drug will have
an adverse effect on human development. But
if research is to proceed, testing in humans
must at some point be carried out. A new
drug will be administered to humans only
when, in the opinion of the responsible physician, animal studies have indicated that the
drug may be used without undue hazard and
that it has probable usefulness in the practice
of medicine.
The first administrations of the drug to
humans are entrusted only to the hands of
highly trained and competent clinical scientists, usually in established teaching or research institutions. When these critical studies
have established that the drug may be useful
without undue hazard, general clinical trials
are initiated. These are primarily designed
to demonstrate that the drug may be used
safely and effectively in general medical practice; rare and unusual toxic effects may also
be uncovered.
Often three to five years may have elapsed
since a compound was chosen for study as
a potential drug. In the case of a lifesaving
drug, many persons will die because of its
unavailability before the end of this extended

period. This underlines the desirability of
completing the investigations without unnecessary delay.
Government scientists review all the data,
and may at their discretion suggest additional
tests. When both parties, the manufacturer
and the government, are satisfied that the
drug is safe, the new drug application becomes
effective and the drug may be distributed for
general use.
Two conclusions stand out with respect to
the safety of our drugs:
1. There are a number of complex, scientific problems about the testing of drugs that
are still unresolved, although the pharmaceutical industry and medical scientists are constantly working on these problems. Until
medical science has solved them, absolute
safety cannot be assured. It may be the nature
of biological systems that absolute safety will
never be attained. In such instances, physicians must and do weigh the possible advantages over any known or yet unknown
disadvantages.
2. Both the manufacturer and the Government now take every precaution they know
to be of value to prevent the marketing of
unsafe pharmaceutical products. Canadian
prescription drugs are as safe as practical
modern science can now make them.
Thalidomide. This drug was first conceived
as a treatment for epilepsy, but the developers
themselves discarded it for this purpose on
their own findings of ineffectiveness. It was
developed eleven years ago in Germany, and
the development process took eight years
before it was on the market, when it was used
clinically for a period of three years. It was
sought as a sleep-inducing sedative and for
this purpose it proved phenomenally successful. The research investigator in the United
States, Dr. Helen Taussig, termed it "Germany's favourite sleeping pill". Here I wish
to interject a fact: This drug had been widely
used in Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Switzerland, and it was not until
some untoward incidents occurred in Germany
that the drug was banned in the United States.
As a matter of fact, the authorities in the
United States never got around to testing it.
So let us give credit where credit is due.
Thalidomide was banned in Canada in
December 1961. All the laboratory evidence
indicated that this drug was entirely safe.
Indeed, that was one of the greatest virtues.
It was suicide proof. It was effective for the
purpose claimed. It was not until two and a
half years after the drug first was sold in
Germany that it began to be connected with
the birth of deformed infants.

SENATE
this unfortunate incident, with which the
medical profession has had to deal, but this
has been a tragic event because it has affected
the yet unborn child.
The drug industry needs some regulation.
No one questions that, but such law should
impose the very minimum regulation absolutely necessary for public health and safety.
Beyond that point we get into the realm of a
stifling bureaucracy, and the whole course of
events can be reduced to impotency. To use a
homely phrase known to every doctor and
patient, in the name of treating an ailment it
would provide a cure that is worse than the
disease.
Honourable senators, the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons, of which I have the
good fortune to be a member, was called upon
by the minister to form a committee. This
committee consisted of Dr. Dufresne, Professor
of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, Dr.
E. A. Sellers, Professor and head of the
Department of Pharmacology, University of
Toronto, and Dr. Brien of the University of
Western Ontario. They are now studying the
whole problem as to what proposals can be
added to the existing regulations.
It has been stated that the food and drug
department of the United States is a shining
example of efficiency. Recently, Congress
approved a drug bill giving the Food and
Drug Administration Department broad new
powers, and the thalidomide episode resulted
in much favourable publicity for that department. But the roof fell in. Senator Hubert
Humphrey levelled a serious and surprising
assault on the agency. He questioned its
ability to carry out the drug law effectively,
accusing it of sloppy work, lack of imagination, and failure to keep in touch with other
government health agencies. He said the FDA
approved drugs which should have been kept
off the market and kept drugs on the market
long after they have been withdrawn as
dangerous.
So I feel, honourable senators, that our
food and drug department is certainly to be
commended on the way it has carried on and
the action it has taken. This committee that
has been formed by the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons undoubtedly will
bring in most important information. They
are the experts the Government is depending
on to appear before the proposed special
committee just announced by the minister,
which is certainly indicated, as my later remarks will amply justify.
My personal opinion is that from time to
time certain compounds might require greater
control than is afforded by the Food and Drugs
Act as it now exists. Honourable senators
will recall the amendments that were made to

this act, which I had the pleasure of sponsoring in this house, in regard to the barbiturates or so-called "goofballs." Now we
are presented with another amendment. But
I believe it to be bad policy to stifle legitimate careful investigation by qualified investigators, and I sincerely trust that those who
spoke in the House of Commons will note
this statement: "A smattering of knowledge
is dangerous."
Let me say a word about the second drug,
lysergie acid diethylamide. I have a whole
text book here on the advantages of the
drug. Dr. E. A. Sellers, Professor and Head of
the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Toronto, states:
My information is that L.S.D.25 may
be a valuable therapeutic agent under
some circumstances.
However, it is used-and these are my own
words-and widely held to be most useful by
the psychiatrists, to elicit release of repressed
material and provide mental relaxation, particularly in anxiety states and obsessional
neuroses. But it should only be prescribed
for and administered to an individual in an
institution, as I have stated, and by careful
investigators and scientific research men. This
is exactly what is being done.
Dr. Lewis, Associate Professor of Psychiatry
in the Faculty of Medicine of the University
of Toronto, had this to say:
Let me say that the drug is not an
habituating danger. It is something in
which research in all parts of the world
is going ahead actively and it is a medication which brings hope to types of neurotic
and character problems, such as alcoholics, who do very poorly with any other
type of psychiatric treatment. The late
Carl Jung, the world renowned psychoanalyst, told me personally that he felt
this was an important and expanding
frontier in psychiatric research and encouraged me to continue in this work. I
would like therefore to ask you to use
your influence to permit the restricted use
of this drug by qualified scientists and
psychiatrists.
Dr. Lloyd G. Stevenson, Dean of the Faculty
of Medicine of the University of McGill,
writing in the Journal of the Canadian Medical
Association, had this to say-I shall quote
only parts of his letter:
Some of the members of the Faculty
of Medicine of McGill University have
expressed their concern over the withdrawal from the market of certain
chemical agents of considerable value
in treatment. They are of course well
aware of the current reaction to the

DECEMBER 5, 1962
thalidomide tragedy and fully share the
universal feeling that the utmost care
must be taken in authorizing new
therapeutic agents to ensure that untoward effects are kept to a minimum.
We might at the moment ask ourselves
what would have happened if the present
climate of opinion had existed when
chloroform or insulin or the arsenical
treatment of syphilis were introduced.
All three agents conferred vast benefits,
but all three of them took a toll in
occasional serious side reactions and even
in fatalities.
What is required is a sane and balanced view, and this is likely to prevail
if the public and the profession encourage government to accept the expert
advice it is now seeking and do not
subject it to the pressures of haste which
might lead to ill-considered action.
Let me illustrate my point further. I have
here a pamphlet of the proceedings of the
Mayo Clinic. In conjunction with a particular
department at that clinic and my own in St.
Michael's Hospital, Toronto, under one of
my associates, we are at the present time
investigating the use of a certain drug in
a particular form of disturbance of the internal ear. This treatment, this method of
administering the drug, is carried out under
observation within the hospital.
Before this bill becomes law, and frankly
I feel that it should, I will move to refer it
to the appropriate committee. I, too, wish to
ask some questions of the personnel of the
directorate, as I do not want qualified investigators to be hampered in their research.
It is my good fortune to sit on the Connaught Committee of the Board of Governors
of the University of Toronto. Honourable
senators know that that is one of the outstanding research institutions in the world.
The director of that institution states:
Our Food and Drugs Act does need
to be given more teeth, but I hope that
all clinical investigation will not be put
under too stringent control by the food
and drug directorate,-it contains many
fine persons, but they do not know all
about everything and never will.
I am sure that my medical colleagues in
this house, Senator Gershaw and Senator
McGrand, will join me in supporting that
statement.
I have a suggestion to make-I do not
propose to put it on the record now, but
I will do so at the committee meeting-as to
how we could save the Government thousands of dollars in this particular aspect. We

have in Canada today leading research institutions. We also have in the various universities, particularly those mentioned and
some others, outstanding departments of
pharmacology. When a questionable drug
comes into the country, we have all the
facilities at our disposal to investigate it.
For example, such a drug could be sent to
the pharmacological department of the University of Western Ontario for investigation.
Why is it necessary to duplicate this service
when the available scientific men in this field
are already in these institutions. I leave that
for honourable senators to ponder on.
We have had a great influx of drugs from
Europe. Honourable senators will probably
remember having read in the press about the
Lederle Company of New York having had
a patent stolen from it by a drug company
in Italy. The consequences of that were very
serious. The drug manufacturers of this
continent have done everything they possibly
could to enhance their reputation.
As a member of the editorial board of one
of the leading scientific medical journals of
the United States, I have just recently been
provided with a brief abstract of the
latest information relating to the thalidomide
episode.
Phocomelia studies uncover "negatives".
A group of German scientists in studying the
negative cases of phocomelia-those in which
the mother of a malformed child is not known
to have taken thalidomide.
It is of interest to note that Gunter Grupp,
PhD., Associate Professor of Pharmacology
at the Cincinnati University College of Medicine, visited fourteen German medical centres
during August and September, and reported
that in all places where the patients had been
carefully studied there were always more
than 25 per cent in which thalidomide could
not be found in the history. He said he had
interested five German physicians who had
been active in studying thalidomide in making
a joint study of the negative cases. Some
German experts, Dr. Grupp said, believe that
the negative cases must have taken the drug
unknowingly, while others feel that the number of such cases shows that thalidomide is
not the only cause.
There have been other recent developments: The British Medical publication Lancet
carried a report from Dr. Tadashi Kajii of
the Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan, estimating
that 700 babies with phocomelia have been
born in Japan since 1961.
Dr. H. W. von Schrader, Scientific Director
of the International Division of Chemie
Grunenthal, the German firm which first

SENATE
distributed thalidomide, after studying reports
from eight countries concluded that:
1. There are children with extremital deformities whose mothers took thalidomide
during early pregnancy. The assumption of
an association is thus justified.
2. There are normal children whose mothers
had taken thalidomide during the critical
period.
3. There are children with extremital deformities whose mothers have definitely taken
no thalidomide. The majority of investigators
assess these cases at up to 50 per cent.
4. As long as the high percentage has not
been explained, and the decrease of the extremital deformities is not yet certain, the
term "thalidomide embryopathy" for the
phocomelia or amelia syndrome seems unjustified.
R. W. Smithells, MB, consultant pediatrician, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, England, reported in Lancet on a study
of cases in Liverpool that the previously
reported association between thalidomide and
ectromelia is confirmed, but this drug appears
to have been responsible for less than half
the cases.
One further word about drugs, the so-called
idiosyncrasies of drugs. Some people can take
aspirin, others cannot. The injection of a
hypodermic which is supposed to be of a
sedative nature before a major operation can
produce the very opposite effect. But, if it were
not for the scientific clinical investigation of
these drugs, the great boon to mankind of
the so-called "miracle" drugs would never
have occurred.
This very earpiece I have in my ear is
made of a substance which is supposed to be
non-allergic, yet I have seen many a patient
who bas suffered the most diffuse and widespread allergic reaction from this very material, in spite of the fact that these patients
:are tested first for such a sensitivity.
Let me interject here a thought on exactly
what I mean-and, frankly, I am supposed to
know something about this particular subject.
The honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
'(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), speaking last week, said
that he knew something about the criminal
law. Rightly so, but he should have left out
the word "something". Science is not the
"be all and end all" of life. You may know
something about the sun, the atmosphere, the
rotation of the earth, education, law, or medicine, but you do not know everything. What
I am trying to say is that there is no such
body as a "know it all". A question was
asked by an erudite individual-who pretends
to speak with a degree of infallibility about
everything in this country-as to what planning there was in order to take action in

respect of drugs said to be effective in the
treatment of cholesterol. My answer is: I am
very glad that I have cholesterol in my
bloodstream.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to be
facetious or sarcastic; that is not my way of
life; far from it. I speak on a subject I know
something about, not on something that I am
letting on to others I know something about
and in fact know nothing about it. To substantiate this remark, Dr. Fraser Mustard, Research Associate of the Department of Medicine of the University of Toronto states, "We
know very little about the true action of cholesterol." I advise people with a family history
of heart disease to consult their physician before trying to modify their own diet.
Honourable senators, before completing
these remarks, I should like to give you a
typical example of a hypothetical case of the
idiosyncrasies of drugs. Suppose the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croîl) came to me and I decided, with his concurrence, that I had to operate on him. He
might casually ask, "Doctor, can you guarantee this procedure?" My answer would be,
"There are only two things in life that we
can guarantee-taxes and death." And in
operating on him I could assure him of one
of those conclusive endings. Beside that point,
if he were administered an antibiotic and a
certain type of antiseptic to prepare the operative field-a careful history pertaining to
all these matters, having been taken beforehand-he still might develop an untoward
reaction to both these substances, what is
commonly known as severe penicillin reaction or a local reaction to a drug. We cannot
foretell that, but there is the odd possibility
that it could develop. Now that is a simple
explanation.
The two drugs mentioned in this bill could
act in comparable ways. They have been a
wonderful boon to psychiatrists, and under
proper control they will continue in like manner, with a limitation on thalidomide that it
must not be given to pre-menopausal women
or pregnant women. That is the safeguard.
The trouble is that the patient takes a drug
on prescription, and instead of taking one
capsule, as directed, she insists on taking two,
three or four to overcome early vomiting in
pregnancy.
At this very moment, as I speak to you,
there is being developed a possible cure for
malaria and muscular dystrophy by means of
new drugs.
If I may project this word of advice: Do
not take any drug or medicine unless your
physician has prescribed it-and this includes
sedatives, tranquilizers, pain-killers, or any

DECEMBER 5, 1962
kind of medicine which you read about in the
press or see on television, even though you
can buy it without a prescription.
Finally, with a background of over thirty
years of medical teaching and research, I do
not hold the Government responsible for this
most unfortunate affair. As a matter of fact,
I think the department acted well. It is only
the so-called group of "do-gooders", the
"crocodile tear" individuals and the like who
would think otherwise, in order that they
might gain some political advantage.
Who else could summarize this whole problem better than the immortal bard Shakespeare? What a mind he must have had. I
quote from Henry IV, Part II:
There is a history in all men's lives,
Figuring the nature of the times deceased;
The which observed, a man may
prophesy,
With a near aim, of the main chance
of things
As yet not come to life, whieh in their
seeds
And weak beginnings lie intreasured.
I highly commend the new legislation to
honourable senators, and if second reading is
approved, I shall move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Health
:and Welfare.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
at this time may I express our welcome to
the new senator from Kenora-Rainy River
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and congratulate him on
his appointment. The people of Medicine Hat
are very pleased that he gives the name of
that historic city as his birthplace.
The sponsor of the bill now before us
has given a complete, factual and definitive
explanation of the measure. He bas told us
something of the tragedies, the sadness and
the hopelessness of parents who find their
child deformed from any cause, and particularly from a cause which might have
been avoided. He is a surgeon of note who
has brought fame to Canada in the international field, and we in the Senate are bon-oured by having him with us.
I venture to follow the honourable gentleman because I have had some contact with
the drug thalidomide, which was on the
market in Canada from April until November, 1961, and although I prescribed it from
time to time, I am very thankful that it
reached no person in the pre-menopausal
period or during pregnancy. That brings us
to the question as to why certain drugs are
prescribed for certain conditions.
Every doctor has textbooks on his shelf
which indicate the use of drugs, the dosages
to be prescribed and so on, but, unfortunately,

new editions of these books do not come out
frequently. Every doctor reads professional
magazines containing whole pages of advertisements of drugs, and in addition every
doctor receives numerous samples of drugs
from drug houses who are very generous in
sending them out in large quantities, nicely
packaged and looking as if they would be
pleasant to take, together with instructions
for their use, their side effects, dangers, and
other information of that nature. The bill
presently before the house will stop such
distribution to a considerable extent. That is
to say, such samples will no longer be sent
out in such quantities, but will only be
available to a doctor on his written request.
As has been indicated, every doctor deplores the widespread use of the tranquilizing
drugs. Every doctor tries to persuade his
patients not to use any of these drugs, explaining that they are habit-forming and
so on; but when a patient comes to a doctor,
sick with worry, anxiety, fatigue, fright and
sleeplessness, the use of some of these drugs
may be necessary at least for a time.
Thalidomide, in certain cases, seemed to me
to be the ideal drug. It is a sedative, without
being toxic, and people who take sleeping
drugs in great quantities hoping never to
wake up again, could not achieve this effect
with thalidomide because persons have taken
it to the extent of as much as 140 times the
average dose and have lived quite happily
to tell the tale. In addition, thalidomide does
not cause a hangover-this is not a scientific
term, but it is most expressive-and it does
not depress the heart or respiration. It gives
sleep and rest. Nevertheless, no one will
question the wisdom of its withdrawal from
the market.
As has been said, deformities may occur
from many causes, but there is ample evidence
to show that thalidomide is guilty in this
respect and that it certainly should be withdrawn from the market.
The next drug I have in mind is lysergic
acid diethylamide which, although found to
be dangerous in that it causes some departure from normal mental standards in the form
of mental confusion and fantasies, is a splendid drug for treating certain forms of addiction to narcotic drugs and alcohol. However,
the minister has indicated that under certain
conditions its use in institutions may still be
permitted.
Another drug that comes to mind is preludin which has been used very generally
and which, although it is not being withdrawn by this bill, has now come under suspicion. It is a drug which diminishes the
appetite, and is helpful to people who are
desirous of slimming or reducing weight; if

SENATE
taken before a meal, then they are not particularly hungry and dieting becomes easy.
In Norway and Sweden two other drugs
have been banned altogether. From this it
would appear that people generally are alive
to the dangers of some of these drugs; however, it is to be hoped that they will not
become panicky because if they do so, and
are unwilling to use any drugs at all, they
will be denying themselves the comfort and
the helpful effects of many of the new drugs.
No one regrets the appalling tragedies that
these particular drugs have caused more than
do the medical profession and the drug
houses. The drug houses have spent millions
of dollars in building up huge laboratories,
and employing the best scientists available
to develop these drugs to the best advantage.
When these firms learned that in addition to
causing a little tingling of the fingers, and
some neuritis, this drug was dangerous for
pregnant women, they sent two of their scientists to Germany to get the details, and the
factual information reached them on November 30. Then, between the second and fifth
days of December they sent a letter to every
Canadian doctor to inform him of the danger
of this particular drug. Most of the drug
houses are ethical and desirous of producing
drugs that are pure and wholesome. Therefore, it is to be hoped that the pendulum
against drugs will not swing too far.
Penicillin, insulin, chloroform, and arsenical preparations have in the past proved to
be wonderful drugs in the saving and prolonging of life and bringing happiness to
those who needed them. They have had some
undesirable side effects, and even with these
drugs some fatalities have occurred, but still
they have proved a great blessing to mankind. Such names as Banting, Best, Fleming
and a host of others will live forever because
they have, through their accomplishments in
this field, given their names to preparations
which have been of great benefit in the past
and will continue to be so to future generations.
Research is not easy, and understanding
and favourable consideration should be given
to those engaged in it. It is tedious work.
There are many disappointments. There are
always new difficulties to be overcome, and
the work is tiring and wearing.
For instance, with respect to the arsenical
preparations, thousands were produced before
those engaged in the work found the one that
was synthesized, 606, was the most effective. It is estimated that there are about
3,000 preparations made on every project
before the final drug is chosen.
The research people deserve a great deal
of credit. They work long hours and give

their whole heart and soul to the work they
are doing, and they do their work in the
hope of finding something that will be of
great benefit to society.
If you talk to these people about the trail
they must tread in their work of research,
you might ask these questions and receive
these answers:
Does the path lead uphill all the way?
Yes, to the very end.
Does the work last through the whole
of the livelong day?
From morn to night, my friend.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McGrand, debate
adjourned.
SONS OF FREEDOM DOUKHOBORS IN
CANADA
WITHDRAWAL OF MOTION TO APPOINT
SPECIAL COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 22, the debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Croll:
That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to inquire into and report
upon the continuing problems presented
by the Sons of Freedom Doukhobors in
Canada and any problems related thereto;
That this said committee be composed
of twenty honourable senators to be
named later;
That the committee be empowered to
send for persons, papers and records; and
That the committee be instructed to
report to the house from time to time its
findings, together with such recommendations as it may see fit to make.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, may I be allowed to say that it is
always a great privilege to listen to the informative speeches of our learned colleagues,
Senator Sullivan and Senator Gershaw. Both
are authorities in their field, and besides that
they have broad general knowledge.
I am also glad to join Senator Gershaw in
welcoming and congratulating our new colleague, Senator Robertson. He must have considered it an honour to be appointed to the
Senate, and an honour also to have been congratulated, as he was a moment ago, by
Senator Gershaw.
I have a rather difficult task in dealing with
the Doukhobors-and I undertake it seriously
-because of the excellent speeches that have
been made on the matter by several of our
colleagues. They have expressed their views
very clearly.
In the first place, honourable Senator Croll,
who moved this motion, explained the difficulties which have been caused by the behaviour of the Sons of Freedom, a group

DECEMBER 5, 1962
which comprises about 1,200 Doukhobors who
have no respect for the law.
In order to be informed personally about
the belief s and activities of the Doukhobors
1 went to my own source of information, the
Encyclopaedici Britannica. I have had two
pages of this work copied, and have sent
copies to His Honour the Speaker and to the
honourable leaders of both parties ini this
house. 1 have here two further copies which
I will give to Senator Croli and to Senator
Roebuck. 1 thank those concerned for providing me with these copies.
What is the trouble with these people? It is
explained in this extract frorn the Encyclopaedia Britannica, from which I wiil quote a
f ew sentences:
Doukhobors, a name given by the Russian Orthodox clergy to a comrnunity of
nonconformist peasants. The word sign-ifies "spirit-fighters," and was intended by
the priesthood to convey that they fight
agaînst the Spirit of God . . . they...
eall thernselves "Christians of the Universai Brotherhood."
According to their belief, their church is
where two or three are gathered together
united in the name of Christ. They pray inwardly and they greet each other fraternaily
with low bows, thereby acknowledging every
man as a bearer of the Divine Spirit. There is
a sentence or two that I might read from the
extract. I do flot want to put too much on
Hansard.
They found alike their mutual relations
and their relations to other people and
to ail living creatures exclusively on love,
and therefore they hold ail people equal
and brethren. They extend this idea of
equality also to the government authorities, obedience to, whom they do not consider binding upon them in those cases
where the demands of these authorities
are in conffict with their conscience; while
in ail that does not infringe what they
regard as the will of God they willingly
fulfil the desire of the authorities.
Now, honourable senators, note this:
They consider kiiling, violence, and
in general ail relations to living beings
not based on love as opposed to their
conscience and to the will of God. . .In
many ways they have a close resemblance to the Quakers.
If you are interested in the matter, honourable senators, I wiil tell you that titis
is copied from. the best edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, the edition of 1910,
and has been reproduced in the latest edition with -another paragraph added, which
gives the history of Doukhobors in Canada:

Most of the difficulty the federal and
provincial governments had with the
Doukhobors was with a third group, the
Sons of Freedom, who broke away from
Verigin early in the l9th century and
numbered about 4,500 in the mid-1950s.
Their methods of protest inciuded parading in the nucle, bombing the Canaclian
Pacific railway, burning houses (not only
those of the orthodox Doukhobors but
their own to show conternpt for worldly
goods), and burning schools. Most of the
Doukhobors dropped their opposition to
compulsory education, and some even
abandoned their pacifist position to the
extent of serving in the Canadian army
,in World War II.
The Sons of Freedom, on the other
hand, refused even to serve in conscientîous objector camps, and continued opposition to compulsory education. From.
1932 to 1935 more than 500 Sons of Freedom were imprisoned on Piers Island,
B.C., after conviction for indecent exposure, arson and defiance of the government. Doukhobors in British Columbia
were disenfranchised by the federal governinent in 1934, the province having
taken similar action earlier. Attempts to
reconcile the Doukhobor groups and to
discourage the methods of protest of the
Sons of Freedom failed. Arrests and convictions of them continued in the 1950's.
My honourable friend, Senator Croil,
speaks of human rights and fundamentai
freedoms. I will not insist upon it, because
I do flot believe in it-some day I will
establish to you that there lias neyer been
fundamental freedom, even under this roof
of Pariament. However, I have not the Urne
to do that today; I wiil do it on another
occasion, to satisfy ail your eagerness to
learn about it, if you have any eagerness in
that regard.
Honourable Senator Pearson, the second
gentleman, who spoke, made a speech which
King Solomon would not have disowned. He
said there were some good Doukhobors and
there were some bad Doukhobors-this we
know. In that respect, he said that one
should try persuasion with them. I do not
believe that he would have mucli success.
That was established clearly by our honourable colleague, Senator Tomn Reid, who complained of ail the damage done by the Doukhobors and of the indecent exposure by the
women.
By the way, during the last federal election
campaign, there was an exhibition of women
in surmmery clothes, and without them, bef ore -a gentleman who laughed. He was riglit
to laugh, because lie must have had in mind
that that is the state ia which children deserve correction in the right place. It was

SENATE
a ridiculous incident, and the only thing to
do was laugh. However, that could not go
on indefinitely. Senator Reid's speech is a
formidable indictment of these people, and
it merits special attention.
There was also the eloquent speech of
the honourable Senator Horner of Blaine
Lake who, I hope, will soon recover. He made
a most interesting speech, which was short
but to the point. He was inclined to share the
views expressed by Senator Reid.
Then we come to our genial friend, the
honourable Senator Roebuck, who supported
the bill and thought that the Doukhobors
should be converted to abide by the law.
That is very doubtful. Although he made the
best possible case for them, I regret I cannot share his views.
Then there was my neighbour, the honourable Senator Cameron. By the way, the former appellation "the honourable Senator from
Banff" was abolished yesterday, and I have
the satisfaction of calling each one of my
colleagues by the best names, their own.
Senator Cameron read a letter from Mr. Bonner, the Attorney-General of British Columbia, who is very happy about the action of
the Senate and approves the motion. This is
a good reason to be against it. The fact is
that the attorney general of British Columbia,
who is responsible for maintaining order and
who, according to the Constitution, has the
obligation to enforce the law there, praises
the Senate for doing his job and assuming
his responsibility. That is positive nonsense. I
think Mr. Bonner is completely deprived of
any sense of humour.
Honourable senators, before reaching a conclusion, which I hope will be considered
happy, I should like to refer to what was
done recently by the Acting Chief Justice of
the Superior Court of the province of Quebec,
Honourable Mr. Justice Dorion, who sat as a
member of Parliament for many years. I think
this case should be mentioned. It was the
case of four soldiers, probably under the
influence of dope, who had ill-treated-I will
not go into the details-the mother of several
children. The soldiers had abused her in many
ways and even burned her body with cigarette butts. It was one of the worst offences
one could think of. When those four drunken
soldiers-bums-were in the box before the
Acting Chief Justice of Quebec, he told them
he regretted such an offence was no longer
punishable by death, as they deserved death;
and he condemned them to 85 years of imprisonment, and the whip, a very sound
judgment.
It is time to stop undue leniency and complacency with regard to those who have no
respect for law. That is my view. We have a
book which contains laws which have been

studied by both Houses of Parliament as
well as by committees of Parliament and enacted in order to maintain order in this
country. I remember Mr. Guthrie, a tall and
impressive man. When as Minister of Justice he had to answer a question, he would
say, "This is the law"-and then the Minister
of Justice had spoken.
What is the use of having a Criminal Code
if nobody pays any attention to it? With regard to the committee which studied the
Criminal Code amendments dealing with
capital murder, I told the Minister of Justice
that I disagreed completely with that kind
of legislation, but on the other hand, I congratulated him for the appointment of good
judges.
I believe there are good judges on the
bench in Canada, men who are conscientious
and who are anxious that the law should be
respected by all, so that women can go out
on the street without being molested by purse
snatchers or by scoundrels who would attack
them. Such offenders should be punished as
provided for in the Criminal Code. They
should be put in prison and whipped. That is
what Mr. Justice Dorion has done, and done
very well, and he deserves to be congratulated. That is not all. There should be no
commutation of sentence.
We have reached a time when the psychiatrists are above the Criminal Code, and
when an atrocious crime is committed there
is more sympathy for the offender than for
the victim. It is always that way. The victim
is dead; the parents, we do not hear of them
any more, and the poor offender has to be
punished. It is so sad. Let us shed tears-the
tears of a crocodile, as Senator Sullivan said
a moment ago.
Honourable senators, it is time to have
order restored in this country, and order will
be restored inasmuch as the attorneys general
who have the responsibility for the administration of justice in each province do their
duty, and inasmuch as the Government is
not meek when cases of this kind come before them.
The sentences imposed by Mr. Justice Dorion
upon four such offenders were very severe,
but they were well deserved. He condemned
one accused of twenty years of age to twentyfive years in the penitentiary, and to be
whipped eight times on two occasions. To
another one, also aged twenty years, twentytwo years in the penitentiary, to be whipped
six times on two occasions. The third one,
twenty years of age, twenty years in the
penitentiary, to be whipped six times on two
occasions. The remaining one, twenty six
years of age, twenty years in the penitentiary,

DECEMBER 5, 1962
to be whipped six times. It was not pleasurable, and I am sure that the judge was very
sorry to have to apply the law, but he did
so for the protection of Canadian women and
everyone else in this country, to set an
example. That case will serve as an example if we do not read in the papers in
one year from now that those sentences have
been commuted to ten years, and then the
year after that those men have been released
on parole.
This is not a pleasurable speech that I
make now, but it is my duty as a senator of
Canada to say to my colleagues what I think
of the situation and what all those who know
about it think of it.
To come back to the Doukhobors, why are
they allowed to run around destroying
bridges, bombing communities and all that,
without any action being taken by the Government and by the attorneys general of
the provinces where they commit those outrages? The law is there, and is to be observed
for the protection of us and all our fellow
citizens. It is a most unpleasant subject to
deal with, but it bas to be done and I have
done it under the authority of a good
judge, the Acting Chief Justice of the Superior Court of my province.
Now to conclude-and my conclusion will
surprise you. I have a note here of what I
said one day in the Senate, that psychiatrists
were a plague to humanity. It is on record
in Hansard, and I am not going to repeat it.
Here I have two envelopes addressed in
my own hand. They contain the copies of
Hansard with speeches delivered in this
chamber by the honourable Senators Croll,
Reid, Horner, Pearson, Roebuck, and Cameron. The envelopes are not closed, and I
will add the Hansard of today. One envelope is addressed to the Honourable Robert
W. Bonner, Q.C., Attorney-General, Victoria,
British Columbia. The other is addressed to
the Honourable Donald M. Fleming, Q.C.,
M.P., Minister of Justice. What I want you
to understand, honourable senators, is that
the speeches referred to form a case-a
factum.
Honourable senators, there is the pro and
con of the Doukhobor infringements and obstructions to the law. It is much better to
inform the Government of British Columbia
and its Minister of Justice of the work that
has been performed by our colleagues in
order to elucidate that matter and to induce
the Attorney-General of that province to first
accomplish his duty by giving an opportunity
to the courts of his province to decide whether
or not the Doukhobors are guilty of any
offence. If he is unable to deal with this
matter, and if the Government of British
Columbia is unable to deal with it, let

Premier Bennett get in touch with the federal
Government and ask for its assistance. That
is all. We have nothing more to do.
It was most kind and generous on the part
of our colleagues who have spoken on this
vital matter to have taken the trouble
to do research and study. All that must be
useful. The Senate has accomplished its
duty. Let the Government of British Columbia now do its duty.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Croll realizes
that if he speaks now he will have the effect
of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, may I
first thank my deskmate, Honourable Senator
Roebuck, for seconding the resolution that I
presented to this house. I am not going to
name all the senators who participated in the
debate. Honourable Senator Pouliot did that
for me. I thank everyone for participating,
and for those who agreed with me particularly
I give high marks. I had hoped when I introduced the resolution that an unbiased Senate
committee would take a new look at this
Freedomite problem.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I would
hope that all Senate committees are unbiased.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am merely describing the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I do not
think there should be a suggestion that some
Senate committees are biased.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I did not make the suggestion; that is what you are reading into it. I
thought that perhaps eastern eyes could see
something new, something that would carry
with it a real hope, that some of us would
take a fresh look at this problem.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Do you think eastern eyes
are better?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I don't know. It is worth a
try, because you people of the west who have
been looking at it for a long time have not
done too well. You keep referring to it as a
Doukhobor problem whereas, as a matter of
fact, it is a Canadian problem about Doukhobors. I thought that history and events, as the
record would indicate, proved that repression
will not pay.
You will remember when I first spoke I
made reference to a by-law that was passed
by the municipality of Kent. I did not say
much about it except to bring it to your attention at that time because it was under review
by the court, but I would remind you about

SENATE
it now when we talk about these lawless
Doukhobors and Freedomites. I do not want
to be misunderstood.
Kent municipality passed a by-law that prevented the Freedomites from entering their
area, and the police immediately put up a
road block. Now, whatever we may think of
Freedomites, their right to use the public
highway is unquestioned. Although the municipality gave the reason that it expected a
breach of public order, that is neither a legal
one nor a moral excuse because the principle
that I asserted a few minutes ago is unassailable.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is what the court
f ound.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, and I will come to
that. If the municipality had been permitted

(Bedford): Who

Hon. Mr. Croll: The lawful activities of
anyone wanting to travel the highway. There
was no breach, there was no suggestion of a
breach, it was an anticipated breach.
The Attorney-General of British Columbia
did not hold with the by-law. He refused to
enforce it and spoke out publicly about it.
He was criticized publicly, yet he was right.
For that be is entitled to commendation.
When the bylaw was passed the Freedomites
behaved themselves, they respected it, they
did not ignore it. In spite of the fact that the
municipality was acting illegally and had
been so advised, and the Attorney-General
of the province of British Columbia would not
support the by-law, they abided by it. The
matter went to the Supreme Court of British
Columbia and Mr. Justice Norman Whittaker
declared the by-law invalid as being discriminatory. It was only then that some of the
Freedomites moved on.
You have heard the discussion today and
contributions made by senators on other occasions.
This is not an easy problem, and there is no
easy solution. These people are clinging to
ingrained ideas, and from their actions one
would almost think they courted martyrdom.
If you are ever going to try to understand
the problem, this is the time to do it.
My honourable friend, Senator Pouliot, told
you today, in reading from the Encyclopedia
Britannica-asI indicated to you on a previous
occasion-that these people were originally
pacifists. Suddenly we find that they have become dynamiters. Why? Surely, we can ask
ourselves: Cannot that process be reversed,

and cannot we find what caused the change?
The Doukhobors in this country are assimilating slowly.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask what their
conduct was in Russia before they came here?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I might remind the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) that I covered that ground thoroughly
when I originally spoke. They found life most
uncomfortable there, and, as a result of the
way in which they were repressed in Russia
under the Czar, public opinion was aroused
in Europe, and particularly among men of
goodwill who were Quakers in the United
States and Great Britain. They went to the
highest authority in Great Britain and asked
if they would not approach the Canadian Government for the purpose of giving these people
a fresh opportunity in life. I am told that
the British Government did approach the
Canadian Government, and in its generosity it
said: Yes, we are willing to do this, subject
to certain conditions.
I did not gloss over these facts. I placed
them on record when I first spoke on this
matter, and I am not here excusing the lawlessness. They have been tried before the
courts, they have been sentenced, and I have
not attempted to excuse them for what they
have done. I am trying to understand them
and to determine what makes them tick that
way. That is the problem. It is easy enough
to hit them over the head, but that does not
settle any problems. I repeat, the Doukhobors
in this country are assimilating. I think the
answer is that in some way we have to reduce
the violence, not by repression but by an intelligent, informed approach, and at the sarne
time doing everything we possibly can to bring
about their complete assimilation. Social
workers can do much more than the police
in these circumstances.
We read about their plight in the press.
Here are 1,300 persons living in conditions
that, it is said, could not be any worse. I
have in my hand a report from Hope, British
Columbia, dated November 30:
A medical health officer has warned that
frozen water and sewer pipes will force
Sons of Freedom Doukhobors out of their
camp and added that there is danger of
disease, fire and death ...
A number of elderly Freedomites live
in a bake house and use only small
camp stoves for heat.
These are Canadians living under those
conditions.
Each time one mentions the Freedomite
problem everyone wants to wash their hands
of it, and everyone ducks. At times one
would think I am the only one who has
not enough sense to duck.

DECEMBER 5, 1962
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): Why
are they living under those conditions in
British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Croll: British Columbia is the
best place in Canada, according toHon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): May
I ask why they are living under those
conditions?
Hon. Mr. Croll: My friend asks, why are
they living under those conditions?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): Perhaps some of it is their own fault.
Hon. Mr. Farris: They are burning their
own houses.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, they are burning their
own houses; they have made mischief for
themselves. However, that does not absolve
us completely from trying to help them in
one way or another to avoid further mischief in that respect.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Would you like to
build them new houses and give them more
matches?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I think that they should
be fed if they are hungry; that clothing
should be given them if they need it; and
that they should have shelter too.

Not only was it raining, but the underground lawn sprinklers were turned on
in front of the buildings. The Doukhobors
had threatened to camp on the lawns
until they got action from the Provincial
Government.
I quote further:
In a statement released after the brief
meeting, Premier W. A. C. Bennett said

the next leader of the Conservative party in
British Columbia, so it is of Mr. Bennett's

Bennett has now made this a political issue

in that sort of political climate.

SUMMARY

This report is a summary of the briefs presented to the Special Committee of the Senate
on Land Use in Canada during the last session of Parliament. The objective of the Committee was to stimulate and promote the
initiative and interest of administrators and
local groups in the ARDA program, to get an
insight into the progress and direction of economic development proposals in the provinces,
and to study the critical role of rural extension and the organization of local area committees in the furtherance of this program.
The briefs were directed to this end. Some of
the highlights of the proceedings are noted
here.
Preliminary plans and proposals under the
ARDA program were presented to the Committee. Cost-sharing federal-provincial projects envisaged putting some rural lands to
more productive use as well as soil and water
conservation programs and general rural economic development. These are being incorporated into a three-year federal policy program. Some of the projects are viewed as
pilot.
Witnesses from two provinces that have
made a start on rural development programs
stressed the need for detailed research and
study in long-range planning; vocational agricultural training and training to upgrade the
skills of farm people for off-farm jobs; development of soil and water resources through
ARDA to facilitate efficient agricultural production and rural industrialization; and
switching of submarginal cropland to more
appropriate alternative uses such as grazing,
forestry and recreation. The organization of
local area committees was viewed as essential
for sustained economic development of rural
resources.
The availability of more farm credit and
more technical information including farm
business management for farmers was urged
to enable the efficient operation of economic
units. To this end a rural development fund,
which would especially apply in high risk
marginal areas, was proposed by a rural settlement society.
The role of the extension service and the
individual extension worker was viewed as
critical to the success of the ARDA program.
It was believed that a new kind of rural
development extension agent with a background in agriculture, trained in organization of community activities and group dynamics, ability to motivate and stimulate local
leadership and action was needed. He should
be backed by specialists with technical knowledge of resource use in agriculture and other
industries to help rural residents organize and
carry out the kinds of improvement projects
which they desire.

Wednesday, December 5, 1962
The Special Committee of the Senate on
Land Use in Canada make their second report
as follows:
The Committee presents herewith a summary of the proceedings held during the last
session, i.e., the Fifth Session, 24th Parliament, 1962.
I. ORDER OF REFERENCE

The following resolution was adopted on
February 7, 1962, by the Senate:
"That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to consider and report on land
use in Canada and what should be done to
ensure that our land resources are most effectively utilized for the benefit of the Canadian
economy and the Canadian people, and, in
particular, to increase agricultural production
and the incomes of those engaged in it;
That the Committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Basha, Bois, Boucher,
Buchanan, Cameron, Crerar, Emerson, Gladstone, Higgins, Hollett, Horner, Inman, Leonard, MacDonald, McDonald, McGrand, Methot,
Molson, Pearson, Power, Smith (Kamloops),
Smith (Queens-Shelburne), Stambaugh, Taylor (Norfolk), Taylor (Westmorland), Turgeon,
Vaillancourt, Veniot, Wall and White;
That the Committee have power to engage
the services of such counsel and technical and
clerical personnel as may be necessary for
the purpose of the inquiry;
That the Committee have power to send for
persons, papers, and records, to sit 'during sittings and adjournments of the Senate, and to
report from time to time;
That the evidence taken on the subject during the six preceding sessions be referred to
the Committee."
A Steering Committee was appointed as follows: Honourable Senators Pearson, Stambaugh, Smith (Kamloops), Taylor (Westmorland), Taylor (Norfolk), and Vaillancourt.
Senator A. M. Pearson and Senator C.
Vaillancourt were appointed chairman and
vice-chairman, respectively.
II. COMMITTEE PROCEDURE

During the session a total of five meetings
were held and eight witnesses were heard.
There were 130 pages of evidence presented
to your Committee.
The Committee directed and focussed its
efforts towards the attainiment of public interest and attention on the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Development Act, hereinafter
called ARDA, by acting as a forum. Witnesses
were requested to present briefs dealing with
the basic land use, economic and social problems of their area, the institutional and
organizational aspects involved in fostering

SENATE
local rural leadership and initiative, the stimulation of rural planning and development,
and, in particular, the rehabilitation of low
income areas. This course of action was taken
with the view of assisting the Federal Government in starting the ARDA program
through the free expression of improvement
needs and proposals. The Committee was
particularly concerned with the matter of
ensuring the support and participation of
rural citizens in the development of projects
desired and needed by the people themselves.
This is a very real extension problem and
critical to the success of the Program in the
long run. Your Committee feels that it can
take much credit in placing the need for a
rural resources development program before
the federal Government and can provide a
service by following up on the action phase
of the Program. The briefs were, therefore,
devoted to a review of the organization and
initial development stages of the ARDA program and its joint relationships in alternative
land use, rural development and soil and
water conservation activities with the provinces. Further briefs concerned the preparations of two provinces, one in Western Canada
and the other in the Maritime Provinces, for
co-ordinated and joint federal-provincial projects; the experience of a rural settlement
organization; and the theoretical considerations pertaining to extension or educational
principles and administrative responsibilities
or implications with respect to ARDA of a
professional extension organization.
It was the intention of your Committee to
call witnesses to describe the state and incidence of rural taxation in different parts of
the country. This subject was recommended
in the last report of the Committee (see proceedings No. 11, June 28, 1961-recommendation No. 5 (b)) as one of six specific problem
areas singled out for research and study by
the Committee. It was planned that the witnesses would outline the principles of rural
taxation and assessments, the systems in use,
the problems of inequity, the burden on real
property and other problem phases of rural
taxation. This would be preliminary to the
conduct of basic research by technical persons employed by your Committee. This part
of the agenda was not, however, undertaken.
The activities of your Committee in this
session were largely confined to the promotion
and maintenance of interest in the ARDA
program in all its phases and ramifications.
No recommendations were made by your
Committee at this time. It is the hope of your
Committee that the circulation of the proceedings will serve the purposes it had in mind
of stimulation and motivation. The following
sections present the highlights of the information submitted by the witnesses.

III. A PROGRESS REPORT OF THE EARLY
STAGES OF THE ARDA PROGRAM

An oral submission was presented to your
Committee by the Director of the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Development Act,
who had only been in office slightly over two
months. He pointed out that the various kinds
of programs and projects possible under the
terms of the Act must be carried out jointly
between the federal and provincial governments through specific project agreements.
The actual physical arrangements of projects
may be carried out jointly or the federal Government may co-operate only through the
provision of financial assistance. There is one
area of activity provided in the Act in which
joint federal-provincial financial cost-sharing
is an exception and not mandatory. The federal Government may conduct research
strictly on its own as well as on a joint basis
with the provinces.
It was explained that exploratory and informal meetings had been held with representatives of the provinces for the purpose of
clarifying the objectives and basic aims of the
legislation and to develop the policy on a joint
co-operative basis in line with needs and desires of each government level. In most cases
the provinces have already set up interdepartmental co-ordinating committees concerned with the kinds of projects possible
under the legislation. Keen interest on behalf
of the provinces was noted and a large number of projects and programs were proposed
for consideration and agreement under the
Act.
Project Proposals
With the help of these federal-provincial
administrative discussions and the submissions of the provinces, a federal policy statement on the application of the ARDA program
within the next two or three years was being
drawn up.
The kinds of projects proposed by the provinces were:
(a) Section 2 of the Act-alternative use
of land-in terms of maintaining land in some
appropriate use, not idle or permitting abandonment
(1) projects to establish association, group
or community pastures on lands considered
to be submarginal or marginal for cultivation
(2) projects to establish pastures on individual farmer-owned marginal cropland
(3) projects to acquire marginal or other
related lands for forestry purposes-provincial crown forests, municipal forests, county
forests or other public forestry management
areas

DECEMBER 5, 1962
(4) projects to acquire marginal lands for
assembly to lease to adjacent farmers for
forestry purposes and promote establishment
of diversified economic forest farm units
(5) projects for the acquisition and planting to trees of lands that are designated as
marginal or submarginal agricultural lands
(6) projects to assist in the establishment
and maintenance of farm woodlots, including
assistance in planting, thinnings, access trails
to woodlots, management, planning and other
woodlot extension services
(7) projects to acquire marginal lands for
recreational needs, particularly in areas close
to large urban centres
(8) projects to acquire marginal lands for
public shooting areas, wildlife management
areas or to lease or acquire easements on such
lands from farm owners for public use
(b) Section 4 of the Act-soil and water
conservation of good agricultural lands
(1) projects for the drainage of good arable
farm lands
(2) projects for the protection of such lands
from flooding, including dykes, main ditching
systems, stream improvement, flood control
dams
(3) projects for the supply of water for
agricultural purposes, including water storage, dams and dugouts
(4) projects for shelter belts and other such
soil erosion control measures
(5) projects for stone removal on good
arable land, also grassing and terracing to
prevent erosion
(6) projects to maintain water levels for
stability of agricultural production and related flood control, wildlife and recreational
purposes
(7) projects to provide for engineering
studies, cost-benefit studies or other studies
related to projects proposed in this section of
the Act
(c) Section 3 of the Act-rural development
(1) projects to establish rural development
areas
(2) projects for pilot area studies
(i) studies of present land use and land
capability for various purposes
(ii) studies of resource use or resource
development opportunities for increasing income
(iii) studies of soil and water conservation
project needs
(iv) rural sociological studies
(v) agricultural economic studies including
marketing, employment, labor, underemployment and vocational training needs
(vi) studies of off-farm employment and
industrial development opportunities.
27511-5-26

Some of the provinces suggested the above
kinds of intensive pilot studies in rural development areas where low incomes are
prevalent and in which local committees
would be set up. The results of these studies
will be presented to local committees in such
a way as to be understood in devising appropriate projects to improve employment
and income opportunities and living standards. It is hoped that blueprints or proposals
for development of the particular area will
emerge from the deliberations of these committees.
Through technical and financial facilities
co-ordinated through ARDA, programs for the
better use of land and improvement in use
of good agricultural land by soil and water
conservation measures will be applied. Technical and financial assistance will be focussed
on local areas through an integrated attack
on local economic development.
Organization and Co-ordination
A relatively small headquarters staff of
ARDA was planned to direct, organize and
co-ordinate the various existing agencies at
the federal and provincial government levels.
An interdepartmental co-ordinating committee at the federal level is planned to function
at two levels, (1) at the Deputy Minister
level to consider broad policy matters, and
(2) at a senior officer working level to consider and appraise provincial program and
project proposals and to advise on project
execution.
It has been proposed that the P.F.R.A. organization in Western Canada and the
M.M.R.A. organization in the Maritime Provinces form the operating arm of ARDA to
deal with negotiations and joint inspection,
and to carry out joint federal-provincial projects. At the time of the hearing there was
considerable indication that they were taking
an active interest in the development of the
ARDA program. Under the terms of the Act
the lines of communication with local areas
and committees will be through the provincial
co-ordinating body or its agents.
IV. ARDA-TYPE RURAL RESOURCE PROGRAMS
IN TWO PROVINCES
(a) Rural Development Approach in Manitoba
The Rural Development Specialist for the
Manitoba Department of Agriculture and
Conservation dealt with ways and means of
promoting positive thinking and action with
respect to rural development in general and
ARDA in particular in this Province. He
considered that there were two broad approaches to rural development. The first of
these was the liberal provision of capital in
order to develop what really amounted to a
completely new resource. The second alternative was a "bootstrap" approach whereby

SENATE
people are given assistance, primarily technical, in order to develop their resources. This
is the basic extension philosophy of helping
people to help themselves.
The general public is generally inclined to
view a program, such as ARDA, as of the
first type while public administrators tend to
regard government assistance as technical
help only. The types of programs to be
developed under ARDA were suggested as
falling between the two extreme categories.
In addition to the provision of more technical
assistance, development capital is needed. This
development capital should not be government handouts in the form of a series of stop
gap programs but rather funds for planned
long range development of the resources at
hand.
In dealing with rural development, it is
unrealistic to try and solve the economic
problems in a narrow setting of relatively
small marginal or submarginal areas. These
areas should be considered as a part of a
larger region including other areas with more
resources, often non-agricultural, capable of
development. Economic development can no
longer be attained in terms of primary resources of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, etc.
The utilization of these resources must be
related to industrial development to permit
wider employment and income opportunities.
Organization of an Interdepartmental Committee in 1961
An interdepartmental committee was set up
in 1961 in Manitoba under the direction and
guidance of the Minister of Agriculture to
formulate a list of proposed ARDA projects.
Two sub-categories composed of research
and investigation projects and physical projects were proposed in each of the major
categories of alternative land use, rural
development and soil and water conservation.
Emphasis on Research
Since ARDA is primarily a long range,
fundamental program a great deal of detailed
information is required. Thus research projects in such fields as soil surveys, farm
ownership, rural sociology and hydrology are
needed to develop multiple use programs. A
considerable amount of research work was at
hand in these fields and the provincial committee felt able to propose action on several
physical works, including a land purchase
program in certain marginal areas, reorganization of certain currently marginal agricultural
land into more effective agricultural use
including livestock and expansion of the
community pasture program. The provincial
committee recognized a basic problem of
underemployment in agriculture especially in

the marginal areas, and proposed an educational program in one area to retrain some of
the people for non-farm employment.
To prepare the people in local rural areas
for participation in the ARDA program, a one
week course for 25 rural leaders was held to
acquaint them with the details of the ARDA
program, the general philosophy of rural
development, and the application and implications on local community development. In one
area an advisory committee of five local
residents and five governmental representatives of major resource fields has been set up
and is working toward the maximization of a
long range program based on involvement of
all local people.
Rural Development Through Industry, Business and Tourist Expansion
The activities of the regional development
program under the Provincial Department of
Industry and Commerce were described by
the Director. This body has the broad objective of securing the proper development of
the physical and human resources to provide
the needs of the people through productive
measures to put permanency and stability into
the regional economy.
The concept of the regional development
program in this province is consistent with
the community development approach employed in the United States through the Rural
Areas Development and the Area Redevelopment Administration Programs of the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, respectively. It also has similarity to the concepts
of rural development which are implied in
Section 3 of the Canadian ARDA Act. It is
believed that the prime way to help in the
development of rural and urban areas of the
Province is through the introduction of secondary manufacturing and processing industries, business developments and tourism
and recreation. The program is premised upon
the initiation of self-help at the local level
supplemented where feasible by government
assistance per se in the role of a development
promotion agency to interest out-of-province
investors to establish in the Province. It
depends upon close interdepartmental cooperation and partnership with local development agencies for economic progress and
social improvement.
The first major step in the program to
stimulate and assist regional development is
the preparation by expert consultants employed by the Government of a broad economic inventory and analysis of human and
physical resources of a region. It concerns the

for economic growth, and particularly opportunities for industrial expansion in the
broadest sense. The development opportunities recommended in these economic surveys
involve agriculture, forestry, industry, business and tourism.
Local Development Organizations
The organization set up to enlist the cooperation of the people in the region is responsible for carrying the program forward.
Conferences and workshops are held to present the facts of the economic survey, to give
the local people an opportunity to present
their views as to the development potentialities and to stimulate local leadership. This is
followed by the completion of an evaluation
form by the community. Four types of community surveys are used and are referred to
as community data, drawing power, industrial
impact, and industrial location. These are
valuable and useful tools in promoting, stimulating and assisting industrial development.
Three kinds of local development organizations are found throughout the Province.
Under the Companies Act as amended in 1958,
community development corporations or
quasi-public bodies can be formed to act as
local development agencies. They are a formal
and legal framework through which municipal
leaders, farmers and businessmen can work
together to solve common problems and assist
in the initiation of industrial projects. In addition to their functions to publicize industrial
opportunities, stimulate business and industrial expansion, provide information and make
business contacts, the most important role is
the power to raise funds to assist industrial
establishment. This latter power has been employed recently in a number of cases to provide buildings for an industry, usually under
a lease-purchase arrangement. The second
kind of local development organization includes a chamber of commerce or a board of
trade. Recently other organizations have been
established, which are unincorporated, under
the name of Civic Affairs or Development
Committees. If these latter two bodies are
successful in stimulating interest in retail or
service commercial activities or tourist attraction or any kind of local development
project, then a corporate body, as outlined
above, is established. The third kind of local
development organization which has grown up
of late is an area development association.
These associations are of a regional nature
and include representatives from a relatively
large number of rural and urban municipalities. They are comparable with area committees as envisaged under ARDA with
various study sub-committees such as beef,
swine, dairy, sheep, grain, special crops, allied

agricultural industries, credit, linear programming and public information. Other nonagricultural committees include forestry, recreation, employment, and vocational training.
An important agency with respect to growth
of industries and tourist facilities is the Provincial Development Fund. Its purpose is to
provide financial assistance to new and existing manufacturing industries, tourist and recreational facilities and to community development corporations. While the source of funds
of this agency is the provincial government,
it is administered by an independent board of
directors. It does not compete with banks or
other private lending institutions but rather
supplements their activities.
Another service of the Regional Development Branch is a town and rural planning
service which provides technical information
to municipalities and works directly with local
planning commissions. This body helps local
people to assess the community problems and
formulate future plans for action to assure the
best possible overall development of the area.
The experience in area economic development has met with far greater success when
an effective development group has been set
up. The common needs of every class of
people in a community in terms of employment, industrial development, more income,
municipal services, new development capital
at the farm, processing and service industry
level simplify the task of drawing the various
segments of the community together through
co-operative effort.
The Relationship of ARDA to the Provincial
Regional Development Program
The relationship of ARDA to the regional
development program is viewed as complementing each other and meshing perfectly. A
major part of ARDA is concerned with the
development, adjustment and use of natural
and human resources upon which rural industrialization depends. Rural industrialization in an agriculturally-oriented province can
be built upon a framework of raw agricultural
products, adequate water supplies and underemployed farm people. The efforts of the
Regional Development Branch are compatible
with the economic and social aspirations of
rural communities which can be aided and
abetted further through ARDA. A key point
with respect to assistance to local development committees is the provision of a sort of
rural development specialist or regional coordinator, with experience in local involvement and motivation, access to technical
knowledge of local resource use in agriculture and other industries, and ability to stimulate gainful employment in those kinds of
production demanded by a maturing economy.

SENATE
(b) Rural Development Launching Steps in
Prince Edward Island
The early phases of the rural and community development program was outlined in
a brief presented by the Director of Research
of the Prince Edward Island Department of
Industry and Natural Resources. The program became effective on January 1, 1961 and
the launching steps were relatively simple.
These were, (1) analysis of the physical economic and social conditions of the normal
and natural regional boundaries coinciding
with the existing regional high school areas
centering on a key centre, (2) selection of a
sponsoring group in each area, and (3) preparation of a list of institutions, organizations
and leaders in agricultural, business and civic
affairs active in each area. Invitations were
sent to leaders and representatives of the area
organizations to attend a meeting at which
the overall provincial program was discussed.
An opinion survey was then used to obtain
some community and personal attitudes followed by a declaration of program agreement
and support of the local participants.
Those attending the meeting were asked to
pursue a study course, to take part in an
area-wide survey of physical and human resources, and to serve on one of 18 different
sub-committees in such fields as agriculture,
fisheries, recreation, tourism, education, public health, small business, new industry, rural
beautification, etc. Out of 150 people co-operating in the study course, 130 were graduated
at a formal ceremony and about 70 per cent
agreed to carry out all three steps. The remaining group were asked to bring an additional person to a group meeting at which
the survey was initiated. The prime purpose
of this survey was to investigate the physical
and human resources mainly in terms of ideas,
aspirations, hopes and needs; kinds of talents
and skills; employment opportunities; training requirements. The survey returns justified
the belief that people in local rural areas
have worthwhile thoughts and ideas for the
improvement and development of the local
economy. The intent is to derive and set
reasonable, sensible and practical long and
short-range goals, specific fields of community
activity and even to suggest project priorities.
Those in charge of the provincial resources
development program have catalogued the
provincial and federal technical experts from
which scientific and technical knowledge and
skills might be sought and made available
to local groups. In this context and with respect to the ARDA program it was emphasized, first, that complete co-ordination of
technical assistance between federal departments was essential as well as an understanding between the provincial and federal departments on the availability of technical

people, and second, local and provincial groups
were encouraged to refrain from appealing
for financial assistance from the federal
treasury only after every other possibility of
local effort has been exhausted, or in the
case of worthwhile projects when no known
local solution exists.
After the provincial program got underway
a forty-four man provincial development
council was formed representing virtually
every economic and social strata of the
Province. Their duty is to counsel, to guide
and direct the program.
Suggested rural development guidelines
Several guidelines were suggested with regard to the administration of the Agricultural
Rehabilitation and Development Act. These
were as follows:
(1) community and area development calls
for a broad and carefully planned adult education effort. All development problems are
basically a matter of adult education or extension concern.
(2) the rural development phases of ARDA
are so broad and so varied that operations at
first should be instituted on a pilot basis.
(3) the availability of federal technical help
should be given very careful consideration.
The creation of a federal extension service
embracing field men and women with a background in agriculture and trained in organization, group dynamics and community action
was believed to be essential by the witneses.
(4) a nationwide training program should
be launched through the use of materials,
radio, television and newspapers.
(5) an urgent need for information on mechanics and operational plans of ARDA pertaining to kinds of specific projects and
methods of determination and lines of communication.
V. THE EXPERIENCE OF A RURAL SETTLEMENT
ORGANIZATION

A brief was presented to the Committee
outlining the principles of Catholic social doctrine that a rural settlement organization is
attempting to put into practical application.
This rural settlement organization, La Société
Canadienne d'Etablissement Rural, resulted
from study sessions held by a group of priests,
laymen and sociologists in 1946, who held
that some organization was needed to coordinate efforts to improve conditions in rural
agricultural areas. The organization which
emerged was composed of representatives of
regional rural settlement societies, rural settlement credit unions, diocesan colonization
societies, rural youth movements, agricultural

DECEMBER 5, 1962
associations and rural leaders. It carries on a
program of disseminating information on
rural life, of stimulating farm leadership and
of inciting the development of a few pilot
projects.
Reference was made to the position of the
Catholic Church as outlined in the Encyclical
issued by the Pope dealing with current rural
problems. The problems of depressed economic sectors such as in agriculture, and of
"underdeveloped regions such as are found
not only from country to country but also
within individual countries" constitute an important part of this Encyclical.

Retention of the Family Farm Concept Urged
The retention of the belief in a closely-knit
family-type farm was urged in this brief.
The extension of this ideal situation to a
'community of persons' involving a number
of farm units with a common interest and
relationship was also proposed. This phenomenon of grouped individual family farms
was carried further through reference to
agricultural co-operatives, and it was suggested that this type of structure offered a
more definite guarantee for the survival of
the family farm than other forms of organization.

The Fundamental Problem in Rural Areas
The fundamental problem with regard to
agriculture as a depressed sector of the
economy was expressed as follows, first, how
to proceed in order to reduce the relative disproportion in productive efficiency between
the agricultural industry and the rest of the
economy, secondly what to do to raise the
level of living of the rural farm population to
that attained by city dwellers, and thirdly,
how to assure that farmers can assert and develop their personalities and look to the future with confidence.
In light of the above conceptual problems,
it was pointed out that the Senate Land Use
Committee had demonstrated the necessity of
renewing the local economies of the depressed or underdeveloped rural regions across
Canada. Essential agreement was expressed
as to the basic tenets of the ARDA program.
With respect to the federal legislation embodied in the Agricultural Rehabilitation and
Development Act, a view was expressed in
the brief that the rehabilitation and development aspects should first take into account the
physical, social and economic conditions of
individual regions and the resultant projects
be formulated and carried out on a regional
level. This view meshes with the concept of
the Senate Land Use Committee to utilize
the conimunity development approach entailing the tripartite collaboration of the local
units of government, the municipalities, as
well as the federal and provincial governments. The basic question is, what do rural
people want their government to do rather
than, what the government should do to or
for rural people?
Concern was expressed over the apparent
unawareness -and lack of the role of conservation in rural renewal programs by Canadians. The Societe supported a program of
basic research, including social and demographic research, which would precede the
launching of pilot projects and the fostering,
encouragement and training of local leaders
to the full extent of facilities in Canada.

Need for more farm credit and technical
information
Methods in agriculture are changing rapidly. Mechanization compels farmers to
modernize involving increased investment.
This underlines the need for more farm credit
and more technical knowhow. More research
in the area of farm management was urged
as well as other related areas of estate management and family transfer arrangements.
In these respects your Committee strongly
concurs.
Based on the resettlement experience of
farm families both as individual units and
as a group, the Société considered that
present-day credit facilities were inadequate
to satisfy the needs in the high risk marginal
areas and suggested that ARDA should set
up a rural development fund. This fund
should first provide guarantees for the basic
investment of private capital in the form of
bonds or debentures to stimulate private investment, and secondly, provide interest
rebates on farm loans for settlement, development and improvement, as in the case of
Quebec Farm Loans Act, and provide government-approved and community processing
plants for agricultural and forest products.
The establishment of local action cooperatives composed of all organizations,
groups, businesses and local units of government in each church diocese was urged. This
organization would put into practice the
recommendations resulting from the research
and planning groups. The experience of La
Société in fostering these developments suggests that if the two types of organization
maintain close liaison, excellent co-ordination
should result. This parent organization acts
in the role of a co-ordinating and liaison
agency between corresponding organizations
in different parts of the country.
The publication of a loose-leaf Atlas of
Rural Canada was recommended, which
would contain precise scientific, social and
economic data. These data should be made
available to all concerned and constantly kept
up to date.

EXTENSION PRINCIPLES AND ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ARDA

Three members of a professional organization, The Canadian Society of Rural Extension, having the objective of advancing the
standards of research and education in rural
extension in Canada and of encouraging professional improvement among extension workers, presented a brief to the Committee.
The first part of the brief included comments on the Agricultural Rehabilitation and
Development Act and referred to it as a sound
and timely program which provided a new
focus and hope for the development of rural
communities and introduced a co-operative
approach to resource development among the
different tiers of Government.

and administrative implications of extension
to the ARDA program.
Extension Staff Requirements of ARDA
It was felt by the three witnesses of this
professional organization that the assignment
of additional duties of the ARDA program
to the present provincial extension staffs
was impossible with the current schedule of
work. Two requirements must be met to
implement the extension activities needed by
ARDA, first, additional extension staff, and
second, a concerted effort to upgrade the
training of the present extension staff. All
federal assistance to extension should be
extended through the present provincial services. A strong plea was made by one of the
witnesses for the provision of federal financial assistance for the training of extension
personnel, community leaders and farmers
along with other carefully-planned research
and program projects. This would be the best
means of achieving the objective of better
rural living.
All which is respectfully submitted.
Arthur M. Pearson,
Chairman.

delegations for the 1962 meeting. They visited
Canada shortly after the general election
held in June last. Only one of the officers of
the federal branch of the C.P.A. had survived
that election. This situation was responsible
for a serious delay in organizing the Canadian delegation, as little or nothing could
be donc until after the opening of the
Twenty-Fifth Parliament on September 27.
Our delegation had to leave Ottawa on
October 11, allowing only a two-week period
for the selection and briefing of delegates.
However, remarkable progress was made
under difficult circumstances. The Department of Health rendered valuable assistance
to delegates in the matter of necessary
inoculations, and the Department of External
Affairs furnished briefings on all pertinent
subjects. Splendid work was also done by
the Canadian High Commissioner for Nigeria
and the members of his staff, who met us on
our arrival at Lagos and gave us excellent
support throughout the five weeks we spent
in Nigeria.
There were 14 members of the Canadian
delegation, six delegates in the federal group
and eight representing eight provincial associations. The federal group was composed
of Senator E. E. Fournier from New Brunswick and myself, representing the Senate, and
four members of the House of Commons, one
from each of the four parties in the house.
Dr. Hugh M. Horner, M.P. for Jasper-Edson
led the Canadian delegation, and Mr. Harold
Winch from Vancouver East was secretary.
There was a total of 135 delegates representing nearly all the countries of the Commonwealth, and according to established custom there were two "associate" delegations
representing the United States of America and
the Irish Republic. The American delegation
consisted of Senator Keating of New York,
Senator Williams of New Jersey and Senator
Burdick of North Dakota. The Republic of
Ireland was represented by Messrs. James J.
Burke and Sean Flanagan, members of parliament of the republic.
The American senators, accompanied by an
imposing secretarial staff, flew into Lagos on
November 8, and attended our sessions on
November 9 and 10. They contributed most
interesting addresses on subjects related to
Commonwealth-United States relations.
The Canadian delegation of fourteen was
one of the three larger groups, the other two
representing the United Kingdom and Australia. The United Kingdom group consisted
of the Right Honourable Charles Hill, M.P.,
the Right Honourable A. Creech Jones, M.P.,
the Right Honourable Sir John VaughanMorgan, M.P., and a number of other distinguished members of the Parliament of

Westminster. The Australian delegation included a number of veterans who had attended
many former C.P.A. conferences. That was a
characteristic of many of the delegations. I
believe that fully one-half of all delegates had
the benefit of having attended former conferences.
At this point, honourable senators, I should
like to respectfully suggest that honourable
members of this house would do well by
Canada and the Commonwealth if they would
take a keener and more active part in the
affairs of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association. Such interest would do much to
prevent a repetition of what occurred this
year, when our branch was rendered almost
impotent by the result of the general election.
In spite of the many handicaps from which
we suffered, I can say with justifiable pride
that Canada made her presence felt, and we
took second place to no other group at the
conference.
We had the sad experience of losing one of
our number through the untimely death of
Mr. S. S. Hessian, M.L.A. for Prince Edward
Island, who was a delegate representing the
provincial C.P.A. in that province. Mr. Hessian
was taken ill shortly after his arrival in Lagos,
and passed away in hospital there on November 5. A funeral service was held in Lagos
before the remains were flown back to Canada. There was a large attendance from the
delegations, headed by the general chairman,
the Honourable Raymond A. Njoku, and from
the Canadian High Commissioner's Office in
Nigeria, headed by the High Commissioner,
Mr. T. L. Carter. Some Canadian businessmen
who were in Nigeria for the International
Trade Fair also paid their respects to the
memory of Mr. Hessian who had the distinction of being a member of the legislature of his
native province since he was first elected in
1919.
Time will not permit me to review in detail
the many subjects discussed during our ten
formal sessions and a great many informal
ones, but I think honourable senators will
be interested in the fact that the European
Economic Community, or the Common Market
as it is familiarly known, held undisputed
first place in the discussions. And no doubt
you will be equally interested to know that
after much discussion, in which fully 90 per
cent of all delegates participated and voiced
their fears and speculations on the possible
result of Great Britain's joining the Common
Market, the final conclusion was that this
is a matter that the United Kingdom must
decide for herself, without too much interference or pressure. I can also say without
reservation that most of the speakers expressed the opinion that Great Britain would

DECEMBER 6, 1962
eventually become a member of the European
Economic Community. Furthermore, it was
the general opinion that, if and when she
did become a member, the fears held by some
members of the Commonwealth would likely
be dissipated in the many advantages which
may be enjoyed directly by the United Kingdom and indirectly by the Commonwealth.
The next important major issue discussed
was the matter of "aIignment" and/or "nonalignment" of newly-formed independent Commonwealth countries-that is, alignment or
non-alignment with the western world, or Free
World. There was a definite indication in
some of the speeches of a tendency on the
part of some of the newer Commonwealth
countries to play "both ends against the
middle" in the matter of foreign aid. The
India-China trouble broke during our meetings. As a matter of interest, all but two of
the Indian delegates left the conference for
India, at the request of their Government. I
have a feeling that the recent experience in
India has been a potent lesson to some other
countries. I think they will take a more
serious interest in who their friends should be.
I cannot conclude my report on the formal
sessions without making reference to an attitude indicated by certain delegates representing some of the newer African countries, an
attitude that was definitely anti-British. It
seems to me that some of these people are
still fighting for their freedom. This is no
doubt a carryover from colonial days and is
quite explainable by students of Africa; but
I think we should take heed of these rumblings and grumblings, for they provide a
seedbed for subversive activities. I am not
being critical of the countries I refer to, and
I certainly do not wish to cause them any
offence; but I do feel that, in the best interests
of the Commonwealth, including of course the
African members of our Commonwealth
family, we should recognize the danger we
are facing and, furthermore, we shouId try
to do something about it.
I cannot give you the picture better
than by referring to what I saw at the
International Trade Fair, which was held
in Lagos, a city of over half a million people,
the federal capital of Nigeria. Over 70 countries participated. An important breakdown
of the exhibits and their sponsors would be
to separate those representative of the Free
World from those representing the communist
world. The latter exhibits were of the prestige
or propaganda type, as compared with those
of the Free World countries, which were intended to build trade. I am going to use, as

distinct examples of the two techniques, the
exhibits of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and those of Canada.
I wish to tell you first that the Canadian
exhibit was somewhat below par, for the
reason that Canada put on what is known
as a "solo" industrial fair in Lagos in the
month of January 1962. The January show
was strictly an independent effort on the
part of Canada; and no doubt it had a very
special value, in that it was not in competition
with 70 other countries. Having participated
in the January project, Canadian exhibitors to a large extent contented themselves with just a token effort in November.
Nevertheless, Canada's show, as I saw it, was
strictly a merchandising effort to sell goods,
while the U.S.S.R. effort was to sell a
philosophy.
To begin with, the U.S.S.R. building was
most attractive from the outside and the interior was very cleverly and lavishly laid
out. Immediately in front of you, as you
entered the building, was the capsule in which
the Russian astronaut made the first trip into
space. It was the centre of a very impressive
display that was designed to sell the visitors
high-level scientific advancement in Russia.
The background was a huge poster-type sign
with a dove of peace in the centre and a
monotonous repetition of the words "Peace,
Unity, Freedom, Equality, Fraternity, Happiness." At the opposite end of the building
there was another huge poster-type sign carrying the following words, which I made a
note of on the spot. I quote:
The Soviet Union's main economic task
is to create the material and technical
basis of Communism within twenty
years.
I was told that the Russians had a staff of
nearly one hundred persons engaged in handing out booklets and sets of picture postcards
of Russian astronauts, and answering questions. The most significant thing about the
show was that most of the assistants were
native Africans, dressed in native dress. Another feature that could not escape my notice
was the huge crowd that was jammed into
the building, and every time an attendant
showed up with an armful of literature the
crowd pushed forward with outstretched
hands, shouting for the literature.
I learned that this U.S.S.R. propaganda
machine is working incessantly throughout
Africa. During my visit to various regions of
Nigeria, I made it a point to meet new people
-people not associated with our visit. I met
a large number of businessmen who had been
in Africa for a long time and who were
acquainted with all parts of the continent.
There was the chap from New Jersey who

SENATE
has been sales manager for the Cluett, Peabody Company in Africa for eleven years. He
was glad to talk to me, for he sold shirts and
pyjamas made in Kitchener, Ontario. There
was the superintendent for a world famous
pharmaceutical firm. There was a distributor
for Massey-Ferguson tractors and farm machinery. There was a district manager for
Unilever Corporation. There were scores of
teachers, missionaries, doctors and men engaged in other fields. From all sources, I got
a composite picture of the battle that is raging between the two great world philosophies
for the rich prize that is Africa. I could not
help feeling that we were losing out in that
battle.
As I see it, there are two kinds of aid going
into the new African countries. There is, on
the one hand, the money, the credit and the
skills that are going into creating an image of
grandeur. There is every evidence of an urge
to catch up, and even to surpass, older countries. Nigeria got independence on October 1,
1960-26 months ago last Saturday. There are
modern skyscrapers, all the way up to 24
storeys high, being erected in each of the
larger cities. There are legislative buildings,
apartment blocks for members of legislative
assemblies and for members of parliament,
and mansions for ministers. There are university campuses, ultra-modern prestige
hotels, a Royal Nigerian navy and many other
developments that tend to give the people a
long-awaited satisfaction and a feeling of independence and confidence. There are two
kinds of aid going into new African countries.
First, there is the aid that makes possible
this prestige program; the other kind is the
technical aid that is assisting the people to
help themselves. They are engaged in a battle
against poverty, disease, illiteracy and corruption. Their greatest hope to beat poverty is
to provide a higher standard of living. Most
of the African countries are well adapted to
agriculture, but they could do with vast improvements in techniques in cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, seed selection and
improvements in stock breeding. This is a
field in which Canada could give aid beyond
estimated value.
Their battle against disease is one in which
they can use a lot of assistance. For a population of over 40 million, Nigeria has about
80 doctors, one for each half-million of population. I visited many hospitals. One, in
Ibadan, the ancient slave capital of Africa, is
quite a new super-modern hospital connected
with the university. They have beautiful
buildings, situated on beautiful grounds, and
fine modern homes for the staff. There is an
outpatient department where from 700 to 800
people call every day. There is one doctor and

one nurse to take care of them. They see
about 300 a day; the rest go away, to come
back if they are able.
I visited another hospital in the city of
Jos, the tin mining centre in Northern Nigeria.
This is an older hospital where they are short
of room, short of equipment and doctors.
Eighty per cent of the nurses are native
male nurses who got some training in the
British army. The outpatient department here
has about 600 patients a day. There is one
doctor and one nurse to take care of as many
as they can see after looking after two wards
in the hospital. So the battle against disease
is another field in which Canada can render
aid with a value that cannot be estimated
in dollars.
The people of Nigeria are making great
headway in their fight against illiteracy.
Native children are apt pupils and keen for
education. We can be very proud of the aid
that Canada is giving in the field of education.
We met many Canadian teachers who are
doing a great work in training native boys
and girls to be teachers and in preparation
for administration jobs in the government
service.
Canada is presently engaged in a iand
survey and mapping program at a cost of
something in the order of 1i million. This.
survey is giving Nigeria the first accurate
maps of the country and will be a great aid
in the Niger River Dam project. We met
many Canadians who are engaged in this
work. A Mr. Turner of British Columbia is
in charge of the survey, and the mapping
consultant is Major Sid Dadson of Ottawa.
The fourth battle in which they are engaged
is that against corruption. In a new country,
with new-found financial aid, it is natural
to find opportunists, entrepreneurs, promoters
and slickers of many varieties, seeking an
opportunity to cash in. Some of these are
natives, many are not. The regional government of Western Nigeria was placed in suspension, and the administration is in charge of
an official administrator while an exhaustive
investigation is being conducted. It is hoped
that by the end of the year the old government will be reinstated or that an election
wilI be called for a new government to replace
the old.
While we were there a sensational treason
trial was begun against a group of twentyseven men who had occupied high places in
government. A very significant thing about
the investigation and trial was the unbridled
publicity given to all the sordid details in
the press of the nation.
The conference proper was preceded by
a tour of three regions or provinces that

DECEMBER 6, 1962
make up the Federation of Nigeria. This
proved to be a most valuable feature of the
conference. It provided a very interesting
and educational opportunity to learn a great
deal about Nigeria and its people. It also
provided an excellent opportunity for the delegates to get acquainted with one another,
which facilitated the work of the conference.
It would take much more time than I care
to devote to give a detailed report of the
tour, so I will conclude my report with a
few brief highlights.
The Federation of Nigeria is the largest
and most populated country in Africa. It is
made up of three regions or provinces and
the independent capital district of Lagos. It
has a population of about 42 million, of
which only 28,000 are white. It is a part of
West Africa and has an area of 340,000
square miles-about 20,000 square miles
smaller than our province of British Columbia. It lies between the Sahara Desert in
the north and the Atlantic seaboard in the
south. Its climate varies from the dryness
of the northern desert to a hot, tropical,
forest belt in the south that is only about
four degrees north of the equator. The Niger
river and its main tributary, the Benue, form
a "Y" which divides the country into the
three regional areas. The Niger is one of the
longest rivers in the world, about 2,600 miles.
There is a project in the making for a large
dam on the upper Niger which will supply
power and water for irrigation.
The ninth Commonwealth Parliamentary
Conference will be held next year in the
new Federation of Malaya. Its chairman will
be the Honourable Data Haji Mohamed
Noah Bin Omar, S.P.M.J., D.P.M.B., Speaker
of the House of Representatives, Federation
cf Malaya.
Dr. Horner, M.P., Leader of the Canadian
delegation, at the last business session of the
eighth conference, extended an invitation to
the association to hold its 1967 conference
in Canada. The invitation was acknowledged and will be considered by the General
Council of the association in due time.
All of which, honourable senators, is respectfully submitted.

Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine, P.C. in the Chair.
Hon. George S. White, Joint Chairman of
the Committee, moved that the report be
adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, I would point
out that under section 3 of the Library of

Parliament Act, Revised Statutes of Canada,
chapter 166, the direction and control of the
Library of Parliament and of the officers and
servants connected therewith is vested in the
Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of
the House of Commons for the time being,
assisted during each session by a joint committee to be appointed by the two houses.
As honourable senators are aware, under
the Civil Service Act passed at the last session
of Parliament the officers and employees of
the Library of Parliament are no longer under
the control and subject to the provisions of
the Civil Service Act.
The two reclassifications and the two promotions which are dealt with in this report
were brought before the Treasury Board in
April of this year, having been approved by
the then two Speakers of Parliament. However, the Treasury Board pointed out that the

senators, may I be permitted to add a word
to what the Chairman of the Joint Committee has said with respect to this report.
I have been interested in the work of the
Library since I have been a member of this
chamber but, unfortunately, I was away from
Ottawa on the day the last meeting was
held.
However, I should like to say, particularly
with reference to these salary increases, that
I think the Library of Parliament can be
identified with that branch of the service
which has received less attention in the way
of salary increases than any other branch
of the civil service employed in this building.
I have had the pleasure of fairly intimate
contact with the Library and know something
about the efficiency with which that
organization is conducted and the services
it renders to members of both houses when
they are disposed to use them. The present
Librarian is doing everything that he possibly
can do to make that fact known to Members
of Parliament, with the result that there
has been a noticeable increase, I think, in
the attendance of members of Parliament in
the Library in search of information and

DECEMBER 6, 1962
data relating to the legislation that comes
before them in the other place. I would
suggest as well that as much interest as
possible might be promoted from this chamber in the affairs of the Parliamentary
Library, because it has been reorganized in
a far-reaching way since the National Library
has taken form and is being established in
the near future in new quarters. The Parliamentary Library is now truly a Parliamentary
Library, unencumbered by detective stories
and a good many other novels that inveigled
our members into fields of romance in days
gone by.
I should like to approve the report and
to suggest very definitely that we have a
good library and a good staff, one which I
think is worthy of our continuous interest and
support.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I am not a member of the committee,
much less, indeed, its chairman, but I think
that one of us who are not especially interested in the committee may possibly be
heard in commendation of the service we
ordinary citizens, and not those in the inner
circle of the committee itself, receive from
the staff of the Library. Particularly, I should
like to mention the service I have personally
received from Mr. Spicer, the new Parliamentary Librarian. That service was impressed upon me most strongly when during
the recess the Librarian sent me a new
book on the history of divorce in the United
States. It was quite a lengthy book and a
good one, and I read it in its entirety. The
fact that he noted I might be interested in
a certain book and sent it to me on his own
initiative impressed me.
I have gone to the Library frequently,
looking for books on the law and other subjects, and have received the most courteous
and devoted attention of every officer who
has attended to me. I think I should acknowledge such service publicly.
Report adopted.
The Hon. the Speaker resumed the Chair.
FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed frorn Wednesday,
November 28, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, for the second
reading of Bill S-3, to make provision for the
disclosure of information in respect of finance
charges.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators-

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I should point out that if the honourable
sponsor of the bill speaks now it will have
the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, in
rising to close the debate on second reading
of this bill I must first say that the debate
has been an excellent one. I may be forgiven
for expressing satisfaction at the measure of
support which the principle of this bill
appears to have received from all sides of the
house. I do not propose to speak at length,
although I have a few things I feel should
be said.
I believe the time bas come when the bill
should be referred to committee for consideration. The mischiefs contemplated in this
bill are not only nation-wide, but are continuing and increasing almost in geometric
progression, as I have demonstrated statistically. It is my view that we should not
defer action any longer.
In so saying, I am not unaware that opposition to this bill has once again been expressed
by the honourable Senator Hayden, though
I understood him to say that he would not
attempt to prevent the bill going to committee. I have met head on, and in great
detail on several occasions-more particularly
in closing the debate on the second reading
of the comparable bill last session-what
may be termed the standard arguments put
forward by the honourable Senator Hayden.
I do not believe any useful purpose would be
served by replying to them once again.
I am most appreciative of the contribution
made by the honourable Senator Vaillancourt. He is very knowledgeable on this
subject, bas had a long association with
caisses populaires and has a special appreciation of the problems involved. He gave us
the benefit of a report that took four years
to complete and which disclosed, as he put
it, terrible conditions arising out of the
operation of finance organizations. His unqualified support of the principle of the bill
bas been forthcoming every time I have introduced such a bill, and I am most appreciative of it.
Honourable senators, I wish also to say a
few words about the contribution made by
the honourable Senator Grosart. As I understood him, initially he was of several minds
about the bill, but he ended up by being
entirely in favour of its principle, and indicated his willingness to co-operate in whatever efforts would be made in committee to
improve its text.
I must take a little longer to make reference to the remarks made by the last
speaker, the honourable Senator Farris. May
I say at the outset that I agree in part with
what he said, and that I am prepared to

SENATE

make what might be regarded as an important concession to his point of view. However, I wish to make it crystal clear wherein
I agree with him and wherein I do not.
He has expressed a lingering doubt or fear
as to the constitutionality of the present bill.
As I have said, and often repeated, I do
not entertain any such fears or doubts, nor
do I believe they are shared by the majority
of honourable senators.
In the first place, honourable senators are
aware that the provisions making non-disclosure an offence punishable on summary
conviction are not included in the present
bill, nor were they included in its immediate
predecessor, although there were such provisions in earlier versions. Accordingly, the
present bill does not stand constitutionally on
the basis of criminal law. Thus the extended
remarks of the honourable Senator Farris
have no relevance to the present bill.
The bill before us is justifiable constitutionally as being legislation which, in pith
and substance, though not necessarily in
every detail, is legislation relating to "interest", as that expression appears in the
British North America Act of 1867. This is
the view which has been expressed by our
Parliamentary Counsel, and was the view
expressed many times by Mr. Varcoe in
respect of the Small Loans legislation. More
recently both these points of view received
unexpected support from the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario
in respect of the Unconscionable Transactions
Act, which is now under appeal to the
Supreme Court and to which I shall refer
at greater length in my later remarks. However, I am sure that our Parliamentary
Counsel, Mr. Hopkins, would be the last person to place around his shoulders a cloak
of constitutional infallibility. On the contrary,
he has often expressed the view, as he did
in his opinion on this bill, that the formulation of a constitutional opinion is, in reality,
an exercise in studied speculation, subject
always to final determination by the Supreme
Court of Canada, as our court of last resort.
I have said that the honourable Senator
Farris has expressed a lingering feeling of
doubt on the constitutional issue and has made
a plea for its reference to the Supreme Court.
Not because I have any fear or doubt about
the matter but rather because I am confident
of the result, I would be quite prepared to
subscribe in committee to an amendment
which would provide a built-in constitutional
safeguard in this respect.
I can find only one previous occasion, in
connection with the Special War Revenue Act,
chapter 27 of the statutes of 1940-41, where
the Senate added such a clause. It read as
follows:

29. Sections three and four of this act
shall not come into effect until proclamation by the Governor in Council, and
such proclamation shall not be issued
until section four of this act shall have
been submitted to the Supreme Court of
Canada for the purpose of having the
judgment of the said Court on the constitutionality of said section four, and said
judgment has been given.
This amendment, added to the Special War
Revenue Act for the purpose of ascertaining
its constitutionality before proclamation,
twenty-one years ago, is a precedent that we
can properly follow.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: That was a Government
measure.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, of course, but it is
none the less a precedent.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The fact that the Government did it would not disqualify it.
Hon. Mr. Croll: As a matter of fact my
friend the honourable Senator Brooks was a
member of the house at that time.
.1 suggest that if the senators entertain any
lingering doubts, and if the committee feels
it is desirable, before the bill becomes law,
to have its constitutionality determined by the
Supreme Court of Canada, this could be done
very simply without in any way holding up
the passage of the bill, the principle of which
appears to command general and public interest. I may say that a determination by the
Supreme Court of Canada on the constitutionality of the present bill, coupled with its
decision with regard to the Unconscionable
Transactions Act of Ontario, would clarify
once and for all the ambit of the legislative
power of the Parliament of Canada in relation
to interest. Indeed, if the provincial legislation falls, and the present bill is upheld, as
I strongly suspect will be the case, it will
be necessary, as I said on an earlier occasion,
to consider the adoption at federal level of
a consumers' bill of rights.
Having agreed to subscribe to an amendment providing for a constitutional safeguard, let me reiterate that we are considering the principle of the bill, and I would ask
that we refer it to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce where it may be
cast in the best possible legal mould for
reference to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Honourable senators, as we proceed to
vote on this bill may I suggest, with utmost
deference, that in this day and age good

DECEMBER 6, 1962
legisiation is that in wh.ich parainount
regard is had for the welfare of the many
rather than for the interests of the few. May
I add, that in the conduet of human aiffairs
the absence of truth very often, if flot always,
denotes the presence of falsehood, and that
in voting on this measure we may be taking
an important first step on a national scale
for the protection of the consumers of retail
credit. I think the lime has corne for this
chamber to take this first step, flot; merely

to fight this problem but to help in solving
it. 1 move the adoption of the bill on second

REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 461 to 504, and
moved that they be taken into consideration
at the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, for a number of reasons I think this is an appropriate
time for me to make a progress report on
behalf of the Divorce Committee, giving some
statistics which may be both interesting and
useful.
So far at this session of Parliament, 577
petitions have been presented, and these have
been dealt with as follows:
Petitions heard and recomm ended ...................
215
Petitions heard and rejected . .
4
Petitions withdrawn ..........

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Could the honourable
gentleman who has just spoken give us some
information as to whether the petition in
the Labrosse case has been accepted or rejected by the Divorce Committee?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not know that this
is a proper time for me to report on that
case but since I have been asked about it
I shall do so. There is a great deal that goes
on in the chairman's chamber that it is not
necessary to report.
The Divorce Committee has had some
difficulty in dealing with perjured evidence.
The practice is for the committee to report
to the Minister of Justice whenever it is suspected that there has been a violation of the
law. This I have been doing in more cases
than I am prepared to state publicly, and as
a result of that practice there are three men
now in jail, one serving a term of five years

DECEMBER 11, 1962
and the others serving lesser terms. A further
trial is in prospect at the moment, as are
further investigations.
1 do not know that I should discuss the
Labrosse case publicly, but in order to answer the question I mnust state the facts.
This case, in which Mrs. Labrosse was the
respondent, was passed by us on apparently
perjured evidence. The investigators who
gave evidence at the trial have pleaded guilty
to a charge of perjury and are the men I
have mentioned as now in jail. Under the
circumstances, Mrs. Labrosse has asked that
the Act dissolving her marriage be now repealed, and she bas filed a petition to that
effect. While that petition bas been received
by our office, it bas not been presented, nor
bas it yet a sponsor. For tbis reason, 1 intend
to present it myseif in due season. I do flot
mean to imply that I will advocate its passage.
1 have nothing to say in that regard at the
moment. I think it should be subrnitted to
the judgrnent of this bouse in due course, and
if no one else sponsors it, 1 shail.
That is my answer to the question. A petition bas been lodged asking for repeal of
this Act of Divorce, which was apparently
granted on perjured evidence.
Han. Mr. Cameron: Can the chaîrman of
the committee give us any information as to
the progress being made by the bill having
to do with parliamentary divorces which was
supposed to corne from the other bouse? Is
tbere any likelibood of its being presented
here before the New Year?
Han. Mr. Raebuck: I doubt that I should
answer that question. It is a matter for the
Commons and not for us.
Hon.
hear.

Mr. Macdonald

(Brantford):

Hear,

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I can tell you that the
bill now before the Commons is one drawn
by myseif and Mr. McCleave, Chairman of
the Miscellaneous Private Bis Committee in
the other bouse last session, and has now been
presented by the present chairman of that
committee. It is expected that the bill will
corne before the Commons on Thursday of
this week, but for me to forecast what that
bouse may do with it, would be entirely
improper.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, wben shall these reports be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I move tbat these reports be considered at tbe
next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

PRIVATE BILL
THE PHARMACY EXAMINING BOARD OF
CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Kinley moved the second
reading of Bill S-15, to incorporate The
Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill now
before us for consideration on second reading is entitled "An Act to incorporate The
Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada". Its
passage through Parliament will constitute
a forward step for the pharmaceutical profession, and will do for that profession in
Canada what was done for the doctors many
years ago.
The bill is a simple one. Section 1 contains the names of the incorporators, who are
prominent pharmacists practising throughout
Canada.
Section 2 contains definitions of various
terms used in the bill.
Section 4 reads:
The head office of the Board shall be
in the city of Toronto, in the province
of Ontario, or at such other place as the
Board may determine by by-law from
time to time.
Section 5 sets out the purposes of the board
as follows:
(a) to establish qualifications for pharmacists, acceptable to participating licensing bodies and recognizable as the
highest in Canada.
I may say that the participating licensing
bodies are representative of the different
provinces, which bodies have participated in
the formation of this board.

(b) to provide for fair and equitable
examinations, for the issuance of certificates of qualification to, and for the
registration of, applicants therefor; and
(c) to promote, with the consent of the
appropriate licensing bodiesThat is, those of the provinces.
-the
enactment of such provincial
legislation as may be necessary or desirable in order to supplement the provisions of this act.
Section 6 sets out the composition of the
board as follows:
(a) one member appointed as its representative by each participating licensing
body;
(b) two members appointed by the
Canadian Conference of Pharmaceutical
Faculties, at least one of whom shall be
proficient in both the French and the
English languages;
(c) one member appointed by the Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists;
(d) the general manager for the time
being of The Canadian Pharmaceutical
Association; and
(e) the president for the time being of
The Canadian Pharmaceutical Association.
A special proviso follows but I think it
can be dealt with better in committee. The
bill continues:
7. (1) Where any appointing body fails
to appoint a member to the Board within
a reasonable time after a vacancy occurs, the registrar-treasurer of the Board
shall notify such appointing body by
registered mail of such failure and shall
in such notice require the appointing
body to make the appointment and to
certify the appointment to the Board
within one month of the mailing of such
notice.
In this bill there is a provision that if the
province does not appoint a representative,
the Board can do so. That question was considered by the sponsors of the bill and the
officials of the Senate, and I think it has
been settled that it rests with the province.
The bill continues:
8. Each appointed member of the
Board shall continue in office until his
successor is appointed ...
9. No person shall be eligible for membership on the Board unless he is a qualified pharmacist ...
Provided that the requirement of registration shall not apply to the members of
the first Board-

DECEMBER 11, 1962
That is, the incorporating board, on which
there probably will be a solicitor. The bill
continues:
10. (1) A participating licensing body
may by resolution withdraw from participation in the activities of the Board
upon giving the Board six months' notice
of its intention so to do and in such event
the terni of office of its representative on
the Board shall expire ...
11. (1) The Board shail have power to
(a) issue certificates of qualification ini
pharmacy to applicants therefor;
(b) establish, maintain and revise..
a register..
(c) establish the ternis and conditions
under which persons may obtain certificates of qualification..
(d) establish and maintain a panel ...
of examiners..
(2) Nothing in subsection (1) shall
authorize the Board to interfere with or
otherwise affect the rights or privileges
of any licensing body under provincial
law.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Are there
any provincial laws at the present Urne?
Han. Mr. Kinley: Yes. In each province
there is a provincial society, and the laws of
the province set out the provincial rights. We
agreed that this would read,
"Nothing in this act . . ." instead of "Nothing in subsection (1) . . ."I. I think that is
agreeable, but it is a matter for the committee.
Then there f ollow the usual sanctions, showing how a member can be removed from the
register. After that there is provision for bylaws. As to by-laws, the bill has this to say:
14. (3) No such by-law or regulation
shail be enacted, altered or repealed
except with the concurrence of two-thirds
of the members of the Board appointed
by participating licensing bodies.
That means the change must be approved by
the Pharmaceutical Society in each of the
provinces.
Section 15 is rather important. It says:
Any qualifled pharmacist licensed or
registered in any province prior to the
comning into force of this Act shali, after
ten years from the date when he became
so licensed or authorized, be entitled to
be registered under this Act without
examination upon payment of the prescribed fees.
That is the usual thing in new legisiation,
that those who are well established in the
business are taken li without examination.
Then there is the usual paragraph about the

holding of property. There is also a section
dealmng with the power to borrow money,
draw cheques, and so on. That is a brief
summary of the bill.
Honourable senators who have read in the
newspapers and heard discussions in tis
house about difficulties affecting our health
will agree that this bll is a timely one, carryîng as it does seeds of unity, of strength, progress and advanced knowledge. These are
salutary advantages. The bill represents a
step forward, and therefore I cornmend it to
the bouse for favourable consideration on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: If the bill receives second
reading, does the honourable senator intend
to ask that it be sent to a committee?
Han. Mr. Kinley: I want it to go to the
Standing Committee on Public Health and
Welfare for consideration tomorrow. 1 intend
to move suspension of Rule 119 for that purpose. This bill was brought Up three weeks
ago and was left on the Order Paper so that
the country could study and think about it
to make sure that everyone was satisfied.
Then I had to go home for a week on some
private business. In consequence, the explanation of the bull on second reading has been
delayed. However, the representatives are here
from the college to discuss it tomorrow, and
I arn anxious to have it brought before the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): If the honourable senator succeeds in getting the bull
to the committee tomorrow, wfll there be
representatives here from interested provinces?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes, they are here in
the gallery now. Both the secretary and the
solicitor of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Society are here.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Will they be ready to
proceed tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does membership in the
organization to be created by tis bil confer
upon the person who becomes a member any
rights, powers, privileges, immunities, licences
or civil rights of any kcind?
Han. Mr. Kinley: No, none whatever.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does it merely give the
mexnber the right, authority and power to
say that he is a member of the organization?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes. It provides for
examination whîch we hope will be Canadianwide in ils scope, but with no precedence over
provincial rights.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Drouin: There is no infringement
on provincial rights?
Hon. Mr. Farris: What attitude are the
pharmacists taking as to this bill?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: As far as I know, the
Pharmaceutical Society representations are
favourable in eight provinces out of ten. The
island of Newfoundland has not yet decided,
and Quebec has not yet come in. Apart from
those, the rest are in.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Will this be binding on
the provinces that do not come in?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is not binding on anyone except those who choose to join voluntarily; then they may vote if they wish.
Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Senator Kinley
was good enough to speak to me a couple
of weeks ago about this bill, and I am very
happy to rise and support it. I took it upon
myself to consult the Dean of the Faculty
of Pharmacy in the University of Toronto,
and I have before me a letter in which he
states his views. In part, he said:
The purpose which the bill is intended
to achieve is precisely that which has
been provided by the legislation which
established a similar Examining Board
in Dentistry and originally, many years
ago, the Dominion Medical Council. In
both of these instances, as you are aware,
there is no interference whatever with

the rights and privileges of the respective
Provincial Licensing Bodies. The same
would apply in the case of the proposed
National Pharmacy Examining Board.
There is an important clause on page 2 of
the bill which states:
5. The purposes of the Board shall be
(a) to establish qualification for pharmacists, acceptable to participating licensing
bodies and recognizable as the highest
in Canada.
In other words, the pharmacists are attempting to improve the status of their profession,
in the same way as the doctors and lawyers
have improved theirs through the Royal
College of Physicians and Surgeons and Osgoode Hall. I think this is excellent legislation.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
tirne.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Kinley, bill referred
to Standing Committee on Public Health and
Welfare.
SUSPENSION

OF RULE

Leave having been given to revert to the
order for Notices of Motions:

Hon. Mr. Kinley, with leave of the Senate,
moved:
That Rule 119 be suspended in so far
as it relates to the Bill S-15, intituled:
"An Act to incorporate The Pharmacy
Examining Board of Canada."
He said: By Rule 119 seven days' notice
is required before a committee may consider a
private bill. However, since the Christmas
recess is drawing near, the suspension of the
rule so far as it relates to this particular bill
would enable it to be considered well before
that time. The purpose of this motion is to
dispense with the customary one week's delay.
Motion agreed to.

DECEMBER 11, 1962
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, December 5, the adjoixrned debate on the motion of Honourable Mr. Sullivan for second
reading of Bill C-3, to amend the Food and
Drugs Act.
H-on. Fred A. McGrand: Honourable senators, I want to take some tîme tonight to discuss Bill C-3, which would amend the Food
and Drugs Act.
We are ail aware of the tragic use of
thalidomide, a drug which was made available to the public by ýdrug companies of excellent reputation. There should be no criticîsm of the Department of National Health
and Welfare, wbich acted promptly when it
became suspicious that this drug was responsible for the deformity of babies; for can
there be any blame on the drug companies,
for they withdrew the drug as soon as they
became suspicious of its side effeets. Perhaps
the blame lies with ýail concerned, to wbich
we ail contribute.
Much has been written about the "wonder
drugs" that have become available within the
last decade. Many people believe that there
is no longer any need for pain or -discomfort;
they are led to believe that there is a powerful remedy for every ailment, great or small,
which has been the heritage of man. it is
from the use of -drugs that man has found
relief from pain and disease over tbe centuries, and in bis flight from physical pain
the human being has looked forward to the
day when ail disease would be eradicated
from his experience and death would corne
eventually from old age alone.
The history of medicine dates from antiquity. No one knows who the first physicians
were. Perhaps our knowledge of mnedicine
began with the observation of animais: the
domesticated dog that ate grass, the sheep
and goats that ate certain herbs when ill. No
doubt our primitive ancestors tried these
herbs or juices on then-selves with gradually
increasing degrees of success. Along wîth
this they learned to recognîze the cardinal
symptoms of inflammation: calor, dolor, robor
and tumor. They applied some drugs externally in the form of poultices. They took
some internally and they compiled the knowledge of the drug's action. It was the beginning of materia medica, and from the observation of their effects clinical medicine was
born.
The dissection of dead humans and animais gave us anatomy. Experiments on living
tissue gave us physiology. Research on the
bodies of those who had died before their
time gave us pathology. The knowledge of

drugs and their action became pharmacology.
On these cornerstones was built the edifice
"dlinical medicine".
Scientiflc research bas added mucb to medicine. Tbe names of Claude Benard and many
otbers, including our own Banting and Best,
bave added to our knowledge of scientîflc
medicine.
Let us not forget the truly great names in
medicine, the renowned physicians and teacbers whose names are associated witb certain
diseases: Graves, Bright, Hunter and others.
Tbese men observed the sick person in the
sickbed, surrounded by bis family. It was
clinical observation that made Osier a
revered name in medicine.
Most people wbo consuit a physician do not
bave a definite physical disease. Between 60
and 80 per cent of them bave complaints,
but not diseases. They are more sick in mind
than in body. Tbey bave pains and aches and
muscle spasm wbich cannot be cured by
cortisone. Tbey bave worries which cannot
be cured by a sedative. Tbey are tired not
from work but from boredom, wbich cannot
be cured by vitamins. Faulty muscle tone,
poor posture, lack of exercise, poor mental
bygiene, ail are misinterpreted by the patient
as physical diseases, and tbey consult a doctor to check their condition against wbat tbey
bave read in magazines or wbat tbey have
seen on television in the exploits of Dr. Kildare and Ben Casey. They want their share
of those health-giving, life-saving "wonder
drugs", the product of scientiflc advances in
this affluent age.
A leading criminologist, writing on juvenile
delinquency, says that much of delinquency
is caused by a failure of youth to capture
and enjoy ail the good things that be bas
been told this affluent society should bring to
bim in this day and age. They reach for but
cannot possess ail the material things tbey
hope for in this mature age, and not being
able to possess them tbey want to destroy the
property and tbreaten the lives of those wbo
possess the things for wbich dissatisfied youth
craves.
Now may I go from. the unbappy youth to,
the frustrated aduit. For years be bas been
told that we live in an affluent society in
whicb a bountiful nature and automation
have produced an abundance of goods. He
searcbes for a gimmick to make a breakthrough of bis frustration, for the materlal
things that indicate prosperity and a new set
of values as be tries to keep up wltb the
Joneses: shorter hours of work, more time
for expensive play, buying on time, easy
money purchase schemes, money when you
need it.
Many a person flgbts automation most of
bis days. He goes to work by automation,

SENATE
he spends his day with automation, he cornes
home by the same method, perhaps deep in
debt to a finance company; he watches
crime on television to adjust himself, and
ends his hectic day by taking a sedative to
sleep off his frustration.
Great changes have taken place in our
way of life since the turn of the century.
At that time most families lived on farms.
Many others earned their living by family
enterprise-the village blacksmith, the tailor,
the cabinet maker. The entire family contributed to its income and the family was a
unit. That was before many disruptive influences made their way into family life, with
a whole chain of frustrations. When granddad had lumbago, grandma put a towel on
his back and massaged his aching muscles
with a hot flatiron. It removed the muscle
spasm and he felt better the next day, and
there was no additional cortisone in his
bloodstream.
Up until recent years there were many
effective and inexpensive preparations available, but many of these are no longer manufactured. They have been replaced by the
more expensive preparations of the wonder
drug variety.
There are many young mothers in their
early twenties with one or two children
who live in modern homes, with modern
appliances, with little physical work to maintain muscle tone. Many of them are always
tired, suffer from fatigue, sleeplessness and
frustration. They take vitamins every day,
often a sleeping pill at night and a "wake-meup" pill in the morning. They are the everincreasing number of women who find their
way to the mental health clinics and some
of them to the divorce courts. They are the
market for the sedatives and tranquilizers,
and if anyone doubts this let him look at the
amount of sedatives available.
Thalidomide was sold in Canada under
two names, Kevadon and Talimol, but it was
sold in other countries under a confusing
number of names. I have a list of 51 names
which I shall not take the time to read but
ask that they be included in the record
of my remarks.

Hon. Mr. McGrand: It is difficult to give the
names of all sedatives sold in Canada, and
the numerous preparations of sedatives, other
drugs and less potent sedatives sold under the
innocent-sounding name "tranquilizers".
In the year 1960, there was available for
sale in Canada 48,000 pounds, or 24 tons, of
sedatives. If put up in quarter-grain doses it
would make a billion tablets. There was also
available an enormous volume of tranquilizers, perhaps half a billion tablets, and
on top of this supply came seven million
tablets of thalidomide. Some were sold to
drug stores, and about four million were
passed out as samples to doctors. It is difficult to say how many were taken by patients
inasmuch as a large amount was destroyed
when it became known that it had serious
side effects.
This drug would have, and must have,
reached many women because it had some
influence on morning sickness, a normal
physical and psychological occurrence in early
pregnancy. It may be nature's way of telling a woman that she is pregnant. Nausea in
early pregnancy is usually not a serious matter, and a ten-minute reassuring talk with
the family doctor, if she bas one, is more
effective than a sedative.
The sale of so many sedatives and other
drugs, the unnecessary use of antibiotics,
cortisone and its derivatives, estrogens and
vitamins, demonstrates how clearly people
have lost control of their emotions. They cannot live with other people; they cannot live
with themselves, for fear of themselves. They
seek shelter from themselves, as they seek
from this affluent society substitutes for their
built-in self-control.
A cold in the head calls for an antibiotic, a
minor headache calls for a sinus decongestant,
pains and aches in the muscles and joints call
for some preparation of cortisone, and a minor
emotional upset calls for a tranquilizer. Here

DECEMBER 11, 1962

is man in full flight from himself. He cannot
bear to live with his own normal emotions if
they cause him the least bit of discomfort,
and in his flight from the worries of the manmade machine age he seeks refuge in the
man-made laboratories in search of wonder
drugs. In this flight Canadians consume yearly
over $22 million worth of antibiotics, over $7
million of vitamins-not including vitamins
sold in bulk-over $2.5 million of sex hormones, and about $20 million of cortisone and
its derivatives. These are all at wholesale
prices.
If you exclude patent medicines, which
amount to about $20 million a year, the sale
of the drugs I have referred to equals about
half the value of all pharmaceuticals sold in
Canada to man and his domesticated animals.
It is not hard to understand why. The less
expensive and equally effective remedies have
disappeared from the market and have been
replaced by the expensive ones because of
their reputation for quick action. They are
wonder drugs when used with discretion.
The antibiotics have saved thousands
who would have left this world before
their time, but because of misuse they have
altered the bacteria flora to such an extent
that new germs, or seldom-observed germs,
are making their appearance. Cortisone is a
powerful drug for good or ill. There are
conditions where its action is dramatic. In
the hands of prudent physicians it is invaluable, but it is a much over-used drug.
It bas no place in old degenerative arthritis,
the result of wear and tear.
There are between 70 and 100 preparations
of cortisone and its derivatives combined
with other drugs now on the market and
used often in types of arthritis where it
serves no purpose, and where its side effects
could be dangerous. There are patients who
are taking cortisone for these degenerative
joint conditions. At the same time they are
taking oral preparations for diabetes, which
may be a side effect of cortisone.
Man has always had trouble with the
proper use of wonder drugs. Back in the
dawn of history the Arabs produced a drug
which was a cure-all. They called it alcohol,
and it was the elixir of life, but it had side
effects. Most side effects add to our emotional disturbances. Most of the complaints
which bring about the doctor-patient contact
are emotional and not physical. Most of our
headaches are of emotional origin: tight
muscles of the scalp and neck; changes of the
blood supply within the skull. Most gastro
and intestinal upsets are emotional. The
appetite vanishes with anxiety. Many of the
upsets of the female pelvis are of emotional
origin. Stomach ulcers have always been
27511-5-27

associated with worry. If worry can cause an
acute ulcer, then a chronic worry can keep
a chronic ulcer active. Many an ulcer patient
seeks a remedy in radical stomach surgery.
A gastrectomy will remove the ulcer and the
ulcer-bearing area of the stomach. A patient
can lose 50 per cent of his stomach but retain
100 per cent of his worries. Perhaps this is
the explanation why so many who undergo
radical stomach surgery at the hands of the
best of surgeons retain their complaints.
Many young women with endocrine disturbances plus emotional upsets are treated
by radical surgery. Hysterectomy only removes the evidence and adds to her problem
by further upsetting her endocrine balance.
Many of the distraught, frustrated, tormented
women who find their way to the divorce
courts are victims of major pelvic surgery.
They consulted the wrong doctor.
I would like to compare the human body to
a well-run commercial business, with its
general manager and superintendents of production and sales promotion. They are the
"organs" of this industrial firm, but above
them is a board of directors which does the
planning. It is this board which keeps the
activities of the firm in balance.
The human body is made up of organs
presided over by the brain. Each organ bas
its own function: the heart pumps blood;
the stomach and bowel take in and assimilate
food; other organs excrete waste. But the
body has a "board of directors." These are
the endocrine or ductless glands, pituitary,
adrenal, thyroid, sex glands. They produce
the hormone or chemical messengers that
are essential to the metabolism of a well-run
body. They control and are controlled by
our emotions.
If you were out on a lonely road for a
quiet walk and met one you considered to
be a mortal enemy, you would prepare for
one of two things: fight or flight. Your whole
body is altered: the blood pressure goes up,
the heart pumps faster, muscle tone is increased. If you decide on "fight," then the
muscles of your arms and shoulders take on
extra strength. If you decide on "flight," the
muscles of your legs and thighs prepare for
action.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: What happens if you
are undecided?
Hon. Mr. McGrand: This is the relationship
between the endocrine glands and our emotions, and their influence upon our bodies in
general.
Most patients who consult a doctor have
an emotional disturbance rather than definite
physical disease, yet for every dollar spent
on psychiatric research there are ten spent

SENATE
in research on physical disease. The result
is that all these wonder drugs have failed
to solve the problems of medicine.
It takes time, patience and long clinical
experience to grasp the art of medicine, for
medicine is both an art and a science: a
science, because we are dealing with our
chemical processes; an art, because we are
dealing with the most complex creature made
by the laws of creation, composed of mind
as well as matter. Man is more than tissuebony, fibrous or muscular. You cannot put
tissue in a test tube and tell if it comes
from a person who is happy or worried, or
if it is tissue from one who can keep up with
the Joneses or his frustrations.
Is the practice of medicine keeping up with
medical problems? Many of the best minds
in medicine are afraid that it is not. Dr.
Alton Goldbloom, one of the senior clinicians
in Canada, writes in the latest issue of
Maclean's magazine an article entitled "We
are forgetting how to diagnose sickness". The
general practitioner is faced by patients with
complaints but no demonstrable physical
disease. About once a week he is visited by
a drug salesman who, with a reassuring smile,
says, "If you have problems in your practice,
I have the answer", and leaves the doctor
preparations and combinations of sample
drugs that contain anything from cortisone
to tranquilizers, which are supposed to make
the diagnosis and effect a cure at one bold
stroke.
The average doctor has no way of doing
his own research; he must rely on the advice
he gets from responsible drug houses. There
is a responsibility on the drug companies;
their business is to make drugs and prepare
them for market. They know that preparations containing a half-dozen different potent
drugs combined in one pill are not examples
of good therapeutic practice. This part of the
bill that says a doctor must request these
preparations in writing is only shaking a
finger at the problern. There is nothing to
stop a drug salesman showing the doctor
the contents of his satchel, giving him a pep
talk and then having him sign an order for
the samples.
It is difficult to say that thalidomide is
guilty of all the crimes with which it is
charged. I am going to plead for its life:
Do not condemn it to death; it is a little
pill that can do no harm if it is not misused.
Were you to take every drug off the
market that is capable of causing death in
careless hands, there would be few drugs
left. What about the weight-reducing drugs?
They not only reduce the appetite but also
give a feeling of well-being that is habitforming, a central stimulant that burns up
energy. At the same time the patient can

and often does become an addict to benzedrine and dexedrine. These are two of the
drugs that go into the so-called "goofball".
Is the difference between normal weight and
overweight-the difference between selfrestraint and no self-restraint-to be measured by a little pill?
There is a responsibility. Where does it lie?
It is not the responsibility of the Department
of Health and Welfare to attempt to regulate
the practice of medicine. Some of this responsibility lies with the drug company; much
of it lies with members of the public who
refuse to bear a little pain or discomfort in
this affluent society; some of it rests on those
who write the prescriptions. This most delicate matter must be handled by the profession itself.
The use of expensive medicines has become a part of our way of life. Much has
been said about the exorbitant profits on
drugs, but there are heavy expenditures involved in research, and this research must
go on. It is part of the advancing science of
medicine, and must serve the purpose for
which it was intended. But medical practice
should not be simply a sales agency for the
drug companies.
Many honest, well-meaning people believe
the answer to this expensive therapy is to
relieve the individual of this burden and
place it on the taxpayer in the form of statecontrolled medicine. That is not the answer.
It is merely shifting the burden from the
individual to the group. It will not discourage
the unnecessary use of expensive drugs but,
on the contrary, it could even encourage it,
without restoring clinical observation which
is so badly needed.
In the prescription and distribution of
dangerous drugs the worst is yet to come.
It is a speck on the horizon, the size of a
man's hand, which will grow larger every
day. I refer to the danger of the contraceptive pill. Here is a drug which is aimed
directly at the endocrine system of the young
female between the ages of 18 and 38. If an
ill-advised hysterectomy of a young woman
can cause havoc by knocking out the endocrine substances, which might be described
as one of the members of her "board of
directors," what will be the result of this
drug which is aimed at the entire board?
And we must remember that she will be submitted to this bombardment for most of her
active sex life. This may be the real Frankenstein monster, created by laboratory skill in
the narne of science.
We speak of scientific advancement as if
it was the only goal of mankind. The
Reverend E. L. Taylor has said:

DECEMBER 11, 1982
The outcome of applied science is
humane slavery, enmity and hatred. The
attempt to become independent of God
that man could master his environment
has resulted in man losîng his sense of
belonging to this earth. This feeling of
no longer belonging
is observable
throughout the world today in man's
senseless striving for security and yet
more power, and yet man's efforts to
conquer space have only resulted in
man's feeling more insecure than ever.
Nevertheless, science has been the most important study in some high schools. It is
considered more important and far more
glorious for a boy to be an astronaut than to
be a philosopher or a humanitarian. Professor McHorter, Professor of Psychology at the
Medical School of the University of Vermont,
and an advocate of humane education in our
schools as an antidote to so much teaching of
science, makes this observation:
Perhaps this is an instrumental factor
in why there are more men than women
in mental hospitals, why men die sooner
than women. Men, as the stereotype would
have it, are supposed to be "strong, virile,
objective, unemotional." I suspect that it
is because men strive to assume this
"masculine" type of role that they crack
up, physically and mentally, several years
ahead of time. The human male would be
a far happier, healthier creature if be
would simply cry more and give vent to
more of his integrated emotions, particularly affection and compassion. Perhaps if this were done we would have
a saner and more secure world in which
to live.
The transfer of medicine from the bedside to the laboratory has robbed it of its
clinical aspect and much of its humaneness.
It is time now to take a new look at medicine and to give it a new meaning. Perhaps
we have moved beyond the drug age in
medicine. There is more to man than his
body. His restless mind gets him into most of
his troubles.
In less affluent ages man worked hard and
then relaxed; now with working and hard
play he seldom relaxes.
It is not man's body or its diseases that
represent the great challenge to our society.
Smallpox, diphtheria, leprosy are well under
control. Heart disease, cancer, high blood
pressure are not contagious. It is man's emotions we fear most. No timid woman or smal
child need be afraid to meet the biggest man
in the world in a dark alley if he is sound
emotionally. The challenge comes from the
criminal who threatens our lives as he robs
us of our goods, the juvenile delinquent who
27511-5--27J

feels deprived in this affluent society, the drug
addict and the sex deviate with their frustrations.
For years we have done research on animals. Much of our knowledge of drugs comes
from this source. But we have seldom studied
the emotions of animals in their natural state.
Here is a whole field to explore as we probe
man's emotions. Naturalists are happy and
contented people because they appreciate their
surroundings and what nature has to offer
them. In our pursuit of chemical and physical knowledge, philosophy and moral values
have lagged behind. I recall the Greek adage:
Life is a gift of nature; but a beautiful
life is a gift of wisdom.
Bliss Carman described this kind of medication when he wrote:
There is virtue in the open;
There is healing out of doors.
The Great Physician makes his rounds
Along the forest floors.
Common things occur commonly, and we see
common things often. Medicine practised at
its best is made up of little things. It concerns people, their little pains and aches, their
little troubles and worries. A good talk is,
for most patients, better than a pocketful of
pills. Medicine is a humble profession and
one needs humility to practice it at its best.
There is not much that we can cure or should
profess to cure, but we can help a lot. This
humility has been expressed very well by a
French physician who said, "I treated him.
God cured him."
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
the bill we are now considering is simple and
has been thoroughly discussed. However, it
bas certain implications. It is a sad reminder
that in the forward movement in the constant battle against disease we have met with
a creeping disaster, not of our own making,
but which comes from advanced knowledge
at the very centre of applied science in
Europe. It has created a situation which many
countries must face at the present time. I
said "disaster," yes, but I did not say "failure", because I believe that the wonder drug
and the achievements which have been secured by its use will, in the future, be regarded as one of the steps forward in this
century.
This bill simply prohibits the use of two
drugs, restricts the use and distribution of
samples, and gives the Government power to
pass regulations by order in council. I think
all this is necessary and is readily supported.
Sometimes we criticize the method of regulating by order in council, but the world

SENATE
is moving faster and statute law is now too
static to be wholly efficient for present-day
affairs.
We listened to the speech on this bill by
the honourable Senator Sullivan, a distinguished surgeon. I often think of how wonderful it is to be among distinguished senators who are specialists and who advise us
on intricate and important problems, and
Senator Sullivan is one of those.
We heard speeches from Senator Gershaw
and Senator McGrand, who are also medical
doctors. Senator Gershaw is most highly regarded in the Senate. He is the kindest of
men. I know that he looks after the medical
problems of many of the older members of
the Senate, and we appreciate it very much.
He is a man who does not speak from the
ivory tower. I do not know if he ever uses
those strange words that Senator Sullivan
told us about and which are contained in
the medical vocabulary.
We have just listened to Senator McGrand,
who made a peculiar speech. At first I thought
he was a therapeutic nihilist, but as he went
on he got down to something good, and he
made a splendid speech. It was a moving
speech, one that appealed to the sentiment.
Sometimes we are carried away by sentiment,
and we are led by our hearts instead of
our minds. I must say, however, that while
we admire people who are clever and who
can do things, we are moved by appeals to
the heart. I have found that true in political
life, and I think I can apply it to the speech
of my honourable friend.
Senator McGrand comes from the Maritimes. I remember a distinguished lady
who came to the Maritimes at one
time and said, "I am now in the place
where wisdom abides". Some of the things
that have happened in Ottawa recently
have made me think that wisdom does indeed
abide in the Maritimes. I think Senator McGrand should make that speech before the
Canadian Medical Association. After all, he
is a doctor, and if he has opinions that are
as strong and as convincing as those he has
expressed tonight, then they should be heard
by a lot of people who feel that medicine is
a great science.
I was asked by our Leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) to say something in the
debate on second reading of this bill. I suppose this is because I have had over 50 years
of active service in the practice of pharmacy.
I remember that when I first went into pharmacy we made up our own pills, elixirs, emulsions, tinctures, ointments and other preparations. That practice prevailed for a long
time and then the pharmaceutical houses got
going. They made up prescriptions, put them

in gallon bottles and went around to the
doctors saying: "This is a good thing". The
doctors tried it, and gradually those large
companies obtained most of the trade in the
country. Their business has developed, and
now in the larger sphere they are the makers
of these so-called wonder drugs.
There has been a great change in the practice of medicine and in the production and
use of drugs. However, while we do not know
everything, and from time to time mistakes
are made, I think on the whole there has
been progress.
I now have to pay some attention to the
speech of the honourable Senator Sullivan,
because he was honoured by his Leader (Hon.
Mr. Brooks) in being asked to sponsor the
bill in this house, and I wish to commend
him on a few things he said. He spoke about
the esoteric vocabulary of the learned professions, especially the medical profession.
He quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes on the
importance of the law, and then paid tribute
to law and medicine by saying they are two
of the greatest forces in the molding of civilization. I think he might have included the
engineers with the lawyers and the doctors.
Had he done so, I think he would have had
a good argument. It is my opinion that the
engineers have made a very important contribution.
However, as a practising pharmacist for
over 50 years I do not think we need put a
divine cloak on the medical profession at this
time, although we admire its members greatly.
I may say that in my own family I have two
surgeons affiliated with the Royal College of
Surgeons, I have a nephew in California who
is a brain surgeon, and four of us are pharmacists. So I am continually in the theatre
of discussions about such matters as this.
Senator Sullivan has said that the recent
catastrophic appearance of malformed babies
reportedly associated with the drug thalidomide was due to a lack of scientific knowledge, and not to a deficiency in the law. I
agree with that.
I have here a pamphlet from a drug company that says practically the same thing. I
must confess that I am a shareholder in two
of these companies in the United States, and
I have been following their activities. Here
is a monthly report on the company's financial affairs which is sent to all shareholders.
It also reports upon the manufacture of certain drugs that are being placed on the
market.
Senator Sullivan also said that protection
against the unknown cannot be legislated. I
agree with that, and it is in the reports that
I get from these manufacturers. They also
agree. However, the unknown is always with
us, as is research into the unknown. We have

DECEMBER 11, 1962
to deal with the unknown, and I am sure our
medical friends deal with the unknown in a
controlled and practical way. They know how
far they can go, and we accept their opinions
because they are educated people.
The Honourable Senator Sullivan spoke
very highly of the personnel in the health
departments of this country, and I agree with
what he said. It was my privilege to represent the Senate as an observer at the United
Nations in 1960, at which time there was a
committee dealing with the traffic in narcotics. It was really a plenipotentiary conference of nations set up for the purpose of
finding out if it was possible to have one
convention instead of nine to cover the whole
field. I attended its sittings. While it was a
committee on public health and welfare, and
everybody was concerned with public health,
it dealt with the interests of individual countries because one was in production and
another was in traffic. On the whole, it was
a tedious affair. What I want to say is that
the representative from Canada stood out
splendidly among the representatives of 100
nations. I remember one of our men showing
me one day a note that came from the Russians in which the Canadians were congratulated upon their fine contribution to the
debates and on the action they took in committee. I thought that was very good.
However, the committee kept busy for a
long time but did not get very far. Finally,
they framed a resolution which they thought
would cover the subject, but 40 nations had
to sign it before it became operative, and to
this date only 14 have signed. As the United
States is against it, it has very little chance
of passing. I do not know why the United
States is against it. Perhaps it thought it
involved too much compromise. However,
whether it was or was not, the idea was
voiced that too many countries were allowed
to continue in the processing field, and it
was thought that it should be better controlled.
The fact remains that the delegation from
the Canadian Parliament was considered one
of the best. They took an interest in their
work, they worked hard, and applied their
knowledge. I am glad to say that they were
very effective in that organization and we are
proud of them; I am also glad that Senator
Sullivan paid them the tribute he did in his
speech.
Senator Sullivan says that the Government
is going to appoint a special commission to
look into this drug question and that the
Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons
will help. That is all to the good. The senator
went further and said that both the manufacturer and the Government now take every
precaution they know of to make prescription

drugs as safe as practical modern science can
now make them. That is exactly the same
comment as I have here from a pharmaceutical company.
I agree with this, but when it says that
"prescription drugs are as safe as practical
modern science can now make them," the
question raised in my mind is as to the distribution to the public, which is most
important. There should be a record of every
sale of potent drugs and of those which need
to be carefully watched. The best record is a
prescription.
If the inspector from Ottawa comes into our
stores and sees in our record that somebody
has got too many prescriptions for a narcotic
or something of that kind, it is likely that he
will interview the doctor concerned. He may
find that the doctor has given the prescription,
but how much has the patient used that he
never had a prescription for at all?
Of course, salesmen visit the doctor and
sell him drugs, and the doctor has special
privileges. Sometimes a girl who is acting as
receptionist or bookkeeper will hand out
these things. I cannot see that there Is an
accurate record kept.
In the organized centres where there are
important surgeons and medical men, I can
understand that there are good records kept;
but I can say from my experience-and I had
six drugstores when I was actively in the
business-that if we desire to prevent narcotic
or other dangerous drugs getting into the
hands of the people, it will be necessary to
have better control in the doctor's office.
With regard to thalidomide, Senator Sullivan said that credit should be given where
credit is due. I think he was a little unfair to
the Americans in his statement. I have reports
here from the press of the United States, from
Life and other publications. The senator said
that the Press deals in news and that he
looked for facts. Well, this is a report in Life
on the thalidomide affair, and I feel that it
was a very fair one. If you read what
appeared in Life and in the weekly section
of the Ottawa Citizen, you will find that the
reports are pretty good. To be fair to the
Americans I should like to read from the
report in the Ottawa Citizen Weekend
Magazine:
On March 8, an application to market
thalidomide in the United States was
withdrawn. The application had never
been approved in the U.S. because Dr.
Frances Kelsey, a Canadian-born scientist from Cobble Hill, B.C., a federal
pharmacologist, had been dissatisfied with
the scientific data in support of the drug
and had held it up. For her efforts, Dr.
Kelsey was awarded a distinguishedservice citation by President Kennedy.

DECEMBER 12, 1982
We were proud to note that Canada is splendidly represented in Brazil.
Unfortunately we stayed only a short time
in that charming city. We then proceeded to
Brasilia, our ultimate destination, located 600
miles in the hinterland.
In view of the seriousness of the international situation, as well as the importance of
the Interparliamentary meetings that were
to be held there to promote the welfare of
the world, Brasilia seemed to us the capital
city of hope and an oasis of peace.
Brasilia is an ultra modern capital city.
When I visited Brazil a few years ago, it was
practically a desert. The idea of building the
capital city in the middle of the country dates
back to 1822, date of its independence, but the
latest basic law of the Republic, that of 1946,
states clearly:
The capital city of the Union will be
transferred from Rio de Janeiro to the
central plateau of the country.
However, the idea materialized very slowly
under the persistent efforts of former president Juscelino Kubitschek while he was in
office, from 1956 to 1960, and Brasilia was
inaugurated right on the date set by Congress, on April 21, 1960. An old Brazilian
dream had come true. The capital city is
built on an immense plateau and is a symbol
of the boldness, the imagination, the courage
and the initiative of the Brazilian people. It
now has a population of approximately
200,000 people. However, it is far from being
completed. As Senator Beaubien said, there is
still much to be done. Lúcio Costa, the town
planner who designed the plans of the city,
states that:
The purpose of the Brasilia pilot
scheme was the location of a city planned
for orderly and efficient work but also
a pleasant city suited for dreaming and
intellectual outpourings which could later
on become, apart from being the headquarters of the government and of the
administrative services, one of the most
brilliant and receptive cultural centres.
Oscar Niemeyer was the architect who drew
the plans of the public buildings.
It is in that 20th century metropolis that
the Interparliamentary
Conference took
place, in order to strengthen democracy and
freedom. The opening ceremony was held
on Wednesday, October 24, at 10.30 a.m., in
the House of Representatives. Mr. Joâo Goulart, President of the Republic of the United
States of Brazil, launched with an address,
which was loudly applauded, the series of
27511-5--28J

welcoming speeches. After that, the business
of the session started in earnest in that same
chamber.
The questions which were discussed at the
Conference were determined by the InterParliamentary Council at its 90th session
which was held in Rome on April 28, 1962
and at which Senator Thorvaldson was
present.
I now wish to say a few words in regard
to the machinery of the Union which enables
all delegates to obtain ahead of time all the
information they need with respect to the
matters on the agenda. All member countries
of the Interparliamentary Union are invited,
during the year, to suggest themes for discussion and study at the next Conference.
A selection is made by the Coundil and it is
submitted to the following standing committees:
The Economic and Social Committee; the
Parliamentary and Juridical Committee; the
Committee on Non-Self-Governing Territories and Ethnic Questions; the Committee on
Political Questions, International Security and
Disarmament; the Committee on Cultural
Questions.
These Committees meet once a year, in the
spring, and pass resolutions on each question.
In this way, preliminary papers for the conference may be distributed several months
before discussion starts. Unfortunately, delegates are generally chosen at the last minute and have not always the time, before
their departure, to study the matters which
will be discussed. The Union also has a permanent secretariat in Geneva under the able
and wise administration of Mr. André de
Blonay, with whom we regularly correspond,
and who keeps us fully informed in every
respect. Nevertheless, some Canadian colour
should be given to the information received
from such a distance and that is why we turn
to our Department of External Affairs to obtain all sorts of records on every matter under
study. I would like to express our appreciation to Mr. I. W. Robertson, of the Information Division of that Department, who left
no stone unturned to keep the Canadian delegation well informed and supplied with relevant records.
Al our delegates took part in those debates, whether in the various committees or
at the Conference itself. We met every day
before sittings in order to decide what our
stand would be with regard to matters being
discussed or in case of a vote. All problems
on the order of the day were seriously and
competently considered by each member of
the delegation. Debates were conducted in

SENATE
the best parliamentary tradition, which gave
to this Conference the look of an international
parliament. That high assembly, consisting of
the representatives of 43 nations-several of
whom in their colourful national garbseemed to us the prestigious mosaïc of a
world craving for peace.
Senator Thorvaldson listed, in the speech
he made on December 4 last, in this house
all points which were discussed at the Conference. May I briefly mention two of them.
I was more particularly interested in the
question of disarmament. When I dealt with
the matter, the Cuban crisis had just broken
out. That event completely changed the atmosphere of the Conference. Most delegates
had to revise their speeches to protest the
establishment of Russian nuclear bases in
Cuba. In my remarks on disarmament, I
mentioned the efforts made by the InterParliamentary Union to find an efficient
formula for disarmament. May I quote a
brief paragraph:
Disarmament is the ultimate purpose
of the Interparliamentary Union. That
is why it was founded in 1889 and that is
why it is still in existence today. Failure,
will you say! Far from it! I ask you,
ladies and gentlemen, what would have
been the turn of events in the difficult
moments had it not been for the continued efforts of the Interparliamentary
Union in the field of disarmament? Each
time, its influence has been felt by a
majority of member nations, and it has
tried to instil the idea of disarmament
in the minds of our politicians.

.

. Certain

countries should not be supplied with
armaments by powers capable of becoming a threat to peace. On account of
the present situation, Cuba or any other
country, in a similar situation, should
not become a military bastion.
Then I underlined the attitude taken by
Canada at the United Nations and at the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament, and I
ended up by these words:
As long as certain nations will consider
peace treaties and international agreements as mere scraps of paper, as long
as they will lack frankness and sincerity,
peace shall only be an empty word.
The second item on the agenda which I
should like to stress is the proposed convention concerning international steps to be taken
against those guilty, in the exercise of public
office, of fraudulent enrichment prejudicial
to the public interest.

I know that Senator Roebuck is interested
in this question. He was a delegate at the
Tokyo Interparliamentary Conference held
in 1960, and the Parliamentary and Juridical
Committee, on which he was sitting, had
undertaken the discussion of this problem. He
will no doubt welcome the news that a convention in this respect has been approved
by the Brasilia Conference. I will gladly give
him a copy of this document. We intend to
bring it to the attention of the Government,
as well as all the other resolutions passed
during our sessions.
Naturally, at the Interparliamentary Union,
we are expressing our own views without
committing the government. The Union is a
forum where current international problems
can be considered in an atmosphere of complete freedom. The public men and women
who take part in the work of the Union have
the opportunity to examine closely international issues and thus widen their knowledge. They familiarize themselves with the
conditions of life and the aspirations of other
countries, thus obtaining a better understanding of the factors which affect the international situation. If the Union does not have
the necessary authority to settle the differences between nations, it can nevertheless
contribute to bring about an atmosphere of
understanding and mutual respect, which is
essential to the development of international
co-operation and to the strengthening of
peace.
Three members of our delegation, Senator
Thorvaldson, Senator Méthot and myself, were
accompanied by our wives. This made our
stay all the more enjoyable and helped us
to rest from our trip and from the hard work
entailed by the business of the Conference.
Our delegation held a reception for the
members of the Union from all parts of the
Commonwealth. That family reunion enabled
us to exchange our views on common
problems. We enjoyed the hospitality of the
president of the Republic, of organizations
from Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United
States, Australia and Spain.
I would be remiss if I failed to mention
the unstinting devotedness of the representative from the Canadian Embassy in Brasiliaour embassy is still located in Rio de Janeiro
-Mr. Dacre P. Cole. He speaks fluent Portuguese-and so does his wife-and needless
to say his assistance was most valuable.
He is a competent civil servant who spared
no effort to be of assistance to us.

DECEMBER 12, 1962
Honourable senators, I hope that Canada's
participation to that conference will help promote world peace and will help the InterParliamentary Union to attain its objectives.
During the various gatherings and meetings, the representatives from Latin America
often asked us why Canada was not a member
of the Organization of American States, previously called the Pan-American Union. We
expressed the hope, in our own personal
capacity, that a day would come when we
would have the privilege of filling the seat
still reserved to Canada in the Organization.
We believed that Canada's presence in this
gathering of American States showed in a
concrete manner the sympathy we have, not
only for our neighbours to the South, but also
for all Latin American countries who are in
such need of our encouragement and assistance in all respects, with whom we have
business relations and where we maintain
embassies.
Following the Conference, the Brazilian
delegation organized a tour of Sao Paulo
and we took advantage of it. Sao Paulo is
known as the "coffee capital and Latin
America's Chicago"; it has a population of
5 million; skyscrapers mushroom all over the
place; it is the most important industrial
centre in all Latin America; there is a
tremendous activity in all fields. I wish to
thank Mr. D. M. Holton, Canadian consul
and trade commissioner in Sao Paulo, and
Mr. R. H. Gayner, vice-consul and deputy
trade commissioner, who met us at the airport
with their charming wives. These two civil
servants do magnificent work on behalf of
Canada. We offer them our gratitude and
our thanks for all they have done to make
dur stay at Sao Paulo a useful and a pleasant
one.
We left Brazil more convinced than ever
of the friendliness of its people and with the
impression that it is a land of promise, of
love and of beauty. In Sao Paulo, my wife
and I parted with our charming companions
in order to proceed to Buenos Aires and
then visit the main cities of South America;
I shall dispense with the details of our
return journey. Suffice it to mention that we
should be rightly proud of our representatives
in Latin America who have contributed so
much to earn respect and admiration for
Canada.
I could not conclude my remarks without
paying a special tribute to our secretary
Mr. Alcide Paquette, assistant clerk of the
Senate, who was constantly at the service
of the delegation and who proved himself
very valuable in obtaining and co-ordinating

all required information. He showed himself
competent, devoted, obliging, active and always on the alert. His services were most
helpful and I wish to give him credit for
this.
In conclusion, I may say that, nevertheless,
we were very glad to return to Canada and,
as the old saying goes, we realized that there
is nothing as beautiful as one's own country.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Méthot, debate

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
that completes the order of business for this
afternoon. We had expected to receive Bill
C-94, which is now under consideration in
the House of Commons. If possible, we would
like to give it first reading in this chamber
today, and, with the consent of honourable
senators, we might have the sponsor of the
bill speak on second reading. Therefore, I
move that we adjourn now, to reassemble at
the call of the Chair, so that if this bill
comes to us we might consider it later this
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Is the honourable Leader
of the Government sure that it will be available later today?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: It is being voted on in
the House of Commons now.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I understand they are
voting on it now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): At the
moment they are voting on the Speaker's
ruling.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understand they are
dealing with third reading.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I have
just received word that the bill was called
for third reading in the other house and that
an amendment was moved. The Speaker has
ruled the amendment out of order, and that
ruling has been appealed. Whether there will
be any debate after that is decided, I do not
know; however, I think the suggestion of the
Leader of the Government is a good one, that
we should rise for half an hour, to reassemble
at the call of the bell.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: We shaH reassemble at
the call of the bell, not later than a quarter
to five.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If the bill comes to us
for consideration this afternoon, will we have
copies of it before the debate begins?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I believe we have had

copies for some time. It is the bill regarding
the Atlantic Development Board; it has been
under debate for some time in the other place,
and I am sure that each honourable senator
has a copy of it on file.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Bran±ford): I under-

stand that if the bill comes to us within a
reasonable time it will be explained by a
senator on the Government side, after which
a senator on this side may either speak today
or adjourn the debate. In any event, the
debate will not be concluded today.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: That is quite right. A

number of honourable senators wish to speak
on it. I may say it is a very important bill,
having to do with the Atlantic provinces.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 4.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
ATLANTIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD

BILL

FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate

that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-94 to provide
for the establishment of an Atlantic Development Board.
Bill read first time.
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: With leave, I move
second reading of the bill now.

Hon. Frank C. Welch: Honourable senators,

as this is the first time I have undertaken to
speak in this chamber, I know you will allow
me to say a few words of a personal nature
before discussing the bill before us.
I would like to say, first of all, how greatly
I appreciate the privilege of being a member
of this body. I regard it as a tremendous
honour and I am grateful, and always wil
be grateful, to our Prime Minister for having
conferred this honour on me. Also, I want
you to know, honourable senators, that I have
deeply appreciated your words of welcome
and the many good wishes you have expressed. Further, I would like to take this
occasion to express the thanks of my wife
and myself for the many acts of kindness
which have been shown to us by honourable
senators and others since we came to Ottawa.

And now I wish to discuss briefiy the bill
before us. The bill provides for the establishment of a corporation to be known as the
Atlantic Development Board, and sets out that
the duties of this board will be to inquire
into and report to the responsible minister
upon measures and projects for fostering the
economic growth and development of the
Atlantic region of Canada. As you know,
this region is made up of the provinces of
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island and Newfoundland.
Honourable senators are probably well
aware that it has long been the contention
of the people of the Atlantic area that their
provinces are entitled to some special consideration and treatment from the federal
Government. They claim this special treatment because they feel they have special
problems which are the result of their being
a part of Canada, and that these problems
can only be solved by federal Government
action. The people in the Atlantic area well
realize that economic growth and development in their provinces has not kept pace
with the growth and development in the other
regions of Canada. They are convinced that
it is this lack of economic growth which is
responsible for lack of opportunity in this
area, as compared to the rest of Canada;
that it is responsible for the fact that the
average wage rate in their region is lower
than the national average, that capital investment there is less per capita than in the
other provinces, and that job opportunities,
especially for young people, are fewer than
in other regions.
You may ask what is the cause of this
unhappy situation, and I would have to tell
you I cannot give a complete or satisfactory
answer. Many and varied reasons have been
put forward to account for the situation which
exists. I shall mention a few of them just
to illustrate why we believe we are entitled
to special treatment by the federal Government.
There is still a belief-in Nova Scotia, at
any rate-that our special problems have their
roots in the very fact of Confederation itself.
Those who hold this view claim that, by becoming a part of Canada we lost our natural
trade advantages and broke our logical trading pattern, with the result that our new trade
with central Canada could never develop as
it would have developed with the United
States. Others will say that our situation is
due to the lack of natural resources and our
own inability to adjust to changing economic
conditions.
But the most widely held belief and conviction is that our lack of economic growth

DECEMBER 12, 1962
and development results from the trade, tariff
and transportation policies of federal Governments over the years. It is believed that
such policies had the tendency to build up
large industry in central Canada and, as a
result, small, local industry in the Atlantic
region could not continue to exist.
It may be that all the reasons I have mentioned have contributed to our problem. In
any event, I do not think it would serve any
useful purpose to discuss old grievances at this
time. Because, whatever the reason may be,
the hard fact remains that our economic
growth and development has not kept pace
with that of the rest of Canada and, as a
consequence, there exists in the Atlantic region a special problem or situation which not
only requires but demands special treatment
and action by the federal authority.
I may say we feel that necessary action
must be taken by the federal Government, for
we are convinced the provincial governments
do not have the necessary financial resources
and, in some cases, the legislative jurisdiction
required to attack the complex problems involved. This is not intended to minimize in
any way the work which bas been done by
the provincial governments involved. They
have been active; they have worked hard and
have done much to encourage and stimulate
economic development. And the people themselves have been active through local groups
in cities and towns, through the Atlantic
Provinces Economic Council, and other organizations. The problems facing us have been
examined and investigated by these groups,
especially by the A.P.E.C. organization. As a
result of their investigations, I believe it is
realized that to foster, encourage and stimulate economic growth and development in the
area, an Atlantic Development Board of some
kind is necessary.
I think I should interject here that I would
not want the impression to be taken from my
remarks that in the past federal governments
have not assisted the Atlantic provinces. They
have assisted us but, generally speaking,
special assistance was given in response to a
specific request for aid, as in the case of the
coal industry, the fishing industry, and the
agricultural industry. While such assistance
was of great value at the time it was rendered
and while special financial assistance bas been
of considerable benefit, yet it is belleved that
the whole problem of the lack of economic
growth should be attacked in a systematic
way.
The purpose of the bill now before us is
to establish the Atlantic Development Board.
It will consist of five members together with
such staff as is necessary for the conduct of
its business, and it may also engage the

services of persons having technical or specialized knowledge. As its objects and powers
require it to inquire into measures and projects which would foster economic growth, it
follows that the proposed board is an advisory
one, and that the responsibility will rest with
the federal Government to put the recommendations of the board into action. Personally, I think this is a good feature of the
bill, although I realize others may feel that
the board should be provided with certain
financial grants and be authorized to use them
to undertake such projects as it thinks best.
However, we can anticipate there will be a
large number of proposals placed before the
board-many perhaps of equal merit and
importance-and if the board had to decide
which to proceed with first, or the priority
to be assigned, then it could well lose some
of the respect and confidence we hope it will
enjoy.
Already various proposals have been made
as to projects the board should investigate in
the different provinces, and in Nova Scotia
I know we feel it should examine not only
the possibilities of having new industries
established, but also the means whereby existing industry could be strengthened, improved
and expanded-industries like steel, coal, fishing and agriculture.
Personally, I would like to see the board
investigate as to what the effect would be on
the market for Nova Scotia apples in Great
Britain if that country decides to enter the
Common Market. I do not mention this from
a selfish point of view, although I am a grower
of apples and have been for many years, but
only to illustrate the manner in which such
a board could render valuable service.
Most of the Annapolis Valley apple crop
is sold in Great Britain, and the growers
would like to know just what effect, if any,
the entry of Great Britain into the Common
Market would have on this business. We know
that some Common Market countries are large
producers of apples, and if we are to be
adversely affected we would like to know it
in good time so that the growers could seek
new markets for their crops. If Government
assistance should be needed to obtain such
new markets or for any period of adjustment,
then the board could make the necessary
recommendations. If it turned out that there
would be no injury to our present apple
market should Britain join the Common
Market, the board could give a realistic
appraisal of the possibility of new markets,
for example, in the West Indies and other
countries.

ATLANTIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Choquette for the second reading of Bill C-94,
to provide for the establishment of an
Atlantic Development Board.
Hon. Harold Connolly: Honourable senators,
it is not often that I inflict myself upon this
house. If, therefore, in the preface to the
remarks I propose to make upon this bill, I
appear to deviate somewhat from the issues
at hand I would ask your indulgence.
I should like to comment briefly on what
I regard as a very serious situation in this
country-serious to every citizen of Canada.
It is a political situation, not in the narrow
partisan sense, having to do with political
philosophies and the future of the Canada in
the political realm.
In the days of my youth there was a twoparty system in Canada. People were either
Liberals or Conservatives. As the years have
passed by there has developed in this country
a multiplicity of political parties with varying political philosophies, and I wonder, as do
many hundreds of thousands of Canadians,
what the future will bring.
I gaze across the ten provinces of this
country, and in three of the four western
provinces I find governments which are diametrically opposed to the philosophies of the
two old-line parties.
There are in Quebec several disturbing and
disruptive political entities, aside from the
old-line parties. In the Atlantic Provinces,
where there is definite solidity in respect to

political thinking-perhaps not more so than
in most parts of Canada but there is the
traditional type of thought which clings
closely to the status quo, which believes in
the things that are good, which holds that
the greatest truths are the oldest truthsthere is much soul searching as to the developments of the moment.
I say this with every bit of earnestness
that I can summon up and by way of warning
to my own party and to the other major
party in this country, that unless we come
to grips with the problems which beset the
Canadian people, and abandon this game of
political bingo with bigger and bigger prizes
being offered almost every day to the electorate, we are apt to find ourselves off the
rails with consequences that none of us can
easily visualize.
Honourable senators, I would hope, therefore, that our approach to this bill and to all
worthwhile legislation-and I designate this
as worthwhile legislation-will not be designed merely to catch votes, but that it will
be designed, first, to rectify such injustices,
economic and otherwise, as may exist, and,
second, with an eye to the future of Canada
so that its real potential may one day be
realized.
Now I pass directly to the bill itself. I
have read much and heard much of the
discussions concerning it. I have heard it
suggested that the bill is a useless thing.
I cannot concur in that kind of thinking.
Nothing is useless where the intent is worth
while. If it is a weak bill, that is another
matter altogether, but I decry the thinking
which labels it useless.
Honourable senators, in the provinces which
this bill pretends te affect there are a million
and a half people who for almost a hundred
years have been forced by the economie and
fiscal system of this country to live as secondrate citizens. In its intent, this bill at least
offers some little hope. Of course it is not
the best bill that can be produced. Ministers
of the Government in the other place acknowledge that fact, so I am not bordering
on political controversy when I merely reiterate what has been suggested already.
On the contrary, it is the only tangible
gesture in more than thirty-five years since
the Duncan Commission of 1926-which to me
indicates a rather despicable way of governing any country-that has been offered to
the people of the Atlantic provinces. By way
of an aside I offer this suggestion-though we
may have to summon all our Christian charity
to regard it as worth while-would we not
be better off to recognize it as a first step,
no matter how feeble that step may be.
Early this spring, before the most recent
election, the Prime Minister of Canada said,

DECEMBER 13, 1962
.:among other things, two important things
to the people of the Atlantic region. He intimated that an industrial development board
,of some kind would be set up to plumb the
problems of those four provinces. He said
very specifically that within the next ten
years one billion dollars would pour from
the federal treasury into those four provinces
to assist in their industrial development.
No man reaches the high office of Prime
.Minister unless he has high qualities, and it
would be ridiculous for any of us, no matter
of what political leaning, to assume otherwise.
Therefore, I assume that the Prime Minister
meant what he said, because I cannot imagine
that a man occupying such an illustrious post
would make statements of that kind without
the proper intent.
However, I suggest to you that the Prime
Minister has not had from his associates in
Government the right and proper sort of cooperation in this effort. He has been badly
advised and badly let down, because this bill
is, I have to confess, almost innocuous.
The people of the Atlantic provinces expected a robust approach to their industrial
problems. They knew, of course, that in the
beginning and for quite some time nothing
of a startling nature would be produced because for almost one hundred years we have
lived as we have lived, and men are not so
gifted that they can reach into the ether and
produce cures for problems that have so long
existed. However, they did expect a sound
healthy baby which would grow to adulthood with resultant benefit to the people of
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward
Island and Newfoundland. Yet they have
found, so they say in letters to me, and I am
sure to others, that instead of a healthy baby
they have been handed an immature, premature embryo, obviously the result of a forceps delivery, and that is not to their liking.
I am confounded and confused, and in my
simplicity you will recognize a reason for my
confusion by this multiplicity of boards that
have suddenly been showered upon us. Before I proceed to deal with that point, may I
say that I have no patience with boards. I
have less patience with governments, whether
they are Liberal, Conservative, or any other
political tinge, which abdicate their authority
to boards-boards which all too often are
made up of people who have a most impractical approach to the problems they are
asked to investigate, who view them from an
abstract platform from which there is little
hope of anything of a practical nature being
done.
When I think of the millions of words that
have gone into reports of boards and royal
commissions, sufficient to start a bonfire to
burn continuously for ten years, and most of

which I am sure are thrown into wastepaper
baskets, and out of which nothing of any
real lasting benefit ever came, I question why
governments who seek election to office and
accept as candidates men who are presumed
to know the problems of their particular area
do not take advantage of that knowledge, regardless of whether it comes from members
of the Government or of the Opposition. However, that is only an aside.
As I have said, I am astounded and confused by the multiplicity of boards which
exist at the moment. There is the National
Productivity Council. I have a bill on my
desk entitled, "An Act to provide for the
establishment of a National Economic Development Board," as well as the bill which
is now before us, "An Act to provide for the
establishment of an Atlantic Development
Board." One would think that we in the
Maritime provinces were outcasts of a sort.
I assure you that we are not Freedomites; we
are Canadians from a long time back, Canadians of average, normal intelligence, Canadians who are prepared to work, Canadians
who have added to the illustrious records of
Canada-and that goes for all four provinces
of the Atlantic region. Where do we fit, for
example, in respect to the National Productivity Council? Are we inside or outside its
scope? Where do we fit in respect to the
National Economic Development Board? Are
we merely an agency of this organization? Is
it sufficient to say that the chairman of this
Atlantic Development Board will also be a
member of the national board? Is this giving
the problems of a million and a half people
in this country the attention they require?
I am astounded, too, at the attitude of
the ministers of the Governinent. When I
say that this bill was ill-conceived, nothing
could more accurately attest to that fact
than the apparent confusion that exists in
Government ranks, with one minister terming as ridiculous the proposed salary of
$3,000 for the chairman of the board, and
still another saying that somebody would
determine what the exact salary would beindeed an amendment was passed to that
effect-and also saying that the salary would
depend upon the type of individual, the
amount of work that he does and the results
achieved. What a hodgepodge! What are we
unsuspecting citizens of the Atlantic provinces
expected to deduce from this needless confusion within Government ranks?
I think it is obvious that a part-time
board with a part-time chairman cannot
possibly hope to accomplish the task with
which it will be saddled. And I wonder, too,
exactly what the board is going to do. I
know what the bill says it will do: it will
report its findings to a minister, presumably

SENATE
one of the ministers from the Atlantic provinces, and it will keep an eye on developments,
and so on-the language leaves nothing to be
desired. There is nothing wrong with the
intent. It is with the potential execution that
I am concerned.
Speaking of execution, may I point out
that for many years in the Atlantic provinces
we have been carrying on research with
respect to our own difficulties. As has been
said before in this house, many worthwhile
organizations have engaged in that effort,
such organizations as the Atlantic Provinces
Economic Council, the Maritime Transportation Commission, the Research Foundation of
Nova Scotia, the Associated Boards of Trade
of the province, and kindred services; and
there is on hand within these four Atlantic
provinces a vast accumulation of information
bearing on every problem which affects their
million and a half people.
Surely then there is no need for this board
to make inquiry, since every inquiry that
could possibly be made bas been made, and
each is fortified with decisions, and any one
with an average knowledge of English would
be able to interpret them.
Questions were asked in another place
about the size of this board. It was said on one
occasion that the board should be enlarged
to fifteen. To me such a number would be a
nuisance, and would simply nullify or
seriously impede the work of the organization.
Perhaps I should say what kind of board I
would like to see, since I have been so bold
as to express certain strong views. Here is
an opportunity for Maritime newspaper
editors to huddle over their typewriters and
go to work. It would be a board without a
single citizen of the Maritime provinces on
it. It would be a board composed of three
men drafted, if necessary, because of their
commercial and industrial knowledge-just
as we drafted the dollar-a-year men in the
propagation of the war effort, because,
honourable senators, this too is a war. True,
it is a commercial war, but it is nonetheless
a war and its outcome is vital not only to
our section of Canada but to the whole country because, as one illustrious member of
this chamber said to me just before I came
in, what benefits the Atlantic region will
undoubtedly benefit the rest of Canada. I
hope that is true, but whether it is true
or not, is it fair that one segment of our
population, the people in four out of our ten
provinces, should have been compelled to
suffer so acutely over so long a period of
time, through no real fault of their own?
The honourable sponsor of this bill (Hon.
Mr. Welch) dealt yesterday, and most effectively, with some of the thinking in the

Atlantic provinces with respect to our
economic plight. He said, and truly, that it
is largely as a result of the tariff policies
of this country. Of course he is right. But
in fairness it should also be said that it is
partly our own responsibility, for we have
not been entirely blameless.
The great need in the Atlantic area is for
money. We are a poor section of Canada, and
if it were entrusted to me to inquire into
these problems I would operate in this
fashion: I would concentrate on the fundamental industries of each of the four provinces, and I would extract from them their
utmost potential. Far too many people, when
they think of industry, think of it in terms
of smokestacks belching smoke up into the
clouds. Of course that is a part of industry,
but let me suggest what could be done in the
Maritime provinces. In Newfoundland, there
could be proper development of the fishing
industry; in Nova Scotia, the proper direction
of the coal industry. And on that point, may
I say this, and I say it without acrimony but
by way of carrying on the argument because
I believe in it, that each and every year
hundreds of thousands of Canadians dig
deeply into their pockets and extract millions
of dollars to subsidize the automobile industry
of Ontario. If that is a good policy, would
it not also be a good policy to dig equally
deep to subsidize the coal industry of Nova
Scotia? In Prince Edward Island there could
be development of the agricultural resources,
because there the potential bas never been
reached; and in New Brunswick, the development of the forest industry.
Honourable senators, this is a subject upon
which any citizen of the Atlantic provinces
could talk endlessly and perhaps ad nauseam.
All we ask for in Atlantic Canada is that
our children should have opportunities at
least comparable to those of Canadian children in other provinces. Is that too much to
ask? If this bill does not do so-and at the
moment it does not-it can be amended so
that it will do these things which require
doing. I do not need to point out to any
member of the Senate, no matter what may
be his place of residence, that of itself this
bill does nothing except set up a board to
take a look at the problems. That is all it
does. There is not the expenditure of a dollar,
except by inference, involved in the bill-a
part-time board, a part-time chairman.
Honourable senators, this is inadequate. It
is not the implementation of the pledge made
to the people of Atlantic Canada by the
Prime Minister, and to me it is a matter of
regret that a man charged with the responsibility of that high office does not have the

DECEMBER 13, 1962

cpportunity to look at and scrutinize closely
every piece of legislation that is presented
to him by his subordinates.
Honourable senators, I have just about come
to the end of what I have to say. I have
already told you that I would make the
board one of three members, drafted for their
technical knowledge, men who have shown
that they have the knowhow, men with
proven background and experience, men who
can dip into this well of information that is
available to them in those four provinces and
come up with some worthwhile answers.
I suggest that the Government of Canada,
of its own volition, without an Atlantic development board, can give us possibly as
much assistance as any by rectifying this
iniquitous system of university grants which
treats us like poor cousins, almost like
paupers, which hampers our universities, and
which, to a people as prideful as those of the
Atlantic region, is a serious disservice. Give
to the universities in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and New Brunswick at least the national average of university grants. Is there anything wrong with
that? I repeat, it is something the Government can do without a commission or board
of any kind.
In addition to university grants there is
a multitude of things which can be done, but
I will not bore you with an enumeration of
them. One predominant matter which can
also be handled by Government, no matter
what its political label, without access or
reference to any board, is trade-freer and
freer trade. Give the Maritime people in the
east the opportunity to trade in their natural
markets. Wipe out this present tariff structure;
give us the opportunity to buy goods where
we can buy them more cheaply, and make our
dollars worth more to us. Let us associate
ourselves with the European Common Market
and the tariff proposals of the President of
the United States. I venture to say that in
a reasonably short space of time we shall not
need handouts, we shall not need Atlantic
development boards, because essentially our
outlook is on the oceans of the world; our
forefathers traded on the Seven Seas, and
with more money being made available to us
we can do likewise.
Honourable senators, I have concluded. I
hope I have not given any offence; such was
not my intention. I speak to you as a citizen
of the Atlantic provinces, deeply inpressed
with the needs, and fearful of the lot of claptrap that may ensue because of the lack of
specific terms in this legislation now before
us, and because the money which we need is
only in the far-off distance. But because it is

an earnest expression of intention, I intend
to support the bill as I hope all honourable
senators will.
Hon. G. Percival Burchih: Honourable
senators, at the outset may I express my
appreciation to the Leader of the Government
and those associ(Hon. Mr. Brooks)
ated with him on that side of the house for
allowing me the opportunity of making a few
observations on this measure this afternoon.
Before I deal with the bill now before us,
Mr. Speaker, may I be allowed to concur in
all the complimentary remarks that previous
speakers have made about you, during
this session and also about your predecessor
in office (Hon. Mr. Drouin), about my old
friend the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Brooks) and his predecessor in office (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine). I concur most warmly in those
sentiments. I would also like to say how
much we miss my old friend the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake, Senator Horner,
who, in the years he has been in this house,
has been a diligent and faithful worker,
especially when he was in the Opposition and
they were few in number. I am sure all
honourable members miss him very much
and hope that he will soon return in good
health.
Now, following my friend from Halifax
North (Hon. Mr. Connolly), and as a fellowrepresentative of the Atlantic provinces, I
want to say first of all that we gladly
acclaim any legislation which seeks to
improve conditions in those provinces. However, I would be less than frank if I did not
say that I cannot agree with, nor can I be
as enthusiastic as, the honourable Minister of
National Revenue in the other house when,
in introducing the bill, he said that the proposed legislation is the most forward step
ever taken in his lifetime for the benefit of
the Atlantic provinces, and that it has tremendous possibilities which will increase the
level of income there and will contribute to
greatly increased employment in the Atlantic
provinces.
Now I, in common with every member
representing the Atlantic provinces, welcome
any gesture designed to assist the provinces
on the Atlantic seaboard, but surely the idea
embodied in this legislation is not new or
untried, for our provincial authorities individually and collectively over the years
have done much in this respect. APEC, for
instance, which Senator Fergusson described
so well, is very active as a fact-finding body,
and brings together the industrial leaders of
the four provinces in a deliberate assembly
which makes recommendations for the encouragement of industry and the development
of natural resources. Senator Fergusson, as

SENATE
reported in the Hansard of October 25, described the policies and the objectives of
APEC as being three in number. She said:
First: research or to get the facts.
Much has been done along this line.
Second: to foster co-operation within the
region. Third: the promotion of interest
in the support of the region for industrial
development.
APEC, as I say, is a very active organization and has done much in the last few
years in the Atlantic provinces, and in addition there have been other provincial bodies
which have been active over the years in
work of a similar nature.
Away back in 1928 the premiers and other
members of the governments of the three
Maritime provinces, accompanied by delegates
from the Boards of Trade of many cities and
towns, undertook a crusade to Toronto where
they were entertained by the Maritime
Provinces Club of that city, comprised of
many prominent and distinguished former
Maritimers living in Toronto. As a result of
that mission, the Maritime Provinces Trade
Commission was established with the object
of stimulating trade between the Maritimes
and Ontario which was, as it is today, largely
a one-way street.
That commission was non-partisan, and was
composed of representatives of the three provinces. I recall that the late A. D. Ganong
and I represented New Brunswick; the late
Governor Frank Stanfield and Mr. Marshall,
secretary of the Halifax Board of Trade,
represented Nova Scotia; and the late Honourable Walter Lea, Premier of Prince Edward
Island, and Mr. Boulter, Deputy Minister of
Agriculture, were the Prince Edward Island
delegates. We appointed as commissioner the
late Mr. R. W. E. Burnaby, and we established an office in Toronto with field representatives in the Maritimes. It is too long a
story to relate here, but the commission, born
under a Conservative administration in New
Brunswick, when the late Chief Justice, J. B.
M. Baxter was premier, was allowed to die,
and was buried under the same Conservative
administration under the leadership of the
late Chief Justice Honourable C. D. Richards.
Many of those who were active in the beginning resigned because of lack of interest and
slow progress, but I was present until the
end and was a pallbearer at the funeral.
While nothing much was accomplished, we
did become convinced that water will not run
uphill.
In 1935, when the late Honourable Angus
L. Macdonald came into power in Nova Scotia,
one of the first things he did was to dispatch
a young man to the United Kingdom to make
an effort to regain our traditional market

there for our eastern spruce lumber. That
gentleman is our present colleague, the
Honourable Wishart Robertson. We had lost
that market when England suddenly went off
the gold standard a few years previously, and
it is interesting to note that this matter of
foreign exchange, which has been prominent
in Canadian politics in recent times, has
always been an important factor in the
fortunes of the Canadian exporter. I recall
that on that occasion, when conditions were
about as bad as they could be in the Maritime
provinces and great numbers were on relief,
the Premier of New Brunswick called into
Fredericton all the lumber operators and
demanded that we start woods operations and
provide jobs for the unemployed.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I ask the honourable senator what year he is speaking of
now?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Between 1930 and 1935.
You were in the house at that time.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The depression of course
was all across Canada.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Exactly. We pointed out
to the premier that there was a market in
the United Kingdom, but that the low rate
of exchange made it impossible for us to
compete with the Scandinavians, Swedes,
Finns and Russians who had taken over our
market because they were trading in sterling
currency. It will be remembered that at that
time the pound sterling dropped over night
from the traditional $4.86§ to around $3.60
He got in touch with the then Prime Minister
of Canada, the late Viscount Bennett, but
without results.
When the late Honourable A. L. Dysart
became Premier of New Brunswick he at
once appointed a New Brunswick Industrial
Development Commission of which the late
Doctor John Stephens was chairman, and
which was composed of many prominent and
representative business leaders of New Brunswick. That board carried on through the war
years; and after the war, under the McNair
administration, another board was set up of
which I had the honour of being a member,
under the chairmanship of Dr. Rowley, who
was brought to the province to head the board,
whose terms of reference included the investigation and appraisal of any and all
projects which would further industrial
activity, and to initiate new developments.
When Premier Flemming assumed power
in New Brunswick his government continued
the effort by establishing a Forest Products
Development Board under the chairmanship
of Dr. John Bates, and another board, under

DECEMBER 13, 1962
the chairmanship of Colonel Gates, was
named to recommend suitable projects and
advise on financing.
Premier Robichaud bas appointed a similar
body, which bears the name "The Resources
and Productivity Council," consisting of
thirteen members whose function is to accelerate research, to encourage and provide
the means for it in our universities, and to
otherwise encourage the establishment of
industries to develop our natural resources.
All through the years the Department of
Industry in New Brunswick has been most
active and helpful.
Anyone who bas read the newspapers since
1949 is familiar with what bas been accomplished in Newfoundland. I will not attempt
to catalogue the provincial enterprises which
have been created there; I leave that to
those who represent Newfoundland in this
chamber. In Nova Scotia the history has been
similar to that of New Brunswick, about
which I have told you. Over the years they
have had similar bodies advising and recommending and, at the present time, the industrial estates consisting of leading industrialists and financiers have done a grand
job of attracting and locating industry and,
I understand, have excellent prospects ahead.
But this board not only finds new industry;
it has funds available for capital financing
to assist industries in getting established in
what it recommends as being sound ventures,
and that is the whole point of my remarks.
After a lifetime of experience of acting on
many of these boards, during which publicspirited citizens have given of their time and
effort freely and voluntarily, it is my opinion
that the fact all new industries required
capital financing which was not available
was one of the serlous road-blocks, and still
is, in our part of the world.
I cannot say too much for the commercial
banks, but they do not supply capital funds;
and I do not think an Industrial Development
Bank, with its head office in Ottawa, will
ever be the answer as a source of long-term
funds for manufacturing plants in the Atlantic provinces.
There are many industries at present in
both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and
also, I presume, in the other provinces-certainly in Newfoundland-employing many
people and contributing much to the prosperity of the provinces, and these industries
would not be there if the provincial governments had not assisted in making the necessary capital available for their establishment.
I want to quote from the December issue
of the Atlantic Monthly in its report on
Ireland. I find it most interesting.
The government of Sean Lemass is
keenly aware of the need to industrialize.

It has set up an Industrial Development
Authority, backed by an Industrial Credit
Company, which bas achieved remarkable results in efforts to attract foreign
capital and knowhow. Here are some of
them:
In the last five years 130 new industries have been introduced from outside the country, a dozen of them
American. They have included such
diverse projects as the manufacture of
transistors by the Japanese firm of Sony,
of precision instruments by SPS International of the United States, of cranes
and excavators by Leibherr of Germany,
and of radio equipment by Phillips of
Holland. The Israelis are making razor
blades in County Carlow, and the Italians silk ties in County Cavan.
More than 1800 people are working in
small firms set up at Shannon Airport.
These firms have total exemption from
income and corporation taxes on profits
from goods exported until 1983. The
project, which bas special privilege, is
primarily intended to save Shannon Airport, now bypassed by jets from the
European mainland bound for America.
The goods produced at Shannon are all
transportable by air-even the grand
pianos of the Rippen firm of Holland.
In the last five years capital in Irish
industry bas been increased by $85 million as a result of the introduction of
foreign firms. Less than one quarter of
this amount has been provided by government grants. More than 21,000 new
jobs have been created. Indirectly, employment bas been given to the hotels,
the catering trade, and building firms.
Honourable senators, the Atlantic Development Board is a very welcome gesture towards our provinces, but results will not flow
from it until it is provided with some source
of long-term financing for capital projects.
We must overhaul our financial setup so that
this kind of money will be made available
to supplement private investment.
If I may make a personal reference, I will
mention that I have just gone through the
experience of being associated in the establishment of a new industry in these provinces, the manufacture of plywood from our
native spruce. People in the Atlantic provinces
use a lot of plywood, and it is just one more
commodity that bas to be imported. Therefore, I know whereof I speak when I talk
about the difficulty of finding money for such
projects. Some way will have to be found,
either by the employment of a revolving
capital account or by the establishment of an

SENATE
Atlantic provinces development bank, sponsored by the federal Government, or by the
governments of the four Atlantic provinces.
While I am on that topic, honourable senators, I want to point out, because I do not
think it has been realized before, that even
the Small Loans Act, which we amended last
session, contains no provision for guaranteeing a bank against loss on loans made for
the establishment of a business. In other
words, the business must be in operation
before the act applies.
It must be remembered that we face the
east on the Atlantic seaboard. We face Europe,
and that is the direction in which our markets lie. Over there, governments are in
business, in some countries altogether and in
others as partners with private enterprise,
and venture capital and credit is not lacking.
That is the kind of competition we face. I
want to assure this house that initiative,
future thinking, enterprise and ability to work
are not lacking in the people of the Atlantic
provinces.
A lady in Ottawa told me not so long ago
that when she was travelling through one of
the Atlantic provinces she stopped to talk to
a fisherman who was deploring the state of
the country, and in the course of her remarks she said, "It is too bad that all the
brains have gone from the Atlantic provinces."
To which he replied, "My dear lady, that is
not true; it takes a lot of brains to stay here
in the Atlantic provinces and make a living."
Honourable senators, I wish to emphasize
that the people there are eager and anxious
to work at something which is useful, if
they receive the wherewithal. While I have
due respect for advisory boards and all they
do, my conclusion is that if the federal Government or any other authority gives us the
tools, we will do the job.
Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators,
I am going to support this bill and in saying
so I really mean the truth of that remark. I
am supporting it not because of what is in
it but because of its great possibilities. The
effectiveness of the legislation will depend
on the board appointed, on the newspapers of
the Atlantic provinces, and on the people
who live there. The Lord helps those who
help themselves and does not help those who
sleep. Unless we in the Atlantic provinces
see that this measure is properly carried out,
it will not be effective.
The learned and eloquent senator from
Halifax, Senator Connolly, said that he, unlike others, did not think this was a foolish
or useless act. He regarded it as a first step.
Then he damned it with the most damnable
praise, net even the faintest praise. He remarked that Nova Scotians have been, for a
century or more, real Canadians. Fortunately

or unfortunately, we Newfoundlanders cannot lay claim to that, since it is only twelve
years since we became Canadians. Nevertheless, judging by the characteristics the
senator cited, Newfoundlanders are not very
different from Nova Scotians. We eat, sleep,
talk and dream just the same as those people
mentioned in the eloquent speech of the
worthy senator from Halifax North.
My friend Senator Burchill opposite said
he did net believe in the praise which was
given to the act by the minister when be
called it a foremost step. I may not believe
it is the foremost step, but I say that it may
turn out to be the foremost step, and it is a
real step. If we read this measure properly
we shall find it is not as innocuous as he or
the honourable senator from Halifax thinks.
Honourable senators, let me deviate a little
in speaking of some matters which may not
at first sight seem appropriate to the bill.
In one respect, Canada has not exalted itself.
Rather should I say Canadians have in one
respect not exalted themselves. I spoke of this
matter before. Canada has given ber children
many wonderful things. Apart from the
natural resources and a fertile soil throughout the country, she has given much of
beauty. Like all Canadians, I can talk of
that beauty. Beauty is something essential
to a province; it makes the soul of the
province.
I have beheld the Rockies, that vast massive cliff "whose awful grandeur terrifies the
glance its magnificence has attracted". I have
viewed the cameo elegance of Lake Louise.
I have seen the comprehensive glory that is
Banff. I have watched the vast immensity
of the Great Lakes of Canada. I have stood
transfixed in admiration at the panoramic
beauties of the eastern portion of Canada.
I have wandered over its verdant fields and
its colourful valleys. I have seen the pomp
of autumn create what only the mind of God
could dream and only the hand of God could
mould. I have noted the majesty of noble
rivers meandering to the sea. One can wax
eloquent over the treasures that Canada gives
to her children. One can speak in the most
glowing terms and one does not exaggerate
in the slightest by the tone of one's voice or
words the real beauty of Canada.
However, honourable senators, there is a
dark side to this picture. What are Canadians
doing to preserve the beauty of Canada?
Where is the history of the past? Where are
the old historic sites? Are they here still or
are they gone? Are they interred in the urns
of mortality? Have Canadians ignored the
admonition of Joseph Howe, who said:
A wise nation preserves its records,
gathers up its muniments, decorates the

DECEMBER 13, 1962

tombs of its illustrious dead, repairs its
great public structures and fosters national pride and love of country by perpetual reference to the sacrifices and
glories of the past.
How have Canadians kept the memory of
the historic past? I have seen beautiful old
houses, redolent of the historic past, torn
down to be replaced by the chocolate houses
made according to the architectural principles
of this modern day.
Only a short while ago, the West Block of
this beautiful pile of buildings was threatened
with demolition in order to have it replaced
by a modern building. Can one imagine such
an atrocity? Can one imagine that anyone
could bring up such a thought? Can one imagine the discord of beauty that would be
created by having a modern building against
these other two beautiful structures which
have -excited the admiration of hundreds of
thousands, yea, millions of people from all
over the world? Do you think people would
come here to see two beautiful piles, with a
modern building attached to them? I was told
that even the East Block was threatened about
50 years ago.What are we coming to in Canada?
I hope this will not occur. I hope that the
board to be set up by the Government will be
composed of intelligent men with lofty and
not iconoclastie ideas, men of learning and
culture, who will see that these buildings will
never be touched at all except for necessary
repairs.
What are the cities doing? There is one
city where this sort of thing should not happen. Quebec has still the charm and grace of
a day that has long gone by. Charm and
grace have come back again to make gracious
at least one man-made spot in Canada.
There is another city, a smaller city, and
not of such ancient vintage as Quebec, which
has still the same lofty ideas of culture. That
is the city of Halifax. It is a pleasure to visit
that city and see how the people and the
authorities throughout the years have preserved the old buildings and historie sites. It
is a city which I am sure is visited by a large
number of people just to see those old buildings and sites.
I wish I could say the same of my own city
of St. John's, my birthplace, the oldest inhabited city or town on this side of the world.
Just this past September, there could have
been commemorated the last battle fought
between the French and English for the conquest of Canada, the Battle of Signal Hill,
which was fought three years after the Battle
of the Plains of Abraham. I referred to that
battle in one of my speeches in the last
session. However, I regret to say that not
much interest was taken, apart from what

was published in one newspaper, which set
out my remarks in full.
This year in St. John's not the slightest interest was taken in that historie battle. In fact,
only two years previously the municipal council of the city gave to a commercial firm one
of the old lanes of the city, if not the oldest.
lane, and it has been built over by that firm.
That was an illegal act on the part of the
city council, for the council cannot close a
way which has been dedicated to public purposes, unless it is for the benefit of the public-and it was no benefit to the public to bar
it off.
This is the lane which tradition says the
soldiers of the British army went over and
through in order to reach Signal Hill, overlooking St. John's, and capture it. It is one
of the most historie lanes on the entire continent. I trust that this board, which I presume
will be entitled to take under its control the
repairing of old buildings, will see that the
building is torn down, or else that the company will be forced to make a lane through.
it so that tourists will be able to walk over
the place where the British troops walked
300 years ago in order to win the battle for
the ultimate conquest of Canada. If matters,
of that kind come within the jurisdiction of
the board, it will have very strong potentialities.
We have heard recently that it is intended
to re-erect Louisburg as it was in olden days,
as a fort with twenty square miles of land,
and to place it in the same position as when
it was captured. No one will throw criticism
at this tribute to the past, for Louisburg
played a large part in the history of French
Canada and for a long time held a place
second in importance only to Quebec.
Of course we must provide things whereby
we can work and live at ease. After all, in
accordance with commercial ideas we are
entitled to try to make a living. We cannot
enjoy and cherish our historic spots unless
first we have a full stomach. When we are
hungry we cannot look on things as we
should.
Let the board take the fishing industry
seriously. I am speaking mainly of Newfoundland now. The fishery is part and parcel
of Newfoundland. There is scarcely a Newfoundlander who does not know all about the
fishing industry, and I am surprised how few
Nova Scotians know about fish. We have been
brought up among fish. First of all, the board
should see that the Norwegian methods of
fishing are brought into this country. They
are far superior to us in the catching and
processing of fish.
I deeply regret that my old friend and
compatriot from St. John's West, Senator

SENATE
Pratt, is not present here this afternoon. Senator Pratt is a merchant of international
reputation. His markets are all over the
world. He is a man of great comprehension,
and he is deeply versed in all things pertaining to business, particularly in connection
with fish. What is more, he has spent some
time in Norway. He has told me that he was
amazed at the expertness of the Norwegians
in dealing with fish. We have down in Newfoundland caplin, a fish like smelts, which
touch the ocean around various parts of the
island. They are at different places for only
a short time, and they come in tremendous
quantities. You do not talk of them in thousands or hundreds of thousands, but in trillions. They are in such enormous numbers
that only an infinitesimal part of them can
be used, the rest being thrown out as manure
on the fields. There should be some way of
canning these fish; in fact, an attempt has
been made to do so, but the oil becomes
absorbed into the flesh so much that it
becomes a mush. However, I understand that
a Newfoundlander has invented a process and
has sent it to Ottawa for consideration.
May I say that we are definitely lacking in
fisheries research in Ottawa. Do you know
that Newfoundlanders caught squid at one
time, canned it and sent it as far away as
China and made money on it? This board
should find out about foreign markets, of
which there are plenty still available. The
larger part of South America is still untapped.
Why is fish not sent down there? The board
should ascertain what the market wants. Does
it want Spanish cure, dry salted, heavily
salted fish or Madeira? Different parts of the
world want different kinds of fish. In some
hot climates the people take the raw salt fish
and chew it as it is.
The board will have the opportunity of discussing freight rates, and finding out how the
Atlantic provinces are suffering from overcharges. We have to get most of our goods
from Ontario and Quebec, which take very
few from us. You will be surprised to know
that Ontario and Quebec supply well over
$200 million worth of goods to Newfoundland,
and I do not believe they spend a cent in
return for our commodities. Freight rates are
high.
But why do I need to elaborate? The opportunity of the board is tremendous; its
possibilities are limitless. The principle of the
act cannot be criticized. It is impossible to
assess its effectiveness at present; this must
be seen later. It will depend on the financial
assistance allowed, but above all on the
energy and imagination of the board. Its
duties are set out very clearly. Its objects
are stated, and they can be enlarged at the
wish and the whim of the board itself.

An editorial in a St. John's paper, which
I read this morning, says:
The concept of the Atlantic Development Board is sound in principle. It is a
forward step but its prospects must
naturally be considered with some reserve until it has had a chance to show
what it can do.
Let us show what it can do. But let my
honourable friend, Senator Harold Connolly,
praise it as much as it should be praised. Let
him go around and say what should be done,
and tell the board what they should do. If
the board members do what they should do,
they will not be criticized.
The possibilities of the act, as I have stated,
are immense. It lays the groundwork for
great future achievement. The act is very
succinct. It does not set out the amount of
money that will be allowed, and why should
it? What amount of money is necessary is
impossible to decide at present. This is really
an act to create a research board for the
study of problems in a vast country, for the
study of the natural resources and the industries of the Atlantic provinces. When the
board has made its full inquiry and presented
its report of what must be done in order to
assist the Atlantic provinces, then and only
then shall we see the ultimate results of the
act.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hollett, debate
adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
THE PHARMACY EXAMNING BOARD OF
CANADA-REPORT OF COMMITTEE
ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Veniot for consideration of the report of the
Standing Committee on Public Health and
Welfare with respect to Bill S-15, an Act to
incorporate The Pharmacy Examining Board
of Canada.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I yield to Senator Kinley.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I must thank Senator Pouliot for his courtesy
in yielding to me.
This afternoon we listened with special
attention to speeches by three senators from

DECEMBER 13, 1962
the Maritimes, and counting the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks), also
a Maritime senator, who moved third reading
to the Food and Drugs bill, I am the fifth
Maritimer to speak this afternoon. My subject will not be as glamorous or interesting,
but it is a routine job and I would like to
finish it this afternoon.
Honourable senators, my role is to explain
some of the amendments that have been made
to this private bill by the Standing Committee
on Public Health and Welfare. The committee
studied the bill and reported it back for our
consideration with certain amendments.
These amendments are all salutary and welcome because this is a bill which we are desirous of having in good form. This is a
Senate bill and it bas yet to go to the House
of Commons for passage there. It deals with
a technical subject, and in its preparation we
have had help from our Law Clerk and men
who are prominent in the legal profession,
and the amendments suggested, I think, will
appeal to the house.
The first amendment is to clause 2, subclause (d), after the word "from" insert,
"or registered by,". With that amendment the
subclause will read as follows:
2. In this Act ...
(d) "qualified pharmacist" means a person holding a licence or authority to
engage in the practice of pharmacy
from, or registered by, any licensing
body.

7. Where any appointing body fails to
appoint a member to the Board within a
reasonable time after a vacancy occurs,
the registrar-treasurer of the Board shall
notify such appointing body by registered
mail of such failure.
The appointing body is the body representative of the societies throughout the provinces,
the secretary and president of the Canadian
Pharmaceutical Association, those connected
with the colleges and the nurses in the
hospitals. They represent the appointing
boards. I think you will find that that leaves
the question of appointments largely to the
provincial bodies. What we objected to in this
was that if a provincial body did not appoint
a member to the board be could be appointed
by the central body. We thought that that was
rather an evasion of the rights of the appointing body, because the appointment would
then fall on people who were perhaps not too
interested; and if the province was not
interested enough to appoint someone to the
board, it may well be because they wanted to
be left off it.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: May I return to my question? I f ail to see where there is any purpose
served by this amendment, because the same
words appear in clause 7, subclause (1).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): But that
has been struck out.

Hon. Mr. Kinley: We are striking out clause
7 completely.
I do not think that needs any explanation;
a licensing body is defined in the same clause.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: But what you are striking
Honourable senators will readily understand out is exactly the same as your amendment.
that a licensing body may differ fron province
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I know. We are moving
to province and the definition was so worded
it up to a more suitable place; it is for better
to cover all cases.
The next amendment is to clause 6-after continuity.
subclause (7) add subclause (8) as follows:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): As I

SENATE
With the amendment it will read:
(2) Nothing in this Act shall ...
The next amendment is:
5. Page 4: Strike out paragraph (b) of
subclause 1 of clause 12.
Clause 12 is one of the sanctioning clauses.
Section 12(1) of the bill now reads:
The Board may direct that the name of
any person be removed from the Register
if such person . .
(b) has been convicted of any indictable
offence under the Criminal Code . . .
The Criminal Code is rather complex. For
instance, a man driving his car might become
involved in an accident which could result in
his being thrown out of work and having his
means of livelihood taken away from him,
because he has committed an offence under
the Criminal Code. Paragraph (b) has been
deleted because individual provincial statutes
cover such an occurrence.
The next amendment is:
6. Page 4: Strike out subclause (2) of
clause 12 and substitute therefor the
following: -

"(2) Where any person registered under
this Act has been registered, licensed or
otherwise authorized to practice pharmacy under the laws of any province and
such registration, license or authority has
been revoked or suspended under the
laws of that province, the Board may
direct that the name of such person be
removed from the Register."
That puts this in the hands of the individual province, and if the province finds a
man is guilty of an offence and must be
excluded from membership of the society, the
amendment to clause 12 would cover that
situation.
7. Page 5, line 39: Strike out "authorized" and substitute therefor the following:"registered".
Clause 15 is an interesting and important
clause, which reads:
Any qualified pharmacist licensed or
registered in any province prior to the
coming into force of this Act shall, after
ten years from the date when he became
so licensed or authorized...
The word "authorized" is to be deleted and
the word "registered" substituted therefor.
With the amendment it reads:
... after ten years from the date when

he became so licensed or registered, be
entitled to be registered under this Act
without examination upon payment of
the prescribed fees.

That is the usual procedure in these circumstances. When bills of this type are enacted
those who have been practising for a long
time and who have a wealth of experience
are registered under the new act, without
examination, upon the payment of the prescribed fees.
Honourable senators, these are the amendments now before the house. I think they are
all good. We have attempted to make this as
good a bill as possible and, of course, it
should stand for a long time. As you know,
dentists have such an organization, as does
the medical faculty, and we want to make
this just as fine an organization for pharmacists. That is why I, as sponsor of the
bill and as one who has had some experience
in the field, worked with the solicitor and
secretary of the Canadian Pharmaceutical
Association, who came here and, along with
the Law Clerk of the Senate, assisted in
making these improvements. We believe the
amendments improve the bill and as a result
will give the body better legislation. The
Law Clerk was present at the meeting of
the committee and approves what we have
done. The Deputy Minister of the Department of National Health and Welfare, and
Dr. Morrell, and Dr. Pugsley, were also in
attendance.
Honourable senators, it is for these reasons
that I move adoption of this report.
Report adopted.
THIRD

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honaurable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
move, with leave of the Senate, that this
bill be read the third time now.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I have just one question
to ask the sponsor of the bill. Will this examining board replace the boards already existing in the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: No. The provinces are
supreme in their own field. This board will
issue certificates which have no virtue in the
individual province unless the province concerned agrees to recognize them. It is hoped
that the enactment of this bill will improve
the standards of education in the profession,
and will assist individual members in moving from one province to another. It is hoped
that there will be reciprocity among the provinces. In the Maritimes we already have reci-

BANKRUPTCY ACT-REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce to whom was referred the Bill
S-2, intituled: "An Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act", have in obedience to the order
of reference of November 8, 1962, examined
the said bill and now report the same with
the following amendments:
1. Page 1: Strike out clause 1.
2. Page 1: Strike out clause 2 and substitute the following:
"1. Sections 114 and 115 of the Bankruptcy
Act are repealed and the following substituted therefor:
'114. The following provisions apply to the
summary administration of estates under this
Act, namely,
(a) all proceedings under this section shall
be entitled "Summary Administration";
(b) the security to be deposited by a trustee under section 8 shall not be required unless directed by the Official Receiver;
(c) notice of the bankruptcy shall be published in the Canada Gazette in the prescribed form but shall not be published in
a local newspaper unless deemed expedient
by the trustee or ordered by the court;
(d) all notices, statements and other documents shall be sent by ordinary mail; and
(e) there shall be no inspectors unless the
creditors decide to appoint them, and if no
inspectors are appointed the trustee, in the
absence of directions from the creditors, may

THE SENATE

Monday, December 17, 1962

The Senate met at 8 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
HON. C. G. POWER, P.C.
FELICITATIONS ON FORTY-FIFTH
ANNIVERSARY IN PARLIAMENT

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Mr. Speaker, be-

fore we proceed with the business of the day,
may I say a few words. I am sure all honourable senators would wish to join me in expressing felicitations and good wishes to one
of our members who is today commencing his
forty-sixth year of continuous service as a
parliamentarian. I refer to the Dean of Parliament, the Honourable C. G. Power. Today is
the anniversary of his first election. He was
first elected to the House of Commons to represent the constituency known as Quebec
South on December 17, 1917, and was reelected in 1921, 1925, 1926, 1930, 1935, 1940,
1945, 1949 and 1953, a total of ten elections,
which constitutes a record equalled by few in
any Parliament.
Even before his election, he was not unknown to the world of politics. He was
brought up in a home where there was a
political atmosphere. His father, who was a
member of Parliament for the constituency
which later became Quebec South, sat in
Parliament until just before his son was
elected.
Our honourable colleague was well known,
especially throughout the province of Quebec,
for another reason. He and his four brothers
were members of a hockey team which
brought the Stanley Cup to Quebec on many
occasions. While playing hockey he learned
the advantage of co-operation and fair play,
qualities which have stood him in very good
stead throughout his political life.
When the First World War broke out
"Chubby," as he was then known and is still
affectionately known to many of his friends,
enlisted and served with distinction and
valour, for which he was decorated with the
Military Cross.
In Parliament he was a doughty fighter,
whether on the defence or on the attack.
He loved the political arena, and I think I can
truly say he came out of every contest with
honour. He bas been in many contests, but
no one has more friends and fewer enemies
throughout Canada and Parliament than has
Chubby Power.

We can truly say that Senator Power is
regarded with admiration and affection by
thousands of friends, known and unknown,
across Canada, and especially those who
served with him in the armed forces in the
First World War. He is so regarded more
especially by those who served in the Royal
Canadian Air Force.
It was the Honourable C. G. Power, then
Minister of National Defence for Air, who
established the Commonwealth Air Training
Plan in Canada. You will recall that under
that plan air training stations were established across Canada to which young men
from all over the Commonwealth came; and
after their training here they went abroad to
fight for the cause of freedom. During the
time when that plan was in effect, there
graduated from the schools in Canada no
fewer than 131,553 air crew personnel. At the
peak of the plan there were 97 flying schools,
including 24 of the Royal Air Force and 184
ancillary units. That operation was a tremendous contribution to the cause of the
Allied Forces during the Second World War.
Chubby Power has had an interesting career
in the political world. At his side through all
his contests has been his devoted wife, and
together they have given their best in service
to Canada. As a member of Parliament, he
was most fortunate in having the devotion
and help of his wife, and in congratulating
him today we also extend to her our very
good wishes.
We are fortunate in having the Honourable
C. G. Power in the Senate. He adds a lustre
and distinction which this chamber would to
a large extent lack without him.
He is a man of wide experience, vigorous
and young in spirit. He is a great parliamentarian and has deep respect for Parliament
as an institution. I am sure all honourable
senators join with me in the hope that
Senator Power will be with us for many years
to come.
Two other members of the Senate were also
elected to Parliament on the same day in 1917
as was the honourable Senator C. G. Power.
I refer to the honourable Senator Crerar, who
unfortunately is not here this evening on
account of illness. He also has had an illustrious parliamentary record and has rendered
major service to our country. Although he has
not been continuously in Parliament, as has
been the honourable Senator Power, he has
contributed greatly to Parliament. We all hope
that Senator Crerar will be with us again
when Parliament reconvenes after the Christmas recess, and will continue with us for
years to come.
Senator Crerar's wife has been a faithful
companion to him at all times and bas been
close to him throughout his career. She too

DECEMBER 17, 1962
bas been unwell, but I understand that she is
recovering. Our good wishes go to both of
them.
The honourable Senator Thomas Vien was
also elected to Parliament on the same day in
1917. His service in Parliament was interrupted for a number of years, when he served
on the then Board of Railway Commissioners.
He has served Parliament with distinction as
Deputy Speaker of the other house and later
as Speaker of this house.
We extend to Senator Vien and his wife
our best wishes for good health, and look forward to the senator being with us when
Parliament reassembles after the Christmas
recess.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
wish to join with the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald,
Brantford) in the eloquent and deserving
tribute he bas paid to three great Canadians.
Probably I have not known these three gentlemen as well as has the Leader of the Opposition, but I have known them long enough and
well enough to know how much the tribute is
deserved.
Like the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I knew of the honourable Senator Power
when he was an outstanding hockey player. I
was always a keen follower of sports and an
admirer of those who took part. I also knew
Senator Power as a soldier. I believe that
while serving in France, he and I had the
honour of belonging to the same brigadethe 5th Brigade. He was with the 22nd Battalion from Quebec and I was with the 26th
Battalion from New Brunswick. Many a time
his battalion relieved mine, as, in turn, our
battalion relieved his. There is one thing
upon which I am sure he and I would not
agree: I have always contended that the 26th
Battalion was the best in the 5th Brigade and
that the 22nd came next.
Senator Power has always excelled in whatever he has undertaken-first, as a young man
in sports, then as a soldier, and for many
years as a statesman in the Parliament of
Canada.
I first came to the House of Commons in
1935, when Mr. Bennett was Leader of the
Opposition, after having put in five quite
stormy years as Leader of the Government.
At one of our first caucuses-and it is not
often one tells the secrets of the caucus-in
discussing the various new members of
Mr. King's cabinet, many remarks, both complimentary and uncomplimentary, were made.
But I recall Mr. Bennett saying that he considered Mr. Power one of the ablest men that
Mr. King had in his cabinet. I have never
forgotten that remark. It struck me as a word
of tribute paid by a very worthy statesman
27511-5-29

to one who had not pulled his punches in any
way-as far as I could judge from reading
Hansard--over the five years that he had
been in opposition to Mr. Bennett.
There is scarcely time tonight to pay the
well-deserved tribute to these men that we
should like to pay. I join the honourable
Leader of the Opposition in wishing Chubby
Power, as we know him so well, many years
of good health and service to his country.
May I say, honourable senators, that when
I succeeded Senator Power as Minister of
Veterans Affairs, I noted, as the honourable
Leader of the Opposition has mentioned, the
affection which Senator Power enjoyed across
Canada. I recall that when I visited veterans'
hospitals and organizations one of the first
things the older men would ask was, "How
is our old friend Chubby Power"? And the
question was always asked with affection
and esteem.
I have also known the other honourable
gentlemen who have been mentioned. It
would be a difficult task to pay an adequate
tribute to three such distinguished men in
the short time available tonight.
Senator Tom Crerar is well known to all.
History will give him a lofty place in the
annals of his country.
I knew Senator Vien when he was Deputy
Speaker in the other place. I also knew
him as chairman of many of the committees
there, and he was recognized as one of the
best committee chairmen we had during
those years.
I feel honoured indeed to pay tribute to
these three distinguished gentlemen. I wish
them all many more years of happiness, and
many more years of service to their country.
Hon. C. G. Power: Honourable senators,
I would be less than human if I were not
intensely moved by the words of the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Brooks), and the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford).
As he was talking I looked across the floor at
my good friend the senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mrs. Quart) and my good friend from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Flynn) and wondered
whether if these speeches had been made
twenty years ago would they have had much
effect on feelings, on the general atmosphere,
which surrounded the electoral combats
which took place in the constituency which
we all three hold so dear.
Honourable senators, it is very difficult to
speak under such circumstances, under a
shower of, for the most part, undeserved
compliments. I have often thought, as one
of my friends bas just reminded me in a
note, such tributes as these are usually given

SENATE
after a senator's passing. There is this advantage in hearing the tributes now, that if a
little too much is said you might suggest that
they are overdone, and that such tributes are
only paid after one becomes a statesman.
As I have said, it is difficult to offer much
in reply under these circumstances. I must
say, however, that the political life has been
a good life, so far as I am concerned. I do
not regret any of it. I enjoy the atmosphere
of politics. After all, politics is the science of
dealing with humanity, and above all other
sciences or arts or studies the most important
activity in this life is that of dealing with
human beings and endeavouring to suit oneself
to the eccentricities and perhaps even the
frailties of humanity.
All my electors were not godly men or
women; they were not all pious; they were
not all holy. In fact, I think probably only a
modicum of such persons who lived in my
constituency supported me to any extent.
It was my ambition to be to my electors the
average man, with his faults, frailties and
sins. Indeed, I think one of the functions of
Parliament is to teach us to understand that
all is not godliness here below, and that if
we are endeavouring to deal with our fellowmen we must deal with them as they are.
I believe that is the great lesson I have
learned in the years I have been in politics.
It is a life that brings its own trials and
tribulations, rebuffs and defeats. But, on the
other hand, one meets loyalty and friendship
with the best that there is in humanity.
Above all, when dealing with adversaries,
not necessarily enemies, as well as when
dealing with friends, and when dealing across
the floor of this chamber or the other place,
one always finds there is comradeship and
friendship. It is a comradeship based on the
understanding and recognition that with all
our faults and all our mistakes, whether we
have acted well or ill, we are all endeavouring to do one thing, the best we can for our
fellowmen. Thank you.

ATLANTIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
December 13, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette for the second
reading of Bill C-94, to provide for the establishment of an Atlantic Development Board.
Hon. Malcolm Holleti: Honourable senators,
I think I would be remiss if I did not personally join in the hearty congratulations
offered by this house to the honourable Senator Power. While listening to the tributes
that were being paid to him, my memory
went back across the 46 years that the honourable senator has been in politics to the
time when I ran into a shell in France, the
anniversary of which event I celebrated only
twenty days ago. I mention this because I
am very happy to have been spared to come
back and sit in this house with the honourable Senator Power.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) also referred
to the fact that Senator Power was head of
the Commonwealth Air Training Plan in
Canada. Having had the honour of having
my eldest son trained under that air training
plan, I know you will pardon my reference
to these matters. Perhaps as we get older we
27511-5-294

like to recall events of early days; my mind
went back to these things and I felt I had
to mention them. I wish to take this opportunity of offering my personal congratulations
to the honourable senator.
In rising to speak to Bill C-94, which is
aimed at fostering the economic growth and
development of the Atlantic provinces, I
shall endeavour to confine my remarks chiefly
to the possible relationship which this bill
may have to the particular province from
which I come, Newfoundland. At this stage
may I say that I find it rather difficult to
understand the meaning of some of the
remarks made both here and in other places
relative to the proposed Atlantic Development Board, nor do I quite understand the
comments of some of the editorials which
have been written concerning it. For instance,
in an editorial in the Ottawa Citizen the
following appears:
This bill has been received with less
than enthusiasm by Opposition parties in
the House of Commons.
I repeat "with less than enthusiasm by the
Opposition parties in the House of Commons." That is rather strange.
Furthermore it quotes Premier Smallwood
of Newfoundland as saying that he will remain uninterested until the board is provided
with both money and authority. How true to
form is this remark by our premier! All the
adverse criticism of this bill seems to be
based on the fact that, because the Government has not already proposed legislation
providing for the expenditure of several billions of dollars, the bill is of no value. I
would like to point out that we on this side
of the house, at any rate, believe that it is
more important first to formulate a policy
based on sound economic principles, and then
set about finding the money for its implementation.
The honourable senator from Halifax North
(Hon. Mr. Connolly)-I am sorry he is not
present tonight-for whom I have the greatest
respect, especially for his multiplicity of
words and his ability to put them togetherstarted his speech here last week by saying
that it is indeed a worthwhile piece of legislation, and that it is the only tangible gesture
yet made toward the economic development
of the Atlantic provinces during a period of
35 years. That is quite an admission when
we remember the twenty-two years prior to
1957.
However, it would appear that the honourable senator is not satisfied with his first
decision that this bill is a piece of worthwhile
legislation, because he goes on to say that it
is almost innocuous, and in his own particularly oratorical style, on which I congratulate him, he describes the bill as an

SENATE
immature, premature embryo, and a "forceps
delivery," whatever that may mean in this
connection. He further describes the legislation as being ill-conceived. Having said that,
he immediately relents by saying that there
is nothing wrong with the intent of the bill;
and he winds up by giving his wholehearted
support to it, and stating he will vote for it.
How the honourable senator could start out
as he did, wholly supporting the bill, then
damning it, and later saying he was going to
vote for it, is something I find difficult to
understand. I only wish he were here to
explain the situation to me, or to bring me
to book.
Another matter was mentioned by the honourable senator from Halifax North with
which I should like to take issue. I refer to
his remarks relating to university grants by
the federal Government. He said:
I suggest that the Government of Canada, of its own volition, without an
Atlantic development board, can give us
possibly as much assistance as any by
rectifying this iniquitous system of university grants which treats us like poor
cousins, almost like paupers, which
hampers our universities, and which, to
a people as prideful as those of the
Atlantic region, is a serious disservice.
He says that the Government should give
to the Atlantic provinces at least the national
average of university grants.
May I point out that the Government of
Canada established the system of university
grants as recommended by the Massey Commission on National Development in the
Arts, Letters and Sciences. The first of these
grants was made during the academic year
1952. It was paid on the basis of 50 cents
per head of population of the provinces, and
the eligible institutions received their share
of the total provincial allotment according
to the number of full-time students at university level.
In 1952, as we all remember, there was a
Liberal administration and during that time
the grant was 50 cents per head of population.
In 1956-57, when the Liberal administration was still in power, the Government increased the payment to $1 per head of population, a step on which I congratulate them.
In 1958-59 when, fortunately, there was not
a Liberal Government in power, the allocation was increased to $1.50 per head of
population.
I might mention that I understand a bill is
soon to come before the House of Commons
which will raise the amount to $2 per head
of population. We on this side of the house
are very happy about this; it will certainly
be appreciated by our people in the Atlantic
provinces.

To sum up, since 1952 when the first grant
was made the allocation per head of population has risen from 50 cents to at least $1.50,
and I hope that shortly it will be $2. Therefore, I cannot understand the honourable
senator's worry over the matter of university
grants. He almost seems to say: "Give us a
bigger university grant and we will forget
the Atlantic Development Board". I cannot
quite make that fit.
Newfoundland, the tenth province, is still
a teenager as provinces go, and with its large
area and small population it cannot be expected to have reached a stage of development
anywhere near that of the more populated
provinces. Unfortunately, however, the other
Atlantic provinces, which indeed initiated the
idea of Confederation nearly a hundred years
ago, are almost on a par with Newfoundland
as far as economic development goes, and
it is in the hope of curing this condition that
this bill has been introduced. I feel certain
that every member of this house will vote
for it.
Newfoundland, including Labrador, with
an area of 152,000 square miles of land and
water has a population of only 450,000, four
and a half centuries after its discovery. There
are several reasons for this, the chief of
which is that so many of our people every
year discover they can make a better living
for their families on the Canadian mainland
and in the United States of America. That
is true also, I believe, of the other three
Atlantic provinces.
During the past ten years Newfoundland
bas lost nearly 15,000 people to the mainland;
Prince Edward Island nearly 12,000, and during that time 70,000 citizens of Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick have left for greener
pastures. Therefore, in the past 10 years
almost 100,000 people have left the Atlantic
provinces. I quote these figures to show how
urgent it is that such legislation be passed
quickly.
Hon. Mrs. Inman: May I ask a question of
the honourable senator? How many people
did he say had left Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Twelve thousand in the
past 10 years. I obtained these figures from
the Canada Year Book and I think they will

be found to be correct. I was very surprised
at them myself.
I quote these figures to show how urgent
it is that such legislation as is contained in
Bill C-94 be brought before Parliament, and
how important it is that such a board should
be instituted immediately, and that a close
study be given to the national resources and
economie possibilities of the Atlantic provinces, this study being conducted in co-operation
with the provincial governments concerned.

DECEMBER 17, 1962
According to the minister who introduced the
bill in the other place the present Government
now recognizes that the Atlantic provinces, to
use his words... constitute a special situation deserv-

ing special attention and deserving
special consideration and demanding
special action.
There are many "specials" there, and I am
quite sure it is going to take many "specials"
to cure the ills of the Atlantic provinces and,
of course, of all Canada.
When Newfoundland came into Confederation in 1949 the per capita income in Ontario
was $1,000. Today it is $1,853, and we all
know it is much less in the Atlantic provinces.
I am sure we cannot blame our people for
migrating to other more prosperous provinces.
I doubt very much if the per capita income
in the Atlantic provinces during the past 10
or 15 years has increased to any great extent.
A comparison of the population with the net
value of production in the varlous Atlantic
provinces with that of, say, Ontario will
demonstrate to what extent we are lagging
behind the rest of Canada.
For instance, in 1960 the approximate per
capita production for all of Canada in terms
of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining,
electric power, and secondary industries of
manufacture and construction, was approximately $1,050. For Ontario the comparable
per capita production was around $1,350,
which is away above the national average.
The comparable figure for Newfoundland was
only $520, for Prince Edward Island it was
approximately $500, and for Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick it was between $550 and
$575.

billion worth of goods imported per year.
When we think of these figures, we will think
not only of the Atlantic provinces but of the
whole of Canada.
He noted that Canada imports $235
worth of manufactured goods per person per year, compared with $75 per
person in Great Britain, $60 in West
Germany and $35 in the United States.
Some 85 per cent of imports from the
U.S. are manufactured goods, while only
17 per cent of Canada's exports to the
U.S. are manufactured goods-

That means that the labour used in manufacturing 85 per cent of the $235 worth of
goods imported by Canada per person per
year is given to the United States and to
other countries. It is not being used to give
employment to our own people. Mr. Graham
said that only 17 per cent of Canada's exports to the United States are manufactured
goods, the balance being raw materials and
farm products.
If these figures are to change-and indeed,
they must change-we must fabricate more
goods for both ourselves and for export,
and so make jobs for our idle hands. I am
quite sure that every honourable senator
present will agree with that.
I believe the present federal Government's intention is to make an honest attempt to see that our Atlantic provinces are
more attractive to capital and industry. I
have pointed out that it must make that attempt with respect to all of Canada, and it
must be done by whatever government is in
power, whether Conservative, Liberal, New
Democrat, or Social Credit. Unless this is

Hon. Mr. Brooks: That is an old point of
yours.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: This is the problem: unless
the people of Newfoundland make a decent
living there, the population will not grow.
There cannot be industry without population,
and I am sure there cannot be population
without industry. The main thing is to develop
our own resources-the problem lies in how
we should do it.
If we in Newfoundland were to cease fighting and snarling at each other and get down
to business, something could be done. However, in the political atmosphere in which
we live we are snarling at one another instead
of thinking out ways and means to develop
our portion of the country.
The resources of Newfoundland are almost
unlimited. Our resources in waterpower, minerals, forests, and fisheries are immense. With
a sensible approach to their proper development, there would be prosperity for the
people of Newfoundland and that would be
good for all Canada.
Honourable senators have all heard of the
approach made in the early fifties by, shall I
say, our Newfoundland Liberal administration. I do not know whether honourable senators on the other side will agree that it was
a Liberal administration. What occurred then
was heartbreaking; it was tragic. Some $50
million was practically thrown away. In the
minds of the originator of the plan, there
must have been a desire to do what our
present federal Government hopes to be
able to do. There must have been a
desire to provide for development. However, that $50 million was thrown away because of lack of proper planning and the
absence of economic study.
You all know where Newfoundland is situated, how far it is from certain markets, and
how much more it costs to bring goods to
consumers in varlous parts of the world.
These things were not considered. The cry
in the 1950's was: "Abandon your fishing
boats and come to our new industries".
Although I have been only 10 or 12 years
in politics, I have learned a great deal. We

were told then that the administration would
provide 20,000 new jobs, two jobs for every
man, and that labour would have to be imported. Unfortunately, these things did not
happen. Some $40 million went into 18 new
buildings and factories. One big machine plant
costing $21 million, which was officially
opened by the late Right Honourable C. D.
Howe, is used now as a sort of garage for a
construction company whose directors in Newfoundland are not of my political persuasion.
A big rubber plant, costing $1,800,000 was
established, to manufacture all sorts of rubber goods, including boots and shoes. The
machinery which went into that plant was
already 30 years old when it was imported
from Germany; yet it was put into a new
plant costing $1,800,000. Those buildings now
serve as storage sheds.
I could give honourable senators many instances of failure resulting from lack of planning and economic sense, and how thousands
of jobs failed to materialize. The same administration, the same "prophet", ten years
later tells the Newfoundland fishermen to go
back to the fisheries because he intends to
start a big new fishery program costing $70
million. That announcement was made as a
political dodge, I suppose, less than three
weeks after the committee was set up to formulate the fishery development plan. We are
told that $70 million will be spent on this
plan, and that the federal Government will
be asked to donate $371 million towards it.
Let me say right here that before any government, provincial or federal, commits itself to
spending $37 million, or $70 million, on the
development of our fisheries, I hope there
will be a much closer study of our fishery
problems than any made heretofore.
We have the best fisheries in the world
and do not know how to handle them. I believe we do not put enough capital into our
fisheries to catch, cure and market the fish
properly. For instance, about 1953 a fishery
board was set up in Newfoundland. The other
day an honourable senator said he was becoming sick and tired of boards. Let me say
that this board, which was called a "fishery
authority" first consisted of three men-none
of whom knew anything about fisheries, of
course-and who were paid an annual salary
of $25,000 each, with guaranteed pensions of
$10,000 at the end of 10 years. This was
indeed an excellent job.
Honourable senators being mostly businessmen-and some of you being most successful businessmen-will know that is not the
way to ensure proper development. You will
realize, I am sure, that the correct way to
develop the vast mineral areas of Labrador

DECEMBER 17, 1962
and of the Island of Newfoundland is certainly not by making an initial grant of
the mineral rights in 50,000 square miles of
that territory to one man or one company.
That has been done in Newfoundland, as
nost honourable senators know.
A wiser course must be followed. Newfoundland is now part of Canada and ber
resources must be developed by and for all
Canadians. Already in Newfoundland millions of dollars are being amassed by the few
select-I am going to call them "heelers"
this time-and the proper benefits do not
accrue either to the people or to the governments, provincial or federal. We have a rich
heritage in our fisheries, but we are at present
allowing these benefits to slip through our
fingers and go to other lands, all because
no proper approach by any government has
yet been made with regard to catching, curing or marketing of the many species of fish
in the waters surrounding our shores. In
other days, of course, governments took very
little note of these requirements, but today
governments ail over the world are seeing
to it that fishermen are protected in their
livelihood, and competition, at any rate in
Newfoundland and the Atlantic provinces, is
great. Our natural resources are for our
people; they were not placed on the land
and in the sea by the Almighty for the
benefit of the few, some of whom, I regret
to say, delight in fiying back and forth to
their respective bank accounts, some of which
are in foreign lands.
Believe me, honourable senators, I do not
wish to become partisan with regard to this
bill. I am only giving you certain facts because of a statement made by a member in
the other place, who said:
Any projects of major importance
which have been completed in the
Atlantic provinces have been completed
by a Liberal Government.
My only reason for injecting in my speech
a few sentiments of this kind, which might
otherwise be left unsaid, is to reflect the
truth. However, I agree wholeheartedly with
the minister when he said:
I should like to think that the Atlantic
Development Board can be an arm of the
federal Government to be consulted by
the provincial governments and by industry in general, with a view to rendering real assistance in every sector of
the development of the Atlantic region.
Honourable senators, this bill could register
the turning point for the better development
of our Atlantic provinces and for Canada as a
whole. However, in this day and age I fear
that no real progress can be made by way of

economic development without first giving attention to roads and other means of communication. In this regard I feel that Newfoundland needs some special attention. I
refer to the Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland. There are still some 400 miles of
dirt road or, shall I say, 400 miles of potholes,
along the Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland. I know I shall be charged by certain individuals in our tourist industry with
downgrading Newfoundland by saying so, but
it is the truth and, if we do not speak in
such terms once in a while we shall get nowhere. We have 400 miles of road that cannot
be said to meet the standards of the TransCanada Highway. We feel that we are deserving of special attention from the federal Government in this matter. Our economy at the
moment is such that we simply cannot afford
to build this 400 miles of road to TransCanada requirements. In the thirteen years
since Confederation with Canada, our provincial debt has jumped from $34 million
to nearly $90 million, in spite of the most
generous assistance during the past four or
five years. But, you may ask, what justification is there for special treatment in Newfoundland's case with regard to the Trans-Canada Highway? In our opinion, this is why we
should get special treatment. When we entered
Confederation thirteen years ago the Canadian
people took over our national debt of some
$76 million. You may say that was pretty
generous, and it was. Although there was a
per capita debt for Newfoundland at that
time of some $200, it amounted to only an
increase of about $5 in the per capita debt
for all of Canada. But let us not forget that
in exchange we, in Newfoundland, took on
Canada's debt-and I mean the gross debtwhich at the moment amounts to about $21
billion, or a per capita debt of around $1,100,
or a net per capita debt of, say, some $700.
This in itself appears to us to be a good,
bona fide reason why the remaining 400
miles of Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland might very well in justice be
completed by the federal Government. We
must not forget that much of the national
debt of $700 per capita was incurred in the
construction of the Trans-Canada Highway on
the mainland as well as in supplying other
benefits not presently enjoyed by Newfoundland. That is the reason I think Newfoundland
should get a little special consideration.
Honourable senators, getting back to the
bill before us, we on this side believe it is
a good bill, or rather that it can be made
good legislation. It is the bedrock, the foundation, and together with the will and the determination already evidenced by this Government, it is sure to provide the means

SENATE
necessary for a more equitable equalization
of opportunity within our Atlantic provinces.
Honourable senators, I am quite sure that
if this bill passes it will lay a foundation. All
that will remain is for us to get down to
business. We must endeavour to do something
about our secondary industries. I have quoted
figures to show how necessary it is to encourage capital into industry in the Atlantic
provinces, and thus provide prosperity and
labour at home. Mr. Graham, whose remarks
I have already quoted, feels that capital invested in such industry should be made more
secure by the federal Government, so that
investors would not feel obliged to put their
money into projects outside of their own
province.
Honourable senators, it is a pleasure to have
had the opportunity to say a few words on
this bill. As I have already stated, we as
senators, as Canadians, and as provincial
representatives, must, if we want a Canada
worthy of the name, work together in
harmony toward the particular matters I have
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Would the honourable
senator tell us why that wonderful iron
mine under the sea at Bell Island in all these
years has not progressed and provided Newfoundland with some industry? Is it because
of high labour costs, or can he give us that
information?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: To answer that question
would be to furnish one of the answers this
board ought to find. Of course, as I see it, to
manufacture machinery in Newfoundland,
where at the moment there is no demand for
heavy machinery, would be absolutely uneconomic and unsound.
That is why, of course, the iron ore has to
be shipped to smelters abroad, to be nearer
the market for the machines that are to be
made. That is the only answer I can give at
the moment.
Another reason is that on Labrador we
have now opened up some iron ore mines
which can produce iron ore pellets which I
understand are of higher quality than can
be produced at Bell Island. I think the iron
content of the ore at Bell Island is 52 per
cent, and that Labrador ore can be turned
out containing 65 per cent.

for the establishment of an Atlantic Development Board, has already been reasonably
well explained and discussed in some detail
by the sponsor of the bill, the honourable senator from Kings (Hon. Mr. Welch). I should
like to take this opportunity to welcome him
as one of the new senators to this chamber,
and I do so partly because of the fact that
we belong to the same fraternity, in that we
are tillers of the soil. In addition to that I
believe he is probably one of the largest
exporters of fruits in Canada. And he represents a constituency which was represented
in the Senate by a very long-standing friend
of mine. I refer to the late Senator John A.
McDonald. From 1933 until his death he and
I worked very closely together in agricultural
matters affecting Canada as a whole and the
Maritime provinces in particular. I welcome
Senator Welch here and I am sure that he
will make a worthy contribution to the work
of the house and to Canadian agriculture, as
did his predecessor.
I should also like to welcome another new
senator, a man who comes from my own
province, representing the constituency of
Madawaska-Restigouche, and a man whom I
have known for a number of years. Senator
Fournier and I sat in the New Brunswick
legislature at Fredericton at the same time,
although on opposite sides of the house. I
welcome him here too, and I shall have something more to say about him later.
It would appear to me, honourable senators, that there is no opposition to the principle of the bill now before us, but there is
some difference of opinion as to its value as
a means of improving the economic position
of the Atlantic area.
In studying this bill, and viewing it in
relation to the intent, I feel that the purpose
is good, but, like some others, I question
whether or not it is to perform the function
that some honourable members believe it
will.
As a matter of fact, I heartily disagree
with what the Minister of National Revenue
said when he introduced this bill, and I
quote:
I consider that the proposed legislation
to set up an Atlantic Development Board
is the most forward step ever taken in
my lifetime for the benefit of the Atlantic
provinces.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senI also am forced to disagree with this comators, when I came into the chamber tonight

honourable senator who has just taken his
seat I now have no such fear.
Honourable senators, I don't mind admitHonourable senators, the bill which is now ting I am getting a bit tired and annoyed at
before us, namely Bill C-94, an act to provide listening to and reading statements made by

DECEMBER 17, 1962

various public figures to the effect that nothing has been done for the Atlantic area in the
last 30 to 35 years, and it has even been
stated by some that nothing was done for
the Atlantic area during the 22 years that the
Liberal Party was in office in Canada.
In order to keep the record straight, I
should like to review what, in my opinion, are
important policies adopted by the national
Government over a period of years in relation to the development of the economy of
the Atlantic provinces. First, I want to refer
to the appointment of the Duncan Commission
in 1926-headed by Sir Andrew Rae Duncan
-to hear complaints from the Atlantic provinces and to make recommendations to the
Government. It is a well-known fact, but one
that may be forgotten by some, that in its
final recommendation on freight rates, bearing in mind the long distances that the people
of the Atlantic area were forced to transport
their products, and due to the sparsely settled
areas in the Atlantic provinces, the commission recommended a reduction in rates of 20
per cent. The following is an excerpt from
page 22 of the report:
We recommend that an immediate reduction of 20 per cent be made on all
rates charged on traffic which both
originates and terminates at stations in
the Atlantic Division of the Canadian
National Railways, and that the same
reduction be also applied to the Atlantic
Division proportion of the through rates
on all traffic which originates at stations
in the Atlantic Division, and is destined
to points outside the Atlantic Division.
Based upon this recommendation, the Government of the day passed an act in 1927,
known as the Maritime Freight Rates Act,
authorizing the implementation of the Duncan
Commission Report on Railways, as it applied
to the Atlantic provinces, or the Maritime
provinces as they were known at that time.
It is impossible to estimate the tremendous
amount of money saved to the people of the
Atlantic area in the functioning of this act.
I venture to say that the amount is staggering.
I should like also to point out that in the
spring of 1957 a further reduction of 10 per
cent in freight rates was authorized by the
Government in the Appropriation Act.
Another valuable means of assistance to the
agricultural industry of the Atlantic provinces
was brought about by the passing in 1948 of
an act known as the Maritime Marshlands
Rehabilitation Act, which gave authority to
the federal Government to assist the provinces
in restoring to the farm people of that region
vast areas of marshlands that had been encroached on by the sea; also to assist in the
repair of established aboiteaux and outside
27511-5-30

dykes. Up until November 30, 1962 the amount
contributed for actual works in this connection in the three Atlantic provinces-Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island-amounted to $13,805,264. This does not
include cost of administration, surveys,
engineering, workshop and equipment, or construction supervision; nor does it include the
amount contributed by the provinces and the
individual farmers. I might point out that the
total expenditure, so far as the federal
Government was concerned, amounted to
$20,029,042.
Honourable senators, I recall that in the
early days there was established in Canada a
very low freight rate on wheat and coarse
grains to be exported from Canada through
the ports of Halifax and Saint John. These
low rates were known as export rates on
grain. I am not complaining about this, because I think it was done primarily to build
up the export trade of Canada. I distinctly
recall appearing before the Board of Transport Commissioners at a meeting in Saint
John, New Brunswick, at which I represented
the New Brunswick Farmers and Dairymen's
Association. There I, with others, pleaded for
the export rate on coarse grains and mill
feeds to be applied to these commodities purchased and used for livestock feeding in the
Atiantic provinces.
As I remember, at that time grain could
be shipped from western Canada to Halifax
and Saint John, loaded on boats, shipped to
Europe, and from there shipped back to Halifax and Saint John and sold to Maritime
farmers cheaper than they could purchase
it directly from western Canada. That was
was the situation at that time. Following
long negotiations a policy was again
adopted by the Liberal government and
brought into effect in October 1941 whereby
feed grain was made available to farmers of
the Atlantic provinces at about the same cost
as to other provinces in Canada. This was
done to equalize the cost of feed grains to
farmers across the country. From that time
until October 31, 1962 the federal Government has under this policy paid out approximately $70 million on behalf of the four Atlantic provinces.
I now wish to refer to the year 1939, when
Canada was involved in the Second World
War, and foremost in the minds of Canadians
was the desire to win the battle for freedom
and every effort was made to that end. I think
we must all agree that Canada's contribution
in manpower, equipment, and food was a
major contribution to the winning of that war.
After a number of conferences between
the provinces and the federal Government,
an agreement was reached which was known
as the Wartime Tax Agreement, by which the

SENATE
provinces gave up certain fields of taxation
and received in lieu thereof certain sums of
money from the national treasury to reimburse them for that particular field of taxation. I refer particularly to income tax, corporation tax and succession duties. These
agreements had worked out reasonably successfully for the provinces concerned and, as
a result, after the war most of the provinces
entered into a tax rental agreement with the
dominion Government, on the basis of the
former agreement but with some slight
changes similar to the recommendations of
the Rowell-Sirois Commission. This arrangement was set up under a Liberal Government.
The agreements are still in effect, with some
modifications and, to be fair, I must state that
in my opinion they have been improved at
each renewal, except the 1962 agreement.
In this latter agreement the province of
New Brunswick is not in too favourable a
position, compared to the other provinces, due
to the natural resource income factor. However, until this new agreement was completed,
New Brunswick was treated in a similar manner to other Atlantic provinces.
Being one who wants to give credit where
credit is due, I want to compliment the present Government for the recognition it has
shown the Atlantic area in providing what is
now known as the Atlantic Provinces Adjustment Grants, which have helped out considerably. Also, I want to recognize the improvement it made in the tax agreement in 1958,
changing from the 10-9-50 formula to the
13-9-50 formula, which, of course, was an
increase in the income tax revenue granted
to the provinces. In the case of New Brunswick this provided slightly over $2 million
additional revenue and, of course, the same
principle applied to the other Atlantic provinces and all provinces of Canada.
As a result of these tax agreements which
were brought into effect by the former Liberal
Government and through the recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois report, the agreements were modified and improved in each
instance upon each renewal. To give some
idea of the magnitude of these grants may I
point out that in the fiscal year ending March
31, 1962, Prince Edward Island received
$7,281,000, Nova Scotia $39,817,000, and New
Brunswick $33,733,000. I have not the figures
for Newfoundland because the amounts do
not appear in the statistics until 1949. These
figures do not include the annual subsidies
provided for in the B.N.A. Act, or any
amounts under various shared programs, such
as hospital insurance, Trans-Canada Highway,
vocational training, et cetera. As a matter of
fact, the Atlantic provinces are now receiving
around 40 per cent of their total revenues

from moneys received under the tax rental
agreements and constitutional subsidies provided for under the B.N.A. Act.
One could also mention the building of the
Canso Causeway, and the establishment of
Camp Gagetown, at a cost of around $50 million, which provides employment for hundreds
of men. This, together with ancillary services,
means a great deal to New Brunswick. I mention these matters to disprove the erroneous
statements made by men who know differently but will not give credit where credit
is due.
Having outlined the various sources of assistance to the Atlantic area, all of which
have been most helpful, and admitting that
we could not have existed without them, they
by themselves will not solve our economic
problems in the Atlantic provinces. The
present bill will not solve our problems unless
accompanied by complementary legislation
which will give effect to the recommendations already made by former commissions and
agencies, including projects presented to the
national government by various agencies, and
finally to give effect to the recommendations
of the board that will be created under this
bill. As I see it, this bill merely appoints
another board or commission, which unlike
some others, unfortunately, is only a part-time
one, if I interpret the bill correctly. In any
event, all but the chairman are to serve
without remuneration. The chairman is to
receive an honorarium approved by the Government; all others are allowed only expenses.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that
in the Atlantic area we deserve something
better than that. I believe sufficient evidence
has already been submitted to the Government of Canada by other boards, commissions,
provincial governments and various other
organizations, including reports from highranking civil servants, to enable the Government to go forward immediately with a broad
program of capital projects for the Atlantic
area.
May I refer to the report of the Gordon
Commission of 1957 as it deals with the Atlantic provinces problems. I read from page
410 of the final report:
There is, then, a need in the Atlantic
provinces for considerable expenditures
of capital on basic public facilities designed to encourage development of the
resources of the area. These would include, but should not be limited to, the
provision or reconstruction of adequate
power and co-ordinated transportation
services. The cost involved in providing
these needed services, however, would

DECEMBER 17, 1962
seem to be beyond the financial competence of the provincial governments concerned. In view of this, we suggest that
the federal Government agree to contribute a substantial sum for capital projects in the Atlantic area to be spread
over a relatively short period of years.
The commission suggested that this capital,
referred to in their report, should be in addition to the sums already being spent in the
Atlantic area, and it further proposed the
establishment of a Capital Projects Commission to co-ordinate investment and allocate federal funds. You will recall that during the session of 1957 a start was made to
implement a portion of these recommendations. This was outlined in the budget speech
of the Honourable Mr. Harris, and later enlarged on by the Minister of Northern Af airs
and National Resources, the Honourable Mr.
Lesage. I quote Mr. Harris' statement:
It is suggested by experts in the field
of electric power that advantages would
result for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick from the interconnection of their
electrical systems. Such interconnection
would reduce the requirements for standby capacity and would permit the most
advantageous location of thermal plants
and the building of larger and more
efficient thermal units.
If the governments of Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick agree and in order to
help reduce the differential in the cost
of power between those provinces and
certain other parts of Canada, the federal
Government would be prepared to provide the main interconnection facilities
within and between those provinces, and
to build and operate such large thermal
plants as may be needed either to replace
existing ones, should efficiency so indicate
or to meet the requirements of growth
and industrial development.
Under this proposal, the transmission
lines would be rented on a non-profit
basis and the power would be sold at
cost to provincial electric systems. The
purpose would be that the plants and
other facilities built under this program
can be acquired by the provinces at any
time on payment of their amortized cost.
The proposal of the then Government was
quickly approved by the province of New
Brunswick, as evidenced by a telegram from
the then premier, the Honourable Hugh
John Flemming, addressed to the Honourable
Minister of Northern Affairs and National
Resources, which reads as follows:
Very pleased at results of March
twenty-first meeting of officials Stop Government of New Brunswick accepts in
27511-5-30J

principle proposal of Government of Canada to provide the main interconnection
facilities for power within and between
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and to
build such large thermal plants as may
be needed and to sell power at cost to
provincial electric systems as outlined in
budget address of Honourable Walter E.
Harris and discussed in detail at conference of officials mentioned Stop Letter
to this effect going forward.
You will recall that after the election of
June 10, 1957 the new Government headed by
the present Prime Minister introduced and
passed legislation to give effect to the principle outlined by Mr. Harris and Mr. Lesage
with, of course, some modification. I think
the honourable senator from MadawaskaRestigouche (Hon. Mr. Fournier) will agree
that the program developed was a reasonably
satisfactory one. While I do not always agree
with the honourable senator's political philosophy, I must state at this time, in fairness
to him, that he performed a valuable and outstanding service for New Brunswick while
chairman of the New Brunswick Electric
Power Commission, and I am sure he will not
shirk any responsibility that will arise in his
new field of service here.
Honourable senators, in addition to the
recommendations of the Gordon Commission
and the implementation of part of them, I
wish now to refer to the splendid work done
by the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council,
otherwise known as APEC. This council is
composed of men of outstanding ability in the
Atlantic area, of all professions, including
industrialists, top-ranking Government officials, and many others from all walks of
life. Last year the council was headed by
Professor W. Y. Smith, an economist from the
University of New Brunswick. For some years
he was economic adviser to the Flemming
government in New Brunswick, and I believe
he is now adviser to the Stanfield government
of Nova Scotia. This council was established
in 1954, when my honourable friend from
Madawaska-Restigouche was a member of
that government, and I give that government
credit for proposing and helping to set up
this economic council.
After years of study they produced a blueprint for economic development in the Atlantic
area. This blueprint suggested two lines of
action: first, a federal agency to expand
public works on the lines proposed by the
Gordon Commission and, secondly, the creation of a federal capital fund, to be used in
the establishment of cornerstone industries,
around which other industries could and
would develop.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I believe it is now
over a year since the premiers of the Atlantic
provinces came to Ottawa and jointly appeared before the Government to seek action
on a program along the lines developed and
recommended first by the Gordon Commission
and, secondly, by APEC, but apparently these
requests have been buried, because as far as
I am aware the joint proposals to which I
have referred have not even been made
public.
It must be apparent to all that there now
exist two major development proposals that
have been declared feasible and necessary
as prerequisites to large-scale industrial
development in the Atlantic area. They are,
first, the Prince Edward Island causeway
and, secondly, the construction of the Chignecto canal, with the accompanying tidal
power development. I do not mention these
as in order of preference. The only reason
I mention the Prince Edward Island causeway
first is because of the fact that a commitment
on it has already been made by the Government. It is also recognized that the studies
which have been made in connection with it
have proven satisfactory. I need only to quote
none other than the Prime Minister to prove
the accuracy of this statement. He said:
I have two or three announcements
I wish to make today. The first has to
do with the Northumberland strait causeway. As the house knows, comprehensive
studies were authorized by the Government in January, 1958, as to the whole
question of the building of this causeway. The Government has now decided
that a causeway will be built between
New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island.
Studies to date have involved several
Government departments, consulting engineers and the National Research Council. An important part of the work was
the construction of a scale model of the
area by the National Research Council.
The purpose of the studies undertaken
has been to determine whether the project would be feasible from an engineering point of view and justified from an
economic point of view. The answer in
both cases is in the affirmative.
It will be noted that this statement was
made on April 17, 1962 and it may be
significant to note that the second announcement made at that time had to do with the
dissolution of Parliament. I am just wondering if in the passing of this bill there will
be a similar joint announcement. In any
event, whether or not I agree with the report,
it would appear that no further study by the
board to be set up under this act is necessary
before the commencement of this project.

The second large-scale development, which
I have already referred to, namely, the
Chignecto canal, with the accompanying tidal
power development, is a project which when
finished would complete what I call the
St. Lawrence Seaway, because in my opinion
this great seaway will never be complete
without the establishment of the eastern
terminus and what is generally referred to
as the Chignecto canal.
It will be recalled that this project has
been recommended more times than any other
single project in the whole of Canada. As a
matter of fact the first survey was made in
1686, when it was recommended by the
Administrator of what was then known as
New France, and since then more than
twelve actual surveys have been made. It is
also significant to note that each of the
surveys and reports has declared in no uncertain terms that the joint development of the
canal and tidal power is feasible from an
engineering viewpoint and fully justified
from an economic one.
It is also interesting to note that at one
time, in 1871 I believe, tenders were called
for the construction of the canal, but for
some unknown reason no contracts were
awarded. In the report of the Royal Commission of 1871, headed by Sir Hugh Allan,
the following two paragraphs will be found:
In urging this policy of canal enlargement and expansion upon the favourable
consideration of the Government, the
Comissioners feel that it is the one which
will best stimulate the commercial development of the whole Dominion, and bind
all sections together in the bonds of
mutual amity and interest.
The expense of these improvements
will be insignificant to the direct benefit Canadian commerce will receive, and
will be immediately met by larger revenue that must accrue from the tolls of
a vastly increased traffic.
Then again, as late as 1958, the President
of the Foundation of Canada Engineering
Corporation, speaking before the Women's
Atlantic Council in Saint John, New Brunswick, and after making a complete and
thorough study of all the reports up to that
date, had this to say in relation to it:
What Sir Hugh Allan said in 1871
holds true today. The key to development
of the industrial economy of the Atlantic
provinces is low cost transportation and,
I should like to add, power, and there
can be little doubt but that the provision
of the facilities suggested would have
a very favourable impact on the economy
of the Atlantic provinces. Therefore, in
studying the Chignecto Canal scheme

DECEMBER 17, 1962
we should not think simply in terms of
what portion of present traffic could be
diverted through the canal but rather
we should base the studies on increased
traffic which would be generated by new
industrial developments in the whole
region which would follow in the tracks
of the construction of such a waterway
and power producing facilities.

the Atlantic provinces by various governments.
May I remind you, honourable senators,
that we in the Atlantic provinces helped to

up central Canada by purchasing most of
our goods from it. We have helped in our
small way to build the St. Lawrence Seaway,
and we are now helping to build the South

May I now ask you in return to help us to
gain a degree of economic stability comparable to that of the rest of Canada so that
there will be no second-class citizens in any
part of this country.

BANKRUPTCY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT OF COMMITTEE
ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill S-2, to amend
the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen, for Hon. Salter A.
Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, moved the adoption of the report.
He said: Honourable senators, speaking on
behalf of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, it is my
privilege to move the adoption of the report
of that committee on Bill S-2, intituled: "An
Act to Amend the Bankruptcy Act".
Your committee devoted a great deal of
consideration to this bill. It held in all five
sittings, each of which lasted from two to
three hours. That fact, perhaps, is the reason
for the substantial list of amendments suggested in the report of the committee to the
bill as originally introduced.
At all times during its sittings the committee had the benefit of the advice of Mr.

T. D. MacDonald, the Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice, and of Mr. John Larose, the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy in the Department of Justice.
Several public bodies appeared before the
committee to give their views on the bill,
those bodies comprising the Credit Grantors
Association of Canada, the Toronto Board
of Trade, and the Montreal Board of Trade,
and, although they did not appear before
the committee, we were apprised of the views
of the Canadian Bar Association.
With respect to this report I think I should
advise the house that the bill is divided into
two separate and completely distinct parts.
The first part comprises sections 1 and 2 of
the bill which provide for the repeal of
subsection (6) of section 26 and of sections
114, 115 and 116 of the present Bankruptcy
Act.
Those are the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act, passed in 1949, which provide for summary administration of small estates in cases
where the total net value of the assets of
the bankrupt in excess of the claims of
secured creditors is not expected to realize
more than $500, and those provisions of sections 114 to 116 inclusive provide an expeditious and inexpensive method of dealing with
such bankruptcies.
The evidence that was given before the
committee by these various bodies was to the
effect that they all agreed that those sections
in their present form leave a good deal to
be desired. In fact, two of them, the Montreal
Board of Trade and the Credit Grantors
Association of Canada, agreed with the
provisions of the bill to strike out these sections altogether. On the other hand, the
Toronto Board of Trade gave as their opinion
that there was some virtue in retaining these
provisions for summary administration of
small bankruptcies, provided they could be
tightened up in certain respects, and they
made certain suggestions to that end.
Your committee had these two alternative
views before it, and in the end we decided
to adopt the suggestions proposed by the
Toronto Board of Trade; and, rather than
strike out these summary provisions altogether, we decided to amend them and
tighten them up in certain respects.
If honourable senators will look at the first
page of the committee's recommendations
they will find that paragraphs 1 and 2 deal
with the way in which it is proposed to
tighten up these provisions for summary administration of small bankruptcies. There are
several changes, but I shall indicate only one
or two of them.
Under the present act, in small bankruptcies
of this kind the trustee is not required to

SENATE

give a security bond. We were told that there
has grown up a practice in certain areas-I
am sorry to say, particularly in the area of
my own city of Montreal-under which these
provisions for summary administration have
been abused by collaboration between authorized trustees and small debtors, whereby
the trustee may get from the small debtor
a sum of $100 or $200 for his costs and will
then put the small debtor through these
summary administration provisions. Having
received his fee, the trustee will pay no attention to the interests of the creditors and
will endeavour to get the debtor discharged,
without attempting to collect any part of his
assets or any part of his salary. Therefore,
these changes in section 114 which your
committee recommends are designed to tighten
up the procedure and discourage this sort of
practice.
Under the present act, no security need be
given by a trustee. Under the proposed amendment the Official Receiver can, if he thinks
it necessary, require a trustee to give security.
Under the present act, there is no provision
for the appointment of inspectors to represent
the interests of the creditors. Under the
amendment the creditors have the right, if
they so wish, to appoint inspectors.
There are one or two other similar provisions for tightening up these sections of the
act.
That is the first part of the bill and those
are, I think, the only useful comments I can
make upon the report of your committee.
Honourable senators, the second part of
the bill introduces into the Bankruptcy Act
Part X, headed "Orderly Payment of Debts".
The bouse will remember, from the discussions on second reading of this measure,
how this section was introduced. Originally,
it comprised an act of the province of
Manitoba which apparently was very successful for a number of years and which
very recently was copied by the province of
Alberta. That legislation contained provisions
dealing with the case of an honest debtor
who wished to obtain an extension of time
for payment of his debts, by making an
orderly monthly payment into the court and
by the court distributing the proceeds to his
creditors every two or three months.
The trouble about that was that a recent
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
decided that the Alberta act was ultra vires
of the province as relating to bankruptcywhich, as honourable senators know, is
legislation reserved to the federal power by
section 91 of the British North America Act.
That decision included necessarily the presumption that the Manitoba act was also ultra
vires. As was explained on the second reading
of this bill, this new Part X has been intro-

duced at the request of the provinces of
Manitoba and Alberta to replace the provincial legislation declared ultra vires as constituting bankruptcy legislation. We considered this Part X very carefully and made
some suggested changes in it. Those changes
are not of great importance, but I should like
to indicate some of them.
Section 174(1) defines the kind of debts to
which Part X applies. Briefly speaking, it
applies only to debts the amount of which
does not exceed $1,000, though of course there
may be any number of creditors with claims
of less than that amount. We suggested an
amendment to that subsection to permit claims
of creditors in excess of $1,000 coming in
under these provisions, if the creditor desires
and consents so to come in.
There were some other amendments, with
the details of which I do not need to trouble
the house, since many of them were really
only verbal modifications or changes in language required to make the legislation conform to the language of certain provincial
statutes.
A suggestion was made to us by one of the
parties anpearing before us, that a provision
should be made whereby the clerk of the
court-who is to be the authority before
whom the debtor appears and who is to
receive the moneys-should keep a separate
record of all matters coming under Part X,
and that this record should be open for inspection by any creditor at any time. We
provided an amendment to that effect, amendment No. 5.
The only other amendment to which I
should draw the attention of the bouse occurs on page 10 of the bill. This deals with
those cases which arise during the operation
of the "orderly payment of debts" provision,
when a man is still paying his debts and
some sudden crisis arises in his affairs and he
has to go into bankruptcy. A question would
arise then as to what should be done with
the moneys in the hands of the clerk of the
court under the orderly payment of debts
provision, when a bankruptcy order was issued against the debtor. The bill, as introduced, said in section 193 that in such an
event the clerk of the court should pay over
to the trustee in bankruptcy the moneys he
had collected. We thought it would be undesirable to maintain this provision since in
certain cases it might tempt a trustee to
encourage a man to go into bankruptey if
there were several hundred dollars standing
to his credit with the clerk of the court.
We changed the section so as to provide
that if the man went into bankruptcy at
a time when moneys were on deposit to
his credit with the clerk under these special

DECEMBER 17, 1962
provisions, those moneys should be distributed by the clerk amongst those creditors who
had filed their claims.
Honourable senators, that is as clear an explanation as I can give of the report made
by your committee. We worked very hard on
the bill and we heard quite a number of
representations. As a result, this report represents the best judgment of your committee
as to the way this bill should appear on our
statute books.

ATLANTIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD
BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Choquette for the second reading of Bill C-94,
to provide for the establishment of an Atlantic
Development Board.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators,
it is with great pleasure that I undertake to
say a few words on this bill. I wish to compliment all the senators who spoke on it, and
especially Senator Welch on his comprehensive and able introduction of the bill.
I listened attentively to the many speakers
who spoke on this bill, and I must say that in
my opinion many of them were out of order
in speaking on matters which had no relation
whatever to the bill itself.
I must say I deplore the fact that so many
illustrious and constructive speeches, containing such commendable recommendations, were
rendered somewhat tasteless by an overdose
of red pigment. One sitting here last Thursday would have thought that he was listening
to a retired professor of medical science,
carried away by partisan ambition, condemning modern science because his past
practice had seen so many failures.
I have no intention of following the same
course. To answer the remark made by
honourable Senator Connolly of Halifax about
the bonfire that would burn continuously for
ten years, I would say that if he were to
add to the fire all the promises and failures
that his party made to the Atlantic provinces
in that period the fire would be kept burning
for twenty years.
Senator Burchill, a great New Brunswicker
and a personal friend of mine for many
years--the lumber king of New Brunswick,
as he is known-referred to his membership
on many boards. He had no trouble naming
several, and naturally he dressed them also
with some red paint. I was amused to hear
him admit so freely that practically every
board of which he was a member was a
failure.
Honourable senators, what has been the
result of these uncalled for remarks throughout the Maritimes? I must say that every one
of the speeches, except for the overdoses I

There is another problem. Many think that
immense public works projects would be the
answer. Others claim that higher standards
of education will cure our high unemployment.
Others suggest that mass deportation from
various areas will cure the ill. Before we arrive at a conclusion I should like for a few
moments to try to tell honourable senators
about conditions in my own county in New
Brunswick. It is only one of 15 counties in the
province, and the same conditions exist in
about 12 others. These are the facts I shall
try to put before you. Let us look for a
moment at how we lived and earned our
bread in the region of Madawaska some 25
years ago; then let us see how we live and
earn our bread today, and what is left of our
earning capacity.
The county of Madawaska has a population
of some 38,000; the increase in the last 25
years has been very small. Twenty-five years
ago the people of that area made their living
from a combination of farming and lumbering. The farms were all small, and they would
at that time provide farmers and their families
with nearly all the food they needed, except
possibly sugar, tea, coffee, molasses, and a f ew
other items. The children's clothing was practically all made at home, and children walked
to school. Taxes were low. Horses were used
by farmers for their daily work. The farmer
was able to find outside employment at any
time, either alone or with his horses. People
used local wood for heating and cooking; this
was a good market at one time and would
provide necessary cash to afford the people a
happy life.
That county was a prosperous lumbering
area. I can remember when there were some
14 sawmills, the smaller ones employing maybe 40 or 50 men and the larger ones some 400
men. In the early fall there was the cutting
operation; in the winter the log hauling, employing hundreds of farmers with their teams
of horses; in the spring came the log drive
and in the summer there was the sawing,
dressing, loading and shipping of the lumber.
This was a continuous operation, which
brought into the area several hundred thousands of dollars. People were happy. Social
assistance or Government handouts were unknown. People respected the democratic
parties and voted Liberal or Conservativebut mostly Conservative. Anyone could find
employment without difficulty.
Furthermore, there were always railroad
maintenance gangs, employing in summer 300
to 400 men, and a sizable amount of road
maintenance provided more work for farmers
and their teams of horses. The cost of living

pleasure in playing up the critical side of the
speeches rather than their constructive contributions.
I deplore this procedure which does so
much harm to our cause. If these statements
of honourable senators were to remain within
the walls of this august chamber, I am sure
we are all men enough to screen them for
their merit; but when they are thrown to
the public, and for one purpose only, the
consequences are destructive and in many
cases the damage is beyond repair.
Honourable senators, criticism is the easiest
thing in the world, for nothing is perfect.
Any one can rise here and find fault and tear
apart any piece of legislation. If I wanted to
do that, it would be the easiest thing in the
world to do, right or wrong. But, honourable
senators, do you not think I would look
rather foolish, coming from the Maritimes,
were I to try to destroy what seems to be
helpful? Instead, if I in a humble way try
to make some contribution, right or wrong,
I believe I will receive better appreciation.
I must touch upon one point in the speech
of the honourable senator from Halifax North
(Hon. Mr. Connolly), when he said:
It would be a board without a single
citizen of the Maritime provinces on it.
I am sure he was not really being sincere
when he made that statement. First, I believe
that this is an insult to the Maritime people,
as they do not deserve this kind of treatment.
For too long this has been the attitude of a
few, that we in the Maritime provinces cannot run our own affairs. Yet we find right
across Canada many of the largest industries
and manufacturers have at their head former
Maritimers. Surely, it is we, the Maritimers,
who know our problems best, and we must
not expect that western or central Canada
will solve them for us. They may be delighted
to help us, as I am sure they are, but it is
we of the Maritimes who will have to pull
the plow; we will have to be the leaders;
we will have to roll up our sleeves. We must
not expect that strangers or outsiders will
solve the problems for us.
The honourable senator from Halifax North
called it "a commercial war." This is a very
poor way to start a war. This is admitting
defeat before the battle starts, and it is not a
true Maritimer's statement. The honourable
senator referred to his impatience with
boards. He said:
. .. boards which all too often are made
up of people who have a most impractical
approach to the problems they are asked
to investigate...

DECEMBER 18, 1962
was unknown. That was 25 years ago. Now let
us look at the transformation that has taken
place and what has brought about high unemployment and poor living conditions. Let us
start with the farmers.
Mechanization was imposed on our small
farmers as modern living conditions brought
about a program of snow removal from our
highways. This brought an end to pulp hauling by farmers, and completely ruined the
furnace and kindling wood market. This may
sound funny, but it removed work which the
farmers previously did. The removal of snow
left the roads bare and the farmers, no longer
able to use their horses for hauling, had to
hire trucks to do this work, and the truckers
absorbed all the profit.
I remember the days when my father was
hauling his pulpwood to the mill for $32 per
cord delivered at the mill. Today the price
of pulpwood is $12 to $16 per cord at the
highway, and it costs $4 per cord to have it
hauled by truck, so the farmer gets less than
$10 per cord. With this situation today he
either works for nothing or gives his pulpwood away.
There is no longer any public work necessitating the use of horses. There is no more
work for them in lumber operations, with
the result that the farmers have had to dispose
of their horses and become mechanized. When
this mechanization started it cost a farmer
approximately $1,000 for a tractor and
necessary equipment for farm use. Today the
same equipment costs between $6,000 and
$8,000.
The farm does not produce the family food
any more, and since small mixed farming
could not provide a sufficient income many
farmers had to completely abandon the farm
and look elsewhere for a livelihood. Others
went into specialized farming and this also
failed because the farms were too small.
Modern education has brought in the
modern regional school with up-to-date transportation for children. This has increased the
taxes in my region over eight times. In 1944
the school budget was about $77,000. Last
year it was over $1 million. This is a tremendous increase in such a short time.
Employment on the railroad has been cut
to a minimum. Where formerly 400 men were
employed, today, with modern machinery,
50 men can do the work. Today every third
farm is abandoned and others are struggling
to save what they now own. This is because
taxes have increased out of all proportion.
This modern system of highway snow
removal not only affected the farmers, but
everybody in the area. The lumbermen who
had been using horses for transportationand I may add that this was a very cheap

means of transportation because the upkeep
of his horses cost very little-had to provide
themselves with a car to get around,
especially to travel to work, if they could find
a job. People in rural areas have to have
transportation to get to school, the post office,
stores, and church. Nobody can live in the
country without some means of transportation. Previously this was provided by horses.
However, these people had to get rid of the
old, faithful horses and provide themselves
with a car. What kind of car could they
afford? The only car they can afford today
is the one which you and I trade in, because
cars have become too expensive to run. That
may seem odd, but it is a fact. This is how
it has affected the farmers.
Now let us see how it has affected the
lumberman. I believe I said a short while ago
that previously there were at least 14 sawmills in my area. Today all have disappeared
except one, and it is struggling to survive and
employs fewer than 20 men. What has caused
this? Large industries have been established
in the region and have taken over from the
Government all available timber and turned
it into a pulpwood operation, putting an end
to log hauling. This in turn has put an end
to the use of axemen. At one time some 4,000
axemen were employed in lumbering during
winter, but this force has now been reduced
to 2,000. Log hauling was completely
abolished, with the result that there was no
more extra work for farmers. River driving
was discontinued and replaced by winter
trucking.
Early in 1950 another blow was dealt the
pulpwood operation. The chain saw was born,
and it reduced the winter cutting operation
from six to four months at first, then from
four to three months, and in many places now
the operation lasts from two to three months.
The labour force which had been already
cut to 2,000 was reduced to 1,500, and then
from 1,500 to 1,000, and later from 1,000 to
a mere 800.
The large paper mills, in order to maintain
their market, had to mechanize and install
many push-button operations. This too has
resulted in a number of layoffs. Worst of all,
the devil himself appeared in 1960 when wood
chippers were introduced into the pulpwood
operation. This will undoubtedly bring about
a more severe layoff in what is left of the
pulp cutting operation, and within a few years
the pulpwood operation will completely disappear.
Twenty-five years ago the Canadian National railroad shops employed 400 men, but
today they employ less than 100. We saw men
with 30 years of seniority having their jobs
abolished and no other work avallable for

them. Where will they go? What will they do?
These are questions of today. We have no industries. If a man is lucky, he gets a job
and lives fairly well, but if he does not have
a job then he just cannot find one.
Honourable senators, this speech may be a
little too long, but I wanted to give a true
picture of the situation in my home province.
We need no outsiders to find the troubles in
our province. We know them. Will the Atlantic Development Board solve these problems? Is a heavy program of public works
necessary? Will the building of the Chignecto
canal, or the P.E.I. causeway, or the development of tidal power be the answer? I do not
know. In time I am sure all these undertakings will help towards bringing about some
solution, but what about an answer to our
immediate problems?
It has been suggested that higher education is the answer, but can we educate 4,000
men up to Grade 5 standard? Can we bring
them back to school? What will they do with
a Grade 5 education? Most of them cannot
read or write. Suppose we are successful in
taking them on to grades Il and 12, what will
they do then? After they have got that education they still have nothing to do. They
must move out of the province.
That might possibly be good for the younger
generation, but I am not worried so much
about that generation. I am worried about
the people of my own age, people of 35, 40, 45,
50 and 60 years of age who have tried to find
employment and who have nothing in sight.
I hope the members of this board will be
the type of people who represent every class
of society, and that they will go down into
these areas and find out exactly what is being
faced by the people there. I hope the members of this board will be people who understand the problems of the fishermen, the lumbermen and the farmers. I hope they will not
think in terms of large industries that will
take three or four years to build at a cost of
some $60 million or $65 million and then employ a mere 300 or 400 people. That is not
exactly the solution we are looking for.
Honourable senators, I would like to change
the subj ect for a f ew moments and offer some
corrections to the speech made yesterday by
my honourable friend Senator Taylor from
Westmorland. He has been a friend of mine
for many years. We did not always agree in
politics, but it is a privilege to have different
views and always remain friends. I cannot
agree with everything he said.
First of all, I would like to thank him for
giving me a few bouquets which were not
entirely deserved. Senator Taylor was a member of the New Brunswick Legislature for a
long time. I may say that he was the secondbest Minister of Agriculture that we had in

New Brunswick. He was very devoted to the
cause and he did a good job. However, as he
said, he was a little annoyed and tired of
hearing that the Liberals had done nothing
in the last 35 years. That is not an uncommon
situation for a politician to find himself in.
I have found myself in a similar situation on
many occasions, and I have been embarrassed
when faced with the truth.
Senator Taylor went back to 1926, which
is 36 years ago, and talked about the Duncan
Commission. This was a rather long time ago,
and it is something that I feel has little relationship to this bill. I say this in a friendly
way. Senator Taylor mentioned the work of
that commission with respect to freight rates,
and I think we all agree that it accomplished
some good. I do not put forward the proposition that the Liberals have done nothing in
my region. I agree that they have done something, but I believe Senator Taylor forgot
to mention some of the things they did that I
would like to put on the record. We agree that
the work of the Duncan Commission resulted
in a reduction in freight rates that was badly
needed, but if we are going to go back to
1926 I would point out that many events took
place in that period.
In 1929-and some honourable senators will
possibly remember this better than I dothere was a stock market crash, and Canada
at that time was under a Liberal Government. That was something not to be forgotten. It is a good thing it did not happen
under a Conservative Government.
Senator Taylor then talked about the Maritime Freight Rates Act of 1927, and again I
agree with what he said. Then he went on
to speak about 1940, but I think I will skip
this because I do not want to get too political.
In 1946 there was a great transformation
in the lumbering operations in Madawaska
County. Senator Taylor was a member of the
government of that year that sold the railways land lease in New Brunswick, comprising large blocks of Crown land, to big industries for the very low price of $2.10 per
acre. As we used ta say, they sold it for the
price of a Christmas tree. I do not criticize
the large concerns that bought that land at
that price. They were made a gift of it on a
silver platter, and they took it. But, honourable senators, we have never recovered from
that transaction.
Al the little mills across the province were
forced to close down their operations because timber was no longer available. This
is something of which Senator Taylor is well
aware because he was a member of the
provincial government at that time.
I could speak of the early years of the war
when many thousands of industries were
brought over from England and went right

DECEMBER 18, 1962
by our doorsteps on their way to central
Canada. Why did they not stop in New
Brunswick? It was because we never had the
necessary hydro-electric power. Who formed
the government in New Brunswick at that
time? It was certainly not the Conservatives.
It is our feeling that they had plenty of
time in which to develop the much needed
hydro-electric power. Lack of such power
was the reason these industries by-passed us.
I should mention at this point that the
honourable senator went out of his way to
do some reading. I remember when I was a
child I was very interested in a comic by
Jules Verne, who was a dreamer. He dreamt
that in our century people would fly like
birds, travel the oceans like fish, and go into
orbit, and so on. While I was listening to
the honourable senator last night he reminded
me of Jules Verne, for he tried to take the
credit for many things that apparently his
government proposed, but never achieved. I
do not think we can give much credit to Jules
Verne for his wonderful dreams. The credit
should go to the people who actually built
his gadgets and made reality out of his
dreams.
Senator Taylor read from the 1957 editorial of Hansard of the House of Commons,
and I have in my hand copies of documents
and correspondence from the Honourable
Mr. Harris who was then the Minister of
Finance in a Liberal government. This is a
long story, honourable senators, and I could
keep you here all afternoon and tomorrow
in the telling of it. I have no intention of
doing that, so I shall cut a few corners.
When the Conservatives came into power
in New Brunswick in 1952 we tried to follow
the recommendations of the Duncan Commission. That commission recommended assistance for the Maritime provinces. I was one
of those who came to Ottawa with my premier many, many times. We made proposals
all the way along from 1953 and 1954, and
the result was always the same. We came
to Ottawa with briefs. We were well represented and well received. We saw the
Prime Minister of the day the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, and we saw Mr.
Abbott, Mr. Harris and Mr. Lesage. We had
the best receptions but we never accomplished
anything. There was always something missing in our brief, and we had to go back to
New Brunswick to correct it. We would come
back to Ottawa three or four months later
with other recommendations and other adjustments to the brief, and then have to
go back home again. They kept us at that
for a number of years.
On April 27, 1953, there was presented here
a brief for use in conjunction with the Duncan

Report. Here is a letter which was received
on February 3, 1954, which I will read. It is
dated Ottawa 4, Ontario, February 3, 1954,
and reads:
Mr. R. S. Fitz Randolph, Comptroller
General,
Province of New Brunswick,
Fredericton, N. B.
Dear Mr. Fitz Randolph:
Confirming our telephone conversation,
we have, as you know, given long and
careful consideration to your proposals
regarding federal assistance to the Government of New Brunswick in financing
the development of hydro-electric power
on the St. John river.
I am now directed by my minister to
say that he has reviewed this matter with
his colleagues, and the conclusion reached
is that it would not be right or proper
for the federal government to provide
funds by loan or otherwise for the development of provincial natural resources
along the lines you suggest.
I should like to add that those of us
who have been studying this problem
have been impressed by the recent improvements in the New Brunswick credit
rating, and I am sure that relying on the
continued efficient use of established resources and the promise of rich new
resources indicated by recent mineral explorations, the people of New Brunswick
can look forward to a sustained period of
expanding development and rising standards of living.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) K. W. Taylor,
Deputy Minister of Finance.
If this is not a formal refusal, I do not
know what it is.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): May I ask
the honourable senator a question? Will he
also put on record the application of the New
Brunswick Government over the signature of
the premier, and what was said to the federal
government?
(Madawaska-RestiHon. Mr. Fournier
gouche): If it is available, I might do so.
Honourable senators, there is something else
I would like to put on record. Senator Taylor
is a politician with very long experience. In
the quotation which he read last eveningwhich I do not have to read again, as it is
printed in Senate Hansard-he omitted theý
first paragraph, and I believe that paragraph
should be placed on the record. It is found on
the same page, 2220, of the House of Commons.
Hansard for March 14, 1957.

SENATE
Yesterday evening, Senator Taylor quoted
Mr. Harris' statement, starting with these
words: "It is suggested by experts-" The
paragraph which I wish to put on record is
this:
Another matter affecting important
areas of the Atlantic region is the relatively high cost of electric power as compared with most other parts of Canada.
The Government has had a number of
proposals put before it, but has not as yet
been able to satisfy itself that any of these
projects are both technically and economically sound and at the same time
beyond the financial capacity of the provincial government concerned.
What about this proposal which the Govof Canada made to New Brunswick?
I possibly was responsible for the refusal of
this proposal, for as head of a $100 million
corporation I could never agree that the federal Government should build a power plant
in New Brunswick, not knowing the cost of
the plant, the cost of the operation, and the
cost of the power which would come out at
the end of the line. We were never able to
obtain that information from the federal
Government, as they did not know. I could
not take full responsibility for refusing this
proposal. No businessman would approve of
a construction costing some $20 million, for
which he would become responsible, without
knowing the cost of construction or the cost
of the power which would be produced. This
was the reason why we could not accept the
proposal.
It was the same thing with the building of
the grid system lines. We were supposed to
take the equipment in and pay these bills,
but like any good businessman we wanted to
know where we were going. That was never
made possible. However, there was a change
in Government and we built a power plant.
We got the assistance, according to the Duncan Report, and built a grid system. Al this
was taken as being an initial step towards
bringing in industry, so as to raise the economy of the province of New Brunswick.
We have built one plant after another, and
New Brunswick has ample power now to
maintain large industries. There is even a
surplus of power there. As my honourable
friend would know, the generating plants of
5,000 or 8,000 kilowatts, which I called in
many cases puppet plants, have gone up to
50,000 and 60,000 kilowatts. That is following
the right procedure.
There was another statement which I was
very pleased to hear my friend make. It is
one that will cure a long-standing dispute
between his premier, Premier Robichaud of

·ernment

New Brunswick, and the people of that province. He was talking about the 10-9-50 formula and the 13-9-50 formula. I quote:
In the case of New Brunswick this
provided slightly over $2 million additional revenue and, of course, the same
principle applied to the other Atlantic
provinces and all provinces of Canada.
I am glad that this is on the record, as
Premier Robichaud has been telling the
people of New Brunswick very forcefully and
fiercely that all he was receiving from this
provincial tax agreement was $640,000 or
$1.04 per capita. This is in the record and is
irrefutable, and has been thrown to the people
of New Brunswick by Mr. Robichaud every
time he has opened his mouth. I am glad the
honourable Senator Taylor has cleared up
this matter.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): On a point
of privilege, I rise to indicate that I made no
such statement as to what the province is
getting now. What I was referring to was
the change in the tax formula of 1958. The
change in the basis from 10-9-50 to 13-9-50
made the difference, and that gave the province $2 million extra. Under the new tax
agreement made last year we are now receiving only about $641,000 more than before.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I cannot agree with the senator; the
records are there and will speak for themselves.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): The records are there all right.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I say this because I do not like
these manoeuvres. Now I am very glad to
come back to the Atlantic provinces question.
I know very well that those honourable
senators who are engaged in large industries
or living in large cities or in wealthy farming
areas have no idea of the tough time we
have. We are asking you for your support in
this bill. I know that you will not turn us
down; I know that you want to help.
For a moment, let us have faith in the
promoters of this bill. If they went thus far,
surely they are not going to relax? The
sponsor, the Honourable Hugh John Flemming, himself a businessman, well known not
only in the province of New Brunswick but
across Canada, a former premier of New
Brunswick, is well qualified to deal with this
and no one knows better than he the condition of the Maritime provinces. Let us
have faith in the Conservative Government
of the day, which did more for the Maritimes
in the last five years than all previous governments put together.

DECEMBER 18, 1962
I will now quote some figures. No one
will deny that we got $29 million for Beechwood development assistance, $3 million for
grid electric power assistance, and $100 million on the tax agreement. No one will deny
that we have a better deal now under the
federal tax agreement. No one will deny that
coal subventions have increased also. If you
add these totals and spread them over the
last 25 years, you can come to your own
conclusions.
Let us have faith. Time will tell. Let us
be confident. If this measure proves to be
successful, so much the better; this is what
we want. If it does not prove to be successful,
then I hope we will all be here again to get
behind this project and make it successful.
That will be the time to raise other points
and see that this project is put into operation
in the proper way.
I personally do not agree with all that is
in this bill. If I were to say I did, I would
not be honest with you. I do not exactly
agree with everything it says, but I believe
we should at least give it a chance. Let us
try it. There are many things in it that do
not exactly suit me, but I am happy with
what is going to be done at this moment.
Let us not forget that any government
which cannot provide for the poor will not
be able to protect the rich very long. This is
the situation in my county.
Honourable senators, I should like to conclude with a few words in French. I shall be
brief.

The bill entitled an "Act to provide for the
establishment of an Atlantic Development
Board" is like a new beacon on the horizon.
Our economic rehabilitation cannot be accomplished overnight because we are lagging
far behind. But together, we can all march.
forward, firmly, side by side, and every step
we take will be in the right direction. It
shall be our duty to remove the largest boulders and stumbling blocks from our path if
we want to build a better future.
Let us not believe that the day after royal
assent is given this bill we are going to
be transported into some kind of Eden, or
into a new world. Let us not ask what this
legislation will bring us. Rather, let us ask
ourselves what we can bring to the legislation in terms of positive contribution, and
with a determined effort we may reach the
ideal we have been striving for, namely, a
new period of Renaissance for the Atlantic
provinces. If we are willing to follow this
path, our efforts will be successful.
Let us not forget the proverb:
God helps those who help themselves.
Here in this house today I say: God and the
Diefenbaker government help those who help
themselves.

long overdue. There is urgency in the need,
and the establishment of an Atlantic Development Board should, if composed of those

at heart, bring new life and happiness to this
area of Canada.

that financial assistance is of paramount importance. The studies, recommendations and
good wishes of any number of boards are
of small value unless financial means for
implementing such recommendations are
readily available. May I add that it will take
a long time to overcome mistakes that were
made when the Maritimes came into Confederation.

this bill before us, and I would recommend
that it be sent to the appropriate committee,

disposed to deliver his speech this afternoon.

PANY-SECOND READING

COM-

Hon. Donald Cameron moved the second
reading of Bill S-19, respecting Co-operative
Fire and Casualty Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to convert the present company
from a mutual to a joint stock company. The
present contributors to the guarantee fund
of the company, being members of the cooperative movement across Canada, will be
given the opportunity to convert their conto approximately
tributions, amounting
$1,100,000, into shares of the capital stock of
the company. The resulting shareholders will
have exclusive voting rights after the expiry
date of existing policies, but surpluses may
continue to be paid to policyholders as before.
The company was first incorporated in 1951,
and in the ensuing eleven years has become
a very successful and growing business enterprise. Present prospects are that the company
will continue to grow, and the proposed
change set forth in the bill will strengthen
the capital structure by converting it to
capital stock.
One of the main changes to be brought
about by the bill will be that control of the
company will be in the hands of the shareholders rather than in the hands of the

change in control. The change will simply
consolidate control where it already exists,
in the hands of the co-operative movement
in Canada.
Section 4(1) of the bill refers to the
schedule of the bill and converts presently
contributed capital in the amount of $817,300
instead of the total contributed capital of
$1,100,000. The reason for the difference between presently contributed capital and converted capital is that there are some contributors who, because of their present charters
or by-laws, are unable to invest in share
capital in this way. There are other contributors, mostly small ones, who would rather
have their capital paid back as soon as the
company is able to do so, instead of having
the money converted to capital stock. The
amount involved in this respect is only
$282,700. If at a later time a contributor
wishes to convert his contribution to share
capital, he may do so under section 4(2).
Then, under section 4(4), the company can,
when able, pay back the cash contributions
which have been advanced.
If the company should require additional
capital in the future it may obtain it in
the same way as the original contributions,
namely, from the co-operatives.
In section 8 provision is made for the
distribution of surpluses to policyholders in
the same manner as in the past. The section
in the bill concerning this is the same as in
the earlier act.

While no mention of it is made in the bill,
it is proposed that the by-laws will limit
dividends to shareholders to six per cent,
in the same way as was the case of returns
to contributors under the act. The net result
will be that the return of surpluses earned by
the company, if any, will continue to be made
to the policyholders after the nominal return
on capital has been made to the shareholders.
HonourabIe senators, I think I have covered
the main points of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honourable friend a question? What section of the

contributor who does not wish to become a

ATLANTIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Welch for the second reading of Bill C-94, to
provide for the establishment of an Atlantic
Development Board.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
I have read Bill C-94 quite carefully. I agree
with the bill as far as it goes, but I disagree
with its limited powers. The word "development" as applied to the Atlantic provinces
is mentioned many, many times in the bill,
as it should be. Although I am in favour of
the bill, I fully realize it is very vague in
many respects and that it should be more
definite in its purposes. If the bill is passed
as is, it seems to me that just another board
will be established, so to speak. We have had
such easy-going boards in the past without
the results expected.

Let me read from section 9 of the bill,
headed "Objects and Powers".
(1) The objects of the Board are to
inquire into and report to the Minister
upon measures and projects for fostering
the economic growth and development of
the Atlantic region of Canada, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may, in furtherance of
its objects,
(a) prepare on a systematic and comprehensive basis and revise as required
in the light of changing circumstances, an
assessment of factors relevant to economic growth in the Atlantic region;
(b) keep under constant review appropri-ate methods of furthering the sound
economic development of the Atlantic
region, whether such methods involve
new measures and projects or the removal or mitigation of existing factors
that may be considered to inhibit such
development;
Then the bill goes on to provide:
10 The Board shall meet at such times
and places as it deems necessary but
shall meet at least once a year in the
City of Ottawa.
11 (1) The Governor in Council may
appoint an Executive Director of the
Board, who shall hold office during pleasure and shall be paid such salary and expenses as are fixed by the Governor in
Council.
The Atlantic provinces know well their
needs and are fully capable of finding a chief
executive if given the authority to do so.
The chief executive officer of this board will
have to be a man of very high executive
experience in pioneering, building and developing. Such men are available, but they
likely already have big jobs. I have lived
most of my life in the Atlantic provinces
and have helped, in a small way, to pioneer
a business from practically nothing to worldwide fame, and I know what can be accomplished there by knowledge, real hard work
and capital.
As I have stated in this honourable house
several times, all material wealth is derived
from the land, sea, and forest. There is no
other source, and we in the Atlantic provinces have these resources in abundance but
they are, to a large extent, undeveloped. For
instance, all we have done with our immense
coal deposits is sell them as fuel; whereas,
there are over 500 derivatives coal can be
turned into, such as chemicals, and so forth.
I do not know of any place in America or
any other part of the world where, because of
13 miles of land, vessels are forced to go 400

SENATE
miles or more to reach their destination. I
have in mind the building of the Chignecto
canal, which we were promised at Confederation. As to the power to be generated on the
canal, that is a question for the governments
of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to settle;
but the digging of the ditch, or canal, and
the building of locks so that ships can operate
is the responsibility of the federal Government. If tolls are needed in connection with
the Chignecto canal, I suppose they will have
to be collected, but that was not in the
promise made to these provinces at the time
of Confederation.
The Atlantic provinces control about the
most strategic seaboard in Canada. This came
about when Newfoundland entered into Confederation. We lost about half the seacoast .of
British Columbia under the Alaskan award,
but we still own 100 per cent of our Atlantic
seaboard, and we can thank Newfoundland
for saving parts of it for us. The new development of iron ore mines and other metals
means that hundreds of ships loaded with
ore will come down from the north and seek
a protected area from the Northumberland
Straits to the Bay of Fundy and hence to the
United States seaboard, saving a distance of
400 miles.
Let us examine this act further, where
it says an executive will be appointed to
initiate and operate all this development of
the Atlantic area-of course, under a board
which meets occasionally, as stated. Now this
will be about the most important position ever
originated in the Atlantic provinces. The men
of the best ability to fill such a position are
those who know how to create wealth and
prosperity from these abundant resources.
Such men are hard to find and probably have
at present important jobs, but they can be
obtained if the inducement is substantial.
May I refer to the greatest private-enterprise industrialist in the British Commonwealth-a Canadian whom I knew well when
he was in humble circumstances and who has
now gained fame and fortune. We have always
been close friends, and I asked him a short
time ago what the secret of his success was.
He replied, "It was not necessarily me, but
the executives I was able to get to help me.
My business enterprises in Canada, the United
States, England, Australia, Germany, France
and other countries are operated by my executives." As an old friend I asked him what
he paid his executives, and he told me he
paid the top ones $100,000 a year each and
that they all had to make good, or else. He
added that they were really the lowest-priced
men in his employ, as far as profits and
growth went.
What is needed in the Atlantic provinces
is a pioneer builder and developer from the

ground up. To talk about getting such a man
at $3,000 a year or $10,000 a year is sheer
nonsense. My opinion, for what it is worth,
is that unless we can afford to pay at least
$25,000 a year this bill is quite useless and
might as well go out the window, as far as
gaining the results we so badly need for our
economy.
As stated, the head of this board will have
to be a man who will make it his life's work
to develop our vast resources on the Atlantic
seaboard. It will take long and arduous hours
of work to obtain the results we seek and
deserve.
Honourable senators will recall that the
honourable senator from Madawaska-Restigouche (Hon. Mr. Fournier), while speaking
about power development in New Brunswick
yesterday, read into the record a letter
addressed to Mr. R. S. Fitz Randolph,
of New Brunswick,
Comptroller-General
signed by the Deputy Minister of Finance, in
which the deputy minister turned down a
proposal of the province of New Brunswick
for assistance in the development of the Saint
John River watershed. You will also remember that the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) requested that he
put on record the reason for this refusal,
and to read into the record the proposal by
the province of New Brunswick submitted to
the Government at Ottawa. This, you will
recall, was not done. I would like, therefore,
to put on record the request made by the
Government of New Brunswick, under the
signature of the then premier, the Honourable Hugh John Flemming. It reads as
follows:
(1) That the federal Government
advance to the province of New Brunswick the cost of developing the Beechwood Hydro-Electric Power generating
station with projects incidental thereto,
estimated cost to 1960-$44,400,000.
(2) That the money be advanced as
required.
(3) That the funds be interest free, or
if this should prove to be impossible, that
the rate of interest be 21 per cent and
interest free during construction.
(4) That payments be made at the rate
of 1.5 per cent of the principal amount
each year, the first payment to be due
one year after the completion of the
particular project for which the money
was advanced.
This proposal was presented to the federal
Government in 1953.
Then again in 1955, in a brief under date
of March 25 of that year, at page 27 the
following appears:

DECEMBER 19, 1962
It was obvious that great advantages
would be gained by obtaining long term
loans at a low interest rate to provide the
capital for Beechwood's construction.
On March 27, 1953, a brief, outlining
the need for provincial assistance to
site, was
develop the Beechwood
presented to the Government of Canada
by the Government of New Brunswick,
together with a request that the federal
Government agree to advance to the
province as work progressed, sufficient
funds to permit the development of
Beechwood; that the repayment rate
should be 12% per year, starting one
year after the plant goes into operation;
and that the interest rate should not
exceed 21%.
That, it will be noted, appears on page 27,
and on page 28 appears the letter the honourable senator referred to.
It is interesting to note that these terms are
the only ones upon which the province of
New Brunswick appealed to the former
Liberal Government for assistance in this development; it is also noteworthy that the repayment of the loan was to be for a period
of 66 years, and to be interest free if possible,
but if not, the interest was not to exceed 2î
per cent.
Honourable senators, it is now interesting to
note that the Flemming Government of New
Brunswick accepted a loan from the Conservative Government at Ottawa for the building of Beechwood, not for $44,400,000, but for
$29,000,000.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Would you answer a question for me,
sir? Would you be prepared to produce all
the briefs presented after that so that the
record may be complete?
Hon. Mr. McLean: I shall try and obtain
that, sir.
It is also interesting to note that that government is forced to pay back to the dominion
the total amount of the loan in eight equal
annual instalments, and that under the act
the loan would bear an interest rate not exceeding 4R per cent per annum.
You will also recall that reference was made
to the proposal by the former Government
through the Honourable Mr. Harris and the
Honourable Mr. Lesage for assistance in the
development of transmission lines and power
facilities in the Maritime provinces. In referring to that the honourable senator said
the reason the Government of New Brunswick turned this proposal down, even after
Premier Flemming accepted it as a good proposal, was that the Government of Canada

could not tell the Maritime provinces what
the exact cost of power would be under this
plan.
I would like to ask the honourable senator
this question: Can any Government under any
circumstances tell the exact cost of power before the power installations are made? I am
sure that the honourable senator, even though
he was Chairman of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, could not tell the
people of New Brunswick, nor were the people
of New Brunswick told, what the exact cost
of power would be from the Beechwood development.
These facts, honourable senators, I think
will clear the air so far as the honourable
senator's statements yesterday are concerned.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Mr. Speaker, may I answer the question asked by the honourable senator?
The Hon. the Speaker: You are not permitted to answer the question.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
would like to make a few remarks. I do not
wish to speak at any length on the bill, except to say that it is one with which I agree
wholeheartedly.
It has been suggested by some honourable
members that it would be well to send this
bill to a committee. It is not necessary for me
to point out that this bill has already received
very thorough study in the other place, and
in the debate on the motion for second reading in the Senate we have heard some excellent speeches from both sides of the house.
Many points have been brought out which, I
am sure, will be of great benefit to the Atlantic Development Board which I am certain
will be set up.
In ordinary circumstances I would not think
of objecting to the sending of a bill such
as this to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, because no bill loses anything
by being referred to that committee. In fact,
there has always been some gain. However,
I am sure all honourable senators will agree
that this bill is not of a technical nature. It
is not a bill in respect of which representations are needed from officials of a government department, or in respect of which delegations from various sections of the country
would come to Ottawa to present their views.
This is a clear-cut bill, having to do with the
setting up of a board.
Honourable senators, my chief reason for
asking that this legislation be given second
reading and not be sent to a committee is
lack of time. We are drawing very near the
Christmas recess, and I can assure all honourable senators that the people of the Atlantic
provinces are most anxious to have this bill

SENATE
passed as soon as possible. I may say that if
this bill is sent to a committee we will run
great danger that it might not come back to
this house for third reading before the recess. There is to be a recess of a month, and
just what business might be placed before
Parliament after that is unpredictable. When
we return we may find many matters that are
considered more important than this bill, although not by the people of the Atlantic
provinces. They are anxious to have this bill
passed and, accordingly, I ask the indulgence
of the Senate in allowing this bill to be read
the second time now, and to be read the third
time at our next sitting.
I have expressed my feelings, honourable
senators, and I am sure they are shared by
the people who are most concerned with this
bill, namely, the people of the four Atlantic
provinces.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I must say that I am deeply disappointed in the possibility that this bill will
receive third reading without going before
a committee. It is a long bill. It is an unusual bill, and one that I think can be improved by a committee. There are some 19
clauses in it and, as the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) himself has admitted, committees of the Senate
have in times past improved many bills. We
have frequently found that bills coming to the
Senate from the other place-and I cast no
reflection on that house-are not perfect, and
that from time to time they have been perfected in this house, especially by the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I fully expected that this bill would be
referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. I recall that in the excellent presentation made of this bill by the honourable
Senator Welch we were led to believe that
it would be referred to a committee. Senator
Welch's words were:
Honourable senators, I have not explained this bill in any great detail, as
I expect the various clauses will be
examined in committee.
If that was not a suggestion that the bill
would be referred to a committee, then I do
not know what it was. However, the Leader
of the Government has posed a problem. We
are now near the Christmas recess, he says.
He is a much better authority on this matter
than I am, and he says that the people of the
Atlantic provinces want the bill now.
I am torn between two desires, one to perfect the bill, and the other to let the people
of the Atlantic provinces have it in its present
form without delay. If there are imperfec-

tions in the bill, I suppose we can correct
them at some other time. I would not wish to
prevent the passage of the bill and thus deny
the Atlantic provinces the benefits of it, if
there are such.
We have heard arguments both ways here.
Some honourable senators have submitted that
there is nothing new in the measure, that
similar commissions have been set up on many
occasions since Confederation and that this is
just another such effort. That may be so. It
is obvious that there have been many commissions.
The thought occurs to me that it might be
better for the Atlantic provinces if even a
small committee of this bouse were set up to
examine the recommendations made in the
past and make representations to the Government right now, within the next month
or two.
What new recommendations could come forward? As I listened to the arguments advanced here during the past week regarding
this and that commission, it seemed to me
that nothing had been done about them and
many of them had been entirely overlooked.
A small committee such as I suggest could
examine those recommendations and bring
forth something which would get action now
for the Atlantic provinces. However, the Government has not seen fit to act in that way
and bas brought in this new bill entitled "An
Act to provide for the Establishment of an
Atlantic Development Board." It must have
taken considerable time to decide on the wording of the bill, as there were so many previous boards. Now someone has thought up a
new name for a new board.
The Atlantic provinces want another try
at a solution of their problems, and I am not
inclined to stand in the way of this bill going
forward. As the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) has said, if this bill goes
to committee it could not be given the consideration it should receive before Christmas,
and if it goes over Christmas it cannot be
again considered until January 28, when the
committee would have to go to work. This
would mean that it could be well into February before the bill would be finally considered. In view of the apparent wish of the
Atlantic provinces that they should have the
measure passed, I think it is inconceivable
that we should hold it up that long. Therefore, with regret, but under the circumstances,
so far as I am concerned I do not object to
the bill being brought forward, not today,
but tomorrow, for third reading.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I was glad to yield to the two
leaders, so as to hear their remarks about
this bill. I hope no one will think I am

DECEMBER 19, 1962
opposed to the redressment of the wrongs
which may or may not have been suffered
by the Atlantic provinces.
From the time of Sir John Macdonald, the
first Prime Minister after Confederationand the practice existed before that, as you
all know-there was one easy way to solve
all Canadian problems, though only for the
time being, and to satisfy the minds of people
who had a grievance to lay before the
Throne. People with a grievance were asked,
"What is the matter? What do you complain
of?" And they were told, "If you are not
satisfied, the Government will appoint a commission." Then, when a commission was not
enough the Government appointed a board,
something above a commission. Such boards
were as numerous as the stars visible in the
sky on a clear night. There were boards to
the right and boards to the left, composed of
gentlemen who had to walk ponderously,
their backs slightly bent, to show they were
carrying a great burden and a heavy
responsibility.
What did the boards decide? Very little.
When they agreed to make recommendations,
the Government paid no attention to them.
Despite that, the boards existed and acted as
a palliative for the troubles and wrongs
suffered by the people.
In this case, let us ask what is the purpose
of the proposed board. For instance, the
Canadian National Railways is not giving a
fair deal to the Maritime provinces. I know
that. I know the kind of cars that are put on
the trains; I know the difficulties we have
with them. However, let us look at the bright
future, at the silver lining to the cloud-there
will be a board, and it is most urgent.
Honourable senators, it is no easy matter
to establish a board. We have to rush it.
We must pass two readings of the bill this
very afternoon, in order to have that board
become law and to inquire into certain
things.
Section 9 of the bill sets out the objects
and powers of the board, giving a condensation of the lawmakers' intent. Mark you, we
are all lawmakers here. That section, as
drafted, represents the intention of the
Government on whose instructions it was
drafted. It says:
The objects of the Board are to inquire
into and report to the Minister upon
measures and projects for fostering the
economic growth and development of the
Atlantic region of Canada...
Was that not done over a period of five
years? They had 100 per cent Tory members
for the province of Nova Scotia, and a good
measure of members for the province of New
27511-5--31

Brunswick; four Conservative members for
the province of Prince Edward Island and
two for the province of Newfoundland, all
for four years. Now there is one member of
the Conservative party sitting for Newfoundland. Those must be capable men and familiar
with what is happening in their constituencies and whatever is wrong there. They
should have reported to the Governmenteither personally to the minister, or to the
Government as a whole, in the caucus room.
The purpose of a caucus is to give an
opportunity to the official representatives of
the people for certain constituencies to tell
the Prime Minister and other cabinet members what is wrong.
We have this legislation before us today
because the Conservative members from the
Maritime provinces during the past five years
have been afraid to speak to the Government;
or, if they have spoken and told the truth,
apparently they have not been listened to.
Naturally, I am not in on the secrets of
Government, and I must judge it as I see it.
Each Conservative member from the Maritime provinces knows what is wrong in his
constituency if he is in contact, as he must
be, with the people, with the municipal
councils, and the boards of trade, and he has
only to tell the Government what is wrong
there. Nevertheless, we are asked to pass
this legislation today-the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) is insistent
upon it-and it is just because the Conservative members of Parliament for the four great
Maritime provinces have not told the Government what it expects to hear from the
members of the board. It strikes me as
something quite unbelievable. I know very
well that it must have been done, and the
Government cannot have forgotten it.
But today we have this bill. First, subsection 1 of section (9) says:
The objects of the Board are to inquire
into and reportIt is just as if the Government had not
heard a word from the Conservative members
of the Maritime provinces about their troubles. Secondly, the board is to inquire into
and report
-upon measures and projects for fostering the economic growth and development of the Atlantic region of CanadaNo one has any objection to that. When
legislation to help the Maritimers comes
before us, we from the central provinces
are glad to give them a hand. We shake
hands with them and say, "We are behind
you, but we must know beforehand what is
to be done".

SENATE
The subsection goes on to say,
-without limiting the generality of the
foregoingThose are just meaningless words.
-the Board may, in furtherance of its
objects,
(a) prepare on a systematic and comprehensive basis, and revise as required
in the light of changing circumstances,
an assessment of factors relevant to
economic growth in the Atlantic region.
Why has that not been done during the
past five years? That is elementary; it is the
first thing to do. The ministers go to the
Maritime provinces and make their speeches,
and they must hear something in return.
No one knows that better than the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks), who
was very active. I do not say that he has
not made representations to the Government
for the improvement of conditions in the
Maritime provinces, but I say that he has
not been listened to, and for that I am
very sorry.
When we think of the amount of money
that is spent for western farmers, and then
think of how the farmers in the east are
treated, it is unbelievable. I praise the Government for having appointed Mr. Chagnon
as joint Deputy Minister of Agriculture, for
he is a very good man. But that is all that
has been done for the farmers of the east;
and when I say the farmers of the east, I
include the farmers of central Canada as
well as those of the Maritime provinces.
Let me read subparagraph (a) again:
(a) prepare on a systematic and comprehensive basis and revise as required
in the light of changing circumstances,
an assessment of factors relevant to
economic growth in the Atlantic region.
"Changing circumstances"-the circumstances have changed during the past five years.
Do they have to have a diary of the changing
circumstances of the farmers in the Maritimes? We see the closing of mines in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick. There is a bill
yet to come before us to give the mining
section of that area another chance. I will
vote to give them a chance. I will ask some
particulars about the intention of the Canadian National Railways in that respect, but
I will be in favour of the bill. This bill has
nothing to do with the other legislation that
will come here as soon as it is passed by the
House of Commons.
I now read paragraph (b) of section
9(1) of the bill before us:
(b) keep under constant review appropriate methods of furthering the sound
economic development of the Atlantic

region, whether such methods involve
new measures and projects or the removal or mitigation of existing factors
that may be considered to inhibit such
development.
That is what we call in French, "midi à
quatorze heures", or "noon at fourteen hours".
"Exception déclinatoire", as we say, or "declinatory exception".
Now, there is more to it. The next paragraph contains a sentence that is endless.
It has ten lines, and stops at a semi-colonit is still not finished. I will read it so that
you, my honourable colleagues, will see what
kind of legislation is presented to us. What
is the meaning of this kind of legislation,
which nobody understands, and if it passes
it will go on the statute books as just another act?
I now read paragraph (c):
(c) with respect to particular measures
or projects that may be referred to it by
the Minister, inquire into, assess and report to the Minister upon the feasibility
of such measures or projects and the
effect thereof in relation to the economy
of the Atlantic region, and make recommendations to the Minister with respect
to any such measures or projects that in
the opinion of the Board would significantly contribute to the growth and development of the economy of the Atlantic region;
Did you understand a word that I read? You
heard the words, but you did not understand the meaning because it had none. And
who is that great gentleman, "the Minister"?
We will see. The Minister, it says, will change.
It will be like a movie. In the interpretation
clause, section 2, the bill says:
(c) "Minister" means such member of
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada as
may from time to time be designated by
the Governor in Council to act as the
Minister for the purposes of this Act.
The minister will change according to the
fashion; and if one minister says, "Well, I
cannot deal with it", they will try another
one, and finally they will go through all the
Cabinet without any result. It is the first
time I have seen that kind of legislation,
where the minister changes. It is ridiculous.
Let me repeat the last few words:
...

as may from time to time be desig-

nated by the Governor in Council to act
as the Minister for the purposes of this
Act.
Who will be appointed? There are twentyone or twenty-two Cabinet ministers. Who
will take charge of that board? Will

DECEMBER 19, 1962

it be a minister from the Maritime provinces? Those gentlemen are very busy.
There is no Cabinet minister for the province of Newfoundland. There is only one
Conservative member and he is parliamentary secretary to one of the Cabinet ministers. There is the honourable Minister of
Finance, who is a busy man. Will he have
time to do it? Then let us take the minister
from New Brunswick. He is the Minister of
National Revenue, and is also quite busy.
The minister from the province of Prince
Edward Island is the Minister of Fisheries,
a very important activity. He does very well,
too. I am not criticizing him, and I am not
criticizing the two others I have mentioned;
they are good men, but they have not time
to look after this board. These are the best
men in the Cabinet to say what conditions
are in the Maritime provinces.
I challenge the Government to appoint the
Minister of Finance, the Minister of National
Revenue or the Minister of Fisheries, who are
three important ministers holding important
portfolios, to take charge of this board. A new
minister will have to be appointed. New legislation will have to be passed to appoint a new
minister to look after this.
They should appoint the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Brooks) to
take charge of the board. I know he is very
busy but he is genial, friendly, and knows
all about the Maritimes; he is the man to be
given the job. Honourable senators, if he
were appointed I would say nothing more. But
now I am in the dark; I do not know who will
get the appointment. I do not know if the
Government will appoint anyone as competent
as our leader has been, first as Minister of
Veterans Affairs and now as Leader of the
Government here.
Honourable senators, there is another sentence in section 9(1) about the objects and
powers of the board. It is paragraph (d):
consider and report to the Minister upon
any other matters that in the opinion of
the Board may usefully be considered by
it having regard to the need for a continuing sound economic development of
the Atlantic region.
Do you know what the speeches will be
about during the next campaign, whether it
starts next month or three months from now?
They will be: "We want a sound economic development of the Atlantic region. I want it
too, but I know that this measure will be
useless. I am honest with you. Do you blame
me for being honest with you, my dear
colleagues? Let me tell you sincerely that
I am not impressed by this legislation at all.
27511-5-31J

I will read more under "Objects and
Powers" of the board. Subsection (2) of section 9 says:
The Board shall, to the greatest possible extent consistent with the performance of its duties under this Act, cooperate with the National Economic
Development Board...
There is already one board in existence that
does nothing. Now we are setting up another
board, the Atlantic Development Board, and
it will have to co-operate with the National
Economic Development Board. Not only that,
but the board we are setting up must cooperate with the National Productivity Council. That is another board or some other
organization that has not been found workable
and is no good. They will put the Atlantic
board on those two crutches. And mark you,
Sir and honourable colleagues, that is not all:
There is the conscription issue, which I must
read in full. Let me repeat this sentence and
you will see the magnitude of the helplessness-a good English word, and I emphasize it.
The Board shall, to the greatest possible
extent consistent with the performance of
its duties under this Act, co-operate ...
I add, first.
... with the National Economic Development Board ...
And second.
...

the National Productivity Council...

Then it brings in thirty, forty or fifty
departments, branches and other agencies of the Government of Canada having
duties related to, or having aims...
Lofty aims.
... or objects related to those of the

Board.
This legislation is introduced because the
National Economic Development Board, the
National Productivity Council, and all departments, branches and other agencies of the
Government of Canada have been unsuccessful and useless in that respect, and we have
to create another board.
All this reminds me of the way an engineer
with the Department of Public Works used
to practise economy. There is a wharf at
Cacouna, and when the planks on the wharf
rotted he used to put the good planks over
the rotten ones in order to save money. Well,
honourable senators, I will not use the expression "rotten" with regard to the National
Economic Development Board because the
name is too beautiful, nor will I use it with
regard to the National Productivity Council

SENATE
because the name is too sublime. But here we
are, and I am surprised not to have found the
word "efficiency" in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Perhaps you could
amend it.
Hon. Mr. Poulio±: I say that all the other
boards or organizations or inventions have
been useless, and that is why we are asked to
establish a new board.
If you share my opinion about it, honourable colleagues, you will be frank with the
suffering Maritimers and tell them that we
will leave this bill on a shelf and we will
crack the whip at the National Economic
Development Board, the National Productivity
Council, and all departments, branches and
other agencies of the Government so that they
may make useful suggestions to the Government for the assistance and relief of the good
Canadian people living in the Maritime provinces.
I have nothing else to say, honourable
senators, except that I am shocked at this
legislation. To put it in a nutshell, if I am
told by the Government that the honourable
Leader of the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) will be the minister in
charge of this board I will agree to second
and third reading at once; but if I do not
know what minister or ministers will be in
charge to look after it, the Senate may vote
second reading today but I will object strongly
to the third reading.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: On division. It cannot be
read a third time today.
Hon. Mr. Brooks moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
TRUST COMPANY-SECOND
READING
Hon. Lionel Choquette moved the second
reading of Bill S-20, to incorporate Standard
Trust Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
really a re-application for the passing of
legislation to incorporate Standard Trust
Company. This re-application becomes necessary because the company did not conform
to section 13(4) of the Trust Companies Act,
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, chapter
272. That section reads as follows:
STANDARD

No certificate under this section shall
be given unless application therefor is
made within two years after the passing
of the company's act of incorporation, or
within such extended period not exceeding one year as the Governor in Council
before the expiration of such two years
allows.
In 1959-to be exact, on June 16 of that
year-the late Senator Brunt introduced a
comparable bill, Bill S-28, and on second
reading, on June 18, he explained the way
the company was to function. He gave in
detail the qualifications of all directors, and
the bill was eventually passed by the Senate
on June 25, 1959.
Bill S-20, now before us has, as I have
said, become necessary because of delay on
the part of the company in opening its doors
for business. In the case of Bill S-28 the
company had the saine incorporators, with
the exception of Mr. Harry Willis, now Senator Harry Willis, and Murray Axmith. Senator Willis is interested in this company, but
as a senator he does not think he should be
one of the petitioners and introduce the bill.
Mr. Axmith bas no further interest in the
company.
In other respects the petition is exactly the
sarne as the former one, with the exception
that the capital stock of the company in the
first petition was $3 million, which could be
increased to $5 million, and in this petition
the company asks for the whole $5 million.
The former bill was passed by both houses
of Parliament and became an act of Parliament on July 18, 1959.
As I have already explained, under the
law the company was required to open for
business within two years of the date of
incorporation, unless it received an extension. Last year an extension was applied for
and granted, but it then had to open its
doors prior to July 18, 1962. This was not
done. Although all the capital was available,
the company was unable to commence business principally because they simply could
not obtain the right people for management.
Over the three-year period the company
attempted to find the best management they
could; they had one or two individuals ready
to assume office, but for some reason or other
their present employers increased their
salaries or gave them a bonus or interest,
and so the prospective appointments fell
through.
The company now makes this re-application because they have in mind suitable management personnel; they are ready to do
business, and if the bill is passed they will
be in operation within one year.

DECEMBER 19, 1962
The relevant information concerning this
incorporation can be found in the Debates of
the Senate for the 1959 session, pages 862 to
863. I do not think it necessary for me to repeat what was said at that time; reference
can always be made to the presentation made
by the late Senator Brunt, which sets out the
petitioners and their qualifications. They are
all able and important businessmen, capable
of running this type of trust company, and
on the earlier occasion they received the approval of the federal Department of Insurance.
Should this bill receive second reading
today, I intend to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. If there are any questions they can
be asked at that time and there will be someone present to answer them.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Might I ask the honourable senator a question? If this bill is
passed and the company then waits for
another three years, is it likely that more of
the incorporators will be appointed to the
Senate?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am sorry, but I cannot answer that.
Hon. Mr. Willis: Honourable senators, although I am not one of the petitioners, as the
honourable Senator Choquette has mentioned,
because I may have a slight interest in the
company I beg leave of the Senate to refrain
from voting.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Choquette, bill referred to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
INTERPARLIAMENTARY UNION
FIFTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONFERENCE AT
BRASILIA-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, December 12, the adjourned debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Thorvaldson
calling the attention of the Senate to the
Fifty-first Annual Conference of the Interparliamentary Union held at Brasilia, Brazil,
24th October to lst November, 1962, and in
particular to the discussions and proceedings
of the Conference and the participation
therein of the delegation from Canada.
(Translation):
Hon. Léon Méthot: Honourable senators, as
I had also the honour of representing the
Canadian Senate at the Fifty-first Conference
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in

Brasilia on October 24, 1962, I would like,
without overtaxing your patience, to add my
own thoughts to those that have already been
expressed by the three colleagues who went
with me to this important meeting.
First, as my friends, the honourable Senators Thorvaldson, Beaubien and Dessureault
indicated, the hospitality and kindness of our
ambassador, His Excellency Jean Chapdelaine,
and of his charming wife, gave us the opportunity as soon as we arrived in Brazil to
visit Rio de Janeiro, that city which is known
throughout the world for its beaches, and
everybody has heard of or seen Copacabana,
its flora, picturesque sites and architecture.
Not only did he show us around the main
sections of the city, but in many places he
gave us the opportunity of coming in contact with its inhabitants and of finding out
that this country is now occupied, if you will
pardon the expression, by people of every
race from all parts of the world and who seem
to be living there in perfect harmony.
It must be realized that Brazil is the colossus of Latin America, its area being almost
equal to that of the United States. Its population, which is now of more than 60 million,
includes Indians who were there first, Portuguese who settled the land, and negroes imported from Africa. To these I would add the
Germans who are now quite numerous. And,
today, even some Japanese are to be found.
All those races, white, black and red, in many
cases seem to have amalgamated and apparently there is no racial prejudice whatever.
French, English, Portuguese and German
are spoken by important segments of the
population and everybody seems happy to live
in that country where the climate seemed
ideal to me.
Not only did the ambassador take us on a
tour of the interesting sectors of the city, but
when he took us to his offices he gave us information about the people, the system of
government which is in fact an imitation of
the United States system, and the problems
facing the country. Finally, he gave us valuable advice which allowed us to seek information before meeting with the delegations of
countries represented at the meeting.
The ambassador and his wife even gave us
the opportunity to visit the Canadian embassy
which is indeed a splendid place of residence
with an extraordinary landscaping arrangement. They were kind enough to invite us to
a wonderful dinner which gave me another
opportunity to realize that the Canadian
cuisine is still the best.
The very next day we had to be in Brasilia,
the present capital of Brazil. After flying

SENATE
over 600 miles of mountains and jungle, we
landed in that very special and unique city in
the world.
Although the capital of the country was officially transferred to Brasilia only on April 21,
1960, as was explained by the Honourable Senator Dessureault, and the construction of the
city and the installation of services are not yet
completed, it is quite extraordinary to think
that the idea of its foundation originated
nearly 200 years ago.
Indeed, the project of moving the capital of
Brazil inland took shape at the same time
as did the nation's aspirations for political
emancipation.
As early as 1800 a Brazilian by the name
of José da Costa criticized in a London magazine the fact that the capital was in Rio
de Janeiro and suggested that it should be
relocated inland.
At about the same time William Pitt was
advocating before the Portuguese court the
establishment of a new Lisbon in the Brazilian
inland.
It will be recalled that Spain and Portugal
were in conflict at that time and that, for a
while, the Portuguese king moved to Brazil.
That was the reason why a site was being
sought to build a capital which would be protected against assaults and outbursts from the
people who were living by the seashore.
They wanted the capital to free from the turmoil of a seaport and the transients who were
working in the country's gold mines. Recent
newspaper reports gave us evidence that Rio
de Janeiro has among its citizens some rather
unsavoury characters and that two eminent
Canadians have fallen victims to them.
According to history, it was during one of
his expeditions inland, in 1833, that St. John
Bosco suggested that the capital be built on a
site he thought would be favourable to such
a project. When, in 1953, that is, 120 years
later, the commission appointed to find a
new location for the capital completed its
studies, it chose the precise location which
had been suggested by St. John Bosco.
Today, any tourist who visits the new capital
can see a statue of the saint at the top of a
hill which overlooks the city. From the terrace
which was built at that place you can see the
whole city of Brasilia. That terrace is obviously not the one we were told about in
Rio. I, for my part, did visit it without a
mishap. The man who was really responsible
for building Brasilia, if I may express myself this way, was President Juscelino Kubitshek.
The town planner Lucio Costa was entrusted with the preparation of the plan.

Costa's initial idea was to give to the city the
shape of a cross, but he changed his mind and
designed it like a huge aircraft. I have here
two or three photographs, and if any honourable senators want to look at them they
would have an idea of this aircraft shape
which is Brasilia's pattern today.
At its highest extremity, which is the intended site of a radio and television tower,
the city of Brasilia is bordered by a huge
artificial lake fed by two streams the outflow
of which operates a hydro-electric plant serving a third of the city. I should explain that
this plant too does not belong to Brazilian
Traction. It is a government project. When I
asked why only a third of the city was supplied from this source, I was told that its capacity was inadequate for a city of half a
million people. That artificial lake provides
a third of the population with electric power.
It was admitted that the power supply is
not perfect as, once or twice a week, there is
a power failure. Moreover, when we stayed
at the hotel, which I think has eight to
ten floors, it happened at least once or
twice that we had to use the stairs, because
the elevators were not operating at the
moment. Those who had taken the elevators before the power failed sometimes were
stuck between floors. And that was a real
hazard because sometimes the power failure
lasted from one hour, to one hour and a half.
At the highest end of the town, which could
be likened to the front of the aircraft, buildings have been erected that are currently
called the "three powers".
First of all, there is a palace for the president, then a building for his staff. Parliament,
which consists of the Senate and the House
of Commons, comes next. To the right
there are what are called the Supreme Court
and the Lower Court. Near those three
emblems of authority we find-a rather
curious fact or coincidence-the cathedral
which is built underground with only the
steeple jutting out. Could it be that only the
steeple appears above ground, because the
cathedral is not endowed with the authority
of the three powers?
To get to work in the morning, it is rather
curious, but pedestrians may walk on a street
other than the one reserved for motorcars,
and the street reserved for pedestrians is
separated from that which is reserved for
motorcars by a strip of land. Furthermore,
it is a one way street, so I imagine that
accidents are less numerous.
In addition to that, in the body of the aircraft there are huge buildings housing the
various departments, that is, those of Agriculture, Finance and other government
departments.

DECEMBER 19, 1962
Finally, in the wings of the aircraft there
is a cross-street which presents something
which is rather special since, at the crossing
of that street there is another street leading
to government buildings. There we see three
floors, and the streets are set up so that there
are no crossings. Everything seems perfect,
both from the standpoint of architecture and
from the standpoint of engineering.
In the wings of the aircraft we find the
residential section on one side and the business section on the other. It is in the residential section that we find huge apartment
buildings which may house about 1,000 persons. Those persons live in groups of 10. In
one of those buildings is located provisionally
our Canadian embassy, a part of which is
still at Rio de Janeiro. However, it is the
intention to build the Canadian embassy in
Brasilia, which will take charge of both
places now being occupied.
Those apartment buildings have a particular feature that they have been built to
accommodate groups of 10 people in order to
house 10,000 persons, and are provided with
a theatre, a supermarket and, in certain
places, a swimming pool and even a park for
the convenience of people who live there. Of
course husbands go to work but persons who
stay there do not have to get away from the
centre of their building, where they have
all the facilities in the matter of stores or
supermarkets. It is an extremely modern
organization, but, in my opinion, it must be
a very boring place, because wives and children never get away from the place where
they habitually live.
Our conference was held in the Parliament
building, mainly in the Chamber of deputies.
Forty-three of the 64 countries which are,
from now on, linked to the interparliamentary
undertaking were represented at the meeting.
We had delegations from the whole of
Latin America, from Europe, Asia, from the
Russian-dominated group and from independent countries.
According to the program prepared for our
meeting, the subjects which were scheduled
to be discussed were divided into four main
groups: International trade as a factor of a
balance of economic and social progress for
countries now under development; a draft
convention concerning certain measures to be
taken against persons guilty of accumulating
fraudulous fortunes in the exercise of public
functions; terms and conditions of a general
disarmament; methods to be followed in
order to expedite the granting of independence to colonial countries.
One or two of us attended the meetings of
each of those committees. When those decisions were referred to the general committee

487

for consideration by the whole group, each one
of us was called upon or invited to express
his own views or those of the group in regard
to each of those questions. For my part, I
was interested in the independence of colonial
countries, but I noted something rather
special. For instance, when discussions dealt
with a draft convention concerning certain
measures to be taken against persons guilty
of accumulating fraudulous fortunes in the
exercise of public functions-that is, those
persons who have managed to invest their
money and put it safely away-I noted that
the mover was a gentleman from Switzerland,
and that the one who supported him was a
gentleman from Panama. I conversed with
these two gentlemen and I asked them
whether they were not climbing in the
driver's seat in order to get control of the
matter.
Of course, I do not intend to report here
the debates which resulted from the consideration of those four main articles of our
program; those who spoke before me, Honourable Senator Thorvaldson among others,
have already explained to you the resolutions
which have been passed. However, a serious
incident occurred, because you will recall
that it was during a period of serious tension
that the interparliamentary conference was
held in Brasilla.
When, in December 1961, Fidel Castro
made a profession of Marxist faith and made
of Cuba a socialist republic, he certainly impressed al countries of Latin America, not
to say more.
On the other hand, the United States had
to propose to their South American partners
a generous financial support in order to
achieve certain long overdue reforms.
However, things did not improve very
much, especially if we recall the reception
given President Eisenhower and Vice-President Nixon. Finally, at the very moment
when our conference was being held the
situation deteriorated, and it is then that
President Kennedy issued his ultimatum and
ordered the inspection of al Cuba-bound
ships coming from Russia in order to check
whether they were carrying armaments.
The news came when we were sitting, and
as a result the business of the conference was
suspended.
There were at the conference delegates from
Russia, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Mongolia and they unanimously stated their deep
concern in front of this sudden worsening of
international tension. Al the delegates agreed
that international disputes should be settled
without recourse to force.

further developed. There is another harbour
not far away at Dalhousie, New Brunswick.
As far as operating a mine of this kind is
concerned, we have an abundance of labour,
as anyone would understand from the speeches
that we have heard in this chamber, and in
another place. I think I can say without boasting, that we have some of the best labour to
be found anywhere in the whole dominion.
Besides that, we have this rich ore, which we
consider a very valuable asset as far as our
province is concerned.
Bill C-93 would authorize the Canadian
National Railway Company to construct a
branch line of railway in the province of New
Brunswick, from Nepisiguit Junction, which
is on the main line of the Canadian National
Railways, about 3.7 miles south of Bathurst, in
a westerly direction to the mining property of
Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation,
which lies approximately in the middle of the
westerly half of the parish of Bathurst, in
Gloucester County. The railway line would be
approximately 15 miles in length, located near
the town of Bathurst and the Brunswick
Mining and Smelting Corporation Limited,
which is one of the largest companies operating in that area. That company is building
a concentrator near the town of Bathurst.
The estimated cost of construction of the line
is $1,450,000, being $96,667 per mile, which I
understand is somewhat below the average
cost of railway construction.
Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation Limited has expended a substantial sum
in developing large deposits of zinc and lead
ore, containing some copper and silver, in
the area concerned and is currently preparing
one of its properties, known as project No. 12,
for production. The company has requested
rail service to serve its mine and mill at this
point of development by January 1964. It is
expected that it will take approximately a
year to construct the line. The plan is to start
clearing and preparing the right of way this
winter, as soon as parliamentary authority
for the construction has been obtained. In that
connection, I might point out that this line will
be of great benefit, temporarily as well as
permanently, to the people of that area.
As in the case of construction of similar
branch lines in the past to serve industry,
I may say that Canadian National has entered
into an agreement with the mining company,
wherein a guarantee is given that the industry
will ship a minimum volume of traffic over
the line for at least 10 years, and that appropriate penalties will be paid if during any
year of the term the shipments fall below the
minimum volume agreed to. The present project is recognized as being in the category of
self-liquidating, and being in that category

the Government has commended it to the
consideration of Parliament.
Railway revenues which will be received
from the traffic generated by the operations
of the mining company will yield a reasonable
surplus, after meeting all expenses of operation and maintenance of the branch line, cost
of handling this traffic on the remainder of
the system, interest on the cost of building the
new line, and interest and depreciation of
necessary equipment.
This project will assist in the further development of this part of the country, it is
sound from an economic standpoint, and I
am sure it will be favourably regarded by
honourable senators. May I also say that I
believe the full development of the mineral
resources of this area will be one of the
major considerations of the Atlantic Development Board when it is set up.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: We hope smelters and refineries will be established in this area. At the
present time we are shipping much of the
raw ore out of the country, and we have hopes
that we shall in the future be able to smelt
and refine it in our own province of New
Brunswick.
I recommend this bill very highly to honourable senators. Frankly, I think it commends itself to favourable consideration.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I believe we have every right to welcome
this bill. Personally I do so because it relates
to an area of the country which I know
fairly well, that part of northern New Brunswick which in past years has rather lagged
behind the rest of the country in industrial
development.
As the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Brooks) pointed out, this bill is one of
the first results of the remarkable and encouraging discovery, made some few years
ago in the country behind Bathurst, of very
large deposits of zinc and lead ores. This
bill, as he has explained, is designed to
provide a branch line of railway from the
main line of the Canadian National, a few
miles south of Bathurst, to the first development to be actually under way there belonging to the Brunswick Mining and Smelting
Corporation.
I read rather carefully the evidence given
on this bill before the Standing Committee
on Railways, Canals and Telegraph Lines
of the other place, and I am convinced that
neither the country nor the Canadian National Railways will lose anything whatever
as a result of the adoption of this bill and
the construction of the line; but rather that
much will be gained in the way of traffic.

DECEMBER 19, 1962
So I think we can satisfy ourselves that this
bill will in no way constitute any charge
upon the revenues of the country.
My honourable friend referred to the
Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation,
which I understand is at least partly owned
by European interests; and I gather that in
the flrst instance the ores to be produced
from the mine are to be shipped to Europe.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: To Belgium, I think.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend is right, they will be shipped to
Belgium. The ores will move over the proposed Une, a distance of 15 miles to the
present main line, and then they will be
transported over the main line to the port
of Dalhousie from where it is expected
they will be shipped to Europe. Dalhousie
is about 50 miles north of Bathurst on another branch of the main line of the Canadian National Railways. The result will be
that that railway will benefit quite considerably from the freight traffic which will
be originated in that respect.
I happen to know the town of Dalhousie
very well because for over 30 years my
family has had a country cottage close by,
and I think this construction will be of advantage to Dalhousie. The town, as honourable senators know, is situated on the Baie
de Chaleur. One of the interesting things
about Dalhousie is that some years ago the
International Paper Company built a large
paper plant there, for which the principal
market is New York, and they have discovered that for all practical purposes the
port of Dalhousie can be treated as a yearround port. That, of course, is of interest
in connection with this particular bill because
the ores produced at the mine may be shipped
to their ultimate destination in Europe at any
time of the year regardless of the weather.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: That is the only kind
of port we have in the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I fully agree with that,
as a part-time Maritimer myself.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon:
in the Atlantic provinces.

You should say

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In the Atlantic provinces.
I was interested in what my friend said
about the future activities of the Atlantic
Development Board, which has been under
discussion in this house for the last three
or four days. I fully share his hope that
some day we shall be able to smelt and
process these ores in our own country instead of shipping them to Belgium for that
purpose.
27511-5-32J

In every respect I fully support the Leader,
and I hope that the Senate will pass this
bill.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I do not propose to delay the bouse for
more than a few minutes about this matter
because what the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) and the honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
have said convinces me, and I am sure all
of us, that this is a very worthy project.
I think we should remind ourselves, however, that in the earlier days of the development of the mine to which this line of railway will run there was serious concern about
how the ore could be treated economically.
It was as a result of the perseverance of
some experts, mainly from the St. Joseph
Lead Company-an American company-and
the expenditure of a great deal of money,
that there was developed a form of treatment which made these ores economically
marketable.
The fact that the Canadian National now
sees an opportunity to establish a self-liquidating project like this would appear to me
to indicate that those experiments were,
first of all, successful and, secondly-and this
is more important-there is probably a market
for these four metals to which the honourable Leader of the Government bas referred.
I remember a few years ago in one of our
committees there was a discussion touching
upon the development of mining properties
which were producing base metals, and a
serious question was raised as to whether
or not a market could be found for these
metals.
Honourable senators will note that this
is a line of railway 15 miles long. It is a
project that has commended itself to the authorities of the Canadian National Railways,
and I think they have abundantly established
their position through the evidence they gave
in the other place as to the feasibility of the
project, and the fact that it will be self liquidating. But I wonder whether that provision
in the Railway Act which requires the Canadian National, and any other railway, to corne
to Parliament every time it wishes to build
a line over six miles in length is still a valid
provision. This does not arise in connection
with this bill alone. It arises in connection
with all bills similar to this one.
The Canadian National and the Canadian
Pacific are, after all, responsible companies.
They are not going to embark upon hairbrained projects. As a rule, and as is the
case with respect to this projected line of
railway, they know exactly where the revenues are coming from; they know exactly

SENATE
when their investment is going to be repaid; they know, too, that they are going
to make a profit out of it, and that it
is all wrapped up by contract. I wonder
whether, each time they propose to build
a railway more than six miles in length, they
should be forced to come to Parliament to
obtain authority to do so. I am sure there
are projects which are deferred or postponed
longer than they should be because of this
requirement.
Honourable senators, I think on an occasion
like this it is appropriate to mention this
provision of the Railway Act, and to draw
to the attention of the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) the need
for Parliament at some time to look at this
particular section and decide whether or not
it is antiquated. I do not suggest that it be
repealed, but perhaps the requirements should
be relaxed a little.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, I should like to take a moment or two
to speak in support of this bill, particularly
because I am a New Brunswicker and am
interested in this particular development.
My interest goes back quite a number of
years before the actual development took
place in the area. I share with the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) and others the pleasure of supporting this bill, and I express the hope that this
development may continue and become one
of the major industrial enterprises in our
province.
The honourable Leader of the Governinent
referred to the fact that many years ago no
one thought there were any minerals in our
province-and it is not too many years ago.
I recall about 20 years ago while fishing in
that area being told of and shown where
certain iron ore had been taken out in near
proximity to the town of Bathurst. That, I
think, gave some impetus to the people who
were interested in the development of that
area during the late thirties and early forties.
I should like to give some credit, not only
to the engineers from the University of New
Brunswick, but to the Honourable C. T.
Richard, a former Chief Justice, who was
at one time a member of the other house, a
member of the Legislature of New Brunswick
for a number of years, and also a member
of the New Brunswick Government. I recall
his enthusiasm in the late 1930's regarding
the possibility of mineral development in
that area. As a result of his interest and that
of others a good deal of investigation took
place there.
My colleague from New Brunswick, honourable Senator McGrand, may remember
that in 1949 or 1950, on the debate on the

address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the then Minister of Industry, the
Honourable Mr. Doucet, said that the investigations had reached the position where
the possibilities were now beyond the experimental stage.
Immediately following that the Deputy
Minister of the department Mr. William
Moore, and all the members from the
northern part of the province, became keenly
interested in this project. They were able to
interest large corporations to come in there
to make further investigations, and as a
result large scale developments took place.
The extension referred to in this bill is
similar to one contained in a bill which was
passed two or three years ago, extending
the line from south of Newcastle into what is
known as the Heath Mines. I have forgotten
what is the distance there.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It is 23 miles. That was
in 1956-57.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): This is a
similar development, and I have much pleasure in supporting it. Together with the
Leader of the Government I express the hope
that before many years pass a smelter will
be built in that area. We have every reason
to be optimistic about this and I strongly
commend this bill to the favourable consideration of the house.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

Hon. A. J. Brooks moved that the bill be

SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Lionel Choquette, with leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
not complicated. Section 36G is replaced by
a new section 36G which is, as in the former
section, in two parts. The words "31st day
of March, 1963" appear in four places in the
former section. In each instance in the

DECEMBER 19, 1962
amending section 1965 is substituted for 1963.
The explanatory note to the bill says:
The purpose of this bill is to extend
for an additional two years the period
within which the construction of a sewage treatment project in respect of which
a loan has been or is to be made under
Part VIB of the act must be completed
if the municipality or municipal sewerage corporation is to be forgiven payment of a part of the principal amount of
the loan and of the accrued interest
thereon.
I would like to go into further details about
the rate of interest that has to be paid and
the advantages to be derived by municipalities or the municipal sewerage corporation.
The provisions of this bill are quite straightforward. The Government is asking Parliament to extend for another two years the
period during which municipalities may
qualify for a partial rebate of principal and
interest on federal loans for the construction
of municipal sewage treatment projects. The
proposed extension would enable the important work that is being carried out in this
field to proceed without interruption, and to
encourage those municipalities which, for
one reason or another, have not been able
to take advantage of federal assistance so far
to obtain the full benefit of the legislation.
The bill seeks an amendment to Part VIn
of the National Housing Act, under which
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation,
the federal housing agency, is authorized to
make direct loans to municipalities for the
construction or expansion of central sewage
treatment or disposal plants and the construction of trunk collector sewers. The loans are
for periods of up to 50 years, and a municipality may borrow up to two-thirds of the
agreed cost of a project. The current rate of
interest is 5j per cent. Loans are secured by
debentures, or some other agreed form of
security, issued by the municipality or the
municipal sewerage corporation obtaining the
loan.
Honourable senators will recall that this
lending program was originally approved by
Parliament in December 1960. It was apparent to the Government at the time that municipalities faced serious problems arising out of
pollution of soil and water resources. The
practice of disposing of raw sewage in lakes
and rivers and of dumping industrial waste
in our waterways had created a serious health
hazard in many parts of the country. Fish and
game were being destroyed, beaches were
becoming polluted, even drinking water supplies were in danger of contamination in some
districts. Moreover, in many areas new housing had outrun the ability of municipalities

to provide water and sewer services, and in
these instances families were forced to depend
on wells and septic tanks. Although this may
be a satisfactory solution in rural areas, it
poses a serious problem in urban or built-up
areas.
A high concentration of wells and septic
tanks could result in pollution of the soil
and contamination of wells from which individual families draw their drinking water.
In the fringe areas of some municipalities
health authorities had become alarmed at the
prospect. They feared that diseases reaching
epidenic proportions might occur if the practice became more prevalent. Municipal officials and town planners in particular were
also concerned about the wasteful use of land
these arrangements demanded. To achieve at
least a measure of safety, building lots in
areas using wells and septic tanks have to
be larger than normal and, in consequence,
housing in these areas tends to sprawl. This
not only increases road and transport costs,
but results in the subversion of a more extensive area of productive agricultural land
to urban use than would otherwise be required. At the same time the Government
recognized that many municipalities faced
serious financial difficulties in dealing with
these problems.
Smaller municipalities often had trouble
obtaining long-term financing for major
capital works of this sort, and costs of obtaining long-term funds were exceptionally high.
Even the larger towns and cities which had
easier access to the capital market found it
difficult to finance large-scale sewage treatment undertakings.
The 1960 legislation, by providing an additional source of funds for this type of endeavour, removed some of the financial
restrictions which hindered proper development of treatment facilities. To encourage
municipalities to proceed with the work as
rapidly as possible, the Governinent also
offered to forgive payment of 25 per cent of
the amount of loan advanced and 25 per cent
of interest paid on these loans for work completed by March 31, 1963. I am happy to be
able to tell you this lending program has
been extremely successful.
Honourable senators will remember that in
November 1961 Parliament was asked to increase to $200 million the total amount that
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
could lend for these purposes. The total
originally authorized was $100 million.
The volume of lending has continued to
increase. Since December 1960 the Corporation has made 360 loans, for a total of more
than $85 million. In addition, at the end of

SENATE
November there were applications or inquiries in hand for a further 146 loans with
a loan potential of $52.5 millions.
Loans have been made in every province
in Canada and to municipalities of every size.
So far nearly 200 communities of less than
5,000 population have benefited from the
provisions of the act, and 62 municipalities
in the 5,000 to 25,000 population range have
obtained loans under the program. Loans
also have been made to 36 cities of over
25,000 population.
Good progress is being made, and it is
precisely for this reason that Parliament is
now being asked to extend the arrangements
for partial remission of principal and interest
by two years, that is, until March 31, 1965.
The forgiveness provision is one of the most
attractive features of these loans and it has
undoubtedly helped induce many municipalities to undertake these works. However, much
remains to be done. For a variety of reasons,
some municipal governments have not been
able to draft their plans and make their
arrangements as quickly as others. At the
moment there are several communities, particularly in the province of Quebec and in
some western provinces, which are on the
verge of commencing work. Most of these
will find it difficult, if not impossible, to proceed if they are unable to take full advantage
of the forgiveness feature.
I need hardly point out that the only way
to ensure the cleanliness of our waterways is
to stop all potential sources of pollution. Even
a community that has made adequate provision for disposal of its own sewage will not
derive full benefits so long as other municipalities upstream fail to take corrective
action. We hope that by extending these incentives for two years, many more communities will take advantage of the opportunity to finance the installation of proper
treatment facilities and that this, combined
with steps taken by industry to reduce or
eliminate the disposal of its waste, will once
again restore our rivers and other waters to
their original purity so that they can render
greater service to man and beast.
I urge honourable senators to support the
measure so that this vital work can continue.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I regret that we do not have more
time to inquire into the background of this
legislation. I may say at once that I am quite
favourably disposed towards it in every way.
I have been in touch for many years now
with the problem referred to by my honourable friend, and particularly as it has related
to our own Ottawa River which, skirting the
capital centre of Canada and from its headwaters through to Montreal, is about as fetid

an example of pollution as it would be possible to find anywhere on the North American
continent.
As early as 1944 we had a joint committee
of both Houses of Parliament to deal with
this question to a certain extent, in relation
to the negotiations between the municipality
of the City of Ottawa and the federal Government, through the Federal Dstrict Commission, upon the grants that had been adopted
for some years in relation to property matters
and involving the whole question of pollution. At that time it was revealed in committee in the evidence given to us by the
officials of the municipality of the City of
Ottawa, as well as those of the Federal District Commission, that between the Chaudiere
Falls and the easterly limits of this city, which
now extends as far east as the research
laboratory on the Montreal Road, there were
20 outlets of raw sewage into this river. From
the Hull side, as well as that of the City of
Ottawa, through those outlets pollution bas
been increasing for the past 20 years. Threatening prospects to the community were so
serious that some effort was then made to get
joint action that would meet the situation.
Since that time there have been two other
joint efforts made by committees composed
of members of both houses to meet this
problem.
I believe that progress in this matter has
been delayed as a result of jurisdictional difficulties that are naturally incidental to any
dealings between municipalities, the provinces
and the federal authority. Where boundary
rivers such as the Ottawa are concerned
progress has been slow. The Ottawa river is
an outstanding example of an inter-provincial
problem, and is in need of remedial measures
to an outstanding degree.
I believe it is only fair to say that the
province of Ontario, through the efforts of
Dr. Berry, who was chairman of the Water
Resources Commission of Ontario which was
established about five years ago, and those
associated with him, bas established an effective scheme of financing, by means of 30-year
amortization payments, projects for municipalities which require anti-pollution plants in
their vicinity. And that work has gone ahead,
as my friend bas pointed out, in relation to
many small communities, and also cities of
25,000 people and more. It has made fairly
satisfactory headway, but there is still much
to do. And the problem of taxation in relation to this work, especially as it bears on
municipalities, has been a deterrent in combating this evil.
I am not going to attempt to review the
problem from the point of view of need. We
have had some eloquent and, indeed, very
disgusting evidence placed before us in various

DECEMBER 19, 1962
ways in these committees. Dr. Berry, who was
one of the chief witnesses at the last joint
meeting of both houses on this subject, gave,
I think, a comprehensive picture of the conditions that obtained all along the Ottawa river
and along many of its tributaries from west
of this city all the way to Montreal.
I mention this in emphasizing the kind
of problem that society is going to have to
face, regardless of cost, sooner or later, and
I think that the main object of this bill
should be to indicate future obligations. While
the capital has been increased to $200 million,
as my friend pointed out, there is need for
a great deal more money to be spent in
remedying the condition if this country is to
measure up to the wonderful conception we
have of its being a healthy and scenic country
where tourists may be induced to come and
enjoy the fresh-water lakes, the hunting and
fishing, and so on.
From the point of view of an investment
for the future there is no aspect of public
requirement in our country today that is more
demanding than this whole question of water
pollution. I must say that I regret that we
do not have time to consider this bill in committee, where Dr. Bates could give us the full
information which my friend summarized in
relation to the progress that has been made
under this legislation in the last two years.
There is no doubt about the increasing
awareness of public opinion in connection with
this matter, and I think we are probably approaching the point where we can compare
the degree of conscious feeling about this
evil with what has been accomplished in the
matter of forest conservation through the
schools and amongst the younger generation
of Canadians. It has become a second thought
with most people who go into the bushland
in the summer to see to it that our forests are
protected from careless use of fire. If a similar
degree of consciousness can be cultivated, as
I believe it will be, through publicity and the
focussing of public attention on this evil of
water pollution, and air pollution also, the
Government will be supported in providing
financial assistance for this worthy cause.
I think it would be worthy of the concentrated attention of a committee of this house,
or a joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons, to bring ourselves up to
date with all information available from
people like Dr. Berry of Ontario in his work
of administration in that province. The province of Quebec bas undertaken to set up
a commission similar to that of Ontario.
An act has been passed in that province similar to the Water Resources Act of Ontario,
and I think a commission was appointed to
administer it. One hopes that it will make

the same headway that is being made elsewhere. The Ottawa River between here and
Montreal needs immediate attention.
Honourable senators, in a very sporadic
way I have tried to express my approval of
this bill by emphasizing the urgent need for
measures to further this work. These steps
must be undertaken even though they involve
difficulty in the way of financial accommodation for the municipalities and provinces
concerned.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Choquetie moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
COAL

PRODUCTION

ASSISTANCE

BILL TO AMEND-FIRST

ACT

READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-64, to amend
the Coal Production Assistance Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. John M. Macdonald, with leave of
the Senate, moved the second reading of
the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to make certain amendments
to the Coal Production Assistance Act, which
act was passed in 1949 under the title of the
Maritime Coal Production Assistance Act. The
original act was passed following the report
of the Carroll Commission which had made
a searching investigation into the coal industry.
One of the main recomendations of that
commission was that coal mines should be
mechanized in order to increase production
and reduce costs. This would have required
the coal operators to spend substantial sums
of money, and the original act provided that
coal operators in the maritime provinces
could obtain loans under certain conditions
from the Government of Canada for undertakings designed to increase the efficiency
of their operations by means of mechanization.
The act also provided that the total of all
loans made would not exceed $10 million, nor
would any one producer be loaned more than
$71 million and the loan would not exceed
two-thirds of the cost of the project. The act

SENATE
further provided that loans would be repaid
in semi-annual payments of not less than
30 cents per ton of coal produced by the
mines in respect of which the loan was made.
Various amendments have been made to
the act. In 1959 the name was changed to the
Coal Producers Assistance Act and the provisions extended to all of Canada. It would
also provide that the total amount available
for loans would be raised to $20 million.
The amending act does four things. First,
it makes a change in the terms of repayment.
Under the terms of the present act, repayment
could not be less than 30 cents a ton. I understand that this was considered as a reasonable part of the saving which mechanization would produce; but when the act was
extended to include all of Canada the savings were not as great on coals of a low
market value, such as sub-bituminous and
lignite, which are found in western provinces. An amendment provided for a lower
payment per ton on this type of coal of
lower market value.
Secondly, the amendment provides for the
taking into consideration of cases where two
or more loans had been made to the same
producer. At present, if a second loan is
made before the first is fully repaid, then the
producer has to repay 30 cents a ton on
each loan. It has been found that the borrower may have to obtain the second loan
to complete the project for which he received
the first loan, and consequently no further
saving has been accomplished by the second
loan.
Therefore, the second purpose of the
amendment is to provide that where a loan
is outstanding in connection with a coal
mine and another loan is made in connection
with the same mine, the coal produced by
that mine need not be included in calculating
the payments on the second loan until the
first loan has been fully repaid, or until two
and a half years have elapsed since the last
instalment of the second loan has been paid
to the producer, whichever occurs first.
It is provided also that the coal producers
who had previously received loans may have
the benefit of the proposed amendments, as
well as future borrowers.
Thirdly, the amendment provides that it
shall be an offence to make a false statement
to obtain a loan or to use the proceeds of a
loan for a purpose other than that set out in
the agreement respecting the loan.
Finally, the amendment would allow the
minister to amend the agreements made with
the Avon Coal Company Limited of Minto,
New Brunswick.
I might add that up to March 31 last, 20
loans, with a total sum of $11,737,780, have
been made. Ten of these, for a total sum of

$1,654,025, have been fully repaid. As of
March 31, three loans were current in Nova
Scotia, five in New Brunswick, one in Saskatchewan and one in British Columbia.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, we are all indebted to the honourable
senator from Cape Breton (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the explanation he has given of
this bill. 'It seems to be a rather consequential
kind of bill for the coal industry. I gather
that the benefit of the act is to be applied
largely to loans made to coal producers in
western Canada rather than to those in
eastern Canada.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): That
is correct.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): Therefore, the benefit will largely accrue there,
because of the soft character of the coal and
perhaps because the price is lower for that
type of coal.
While this is the kind of measure whicb
normally we would like to discuss in committee, I should not want to insist that a
committee deal with it, because the amendments seern to be reasonable in the circumstances which have been described. However,
I am wondering about section 3 of the bill
which deals with special contracts entered
into with the Avon Coal Company Limited,
and whether the effect of this is to give
the benefits that might flow from this bill
to the Avon Coal Company Limited under
those contracts.
I should also like to ask the sponsor of the
bill (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Cape Breton)
whether any of the loans now outstanding
are in default or whether they are all in
good standing. If he does not now have
the information I am requesting, I would
be quite content, as I am sure the house
would be, to receive it when the bill is
called for third reading, perhaps at the next
sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I think
I can give the information now.
One of the purposes of the bill is to apply
the benefits of this legislation to the Avon
Coal Company Limited, of Minto, New Brunswick. At the present time that company has
two loans to complete its mechanization program. There is one loan in Nova Scotia which,
I am sorry to say, is in default. It is not very
substantial, but I doubt if there will be much
recovery on it. The original loan was $47,738,
of which only $6,853 has been paid, which
means that of the principal loan $40,884
remains unpaid, and I think it very doubtful
that the loan can be recovered.
It so happened that this small company got
into debt with the Workmen's Compensation

seized some of its assets, and negotiations are

the principal was in default for a short time,

SENATE

I would like to correct the impression that
was left this afternoon when a statement was
made to the effect that coal mines have been
closed in New Brunswick. That is not true.
As a matter of fact our coal mines were
never as busy as they are now, and a great
deal of the coal mined in that area is being
purchased by the New Brunswick Electric
Power Commission. There are two thermal
power plants in operation there now, and
I believe there is some talk of a third one
being built. There is no question of the repayment of loans made by this company under
the terms of the act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): There

was never any doubt that the loans made to
the Avon Company would be repaid; there
was never any question whatsoever as to
their reliability.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton) moved

ATLANTIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Frank Welch moved the third reading
of Bill C-94, to provide for the establishment
of an Atlantic Development Board.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I wonder if the Government has
made any decision concerning the appointment of the personnel of this new board?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: The bill has not yet been
passed, honourable senators. I am sure the
Government has some persons in mind but
it cannot very well appoint anyone yet.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank the honourable
gentleman for his reply. If we look at this
bill we find that to a great extent its provisions relate to the future; and in addition
to having the co-operation of all the departments of Government, this board will be supported by two crutches, one, the National
Economic Development Board and the other
the National Productivity Council. The National Productivity Council exists already,
and I find some data about it in a most useful book, the Government telephone directory.
it is of great assistance to me in my research.
I see that the National Productivity Council
is located in the Trade and Commerce buildJng on Wellington Street. The Executive

Director is Mr. Henry; the Administrative
Officer, Mr. Kavanagh; the Program Director,
Mr. Cowan; the Publicity Director, Mr. Radford; and the Work Study Director, Mr.
Lehmann. They must be very important
people because each has a personal, local
telephone number. It is not everyone who
has a local number; only the superior men
of the civil service are entitled to that
privilege. So much for the National Productivity Council.
The case of the National Economic Development Board is much more interesting
because that board does not exist, it is an
unborn child-and I wonder what help it
could be to the Atlantic Development Board.
Probably it is because one looks to the future
that one relies so much on an institution that
does not already exist. What is the purpose
of the National Economic Development
Board, its duties and powers? It is very well
arranged, with not too many officials, in
virtue of the well-known principle that too
many cooks spoil the broth.
There is a very important difference between Bill C-87, respecting the National Economic Development Board, and Bill C-94 respecting the Atlantic Development Board,
which is before this house. Bill C-94 sets out
the objects and powers of the legislation,
while Bill C-87 sets out the duties and powers.
In that respect there is a very slight difference. But I must put on record what are the
"objects and duties" of Bill C-87, which is
before the House of Commons, so that one can
compare it with what I read yesterday about
the "objects and powers" in Bill C-94. The
objects and duties are:
It shall be the duty of the Board to
furnish to the Minister all such advice
and information as will best assist the
Government of Canada in furthering a
high and sustainable rate of economic
growth in Canada, the strengthening of
Canada's international financial and trade
position and the achievement of the highest possible levels of efficient production
and employment so as to ensure rising
standards of living in all areas of Canada;
and in particular, it shall be the duty of
the Board
(a) to study and report to the Minister
upon the longer term prospects and
potentialities of growth for the national
economy and for particular industries and
areas of Canada;
(b) to study and report to the Minister
upon methods and measures for stimulating the development in Canada of such
industrial and other economic activities
and conditions as will best advance the
attainment of the objectives hereinbefore
set forth; and

SENATE
(c) to consider, evaluate and report to
the Minister upon particular projects of
longer term significance, whether or not
such projects may involve direct governmental participation by way of financial
aid or otherwise, and to make recommendations to the Minister with respect
to any such projects that in the opinion
of the Board would significantly contribute to the growth and development of
the national economy.
This bill applies to the entire country from
coast to coast, while the other bill, although
similar to this, applies only to the Atlantic
provinces. If one bill is good the other is not
worth anything. My contention is that both
are worthless and therefore I shall be very
sorry to have to oppose this bill on third
reading. I consider it is a meaningless bill.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, yesterday we gave second reading to this
bill, at which time it was pointed out that
it was necessary the bill should receive third
reading before the Christmas recess. The suggestion was made that if it did not receive
third reading before the Christmas recess,
there would be considerable delay, particularly if the bill were sent to a committee. It
was stated also that if the bill were sent to
committee it could not possibly be considered
before Christmas, and that since it would take
some time to get the committee organized it
might well be the end of February or the
beginning of March before the bill eventually
became law.
In view of the representations which were
made and the pleas of those who come from
the Maritimes that it is in the interests of
the Atlantic provinces that this bill be placed
upon the statute books immediately, the Senate
in its wisdom decided it would not insist
upon sending the bill to committee. It is for
that reason the bill comes to us for third
reading today.
I say to the Government that if the Senate,
at the request of the Government, does not
send the bill to committee and gives it third
reading today, thus enabling it to become law,
then we-and I think I speak for all honourable senators-expect the Government to implement the provisions of the statute immediately. We expect that this board will be
set up before January 28, that by that date
it will have had some meetings, and that
considerable progress will have been made.
Honourable senators, if that is not done the
Government will be breaking faith with the
Senate. We have gone as far as we can in
order to assist the Government in getting
this board established. The next step is for
the Government. They will either take it or
not take it. I am sure I speak for all

honourable senators on both sides of the
house when I say that when we come back
here at the end of January we expect to
find that this board has been set up, that it
has held meetings and has performed some
service to the Atlantic provinces.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time,
and passed.

SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Hanourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Jacques Flynn, with leave af the
Senate, moved the second reading af the bill.
(Translation):
He said: Honourable senators, since it is
the first time that 1 speak in this bouse, you
will no doubt allow me ta say how grateful
1 am for the warm and cordial welcome you
extended ta me. May I also tell you that,
although I made a brief stay in the other
place, I am considering, in the normal course
of events, a longer stay here.
Since I have had the privilege af sitting
here, I have tried to understand and ta
discover the so-called difference in climate
and perspective between the two places. I
think I am beginning ta understand them,
but I note, ini particular-at least some debates have led me ta believe it-that there
is nat sa much difference in the tane af the
discussions.
(Text):
May I s'ay, Mr. Speaker, that I share everything that has been said in camplimentîng you
on your appointment ta your bigh office and
on the manner in wbich you discharge
your duties. I also join with other honourable
senators wha paîd well-deserved compliments
ta the Honourable Leader of the Government

(Hon. Mr. Brooks), the deputy leader (Hon.
Mr. Choquette), the former leader (Han. Mr.
Aseltine), and the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford).
This afiernoon I rise ta spansor Bill C-101,
an act ta amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal
Arrangements Act and the Federal-Provincial
Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act.
The purpase of this bill is very simple,
I would say. On the one hand it pravides for
an increase from $1.50 ta $2 in the per capita
grants ta be paid ta the Canadian Universities
Foundation.
As you knaw, these payments were started
in 1952. In '1960, in order ta settle a prablem relating ta the attitude af the province
af Quebec towards federal grants ta unîversities, an arrangement was arrived at with the
gaverniment ai that province which enabled
it, thraugh an additional deduction of 1 per
cent on corporation incame tax, ta recoup the
equivalent af the subsidies paid ta the Foundatian ta be remîtted ta the universities af the
other provinces.
This act, adapted in 1960, was applicable
until April i af this year. This year a new
arrangement along the same lines was arrived
at with the government af the province af
Quebec. Sa, another purpose of this bull is
ta ratify that arrangement and ta permit the
province of Quebec ta continue collecting an
additional 1 per cent in corporation incame tax
and spend it under their present scheme af
subsidies ta universities. The bill merely takes
this agreement inta account.
As yau know, there is a pravisa in this bill
ta the eff ect that if the i per cent ai corporation tax collected by the province, or any
prescribed province-because it is available ta
any pravince and in principle does nat apply
anly ta Quebec, although in practice it doesshould be higher or lower than the amount
represented by the multiplication ai the population by $2, then there is an adjustment bath
ways by the federal Governmnent.
Hanaurable senatars, 1 do not think I
could serve any useful purpose by adding
anything, since the principle af this bill was
discussed thoraughly in 1960 in the other place
and here. The bill merely continues the
present system, one whicb, under the circumstances, I would say has been a reasanable compromise.
Hon. A. K<. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I think this is the first apportunity I
have had persanally ta express a warm welcame ta my hanourable colleague (Han. Mr.

DECEMBER 20, 1962
there were provincial and federal subsidies
to universities which had lived before on
grants made possible by the generosity of
people of means. The universities received
personal grants from people who were able
to make them and who wanted to encourage
education in this country. It was very praiseworthy of them, and nobody can do anything but admire those public benefactors
who did their best to improve the teaching
facilities.
It is my very great pleasure to congratulate
the sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Flynn). He
belongs to a distinguished family. His grandfather was my professor of Roman law. He
was the Honourable Edmund James Flynn,
who was the prime minister of the province
of Quebec for a time, and later a judge of
King's Bench in Quebec City. He was a delightful old gentleman, and his lectures were
the best I had while I was a student. He explained to us that they were like a chain,
and that one should not miss a link-one of
the lectures-for otherwise the chain would
be broken.
He told us, and I think he was right, that
Roman law was the basis of the law of all
civilized countries. That is true, and I have
come to the conclusion that with a good
foundation of knowledge of philosophy-and
when I speak of philosophy I speak of logic
and dialectics, not of metaphysics-and of
Roman law, a lawyer can find his way of
being most useful to his clients, to the Bar
and to the Bench.
In spite of all the grants, there were many
difficulties. Something happened that previously had been unheard of. There was a
strike of the civil law students at Laval
University, who complained bitterly about
the Dean of the Law Faculty, and they forced
his resignation.
Finally the day came when there was nobody to give lectures. One of the complaints
of the students was that they had had no
lectures on constitutional law for over a
whole year. The professor was away and gave
his notes to a lady whose hats were admired
by the students. She told them bluntly not to
ask her questions, that she knew nothing
about it; and she read the lecture of the
gentleman who was making heaps of money
as an advisor to the provincial government.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Was she talking through
her hat?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: All this was published in
the press. I am not speaking of anything new.
It was published in many Quebec and
Montreal daily newspapers.
Honourable senators, there are professors,
of course, who are worthy of their noble
functions to teach and to form the legal mind

of youth-and I have not to go far to see
some of them-but all professors are not
alike in that.
This payment which is to be made to the
universities, an increase from $1.50 to $2 per
capita, is a blank cheque. The universities
will come for the money, but will refuse to
give any information about how that money
is used. They come here, in spite of the Constitution which provides that education is
strictly a provincial matter.
Honourable senators, I remember also that
the only thing which was suggested to me by
the Honourable Mr. St. Laurent, when I was
in the House of Commons, was to speak
on the motion of a friend of mine who belonged to the C.C.F. party, who wanted to
have federal subsidies for high schools because he considered that education is a provincial matter.
It is strange that the university authorities
overlook the Constitution when they come
here to ask for money; but if someone from
either house asked for an accounting of that
exnenditure, the university authorities would
say that according to the Constitution it is a
provincial matter and that we have no right
to ask for any information as to how the
money was spent.
The matter bas never been put before the
Canadian people, but when they are assessed
they want to know what was done with the
revenue from taxation.
I do not blame the Government regarding
this legislation. I will approve this, and I
will follow the example of my learned colleagues. I do not wish to prevent any student
from obtaining the education for which he or
his parents are making sacrifices. At the same
time, we should know what is done with the
money.
It will be said that a senator wanted to
know what was done with the money; and
then the question will be asked: "Do you not
trust us? Do you not rely on us for the proper
expenditure of the money?" Well, when the
students strike to get rid of the dean of the
faculty, there is something wrong in the realm
of Denmark. I know very well that if one of
the cabinet ministers, or even the Prime
Minister, were to write a circular letter to the
universities to ask them what they were doing
with the federal subsidy, there would be an
outcry. They would say, "Give us your money,
but mind your own business." That is that.
I know that I do not offend the sponsor of
the bill (Hon. Mr. Flynn) by speaking in this
way, because I am sure he is familiar with
all the facts I have mentioned. It does not
affect him, because he is one of the leading
members of the learned profession in the
city of Quebec. He got experience in the
House of Commons and the Privy Couneil,

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 8, 1962
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
FIRST READING
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, this
completes the business that we have presently before us. There are two items which
we expect will be here after the dinner
hour. As you know, one is the Interim Supply
bill which, I believe, is being discussed in
the other house at the present time. There
is also the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation Bill, C-103, and Bill C-91, to amend
the Freight Rates Reduction Act. These three
items of business will probably be before
us this evening.

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-105, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial
year ending the 31 March, 1963.

the Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this bill be read the second
time?

DECEMBER 20, 1962
Hon. A. J. Brooks, with leave of the Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
C-105, has been before the other place for
some time. Before discussing it here on second reading, might I take this opportunity
to thank all honourable senators who are in
attendance, for the splendid co-operation
they have given in connection with the work
of the Senate during the last few days. I
know how difficult it is when we do not know
which bills are coming up, and I know there
are honourable senators who have had to
change their travel reservations on plane or
train. I personally wish to thank you and
express my appreciation for your cooperation.
With reference to this bill on interim supply, it is the sixth one we have had since
these estimates were introduced in April of
this year, and I am sure that all honourable
senators are at this time very familiar with
the estimates.
The present bill requests interim supply to
provide for the financial requirements of the
Government to January 31, 1963. The extra
month's supply will represent a vote of tentwelfths of most estimate items.
Excepted from the general request is a
number of votes which have already received
eleven-twelfths' supply in previous appropriation acts. Extra supply was provided previously in respect of these items, inasmuch as
the funds were required for seasonal work
or for other special reasons. The excepted
items are listed in clause 2(a) of the bill, a
copy of which honourable senators now have
before them. Funds in excess of the general
request were provided in many cases because
they were required for work which could not
progress except during the summer months
as, for example, the provisioning of bases in
the far north and certain survey work that
requires warm weather, work on our national
parks, and other special work of that kind.
In addition to the ten-twelfths requested
for the majority of the items, eleven-twelfths
is requested for Vote 25 in the estimates of
Defence Production, Vote 5 of External
Affairs, and Vote 105 of the Department of
Northern Affairs and National Resources.
Details of these items will be found in
Schedule A to the bill.

On November 27 last, I tabled supplementary estimates (A) amounting to $161,439,147,
and nine-twelfths of supply of these items
was provided in Appropriation Bill C-86,
that is, the previous appropriation bill. In
addition, two-twelfths was provided in
respect of one vote in External Affairs and
two votes in Transport. These items are
therefore excepted from the request for
further supply in respect of supplementary
estimates (A).
On Wednesday, December 12, I tabled supplementary estimates (B) for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1963. Ten-twelfths of all
the items in those estimates is also requested
by the bill now before us. Passage of this
bill will mean that practically the same proportion of supply will have been released in
regard to supplementary estimates (A) and
(B) as to the general revised estimates.
The total amount to be released in respect
of the revised estimates for which onetwelfth of all items is requested is $292,175,958.
The additional one-twelfth of the items
referred to in section 2(b) of the bill amounts
to $1,842,041.67.
The one-twelfth requested in respect of
supplementary estimates (A) 1962-63, as set
forth in clause 2 (c), is $8,738,178.92, and tentwelfths of the items listed in supplementary
estimates (B) is $27,333,333.34. The total then
that would be released by this bill is
$330,089,511.93.
In no instance is the total amount of any
item in either the general estimates or supplementary estimates (A) or (B) being released
by this bill. The passage of this bill will not
prejudice the rights and privileges of honourable senators to criticize any item in the
estimates or supplementaries when the main
Supply Bill comes forward. The usual undertaking is hereby given that such rights and
privileges will be respected and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as the
result of the passing of this measure.
With leave, I propose to place on Hansard
a summary of the estimates, including budgetary expenditures and loans for the fiscal
year 1962-63, indicating the amount already
released for supply and to be released by
this bill. Do I have leave to place this summary on record now?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Since the budget there have been important changes in our international financial
position, and in the requirements of our Exchange Fund which, as the Minister of Finance emphasized hast April, were "unpredictable". The Prime Minister announced
on June 24 that the Government, in order
to sustain and protect the value of our dollar, was entering into certain short-term
borrowing transactions and stand-by arrangements. These inchuded a drawing of $300

DECEMBER 20, 1962
million (U.S.) from the International Monetary Fund.
As a supplement to the exchange reserves
the Government arranged a bond issue of
$250 million in the United States, half of the
proceeds of which were received on October
15, and the remaining half will be received
in January 1963.
In addition, whereas the treasury, from
April 1 to June 24, 1962, acquired over $600
million in cash from the sale of exchange
reserves, it drew down from June 24 to November 30, $936 million in cash to acquire
exchange reserves. This has involved net
requirements of over $300 million which
could not have been foreseen last April.
The cash used in this way is invested by the
Exchange Fund in earning assets abroad.
Since the present borrowing authority is
insufficient to meet the normal requirements,
together with the advances required earlier
this year in connection with the Exchange
Fund, an additional authority is now required. This would have the effect of raising
the total borrowing authority to $2.5 billion.
. This, honourable senators, is a general summary of the bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I do not think there is any necessity for me
to follow the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) in the details that he has
given of the bill now before us. We are
asked, in effect, to vote a sum of over $330
million on account of the total of the revised
estimates which were tabled last September.
I must say that so far as this house is
concerned I do not think it is a satisfactory
way of discharging our duties as guardians
of the public purse to merely discuss the estimates from time to time on supplementary
measures of this kind. The House of Commons, of course, has the advantage that it
goes over the estimates item by item, and in
that way gets complete knowledge of the
way it is proposed to spend the public moneys
of the country. We have no such opportunity.
Our only chance of examining these matters,
under our present procedure, is to discuss
items upon interim supply bills, and then
again at the very end of the session for a
few hours when there is always a great rush
to pass legislation.
I suggest to my honourable friend, the
Leader of the Government, that it might be
well for us to revert to the practice which existed some years ago when the honourable
Senator Crerar was chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance. In those days the
practice of this house was to refer the estimates for the year to that committee so that
it could make such inquiries as it felt necessary with respect to any particular items,

and, indeed, call for witnesses from any particular department in cases where it thought
investigation might be required. I think if
we did that now we should be fulfilling our
functions more adequately as one of the
branches of this Parliament, in seeing that
expenditures are not made without our
having acquainted ourselves at least in some
respects with what is proposed to be spent.
I make that suggestion to my honourable
friend in all good faith, because I think
that during the years when the Finance Committee did perform its functions, it performed
a valuable service and we in this bouse felt
we were taking a better and more active
part in the administration of the financial
affairs of the country.
As the honourable Leader of the Government said, these interim supply bills give us
an opportunity for discussing any particular
item in the estimates which any honourable
senator feels should be brought to the attention of the house. I propose to discuss for a
few minutes this evening one series of items,
those relating to the estimates of the National
Capital Commission.
As honourable senators know, the National
Capital Commission is the body charged with
the maintenance and beautification of our
capital city and its environs. It has been
charged by this Government with the work of
planning the relocation of the railway facilities
in the city. The particular matter to which I
wish to address a few remarks arises out of
a short item which appeared in the Ottawa
Citizen on Tuesday last, which I now read.
Construction work in 1963 on the
National Capital Commission $20 million
railway relocation program will be concentrated on "fundamental phases" in
Centre Town and the new $5 million
Union Station near Hurdman's Bridge.
From this I gather that it is proposed in this
coming year to spend $5 million on a new
union passenger station near Hurdman's
Bridge.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Does my honourable
friend consider that the Ottawa Citizen is a
spokesman for the Government?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: A spokesman for the
Government?
Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: Yes. My friend is
reading from the Citizen.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, is it incorrect? I
gather that it was merely a news item of what
the Government was proposing to do. Does
my friend say it is not correct? If so, I shall
be very happy. I take it as an item of news
and as being in fact what is about to be done
-and I think I shall be able to show that to
my honourable friend before I am through.

SENATE
I have a map of the City of Ottawa in my
office and I made a scale calculation of the
distance of this proposed new passenger station near Hurdman's Bridge from the present
Union Station. I find it is a distance of a little
over two miles. Therefore, this new station
will in effect be on the outskirts of the city,
as against the present station which is right
in the heart of Ottawa. It is proposed to close
the existing convenient, though admittedly
obsolete, station on Rideau Street which, as
I say, is in the heart of the city, and to transfer all passenger services on both railways
to the proposed station two miles from the
centre of the city. Now, I am frank to tell my
honourable friends that I think this is a disastrous mistake.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? When were these plans
first drawn up regarding the changing of
location? If I recall correctly, it was some
years ago. You are speaking of the Greber
plan, of course, which evolved under the
former Government.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I will tell my honourable friend that this plan originated as part
of the overall Greber plan.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: And it had the general
approvalHon. Mr. Hugessen: It had the general
approval of the Ottawa area, about which
I shall say a word or two in a few moments.
But the decision to proceed with this part of
the plan, the building of this station two
miles away, was an action taken by this Government in October 1959. I do not know
whether many here have read the evidence
given by Mr. Donald Gordon.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: May I ask another question? Was the action not taken after plans
had been drawn up and approved some few
years earlier? If my memory serves me
aright, that was the situation.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is not the evidence
I have. I am going to read to the house the
evidence that was given by Mr. Donald Gordon
before the sessional committee on Railways,
Air Lines and Shipping in the other place
on Tuesday, November 20 of this year, at
pages 118 and 119. Mr. Donald Gordon was
being questioned by Mr. Chevrier, and he
was asked this question:
If we are still on the question of the
system, that brings in railway stations.
What is the position of the Ottawa Union
Station? A great deal of comment has been
made in connection with it in the press
and elsewhere, and I think the committee
would be interested to know what the
present position is and what the plans
of the Canadian National Railways are,

if there are any, and anything else you
would like to tell us.
To which Mr. Gordon answered as follows:
Well, there is a lot of background to
this. I do not know if there is much
use going into it, but the fact of the matter
is that the Government decided the Union
Station should be relocated in the Hurdman's Bridge area and that was being
done through the then Federal District
Commission, which is now known as the
National Capital Commission. The station
is being built out there with the indication
that the Union Station would be completely vacated and turned over to the
National Capital Commission.
And a little further down the page:
Mr. CHEvRIER: This decision was made
by the National Capital Commission?
Mr. GORDON: No, it was made by the
Government. According to my understanding an announcement was made in
a press release from the office of the
Prime Minister on October 31, 1959. The
gist of it was the recommendation of
the National Capital Commission for the
relocation of the passenger terminal in
the vicinity of Hurdman's Bridge has
been approved and that the Government
had asked the National Capital Commission to enter into discussions with both
railways so as to complete the planning.
So I say, as far as I can tell from this
evidence, that is a decision of this Government.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Based on former plans.
I am interrupting the honourable senator
again, but I can recall that some years before this Government came into power those
plans had been drawn up and it was decided
to work out a plan.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: A great many plans
were drawn up, and from time to time parts
of them were brought into effect; but this
Government is responsible for this particular
part of the plan. So far as I know, Parliament has never been consulted about the location of the station.
Hon. Mr. McCuicheon: Is the honourable
senator critical of the decision?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Of course I am critical
of the decision.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: Would he like to
have the station left where it is?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Close to the Parliament
Buildings.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps my honourable
friend will possess his soul in patience until
I have finished my remarks.

DECEMBER 20, 1962

Hon. Mr. McCu±cheon: I am very patient.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As far as I am aware,
Parliament itself has never been asked to
give any decision as to where it wishes this
station to be located, although members of
Parliament are keenly interested in the question. The function of Parliament so far has
been confined to voting large sums in the
annual estimates for the National Capital
Commission without any precise indication of
how those moneys are to be spent.
There was another point which was quite
evident from Mr. Gordon's evidence before
the committee of the other place, evident
more perhaps by implication than by positive
statement. It was that the railway companies
were opposed to this suggestion, and I think
if honourable senators will give their minds
to the matter for a few minutes they will
readily understand why.
The new station on the outskirts of the
city will not be nearly so convenient for
passengers. In other words the railways, by
reason of this location of the new station
in this far-away area, will be deprived in
effect of the only advantage they now enjoy
over the airlines of being able, as they now
are, to bring their passengers into the centre
of the city. The railways will lose the advantage of being on a par with the intercity
bus lines which will be able to continue to
bring passengers into the heart of the city.
I suggest that this will have a disastrous
effect upon the rail passenger traffic, arriving
at and leaving Ottawa. Of course, the Canadian National Railways is particularly concerned because of the close connection between the present Union Station and the
Chateau Laurier, which makes it extremely
convenient for passengers travelling by rail
to get to the hotel just across the street.
I do not know that I need go into any
detail about the advantages of the Union
Station in its present location. For businessmen coming to Ottawa and wishing to visit
some department of Government or the Parliament buildings, the present station is
within a few minutes' walk. For the tourist
or businessman coming into the capital, it
is extremely convenient to have the hotel
Tight next to the station. It is equally convenient for residents of Ottawa leaving or
returning to the city by train to have the
station right next to Rideau Street from
which buses leave for al parts of the city.
I do not need to emphasize the convenience
it is to senators and members of Parliament
and to employees of the civil service to have
the station as close as it now is to the Parliament Buildings. By locating the new pas:senger station in this distant suburb, all
these advantages are given up. In fact, as

far as I can judge, the only people who will
really benefit by this change will be the taxi
drivers of Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: What is the distance between the present location of the station and
the proposed new location?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: About two miles.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Is the city growing towards the new station site?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There is an industrial
development around that area, but I do not
think there is much of a residential area.
I mentioned the Greber plan a few moments
ago. I think all of us warmly approved of
the majority of Mr. Greber's ideas and we
are happy to see them gradually carried out
year by year as time goes on.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I think the Greber plan
was the late Mackenzie King's dream.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The general plan
everybody approves.
Hon. Mr. Choque±e: In the original Greber
plan was it not understood that the station
had to be transferred from its present site?
Surely that was agreed in the Greber plan
some 15 years ago. I think Senator Lambert
will bear me out in that. We did not change
the plans.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You approved this
particular plan in 1959.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: We inherited the plan.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes, we inherited
it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As far as I have been
able to find out, if Mr. St. Laurent had
remained Prime Minister this part of the
plan would never have been carried out.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We are willing to
accept a lot of sins.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps you are willing
to accept a lot of sins. Perhaps you are
willing to repent, and I am going to ask you
to repent.
Hon. Mr. McCutcheon: No, not repent.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With regard to the
Greber plan and the proposal to put the
passenger station out in the suburbs, I am
disposed to ask this question: Why should
Ottawa be different from every other capital
city in the world of which I, at least, have
any knowledge whatsoever? Take London,
for instance. Of course it is a much larger
city than Ottawa, but in the centre of that
city there is a series of large terminals
located in a circle, and two of those stations,
Charing Cross and Victoria, are within a
few minutes walk of the Parliament of
Westminster.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McCuicheon: No one lives at the
Parliament of Westminster. Does the honourable senator think the London stations are
within a few minutes' walk of Westminster,
and Claridge's-and the other hotels where
people live?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Two of them certainly
are, Charing Cross and Victoria.
Hon. Mr. McCulcheon: No, they are much
farther away from the centre of London than
this new station will be from the centre
of Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Not by any manner
of means.
Let me refer to Washington, which honourable senators know well. It has its Union
Station right in the heart of the city, within
a reasonable walking distance of the government buildings and of the House of Representatives and Senate chambers. Take Paris.
It is rather like London in that it has a
series of five or six large terminal stations
within a circular area of fairly small dimensions; and one of those stations, if I recall
correctly, the Quai d'Orsay, the terminus of
the mainline railway to the southwest of
France, is right next door to the Chambre
des Députés.
If you visit Rome you will find that the
central station is located in substantially the
same relative position as is the Union
Station in Washington. Rome has one large
central terminal station pretty well in the
heart of the city. Incidentally, this station
was rebuilt by Mussolini and is within a few
minutes' walk of the Quirinal and other
government offices in that city.
I should like to ask why it is proposed
to treat Ottawa differently from these great
capital cities. I suggest that in this connection
perhaps we are suffering from delusions of
grandeur. I do urge this Government to get
the National Capital Commission to do some
re-planning, with a view to keeping the
present Union Station in operation. It is
quite true that the present station is antiquated, but to my mind its advantages of
location enormously outweigh any disadvantages of age. We are told the parking facilities are limited-which is true-but, surely,
we could improve the parking facilities at
the present station at one-twentieth the $5
million proposed to be spent on the new
station out near Hurdman's Bridge.
From the point of view of aesthetics I fail
to see how anybody can object to the few
lines of railway track which run alongside
the Rideau canal for about half a mile, and
the passenger coaches which normally are in
storage on those tracks. In days gone by, the
days of the steam locomotive, there was a
good deal of shunting on those tracks, and

the smoke interfered with the amenities of
the surrounding population. There may have
been something in that complaint, but I
would point out that the steam engine is no
more; it has been replaced by diesel engines,
and there is no smoke nuisance involved. I
am suggesting that we retain the present
Union Station for the reasons I have given.
I think we must all agree that there are
parts of the National Capital Commission's
plans for relocation of the railway lines
which, in themselves, are excellent and should
be retained. I mention particularly the removal of the Interprovincial bridge, and the
taking up of industrial tracks which now
exist in various parts of the city. I believe
that with a little goodwill the present plans
could be modified, without too much trouble,
to retain the present Union Station. I think
all that is required on the part of the National
Capital Commission is not only a little goodwill but perhaps less grandiose and more
practical ideas, and a consideration for
economy.
When I refer to economy in connection
with the National Capital Commission I am
rather encouraged to think that that body
believes in economy, for a few days ago I
received-no doubt in conjunction with every
other honourable senator-a communication
from the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
which begins as follows:
The National Capital Commission is
exploring all means of reducing expenditures. A saving in cost of snow removal
on Parliament Hill could be effected if
all-night parking of motorcars did not
exist.
Then it goes on to say how helpful it would
be to the National Capital Commission in
saving a few thousands of dollars in snow
removal cost if senators would refrain from
parking their cars overnight on Parliament
Hill. If the National Capital Commission is
exercising itself in the matter of small economies of this kind, why should it not exercise itself on the possibility of saving $5
million on an unnecessary passenger station?
As I have said, the Government adopted
this plan in 1959, and I would remind the
Government that 1959 is not 1963. The first
fine, careless raptures of 1958-1959, the visions
we used to hear about, are gone for good.
Since 1959 we have had three annual budgets
with enormous deficits, and the fourth annual
budget with an equally enormous deficit is in
prospect.
This past autumn, as a result of the
exchange and financial crisis last spring, the
Government tabled revised estimates cutting
out many millions of dollars of unnecessary
expenditure. I suggest to them that they can

DECEMBER 20, 1962
save another $5 million by cutting out this
wasteful expenditure on an unwanted station. I suggest that at least they should consult Parliament before they engage upon this
expenditure.
I am going to end my remarks, and summarize what I have said, by a question which
I address to the Government, and particularly to the Minister without Portfolio (Hon.
Mr. McCutcheon): Do you still propose to
inflict upon the people of Ottawa, and the
country as a whole, an expensive, inconvenient, and unnecessary passenger station out
in the sticks?
Hon. M. Wallace McCu±cheon: Honourable
senators, I have been asked a question which,
of course, I should not answer. It is a question in the same category as, "Have you
stopped beating your wife?".
I disagree with al the adjectives with which
the honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
prefaced his question. He knows, and I know,
that this is part of a whole plan to make the
city of Ottawa a viable city in its centre.
Al I say is: "Yes".
Hon. Mr. Higgins: I suppose what the minister means is that it is good to build the railway, but it is not an inexpensive or an inopportune one. Is that what he means? The
honourable senator asked a double-barrelled
question.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I will leave the minister to answer that question for himself.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators,
may I refer the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Brooks) to schedule A,
item 105, and the amount of $4,251,900 under
the heading: "Northern Affairs and National
Resources" for the Yukon Territory?
I am wondering whether this amount includes the financing of the buildings that were
erected for what might be called the Igloo
Festival in Dawson City. If that is the case,
then I think at a time like this when money
is scarce-and if the newspaper report I read
the other day is correct that the federal Government's contribution to the Dawson City
Festival was some $653,000, plus approximately $60,000 voted to the Government of
the Yukon Territory, making in al a contribution of over $700,000 in this fiscal year
-this is a rather substantial amount of money
to be appropriated for this festival, part of
which amount was used to renovate or refurbish what was really the Place Pigalle of
Dawson City, or, in other words, to make a
tourist attraction out of the rendezvous of that
famous lady known as Lou, and which could
not be expected to effectively compete with
equally famous and much closer tourist attractions in this and other countries.

I am wholeheartedly in favour of developing the north country, which I think has great
potentialities, but I have a rather uneasy
feeling, based upon newspaper reports, that
the outcome of this Dawson City Festival, or
Igloo Festival, left much to be desired. I have
a sneaking suspicion that some of the enthusiasm of our officials in the north country
has run away with their judgment.
.I wonder if we could have an explanation
of this item.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
do not have the particulars of this item here,
but I understand it is for a number of buildings, among which is the building mentioned
by the honourable senator, but that is only a
small part of the item.
I know there has been considerable criticism-we have read it in the press-of this
particular building that has been such a great
tourist attraction. I also understand that much
use of the highway to the Yukon has been
made by tourist traffic going to Dawson City,
and that the whole matter is looked upon by
those familiar with the tourist situation in the
north in not at ail the same light as my honourable friend or the press looks at it. So far
as this particular building is concerned, it
could very well be an asset.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Will we have an opportunity at a later date of obtaining the
details?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes. I will tell the honourable senator that I will obtain for him ful
information on the item, but I do not have
the particulars of it at the moment.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I saw in the press today an advertisement which shocked me. It was for a TV
production which commenced at 8 o'clock
tonight, too late to enable me to draw what
was to happen to the attention of the Government, but good warning should be given
to the C.B.C. for the future.
My honourable colleagues know that civic
funerals have taken place in Montreal for two
constables who were killed in a $125,000 bank
holdup. The population was grieved about
those murders of men who were doing their
duty. The advertisement which I have seen
today reads:
Famous star: Lillian Gish, a figure from
the golden silent days of motion pictures,
makes an infrequent television appearance as guest star on The Defenders
tonight at 8 p.m. on the CBC-TV network. As Louise Clarendon, she portrays
a sweet little old lady who tries to rob
a bank in Grandma TNT. It also will be
seen on Saturday, Dec. 22, at 8.30 p.m.
on WCAX-TV, Channel 3.

SENATE
I find it pitiful and shameful, and I presume honourable senators agree with me, that
when men are killed on duty while trying to
protect human life, things like this should be
shown over television and that these notices
should be published in all newspapers. The
daily papers should be blamed for publishing
such advertisements.
I hope that the Government will stop
C.B.C. from giving such scandalous performances. Listen to this: "A sweet little old lady
who tries to rob a bank in Grandma TNT."
It is absurd.
I wonder if the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) will bring this to the
attention of whom it may concern, so that
such performances may be stopped. There
are horror programs at night sometimes, dealing with murders and robberies.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Violence.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes, and it is shown for
everyone, young and old, and that is the
educational part of the program. I regret to
have to mention this, but I think it is necessary to do so. The press is to blame as much
as those who drafted the advertisement. It
may pay them, but the price that the people
pay for that is very high. It is time to stop it.
I am sending this clipping to the Leader of
the Government, and I know that he can
make good use of it.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I have already seen it
and I felt very much as the honourable
senator does.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: This is like a family council, where we discuss matters which affect
Canadian families. It is in their interest that
I am rising tonight, to stop such shameful
publicity.
Honourable senators, there are two other
matters to which I should like to refer very
briefly. One is the C.N.R. committee to study
the promotion of French Canadians. The
most sensible thing which has been said
about the whole matter was in an editorial
written in L'Action by Mr. Lorenzo Paré, a
former president of the Press Gallery in
Ottawa, who said that all the facts were
known about the relations between races,
and the only thing to do was to take action.
It is not complicated to make an investigation, but those who should not make it are
precisely those who could be associated with
the Canadian National Railways, because they
would try to justify themselves. If a civil
servant suffers an injustice and it is reported
to the Civil Service Commission, then an investigator goes to inquire from the same chief
of branch who is responsible for the injustice
suffered by the civil servant. He is the judge
and jury in his own case; and that is the
way it goes.

How can you expect Mr. Donald Gordon
and his associates or confederates to give any
justice to English-speaking or French-speaking Canadians, when it is their own practice
which is to blame? Do you expect them to
redress the wrong? They could use a white
brush to whitewash the black, and a black
brush to blacken the white. That is the practice. Can one expect anything from them?
The only way to find the truth in the matter
is to consult the C.N.R. telephone directories
of Montreal, Moncton, Toronto, Winnipeg and
Vancouver. You have only to count those
who have a telephone and you will find that
the names of French-speaking Canadians are
very few in number.
When Mr. Donald Gordon said there were
so many French-speaking Canadians employed by the railway, he meant everybody,
including day labourers in minor positions.
Each counts for one, and that is very probably the way he made his computation of
figures. There is no truth in that calculation.
It is all a fake. It is not necessary to be an
economist or a statistician with a degree or
a diploma to know that. Each man who
shovels the garbage, shovels the snow, or
works on the track in summer or in winter,
or each day labourer, all count for one as
part of those figures. That is what Mr. Gordon
probably shows to give the false impression
that French-speaking Canadians are well
treated on the railway. It is untrue. I know
it; I have been here long enough to see the
injustices that people suffer. Sometimes the
unions were to blame just as much as the
railway. But the railway will never admit
that they have made a mistake. They are
like the Civil Service Commission, and like
the majority of the employees of the federal
Government; they never admit that anybody
is wrong. That is why there is no redress,
because no one admits any guilt for injustices that might exist.
There is a bill in the House of Commons,
sponsored by a genial member of Parliament,
to haveHon. Mr. Choquette: To make it a criminal
offence to discriminate. Do you refer to McIntosh's bill?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. It is a bill to appoint
a gentleman to listen to the grievances of
the employees who suffer injustices of some
kind. It is sponsored by Mr. Smith, the member for Calgary South. The intention is
good. In the House of Commons there is no
Civil Service Committee, as we have here,
although the one we have here never sits.
But there should be a standing Civil Service
Committee in the House of Commons to listen
to the grievances of civil servants. It was
proposed unanimously by the Civil Service
Committee in 1938, and again in 1939-I see

DECEMBER 20, 1962
my honourable friend the Leader of the Goverment nodding. He was one of us who
recommended the appointment of such a
committee. Why? To give to civil servants
the opportunity to come and state their grievances under the protection of Parliament so
that they would suffer no comeback from
their chiefs of branches. But it was so full
of sense and so practical that it was never
adopted.
Now a member comes with the same idea,
which is presented in another form but
is nevertheless praiseworthy. I believe that
for the protection of civil servants Parlia-.
ment should assume such responsibility and
give everyone a chance to be heard. They
could come before the committee just as well
as the subjects go before the Throne, to lay
their grievances and from which there would
be no retaliation of any kind from the chiefs
of branches. That was recommended by the
committee. It came from the late Alphonse
Fournier, who was at one time Minister of
Public Works and later a judge of the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: As I recall, the honourable senator was himself chairman of that
committee, was he not?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes, I was chairman of
the committee during the session of 1938, and
when Mr. King refused to sanction our recommendations I continued to sit as a member of
the committee but I was not interested to act
as chairman. I sat on the committee during
both sessions, and the sane committee adopted
the same recommendations one session after
the other; and, although the members of that
committee did not belong to the same political
party, I was proud of my colleagues and we
did our best to improve conditions for the
civil service. Those were the only times when
the civil servants were considered with regard
to their usefulness to the state. As a rule the
purpose of other civil service committees
was to increase salaries, to look after promotions, and so forth. But that time we tried
to learn what was done by the civil servants
and the usefulness of each one to the state.
We discovered many other things, one being
that a comely girl could do nothing and be
well paid, while a homely one had to work
hard at a much lesser salary. But these are
things which are very human. However, we
found out the usefulness of good looks in
certain branches of the civil service.
And now my conclusion with regard to
Mr. Gordon is that he should not be left
alone to make that investigation, because
there will be too many dampers around him
to prevent the truth from shining brilliantly
enough so that we can see what has happened in the dark. Besides that, with regard
27511-5-33

to his qualifications, I know thousands of
Canadians who are as well qualified as he
was when he came to the Bank of Canada,
and especially when he came to the Canadian
National Railways as its president. He is not
a bad fellow but he thinks that he is God
himself. Naturally that is a little exaggeration,
but you will remember, Sir, and honourable
colleagues, there was a member of the Senate,
and before that the same member of the
House of Commons, who said many a time
it was really a mistake to appoint Mr. Gordon
chairman of the board and president of the
Canadian National Railways. I repeated that
when the Liberals were in power and again
when the Conservatives were in power, and
to my amazement on the last occasion Mr.
Gordon was again appointed president and
chairman of the board, just as he was before,
as the one and only person who could run
the show.
Honourable senators, I have the satisfaction
at least of being on record as having said
it; whether it was done or not, is immaterial.
I said what I thought should be said and it
is on the record to stay.
I want to warn the Government about
another matter. In my political career I have
often raised my arms to warn all governments
to be careful about the road we are following,
because it could be a dangerous road leading
to a precipice or an abyss. I raised my hands,
and sometimes they found it very unpleasant
because they were so sure they knew their
way.
There is another matter which has been
revived by the Social Crediters in the House
of Commons. They have spoken about a
translation of the Beauchesne book. I thought
that it was a boutade-a joke-on the part
of the Social Crediters, but it was taken
seriously by the Government. Some day I
will ask some questions, and my honourable
colleagues will know more about Beauchesne.
Honourable senators, I have in my hand
a Canadian flag. It is very simple. I showed
it in the Senate one day, when there was not
much doing, and Mr. Speaker at the time
was very helpful. He gave me the opportunity
of showing the flag that I fly over my home
at Rivière-du-Loup. It is a nylon flag, twelve
feet long and six feet wide. This small
replica gives an idea of what the bigger flag
looks like. It is very simple. It is more than
a flag; it is the idea of what a flag should
be. A flag should be simple, with only one
emblem on it, so as to be easily seen from
a distance.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: It looks like a communist
fiag.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: The background is red,
the colour of the Senate, and the maple leaf

SENATE
is green, the colour of the House of Commons.
Really, the colours are immaterial because
the idea is to have the emblem, the maple
leaf, of any colour on any suitable background. It may be blue on white, or gold on
red, or gold on white, or any other colour
combination. When I went to Toronto and
appeared before the Junior Board of Trade
to show them the flag, the only observation
I heard was that the colours should be in
reverse-that it should be red on green,
rather than green on red.
I mention this because I am very much
concerned about the trouble that the Prime
Minister will have on meeting the provincial
premiers to suggest a flag. Take, for instance,
Mr. Smallwood. He thinks only of lions rampant, and his imagination is full of them;
if there is not a lion rampant on the flag
he would create a furore. Therefore, I do not
see what the Prime Minister will do with
Mr. Smallwood if he invites him over there.
There are the good Nova Scotians, who
have a flag dating from King James. It is a
noble flag, and is the provincial flag of Nova
Scotia. In Quebec we have a flag which has
been chosen unanimously by Order in Council, with the consent of the Government and
Opposition, and everybody knows it. It is the
fleur-de-lis. As I say, Mr. Smallwood has
a flag for Newfoundland full of lions rampant,
and has the seal of Newfoundland which
depicts a Newfoundlander kneeling before
Britannia offering her a fish. I do not exaggerate. My friends from Newfoundland know
that that is true, and naturally it is unworthy
of a great province like theirs that one should
kneel before Britannia offering her a fish.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: That seal is an old
one. It bas inscribed on it the motto, "Haec
tibi dona fero"; that is, "These gifts I bear
to thee." I do not presume Mr. Smallwood devised it-it is nearly 300 years old. It was old
before Canada was civilized.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: But my friend, who is
perhaps one of the most learned of our
colleagues, knows what I say is true. Is it
true, or not?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Do you mean that Mr.
Smallwood wants that flag?

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Even if there is a difference of a year or a month, I wonder if it is
not true that they kneel before Britannia to
offer a fish?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: That is quite true.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: What is the use of arguing when the thing is known by everybody?
I thank my honourable colleague for what he
bas said.
Imagine the embarrassment of the Prime
Minister when he sees the quarrel that will
result from his suggestion that the provinces
should select a flag. Whether or not the flag
of Newfoundland, accepted by Mr. Smallwood, is suitable to the other provinces is
immaterial.
On this point I say that three provinces
have their own flag: the province of Nova
Scotia bas the King James flag, the province
of Quebec bas the fleur-de-lis, and the province of Newfoundland has the lions rampant.
There is of course also the province of
Ontario which has the red ensign. I remember that Mr. Frost, before making his retreat,
decided that the red ensign was the flag that
the province of Ontario should have and to
which the school children should give their
salute in the morning. That means that only
four provinces have their own flag, although
each is entitled to have its own. The first
thing each province should do, before giving
an opinion on the Canadian flag, is to have
its own flag, whether it be the red ensign,
the lions rampant, or any other kind.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: For information, may I
ask the honourable senator a question? How
could the province of Ontario adopt the red
ensign with the Canadian coat of arms on it?
I wonder if it is officially the flag of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I share my honourable
friend's confusion, but that is the way it was
done. Mr. Frost said he liked the red ensign
and that it should replace the Union Jack.
This brings me to one of my favourite
points, and that is that the Union Jack is one
of the most beautiful flags, if not the most
beautiful, having the crosses of the three
patron saints of the British Isles.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I would point out we are discussing Bill
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. I am talking about C-105, an Act for granting to Her Majesty
the arms of Newfoundland. There is depicted certain sums of money for the public service
a Newfoundlander kneeling before Britannia for the financial year ending March 31, 1963.
Naturally, we are always interested when
offering a fish.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: They are supposed to Senator Pouliot speaks, but I have been
be two Indians, Beothics, the aboriginals of listening patiently for some time now and I
Newfoundland. The last of the Beothics died cannot see how his remarks regarding a flag
in 1827. They are kneeling, and are supposed have anything to do with this bill. I have
to be offering gifts to Britannia. As I say, allowed certain questions from other senators, but now I would suggest to Senator
the last one died in 1827, 135 years ago.

DECEMBER 20, 1962
Pouliot that he please confine his remarks to
the bill before the house.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The reason I mention this subject is its connection with Vote No. 5, which reads:
Representation Abroad-Operationalincluding authority, notwithstanding the
Civil Service Act, for the appointment
and fixing of salaries of High Commissioners, Ambassadors, Ministers Plenipotentiary, Consuls, Secretaries and staff by
the Governor in CouncilOver $12 million.
Honourable senators know very well that
in that amount there are large sums of money
for the purchase of flags for use at embassies
and consulates general, and since I feel that
we have no national flag for use in our representation abroad I refer to this matter. We
do not have a national flag. I do not say that
to embarrass the Government; I mention it
to help the Prime Minister so that he will
not waste his time.
The Hon. the Speaker: I indicated to honourable senators that in my opinion these
remarks are entirely out of order. If the honourable senator wishes to discuss matters
which relate to the bill, there is no objection,
but I do not think the remarks he has been
making about a flag are in order at this time.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I will not insist. Instead,
I will conclude by offering you, Sir, and ail
my colleagues, my best wishes for a Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

CANADIAN WORLD EXHIBITION
CORPORATION BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-103, to establish the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mark R. Drouin, with leave of the

27511-5-33J

He said: Honourable senators, with all
these lions on the rampage it is with some
trepidation that I rise to speak in support of
my motion for second reading of this bill,
which concerns the Canadian Universal and
International Exhibition.
I understand that the Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General will be here
in about 10 minutes, so my remarks will be
brief indeed. It is for the same reason that
I feel I can expect from all honourable senators their indulgence and their concurrence,
without too much discussion.
The bill before us is the result of a joint
drafting of three levels of government, the
federal Government, the Quebec provincial
government, and the Corporation of the
Municipality of Montreal. It has, I understand, received complete and enthusiastic
approval from the leaders of all parties in
the other place. It was debated there this
afternoon and passed within the last hour or
so. The leaders of all parties spoke in favour
of this bill; it comes here with the general
approval of the other place, ail parties there
having said what they had to say with
respect to it. Accordingly, I would ask all
honourable senators to give this bill the quick
approval of the Senate.
The Montreal World's Fair or, more properhy, the Canadian Universal and International Exhibition, received its final approval
from the Bureau of Exhibitions in Paris on
November 13 last.
Back in 1960 the Canadian Government,
with the concurrence of the province of
Quebec and also of the city of Montreal, made
application for this exhibition. Honourable
senators will recall that this was the first
application. It was heard in Paris. Honourable Senator Fournier was then mayor of
Montreal and he will bear me out on this,
that we worked together on the application.
Senator Fournier went to Paris at the time
for this purpose.
At that time the Soviet Union had also
applied for this worldwide exhibition, international and universal, to celebrate their
fiftieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution. There were three ballots cast, and finally
the Canadian application was turned down
by one vote and the Russians got permission
from the International Bureau in Paris to
hold this exhibition in Moscow in 1967.
Two years elapsed. In the meantime, after
second thoughts, the Russians decided to
withdraw. The Canadian Government applied
again, also with the concurrence of the
province of Quebec and of the city of
Montreal. This application received the unanimous and enthusiastic approval of the two
subcommittees, which sat on October 10 and
11 last, just about two months ago.

SENATE
On November 13 the Bureau of Exhibitions as a whole approved enthusiastically this application. Since then, the
federal Government, the province of Quebec
and the city of Montreal, through their
lawyers and representatives, drafted this bill,
and it is in complete accord with the views
of the authorities on those three levels.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, the International Exhibition of 1967 will make Montreal for six
months the centre of attraction of the American continent, because it will mark at the same
time the centennial of the Canadian Confederation and will enable the metropolis to ask
other nations in the world to take part in those
celebrations on the occasion of a universal
fair. On the national level, beyond all purely
educational and commercial competition, this
exhibition will offer to foreign visitors a
reflection of our way of life, of our thinking,
and should foretell our future. In return,
the guest countries will bring us the image
of their cultural development and of their
economic vitality.
In a spirit of artistic and scientific emulation, the 1967 exhibition will have as a task
to give a synoptic outline of the evolution of
all human activities. It will, in its overall
concept, show the intense longing of all
peoples for a brotherly co-operation and
tolerance. To all the troubles and uncertainty
of our time, it will have to oppose a teaching
of spirit, perseverance and faith in success.
"Man and his World" is the theme which
has been unanimously chosen by the
organizing committee of the universal exhibition and fair. "Man and his world", in French
Terre des hommes-and the French speaking
Canadians who are here now know that Terre
des hommes is the title of a book by SaintExupéry, a great French author-"Man and
his world" will therefore bring us the message of a humanity conscious of its peaceful
mission and it will symbolize our hope and
trust in life.
The registration of the world fair has been
enthusiastically acclaimed not only in Canada,
in Montreal and in the province of Quebec,
but also in several countries for various
reasons. The great nations of the world consider it as an opportunity to associate the
big continents to a manifestation which, to
their way of thinking, must be done on a
gigantic scale, besides being a model for
the others which will be planned in the
future. The countries which have only obtained their independence these last years
shall be represented as distinct ethnical entities, at least that is our hope, and it will be
the first opportunity for these nations to
assert their existence.
Moreover, it seems useless to mention that

the fair will be the most daring undertaking
that the three levels of government, federal,
provincial and municipal, are called upon
to bring about together. Nothing as bold
as this has ever been attempted in our country. In fact, we must build up from scratch
a fabulous thing which should be considered
by the rest of the world as the most sensational event of our times. Here, in Canada, this
is somewhat of a challenge to the imagination of creative and artistic people as well
as to men who have valuable practical experience. It is obvious, and hardly worth
mentioning, that an efficient team will have
to be set up and that the greatest degree of
co-operation at all levels will be necessary
during all the phases of the planning and
organization process.
The unavoidably limited time at our disposal to set up such a large scale operation
does not permit us to be stingy, because each
minute is precious. That is why it is so
imperative that we may rely on the best
brains we can find.
Honorable senators, you will no doubt recall, since it has been widely discussed in the
press, that we should have had seven years
to prepare and organize that fair. The Belgians
had seven years to organize the Brussels
World Fair. We only have four and a half
years to go. That is why I am asking you
tonight to pass this bill without amendment,
because it is in fact the result of an agreement at three government levels, and thus
co-operate with those who will be called
upon to assume the heavy burden of organizing that fair. Time is already running short,
but we believe that, here in this Canada of
ours, we work a little faster with the instruments and the mechanization we have, as
well as with the machines which are at our
disposal, and several of our fellow-citizens,
our architects and engineers have already
devoted some time to such a task; they
already have ideas about the development
of that magnificent project, becase we have
been discussing it for the last two or three
years. That is why we believe that, if no other
additional delay occurs, the people of the
province of Quebec and Montreal will be able
to carry out that undertaking because, on
April 28, 1967 we will have to be ready to
welcome the fifty nations, at least, that we
are expecting and which will probably participate in that project. Fifty or fifty-five
nations will certainly accept the invitation of
the Canadian people to participate, not only
at the fair as such, but they will also come
over here to help us celebrate our national
holiday, our 1967 centennial. We expect to
welcome between fifty and sixty million
people who will spend an average of $75
to $100 each, thus bringing Canada foreign

DECEMBER 20, 1962
exchange exceeding $2 billions, according to
the experts.
Moreover, in my opinion, and I think this
will be very much appreciated by some labour
unions, the undertaking will give employment
to over 25,000 Canadians in Montreal and
vicinity and will, of course, pay reasonable
wages. I am pleased tonight to offer special
thanks to the labour unions of the province
of Quebec who have assured us in writing,
after passing resolutions to that effect, that no
strike will be called on the site of the exhibition or outside with regard to any work
related to it. I am pleased to express to them
my personal appreciation, and, if you will
allow me, that of the Senate and the House
of Commons.
This gesture shows how much we can count
on the co-operation of our fellow-citizens to
carry out this tremendous project.
In this perspective, it is to be hoped that
town-planning projects put under way right
now will eventually prolong the effects that
may ensue in the fields of health and
economics from the works of the exhibition.
Any diffident outlook, any narrowness of
scope, any lack of foresight will only restrict
the chances of success of an enterprise which
will mark turning point in the history of
Canada and its metropolis.
The metropolis of the future must not prove
unworthy of the Montreal of the past.
Honourable senators, I shall not go into the
details of the bill, but if you have any questions to ask I may be able to answer them
since I am quite conversant with the matter,
having looked after it for some time.
(Text):
The purport of the bill is to set up a Crown
corporation to which will subscribe the federal
Government to the extent of $20 million, the
provincial Government to the extent of $15
million, and the city of Montreal $5 million.
That is to be the investment of each Government in this project.
The board will be composed of a Commissioner General, who will also be president of
the Crown corporation. There will be twelve
directors, all appointed by the Governor in
Council, after agreement reached with the
provincial Government and the city of Montreal. In other words, in effect the federal
Government will appoint six directors, the
provincial Government will appoint four, and
the city of Montreal, two. But all these names
will be submitted to all three Governments
so as to be certain that each member of the
board of governors, or directors, will be satisfactory to this Government, the provincial
Government and the municipal government of
the city of Montreal.

517

In substance, honourable senators, that is
the bill. It sets out the ordinary powers, as
drafted by brilliant corporation lawyers. If
some honourable senators have questions to
ask I shall do my best to answer them.
I would ask that this bill receive its three
readings now so that it may receive royal
sanction later tonight. As soon as the bill is
adopted and proclaimed the site will have to
be chosen, the Commissioner General will
have to be appointed, and there is a lot of
other work to do, such as the planning and the
organization of the corporation. All this will
take some time, and time is short.
In view of the unanimity this project has
received not only here in Canada but in Paris,
I would ask and indeed beg honourable senators to adopt the bill as quickly as possible,
permitting it to receive royal sanction tonight.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I think it would be difficult for anybody
with any heart at all to refuse the request
made so earnestly and so eloquently by my
honourable friend for the immediate passage
of this bill.
As he said, this bill is in effect a joint production of the federal authority, the provincial
authority and the city of Montreal, and I understand all of its terms have been carefully
considered and agreed upon by all those
authorities.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Seven lawyers have
worked on it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, that makes me
feel a great deal happier.
However, looking at it from the point of
view of the responsibility of the Senate to
see that legislation which goes through our
bouse is in proper form, perhaps in this
particular instance it does give us an excuse
not to send the bill to committee and subject
it to the very minute scrutiny which a bill
would normally get in our bouse.
I can quite appreciate what my honourable
friend said about the necessity for speedy
action. If we are to have a good world exhibition in Montreal-and, of course, I would
be the last one who would want to prevent
anything of that kind, being myself a resident
of that city-we have to have a tremendous
amount of preparatory organization of the
kind to which my honourable friend referred.
I think that in itself is a second reason why,
in this instance, we can forego the examination which we would normally give to a bill
of this character.
There is a third reason which occurs to
me. After all, this exhibition will not be held
for another five years, and if there should be
any faults or mistakes, or anything wrong
in this connection, we can correct it within
the next year or two.

SENATE
So, on that understanding and for those
reasons, I am in accord-and I certainly think
I speak for all honourable senators on this
side of the house-with the request which my
honourable friend has so graciously made,
and I would be quite happy to agree to
putting this measure through all three
readings this evening.
(Translation):
Hon. Sarto Fournier: Honourable senators, I am not in the habit of holding up
the Senate very often nor any longer than
circumstances require, but I do not feel I
can refrain, on this occasion, from saying a
few words concerning the bill now before us.
First, I should like to congratulate most
heartily our distinguished colleague, the honourable Senator Mark Drouin, for the very
active part he has played in this tremendous
project, not only in the interest of the city of

Montreal or the province of Quebec, but of
Canada as a whole. Whatever happens in this
venture we are entering today, in my opinion
it will certainly be quite an experience, a most
successful achievement. I think that, in the
future, when we have to draw up a list of
the persons we must thank and congratulate,
the name of Senator Drouin will appear at the
very top; I am happy to tell him so and to
congratulate him.
I understand also that the present circumstances require that we move fast. AIthough this is a very important matter, we
must somewhat speed it up and pass it
quickly. Honourable Senator Hugessen, who
spoke before me, said that if mistakes are
made, in the next five years, we shall always
have time to correct them. I know that the
argument of honourable Senator Hugessen is
well founded as regards mistakes we could
discover in the near or distant future. But it
seems to me that, in all good faith, a mistake
has found its way into the bill that is submitted to us. In my opinion, it could be corrected right now.
In spite of the urgent invitation extended
by Senator Drouin during his remarks, when
he asked us to pass the bill without any
amendment-it is an important event, not
only for the whole of Canada, but also for
the whole of North America and, at the same
time, for the whole world. The city of Montreal finds itself, under the circumstances, very
luckily located right in the middle of things.
There is no doubt that the city of Montreal
and its citizens will have, in that respect,
to play a very important part. First, as
citizens of Montreal, we will have to take
part in the preparations, pay our share, and
split the expenses with the other two governments, federal and provincial.
It is now established that the federal Government's share will amount to $20 million,

the provincial Government's $15 million, and
the city of Montreal's at least $5 million.
Thus, the $20 million donated by the federal
Government represents a contribution of $1
per capita, Quebec's share of $15 million, a
contribution of $3 per capita for a population
of five millions, and the city of Montreal, with
a population of 1,200,000, will subscribe
$5 million, in round figures, which is at least
$4 per capita. As residents of Montreal
we are therefore called upon to pay as much
as a resident of the province of Quebec and a
Canadian citizen together: $1 as Canadians,
$3 as residents of the province of Quebec,
which makes $4; and we, the Montrealers,
will pay directly, at least $4 each, in addition
to $3 as Quebeckers and $1 as Canadians.
Nobody is against that; there is no criticism
on that point. It is obvious that Montrealers
will probably be the first ta benefit from the
fact that the world exhibition will be held in
the metropolis. However, we find it odd that
there is practically no mention of the city of
Montreal in the bill. Clause 3 mentions the
island of Montreal. I will not discuss this
technicality but, in my opinion, there is no
legal entity called the island of Montreal. To
be sure, the bill would have to be referred to
a committee to determine whether the
designation should be Jacques Cartier island,
Hochelaga island or the archipelago of
Hochelaga. But "island of Montreal", as such,
is either a new designation or, as far as I am
concerned, something which has no meaning
at all. However, since this designation is the
one customarily used, to wit this bill and the
electoral districts in the Canada Elections Act,
I do not intend to make any fuss over that
technicality. It seems to me that it would be
a loss of time.
There is another article in that bill where
the word Montreal appears, namely section
9(d) dealing with expenditures:
-expend
any moneys received by the
Corporation by way of grant pursuant to
section 11 or by way of grant from the
province of Quebec or from the city of
MontrealIt is the first time the city of Montreal is
mentioned in the bill, but only with regard
to the contribution it will have to make.
Things being as they are, it is no time to
quarrel or quibble. Let us not stumble on that
section 9(d).
To get to the last section, namely section
10(2), which reads as follows:
The Corporation shall wind up its
aff airs and dispose of its assets and liabilities within such time after the closing of
the exhibition and in such manner and
subject to such conditions as the Governor

The Hon. the Speaker: I must point out

Drouin) speaks now, he will close the debate.
I would point out to the honourable senator who has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Fournier,
De Lanaudiere) that he has been referring to
the third reading.
I would suggest that we proceed to second
reading, and when I put the motion for the
third reading, the honourable senator (Hon.
Mr. Fourier, De Lanaudiere) may speak again
and then present his motion. Would that be
agreeable?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Why can I not reply to
his speech right away?
The Hon. the Speaker: I do not see that
there is any objection, except that the honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Drouin) would be
:losing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: An amendment has been
proposed and I wish to reply to it. I think it
is out of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: As far as the amendment is concerned, I cannot accept it, because it proposes "that the bill be not now
read the third time", and we are now on
second reading. That is why I think we should
proceed as I have suggested, and when I put
the motion for third reading the honourable
senator (Hon. Mr. Fournier, De Lanaudiere)
can speak again and propose his motion, if
no other senator wishes to speak.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: But I want to avoid another speech from the honourable senator that
will be as long as the first one, because time
is passing and the Governor General, or his
Deputy, is waiting.
The Hon. the Speaker: When the motion is
put, the honourable senator can speak then.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I want to put a question to the honourable
senator from De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr.
Fournier) on subsection 2 of section 19 of the
bill, dealing with the winding up of the
corporation's affairs and the disposition of its
assets and liabilities after the closing of the
exhibition.
If it occurs, as it bas happened in the past
with some world exhibitions, that as the result of a mishap the Montreal World Fair has
a deficit, is my honourable friend ready to put
his amendment just the same? That is what
I am afraid of. I am from Montreal, and I am
very anxious that it should have an exhibition
and a world fair, but since the result is
financially uncertain, I think it would be very
wise not to put the city in such a position that
its people, instead of being the vache à lait,
will have to meet the deficit.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudiere): Honourable senators, after the bill bas received
second reading I shall be glad to answer the

honourable Senator Dupuis. I assure the honourable Senator Drouin that if my speech was
rather long for him, it was just two minutes
shorter than the one he delivered.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Some Hon. Senators: Now.
Hon. Mr. Drouin moved, with leave of the
Senate, that this bill be now read the third
time.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudiere): Honourable senators, I move that the bill be
not now read the third time, but that it be
amended as follows:
Page 8, line 47, in the second paragraph of item 19, immediately after the
word "Council," insert "and the executive committee of the city of Montreal"
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Honourable senators, I
must resist this amendment very vigorously,
not only because it will have the effect of
delaying the adoption of this bill, which has
received the unanimous support of all the
parties in the Commons, the unanimous support of the people of Canada and, I must say,
the unanimous support and encouragement
of the Council of the Bureau of International
Exhibitions.
The honourable senator who moved the
amendment (Hon. Mr. Fournier, De Lanaudiere) said in his opening remarks that it
was innocuous-it was "inoffensif," as he put
it in French. Well, if it is so innocuous and
unimportant why does he at the last moment
move an amendment to the bill? I said in
introducing the bill that it was the result
of an agreement between all levels of government: the federal Government, the provincial Government of Quebec, and the
government of the Municipality of Montreal.
In other words, it is a pact; it is an agreement.
Honourable senators who are corporation
lawyers will appreciate that this bill does
not contain all the agreements between these
three governments. There is an entente, an
agreement, that goes into many more particulars than does this bill. We could not
embody in it all the detail, all the difficulties
and problems that had to be solved between
the three levels of government by way of
contract. These, I understand, have been
agreed upon before and during the drafting
of this bill, and it is the result of the joint
effort of all three governments. We cannot
amend it, especially section 19 which is a
money question. It has to do with the winding up of the corporation after the closing

DECEMBER 20, 1962
of the exhibition, and it is doubtful that the
Senate can amend a money bill, in that sense.
There are many other sections in which
the city of Montreal is not mentioned, and
could have been mentioned, but that is because there is an agreement. I said that
the city of Montreal would propose two directors, that the province would propose
four, and the federal Government six-12
in all.
Hon. Mr. Power: Is this a written agreement?
Mr. Drouin: No. There is no written agreement as yet.
Hon. Mr. Power: I thought you said that
the agreement was a written one.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: I was very careful not
to say it was a written agreement. I said an
agreement, an entente. I was very careful
in that respect, because I know it is not
down in writing as yet.
This bill was the result, I would say, of
eight or nine meetings held in Ottawa and
Montreal. Seven lawyers, representing Montreal, the province of Quebec and the federal
Government, worked on it, and this bill is
in accord with their agreement. The city
of Montreal has agreed that in certain sections it would not be mentioned, because it
would force the draftsmen of the bill to go
into too much detail and make it too complicated.
This is a public bill. What is done here
is apparently done in corporations that are
formed involving complicated arrangements.
There is a side agreement between the bond
holders, the debenture holders and common
shareholders in many cases. This bill is no
different. Why should we amend it for something that is so unimportant?
As honourable Senator Dupuis, from
Montreal, just mentioned, section 19 provides
for the winding up of the corporation. When
that is done there might be a profit, or there
might be a loss, and if the city of Montreal
does not partake in the division of what is
left after closing it will not be forced to
pay part of the deficit. The honourable
senator mentions that the city of Montreal
will contribute a large amount to this exhibition. That is true, on the whole. But the
city of Montreal will harvest some direct
and immediate benefits from this exhibition,
and that is why the present administration
of the city was justified in agreeing to make
the contribution of $5 million, which is the
equivalent of between $3 and $4 per capita,
over and above what the citizens there pay
in taxes. The city of Montreal will derive
27511-5-34

a direct benefit from all the moneys that will
come in through the visitors to the city at
that time. That will be an immediate benefit
for the citizens of Montreal, and that is why
they are justified in spending a little more
money. Also, the city of Montreal will be
the recipient of permanent works such as
roads, for which the province will pay. The
citizens of the province of Quebec, the citizens of Ste. Etienne de l'Epouvante, will pay
for those roads going into Montreal. That
is the reason why I believe the present city
administration was justified in authorizing
this contribution of $5 million.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I think
this amendment is out of order because it
has to do with expenditures of money, and
as far as clause 19 is concerned it is a money
bill and we should not touch it.
The second reason is that on its merits
the amendment should not stand, for this
legislation is the result of an agreement
among three parties who come to you seeking
only ratification of it. Time is short; we only
have 4j years to organize an exhibition which
should really take seven years. Therefore, I
think we should proceed immediately and not
send it back to the other place and run the
risk of having the amendment rejected. In
that case we would have to wait until January 21, at the earliest, to pass the bill. We
would be losing one more month, and possibly such delay would impair the prospect
of having this exhibition ready on time.
Therefore, I vigorously object to this amendment.
(Translation):
Hon. Sarto Fournier: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to speak very long. I listened
with great interest to the warm-hearted remarks of honourable Senator Drouin. He
seems to have based his argument on the
fact that I am coming at the very last
minute with my amendment, but I would
simply ask Honourable Mr. Drouin, who is
an expert on Parliamentary procedure, after
having occupied the Chair for a few years and
presided with great ability and tact over
the procedure and debates of the Senate, to
tell me at what time I could have submitted
my amendment before tonight.
(Text):
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
am not going to delay passage of this bill,
but I am rather amazed that an amendment
should be brought in at this time, when we
consider there has been so much consultation among the federal Government, the
provincial Government and the city of Montreal, with the lawyers from these different
bodies going over every item of the bill.

SENATE
I am advised that the federal Government
bas considered this matter and, as was mentioned by the honourable senator who introduced the bill here, there was unanimous
consent by all parties in the House of Commons. I am also advised that the Government will not accept the amendment proposed
by Senator Fournier. It could not be accepted
without further consultation with the city
of Montreal, the province of Quebec and the
other parties. If the bill does not pass third
reading here tonight it will certainly be held
up until after the recess and probably longer,
and without obtaining the result for which
the honourable senator has introduced his
amendment.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by
Honourable Senator Fournier (De Lanaudière),
seconded by Honourable Senator Power, that
this bill be not read a third time but that
it be amended as follows:
Page 8, line 47, in the second paragraph of item 19, immediately after the
word "council," insert "and the executive
committee of the city of Montreal".
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure
to adopt this motion?
Some Hon. Members: No.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Decidedly not.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those in favour of
the motion will please say "Content".
Some Hon. Members: Content.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those who oppose
the motion will please say "Non-content".
Some Hon. Senators: Non-content.
The Hon. the Speaker: In my opinion the
non-contents have it. I declare the motion
lost.
When shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Drouin: I move, with leave of
the Senate, that the bill be read the third
time immediately.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

we might have a little time to rest, but this

SENATE
was not to be. We attended an interview with
Brigadier Dare, who briefed us on what was
taking place in his brigade.
Brigadier Dare is a well-informed, competent and inspiring officer. I cannot speak too
highly of his efficiency and of the confidence
which he commands in all ranks. He is an
outstanding Canadian and a fine representative of Canada with the NATO forces.
At the briefing session the brigadier explained the part that the brigade took in the
NATO defence force in Europe, and he told
us about the equipment, some of which is
first-class and some of which is in need of
early replacement. He also told us of the
training which the brigade receives.
Most of the equipment is for use in conventional warfare, if it should take place. I
recall only one piece of equipment which
might be said of the type which would
require a nuclear warhead, and that is the
"Honest John". Apart from training on that
piece of equipment, the other training is in
connection with the class of equipment with
which those of us who served in either the
First or Second World Wars were accustomed,
but of a much more modern type.
There was no ammunition with nuclear
warheads and nothing was said as to whether
or not ammunition might arrive. We not
only saw the "Honest John" but we familiarized ourselves with the other equipment; and
we found the officers and the men were well
trained and very efficient. I am sure that anyone visiting Europe, whether from Canada
or another country, would be proud of our
personnel there.
As darkness fell we returned to the Officers'
Club and shortly thereafter we attended a
reception at which men and women representing various groups located in the army
centre were present. We had an opportunity
to converse with them and tell them about
Canada; they in turn told us about Germany
and of the conditions under which they were
living. I was pleased to learn that there were
very few complaints, for our people in Germany appear to be happy in both their home
life and their military life.
The evenings were happy ones. One evening Senator Connolly, on behalf of our
delegation, presented to the brigadier and
the mess an oil painting of a typical Canadian autumn scene, done by Commander
Anthony Law, R.C.N., of Halifax. We thought
it appropriate that a painting should be presented by a Canadian artist. This idea, which
was accepted by all of the delegation, was
first thought of by Senator Connolly, who
told us that Commander Law is a Canadian
artist of considerable prestige. It is unnecessary for me to say that the brigadier and
members of the mess were pleased to have

presented to them a painting of this type.
After the presentation it was my privilege
to thank the brigadier and the officers for the
evening which they had provided for us.
It was near midnight by this time, but
many of us felt that we should take the
opportunity of visiting the town of Soest at
which was being celebrated the 535th annual
fair. This is a fair to which people come from
all around and bring their wares. There are
amusement rides such as ferris wheels, and
one thing and another. It is interesting to
note that this fair has been going on for 535
years without a break. On this particular
evening we had an opportunity of seeing
something of the German town of Soest and
of meeting the members of the Canadian
brigade as they mingled with the German
people. You can imagine how interesting it
was for us to see our Canadian boys associating with the Germans and to observe how
well they got along together. Although it was
after midnight, there were no disputes and
everything was orderly. The German people
seemed happy to have the Canadian soldiers
with them and the Canadian soldiers were
obviously happy to be with them. I can assure
you that we were very proud of our Canadians that evening. More than that, we ourselves were proud to be Canadians.
The next morning, after having gone to
bed rather late, we were awakened at seven
o'clock and spent the morning in the various
camps where we saw the armed forces both
at work and at play. Time will not permit
me to tell of the facilities which are provided
for our men, nor of the enthusiasm with
which the members of our armed forces
entered into these activities.
We then witnessed a thrilling performance
of skill and daring by five Canadian helicopter pilots, which gave us some idea of the
part a helicopter would play in modern warfare.
About noon we left on the R.C.A.F. plane
which had taken us overseas, en route to
No. 4 Fighter Wing at Baden Sollingen. We
had lunch on the plane so immediately upon
arrival at the base we were able to attend
a briefing by Air Vice-Marshal Wray. He gave
us a warm welcome on our arrival. There is
no doubt be and his officers were glad to
see their fellow Canadians. Air Vice-Marshal
Wray is a competent, enthusiastic and inspiring officer and bas the complete confidence of
all ranks. I do not say that without having
some knowledge. Having mingled with both
the officers and the men, I know that they all
have the highest confidence in their commanding officer. We learned from the Air
Vice-Marshal that the members of the wing

JANUARY 28, 1963
are being trained for the role which Canada is
undertaking to play in NATO, being that of
a strike reconnaissance force.
The first squadron of planes of the C.F. 104
type was then being delivered and it was
thought they would be flying by the end of
the year. That was in November and, from
what I have read in the press, I understand
they are flying now.
There is no doubt that these planes are
effective only when equipped with nuclear
warheads. As the Air Vice-Marshal said, the
decision to arm them is certainly not his. It
is a political decision. Apart from the time
which it takes to learn to master one of these
airplanes, should nuclear warheads be acquired an additional six months would be
necessary to train the pilots to operate the
planes when equipped with nuclear warheads.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: That would be additional
training?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That
would be additional training after the warheads arrive.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: What authority have you
for saying that? I understand the required
additional training would be from two to
three months.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Perhaps
the honourable leader's authority is better
than mine, but I was basing my statement
that it would take an additional six months
on what I thought was the very best authority. However, whether six months or three
months, a considerable period of training
will be necessary after the warheads arrive.
After the briefing we visited the aeroagain, we were imdromes where, once
pressed with the efficiency and the esprit de
corps of all ranks. We were amazed at the
skill of the young Canadian pilots who took
off on an interceptor mission in two jet
fighters in three and a half minutes from a
cold start.
We saw something that afternoon of
family and off-duty life of the members of
the air force. We did this by visiting the
shopping centre provided for and patronized
by the families of the air force personnel, and
we also saw their homes. I would say that
all air force and army personnel seemed to
be happy and contented with their conditions and way of life in Germany.
It was really worth while to go overseas
and rather than find, complaints and grousing to find our Canadians happy in the land
in which they were serving for the time
being.
That evening there was a reception similar
to the one which we had had at the Officers'
Mess in the brigade, although at the air force

mess the ladies were not present. It was
Saturday night and no doubt they had many
responsibilities with their familles.
At this gathering, which was a very happy
one, Senator Hnatyshyn spoke eloquently and
appropriately, and Senator Pearson, on behalf
of the delegation, presented a paintingsimilar to the one which had been presented
at the brigade-to the Air Vice-Marshal,
who left no doubt that the members of the
air force headquarters were very happy indeed to know they had been remembered by
the Canadian delegation.
After the reception, which did not break
up very early, we went to the town of BadenBaden which is situated on the edge of the
Black Forest, and there we saw something
of that beautiful community which is noted
for its casino and its health baths. Here again
we observed something of the spirit of good
will which prevails between our airmen and
the residents of that part of Germany. We
returned to our quarters in the wee small
hours, only to be awakened on Sunday morning at seven o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: What time had you gone
to bed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): After
returning in the wee small hours.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Everything is relative,
you know.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): If I do
not remember the hour at which we went to
bed, I do remember we were awakened at
seven a.m., and after breakfast we attended
Divine Service, either in the Roman Catholic
chapel or in the Protestant chapel.
This was the llth of November. There we
were, in far off Germany, witnessing the
placing of wreaths and hearing the Last Post
and Reveille sounded, knowing that similar
ceremonies were taking place in our own
communities back home in Canada. After the
service we boarded the plane and were taken
to Paris.
Honourable senators, we have arranged our
report so that it will be presented in four
parts. It has been my responsibility to take
it to Paris. Senator Pearson will tell you of
the conference; Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) will tell you of the work of some of the
committees, and Senator Hnatyshyn will tell
of our very interesting trip to West Germany.
Having taken you to Paris, I now leave you
in the hands of Senator Pearson.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, I have a somewhat longer report than
that of the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), but I think it
will be of considerable interest to you.

SENATE
As Honourable Senator Macdonald has said,
we arrived in Paris. We landed at Orly airport, which is one of the largest and busiest
in Europe. Planes arrive and depart almost
continuously day and night. It is a very
modern airport and the American army has
a section of its own there. We were taken to
this American establishment and from there
we boarded an army bus which took us north
into the city of Paris. We went through the
Latin Quarter which to me, from a western
point of view, is a very sad looking place.
It is a very old part of the city with narrow
streets. It was wet and ugly when we were
there, which is the rainy time of the year.
However, in spite of all that, it is most
interesting to go through that part of Paris,
across the Seine river, skirting the Place de
la Concorde and crossing the Avenue des
Champs Élysées and up to the street named
Faubourg St. Honore to Hôtel de Castiglione.
That hotel is named after an Austrian general
who was defeated by Napoleon in the war
against Austria. Although it was not large
it was very comfortable, and I believe each
member of our delegation enjoyed himself
there.
That Sunday afternoon we had a briefing
lasting one and a half to two hours by the
Canadian Ambassador to NATO. He gave us
a most interesting report and brought us up
to date on what was happening in NATO
aff airs.
The next morning we were up early. As the
honourable leader opposite has said, "early"
was always the story over there. We had our
breakfast and a caucus before starting out
for NATO headquarters, where we arrived at
9 a.m. Most of us left the hotel with Wing
Commander Avent, who took us through to
the Paris tube at Place de la Concorde. He
said that we could have gone to la Madeleine,
which was as close, but that we would have
to transfer from that line to another to get to
Porte Dauphine, where NATO headquarters
are located.
Honourable senators, I may say in passing
that I looked over the famous old church of
la Madeleine. When I was over in Paris in
1961 this building was as black as the Ace
of Spades; it was so dirty you could hardly
tell what it was. They have since given it
a thorough cleaning and it looks "new-born";
it glistens in the sun. An interesting thing, as
I understand from talking to some people
there, is that the authorities of metropolitan
Paris have undertaken to have public buildings like la Madeleine cleaned, provided the
property owners in the district do repair work
and cleaning on their own buildings. In doing
this the property owners are charged to
employ casual labour to a large extent, and
this is one way of providing employment for

many refugees returning to France from
Algiers. I understand they are very slow; it
takes these men months to do the work inside
these buildings because they are very inexperienced and it is hard to obtain enough
experienced men to keep them moving.
As I was saying, we arrived at NATO headquarters at 9 a.m. It is on the east side of Bois
de Boulogne, at a place called Porte Dauphine,
at the foot of avenue Foch, which is a wide
boulevard with two-way traffic. Running
parallel to the main boulevard are access
streets to the buildings and houses on each
side. It is rather like a park all the way down
avenue Foch.
To get into NATO headquarters you had to
have a pass with your name on it, and this
you had to show before you could use the
elevator. Once in the large assembly hall, you
could not leave again unless you showed your
pass. So they observed fairly strict security
measures to ensure that only those who were
on duty there and NATO parliamentarians
could enter or leave.
The assembly hall covers a large area and
has an extensive horseshoe-shaped table at
which the representatives of the various
countries sit, starting at the south side with
Belgium, Canada, and so on, proceeding in
alphabetical order, the last group opposite
Belgium and Canada being the United States.
At the head table sit the Chairman and
Secretary General, and whoever is making a
speech at the time.
On the first day of our attendance we were
welcomed by the Chairman, Mr. Micara, and
then we heard an address by Acting Secretary General Colonna. I understood that
in the absence of Mr. Stikker from the
Netherlands, the Acting Secretary General
took his place. Then we heard an address
delivered by Mr. Couve de Murville, Minister
of Foreign Affairs for France, followed by
General Norstad, then the Supreme Commander of the allied forces in Europe. Others
who addressed us were Vice-Admiral Smeeten,
R.N., the Deputy Allied Supreme Commander,
and Professor Walter Hallstein, President of
the Commission of the European Economic
Community. These addresses took up the first
two days.
On the third and fourth days the members
of the parliamentary association spent their
time in committee work. There is a room
with a long table provided for each committee. Only so many representatives can sit
at it, and the others sit immediately behind.
So, if a delegation consists of two members,
one sits at the table and the other behind him.
There is simultaneous translation in English
and French. On the fifth day the reports of
the committees were given at the plenary
session in the large hall, and the closing

JANUARY 28, 1963
address was delivered by the Honourable
George Ball, representing the United States.
Honourable senators, this is a report of
the "daylight" happenings of the group of
parliamentarians that went over there. I will
not say anything further on that.
I should now like to repeat some of the
comments that were made by various speakers
we heard. We heard Mr. G. Colonna, Deputy
Secretary General of NATO, briefly review
the resolutions passed in 1961 and the action
taken with regard to them by the NATO
secretariat. In his opening remarks he said:
We need the fullest support of the
public opinion of our fifteen member
countries, and this means, first and foremost, that of the elected representatives
of our allied nations. You parliamentarians and we officials must work
hand in hand in mutual trust and in a
common conviction as to the common
goal we hope to reach.
I must say that the liaison between the
NATO parliamentarians and the secretariat
has greatly improved since I attended the
NATO Congress in London in 1959. You
might say that the secretariat is beginning
to feel the pulse of the NATO member countries, and so can work more easily with each
country. Mr. Colonna stressed the fact that
the true goal of NATO should be the development of the Atlantic Community. This word
"coxmnunity" has come into prominent use
in NATO circles. I have a feeling they are
developing something new. The objective of
the NATO nations is European unity and
Atlantic solidarity. He said that the Atlantic
Ocean should not separate but should unite
the free world.
Professor Hallstein touched on many points,
such as the Common Market, Atlantic solidarity expressed in NATO, and military
matters. He said that the community element
must dominate in any new mechanism to
be established to deal with the stresses and
strains in working out problems of the Common Market. He also spoke on the question
of independent deterrents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He said that in all
the conferences or conventions of the NATO
Alliance the basic structure in negotiations
must remain the twin and complementary
demands of responsibility and trust. These
have not always been in the forefront, since
at the beginning of NATO there was fear of
Soviet military power, but now that the NATO
nations have spread out from being strictly
a military and political body they have to
take into consideration, first, economic problems as they affect NATO and currently the

developing countries; second, technical and
scientific problems; and, third, cultural and
informational problems.
We then had a short report from Senator
Estes Kefauver of the U.S.A. I might say that
Senator Kefauver has regularly attended the
NATO meetings. He gave the conference a
report on what is known as the Second
Declaration of Atlantic Unity. This declaration was agreed to at the Paris Convention in
January 1962-I think the late Senator Wall
spoke about it when he made his reportalthough, as has been said, it has been
repeatedly presented and passed at the
annual Parliamentary Conventions since 1957.
This declaration was signed by some 242
members of the 14 NATO nations. There was
one member who abstained, I imagine.
If honourable senators will bear with me I
should like to place on record the seven
recommendations that were made at that
meeting in September about which Senator
Kefauver spoke.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The seven recommendations were as follows:
1. Establish a governmental commission
on Atlantic Unity to draw up a Charter
for an Atlantic Community suitably
organized to meet the challenge of this
era.
2. Create a permanent High Coundil
which should act in defined cases by a
weighted majority vote on matters of
common interest.
3. Develop the NATO Parliamentarians'
Conference into a consultative Atlantic
assembly which would review the work
of all Atlantic Institutions and make
recommendations to them.
I notice that in the latest issue of the magazine Freedom and Union there is an article by
a correspondent who suggested that this third
recommendation was one of the finest things
that had come out of this Eighth Conference
of NATO Parliamentarians.
4. Form a trade partnership between
the European Economic Community and
North America as a basis for an Atlantic
Economic Community, but open to all
other qualified nations of the free world.
5. Establish an Atlantic High Court of
Justice to decide specific legal controversies which might arise under Community treaties.
6. Promote measures to ensure more
effective defence including further development of a unified Atlantic command;
a common strategy both inside and outside the Atlantic area; greater standardization and a more rational production of

SENATE
arms and equipment; and defence contributions fairly shared among our respective countries.
7. Support and expand the Atlantic
Institute as an intellectual and spiritual
centre for the Atlantic Community.
These recommendations were placed before
the conference, and Senator Kefauver moved,
seconded by Lord Ogmore of the United
Kingdom, that they be adopted. They received
the unanimous approval of the conference,
and were presented to the Political Committee
of NATO Parliamentarians who, after considerable discussion, brought in their report to
the plenary session of Friday, November 16.
I shall give you a few excerpts from their
report so that you may see how this matter
was dealt with by the committee:
1. Along the accelerating march of
Europe toward Union in both economic
and political spheres there has emerged
a clear and pressing need for a parallel
pattern of union among all the Atlantic
nations. The purpose of this report is to
recommend to the Conference of NATO
Parliamentarians a deliberate exploration
of the means by which existing Atlantic
institutions may be strengthened and
caused to act more in concert, and, if
necessary, the means by which new
machinery may be created to build not
merely European unity but an Atlantic
partnership transcending both national
and natural boundaries.
2. The Atlantic Nations are now served
by a multitude of separate international
institutions-each is controlled by a separate executive council-there are no
formal and regular meetings by which
they may consult or plan or act in coordination. There is no common parliamentary body cognizant of all Atlantic
institutions by which the peoples of the
nations involved may directly be represented. Two assemblies and two only are
in fact needed, namely, a European parliament and an Atlantic Assembly. These
should evolve by the development of
existing institutions.
I think that this second declaration created
quite a stir among the NATO Parliamentarians at that time in Paris. Somebody brought
it before our committee and Lady Elliot,
Baroness of Harwood, who was our chairwoman, said that this idea of a European
parliament and an Atlantic assembly was a
great thing, and that as far as she was concerned this 1962 conference of the NATO
Parliamentarians would go down in history as
the beginning of the union of all nations of
the Atlantie.

Honourable senators will remember that
paragraph 3 of the second declaration suggested that the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference be constituted into a consultative
Atlantic assembly. In other words, the present
political committee agreed in part with the
second declaration by adopting the third
paragraph, except that they put it down in
their own words.
They then went further and made the
recommendation that the NATO Parliamentarians themselves must study and resolve the
problems involved in re-forming and strengthening their own conference. To this end it
urged that a subcommittee of the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference be appointed to
study and recommend possible solutions to
the problem of the development of the NATO
Parliamentarians' Conference into an Atlantic
assembly in accordance with Recommendation
3 of the Atlantic Convention of NATO Nations of January 1962. They further suggested that
the subcommittee should consist of eminent and experienced parliamentarians
who are able to devote sufficient time to
the consideration of this vital matter.
The Political Committee felt that various
other recommendations of the Declaration of
Paris should be adopted by the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference without delay.
With respect to the windup of the Paris
conference I should like to quote a few
excerpts from the talk given us by the Honourable George Ball of the United States.
He gave us a brief history of the development
of the Cuban situation and the conclusions of
that problem. He said it was no accident that
the first major progress towards Atlantic
unity came in the organization of military
power. The danger to which the free states
of the west were and are exposed is the
massive threat of a disciplined and aggressive communism.
He said that in the 13 years since the
founding of NATO not a single inch of
European territory has come under communist
domination. The alliance has been increased
in membership and in geographic scope. It
has kept pace with the rapid development of
sophisticated weaponry. It has steadily augmented the strength at its command. Its institutions and staff have developed in capability
and in confidence. The North Atlantic Council
has come to function as a broad consultative
organ treating, besides military questions,
political questions of the keenest importance
and the greatest variety. NATO is in the
military field what the O.E.C.D. is becoming
in the economic field.
Further in his address, the Honourable Mr.
Ball said this:

JANUARY 28, 1963
We have available over 20 tactical Air
Squadrons, we maintain in place major
stockpiles of nuclear and conventional
weapons, and a diversity of means of
delivery.
In view of the character of the United
States involvement in Europe, any notion
that we might abandon our European
commitments is destructive, chimerical
and false.
Ie went on to say:
Defence in the nuclear age is not
simple. It is expensive; it is technically
complex; it is something relatively new
in the world; and it is constantly changing because of the rapid rate of technological development. The fact that my
own countryHe was speaking of the United States of
America.
-within a very short period bas moved
from reliance on massive retaliation to
a search for the widest range of possible
retaliatory measures is no accident of
political fortune. It is an expression of
the pace and the sweep of change that
technology forces upon us.
Later on he said:
In the military field Europe shares
with the United States responsibility for
western defence as a whole. It is our
common duty to define the priority of
needs. The most urgent need today is
for the development of more effective
conventional forces for NATO to complement the superior nuclear power already
available to the Alliance. The strengthening of conventional forces is, of course,
eminently feasible. In population and
gross national product the NATO countries are more than a match for the
Soviet Union and its East European
satellites.
NATO forces already dominate the
sea; our air strength is at least equal to
that of the Soviet Bloc. We need more
strength on the ground, not only in terms
of manpower but in qualitative terms.
We need more and better equipment and
reserves of better quality and higher
mobility. The additional expense required
to make up these deficiencies can pay
back dividends.
Honourable senators, my understanding,
after listening to General Norstad, ViceAdmiral Smeeton and Honourable George
Ball, is that we need at this time a greater
build-up in conventional forces, so that we
will have as great a superiority in this field
as we already have on the seas and in our

nuclear power. There was no suggestion at
any time that there should be an expanse of
the nuclear family or that there was greater
need for a nuclear build-up.
I trust honourable senators will bear with
me as I deal with another committee, the
Military Committee. In the opening session
there was an address of welcome from the
chairman and then an address from Mr.
Couve de Murville, Minister of Foreign
Affairs in France.
This year, he pointed out, was a year of
crises and just one more of those phenomena
in the conflict between the east and the west.
He said:
It is true, in the autumn of 1962, the
crisis occurred in an area not covered
by the 1949 treaty because it is outside
the territory of any of the member
countries, including the U.S.A., which is
the country directly concerned. That is
the reason why the appropriate bodies
in our organization were not called on to
deal with the question directly, although
they were kept fully informed on what
was happening.
Then he said further:
The main point is that everyone realized immediately that, if the crisis were
to spread, they very soon would be directly concerned, owing to the extreme
difficulty of keeping a conflict of this
kind between two great powers localized
if it lasts more than a day or two.
Everyone realized simultaneously that,
if the situation were to develop along
those lines, the stage would immediately
be reached when the Alliance would
have come into play and we should all
find ourselves facing the most serious of
responsibilities.
Honourable senators, I should like to give
a few excerpts from General Norstad's remarks. In a review of the military situation
of the NATO nations, the General said NATO
was a force to be reckoned with on the land
and on the sea and in the air. He told me
personally in this connection that we could
be justly proud of our Canadian forces under
his command. He said:
In spite of our strength, we are short
in a number of ways. We are short of
combat and service support and until
these goals are met, we are subjecting
ourselves to unnecessary risks. Compared
with what bas been done, the remainder
is comparatively small but should be
attended to.

SENATE
He stressed that
Provision should be made for an adequate reserve for Allied Command
Europe. We need these reserves placed in
Europe, so our transport by plane in case
of war can be used mostly to move in
troops from overseas. These men should
only need to carry their hat and rifle, plus
a small amount of baggage.
He continued:
The military strategy in Europe altered and is keeping pace with the
changes made by the enemy. The new
concept is called forward defence or a
forward strategy. This means the NATO
forces will be in a position to cover all
territory and all people of the Alliance.
Apparently up to now we have taken a
position more or less of a defensive area,
somewhat withdrawn from the Iron Curtain.
Apparently now it is to be something different, to move up towards the Iron Curtain.
Increasing necessity and availability of
stronger forces now make the coverage mentioned desirable and possible. A mobile
defence in the forward areas is now the order
in the central region of Europe. General
Norstad stressed the fact that our great
strength is in the unity we have built. This
unity has taken 13 years to accomplish and
has been undramatic in the building, but
today is recognized as one of the outstanding
accomplishments in our desire to achieve
peace with all people. There are 15 nationsthe United States of America, Canada, Turkey
and 12 in Europe-which are united as
never before for the preservation of peace
and security.
Up to this point in the three speeches we
had heard, Mr. Couve de Murville was the
only one to mention nuclear weapons; that
was to say that the crisis in Cuba might have
led to a nuclear war but he, too, said that
when nuclear powers come up against each
other, as in Cuba, they assess their nuclear
strength on that basis. They came to certain
conclusions which for everyone were happy
conclusions.
Then we heard from Vice-Admiral R. M.
Smeeton, R.N., Deputy Allied Supreme Commander. He told us of the build-up of the
Soviet navy, with 450 submarines, 30 cruisers
and 400 destroyers. Many of the submarines
are nuclear-powered. Russia controls the
so-called Euro-Asian heartland, a tremendous
land mass. Why then this massive build-up of
submarines? Is it to cut Europe from
America? European ports on an average employ 8,000 ships to keep peacetime Europe
supplied, 4,000 in port and 4,000 on the high
seas continuously. Europe might be destroyed

by starvation. On the other hand, America
might be attacked by nuclear weapons
launched from submarines.
Our aim should be to contain Russian submarines in the area of the North Sea; to
prevent submarines from getting out or returning in the event of an all-out war.
Our naval job is to defend Europe, America
and the highway connecting them. There
should be a unified command of all allied
navies similar to the command of allied
armies. He said we must hold Gibraltar, the
Dardanelles and the Suez.
Vice-Admiral Smeeton said:
Sea power gives the Alliance an instrument whose capabilities run the
entire gamut of military requirements.
This includes the ability to engage in allout nuclear war, conventional war, and
cold war or limited war. A prerequisite
is control of the seas.
The danger from the submarine threat
is with us now. In the next decade, with
the introduction of more nuclear submarines with missile capability, the
threat will become very severe.
To me, personally, after hearing these
speakers, the whole concept of nuclear war
is shifting from heavy bombers, which are
themselves very exposed to destruction, to
that of submarines loaded with medium-range
missiles and nuclear powered, so they may
stay hidden from attack for long periods of
time. They are hard to find, can approach to
within easy striking distance of their target
and are movable to any area in the globe. Our
paramount need now is detection and control
of enemy submarines.
With the permission of honourable senators,
I should like now to place on record the
recommendations of the Military Committee.
I think these are quite apropos of the speeches
that were delivered to us prior ta the committee work. The recommendations are as
follows:
I. that the Governments concerned
should give very high priority in their
defence planning and expenditures to
provide SACEUR with the fully trained
and equipped forces, together with adequate logistic support, which have been
deemed necessary by this Supreme Allied
Commander to carry out his mission.
II. that the arms and equipment-particularly the heavy equipment-of troops
who will have to be moved considerable
distances should be stockpiled in peacetime.
III: that all member states contribute,
either by provision of support units, including air transport, or on a financial
basis, ta the mobile forces.

JANUARY 28, 1963
IV: Recognizing the vital importance
of seaborne supplies for the logistic support of NATO operations and civil requirements in Western Europe;
Aware of the heavy and increasing
scale of submarine attack to which sea
communications would be exposed;
Recommends: (1) that urgent attention
shall be given to the provision of adequate anti-submarine naval and maritime
air forces to ensure the security of these
communications; (2) that research and
development in anti-submarine warfare
shall receive high priority; (3) that
SACLANT shall be invited to report again
at the next meeting of this Conference
on the progress being made in meeting
the rapidly increasing submarine threat.
V. Convinced that Civil Defence and
Civil Defence Emergency Planning are
essential as a complement to military
defence;
Believing that these forms of defence
should be properly co-ordinated with the
military defence system;
Believing also that Civil Defence is lagging behind military defence;
Considering that it is essential that
these forms of defence should be clearly
revealed as important;
Recommends that the Civil Defence
Adviser be made directly responsible to
the Secretary General of NATO.
Honourable senators, I had the opportunity
to be the chairman of our group in the Committee on Culture and Information. This
committee, in the opinion of its Chairman,
Lady Elliot, Baroness of Harwood, is the
most important committee of all now that
we have, in a sense, passed the immediate
danger of military action. I must say I wholeheartedly agree with this point of view. With
greater emphasis on the work of this committee, it might be said that NATO bas
broken out of the strict bounds of military
necessity, and through this committee looks
to the needs of, first, its member nations,
second, the developing nations, and finally to
the communist satellite nations; that is to
say, the cultural needs of these nations.
So I say again that the Soviets, who had a
head start in developing their policy of
divide and rule by means of widespread
propaganda and infiltration throughout the
world, have, indeed, hastened the day when
nations, especially the NATO group, were
forced to build a strong co-operative union
to counter all the various ramifications of the
Soviet propaganda. They have done, and are
doing, a far greater service to the world than
the peoples of the western world ever
dreamed of because our people when under

this kind of pressure will not allow their
dreams of freedom to be dominated by a
narrow, cramped ideology. The Soviets believe in the domination of all by the state
as their form of freedom, and on the other
hand the western nations' concept of freedom
is the dignity and rights of the individual.
The Atlantic Community refuses to make the
state the supreme authority.
Under the heading of information, there is
a great need of publicity throughout the Atlantic Community of nations of the work being done by NATO through the various committees.
NATO needs the support of the public, and
it is only able to get this support if the work
of NATO is properly put before the people
of the western nations. Further, information
of the splendid work being done by NATO
nations must be carried to the developing
nations. Apparently no attempt bas been
made to inform these latter nations of work
being done by NATO because of our negative
attitude towards the use of propaganda.
I would like to append the following two
recommendations which were passed by the
Cultural and Information Committee, and
presented to the Plenary Session, which in
turn unanimously agreed to these two recommendations:
I. Affirming the desirability of creating
interest in and support for the Atlantic
idea, especially among young people;
Believing also in the desirability of
continuing the progress which has been
made through exchanges of persons supported by Fulbright fundsThat is Senator Fulbright.
-and by other means;
Requests the North Atlantic Council to
convene a conference of representatives
of appropriate authorities concerned with
education in order to consider and recommend the best means of achieving the
above objectives so as particularly ta
improve the general level of instruction
in the Atlantic area and to increase the
exchanges of teachers, student teachers,
graduate students, research scholars and
professors between NATO countries; and
further to extend these objectives to
groups of persons such as members of
trades unions who, while not possessing
these academic qualifications, have common interests likely to be able to take
advantage of these facilities.
II. Considering that it is essential to
make the aims and achievements of
western civilization better known and
understood by our own peoples as well
as those of the communist-controlled
countries, and those of the rest of the

SENATE
world, including the developing countries;
Considering that the action taken by
the governments of the members of the
Alliance should be intensified and coordinated and that NATO itself also has
its own function in this field;
Realizing that the means available, and
therefore the action taken by NATO, are
still inadequate;
Requests the North Atlantic Council,
to investigate ways of improving the
dissemination of objective information
by the West; to decide what action
properly belongs to NATO; to initiate a
review procedure to survey annually the
foreign and domestic information policies
and efforts of member governments

directed towards advancing NATO objectives, both within NATO countries and
any countries not members of NATO,
including the uncommitted and the communist countries, to the end of developing a better co-ordinated and more
comprehensive ideological thrust by the
free world;
Requests that increased money and
staff be made available to NATO by
governments to carry out tasks in this
field.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa
West), debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

NATO PARLIAMENTARIANS
EIGHTH ANNUAL

CONFERENCE AT PARIS,

FRANCE-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Macdonald (Brantford) calling
the attention of the Senate to the Eighth Annual Conference of NATO Parliamentarians
held at Paris, France, 12th November to
16th November, 1962, and in particular to
the discussions and proceedings of the conference and the participation therein of the
delegation from Canada.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I desire to resume the discussion which
took place last night with reference to the

NATO Parliamentarians' meeting held in
Paris last November. I may say that this was
the fourth occasion upon which I had the
privilege of attending a NATO meeting, either
as a delegate or as an observer on a Canadian delegation, and I consider it a high privilege and a great opportunity to have been
among the members of the Canadian Parliament who attended this and other NATO
meetings.
I think it rather important in the first
place to remind honourable senators of the
countries represented in the NATO alliance.
They are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United
States.
The NATO Parliamentarians' Conference is
somewhat different from the meetings of the
United Nations which parliamentarians from
time to time attend because all of the delegates from all of the countries are backbenchers. Ministers, even ministers of state,
and parliamentary assistants, as a rule do
not form part of the delegations.
The size of the delegation varies of course
with the country. The American and British
delegations are quite large. Canada has an
intermediate-sized delegation.
Honourable senators, before I go further
I would like to say that at this conference,
and indeed at other NATO Parliamentarians'
Conferences I have attended, there was voiced
a great respect and deep affection for one of
our colleagues who founded the NATO Parliamentarians' Association a number of years
ago. I refer to the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who is now
an honorary life president of the association.
As the honourable senator from Lumsden
(Hon. Mr. Pearson) said last night, the work
of the conference is conducted partly in
plenary session and partly in committee.
He also indicated that in the plenary sessions
all the backbencher parliamentarians from
the 15 countries have an opportunity of hearing the great experts in NATO-men like
Norstad and Hallstein and Ball from the
United States of America, and Admirai
Smeeton and others-discuss the pressing
problems of this vital Alliance which is the
shield of the west and which bas proved itself to be the shield from the point of view
of military defence.
In addition to the work done in the plenary
sessions, there are five committees and the
delegates are all assigned to various committees, usually those of their choice. They
are the Military Committee, the Political
Committee, the Economic Committee, the Cultural Committee and the Scientific and Technical Committee.

SENATE
Al these committees and the work they do
have a bearing upon the work, the problems
and, indeed, the hopes of the Alliance. I
think the work of this conference and its
committees is a magnificent opportunity for
backbencher parliamentarians to acquaint
themselves with the problems of these leading
countries of the western world with which we
are associated under this treaty. I feel it is
unique in that respect, in that the problems
considered in all the committees are current
problems, actively engaging the attention of
the leaders of each of the countries in the
Alliance. I would hope that as a result of the
kind of opportunity given to parliamentarians
at this meeting, as time goes on the public
would be better informed as to the importance
of the Alliance, that parliament itself would
be better able to deal with the problems of
the Alliance, and indeed that governments
might be influenced by the type of information which becomes available to backbencher
parliamentarians, and which in some respects
the government leaders with their preoccupation with other problems might be disposed
to neglect.
There is one other preliminary matter I
would like to mention, because I propose
to discuss rather briefly the work done by the
economic committee, on which I have sat now
on three occasions. I should draw the attention of honourable senators to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, of which Canada and all NATO
countries are members. In addition to the
NATO countries, Austria, Ireland, Spain,
Sweden and Switzerland are also members of
O.E.C.D.
The Canadian delegation was privileged to
be invited to a dinner given by the Secretary
General of O.E.C.D., Professor Thurkil Kristensen, on the Sunday night before the NATO
meetings opened. All of our delegation was
invited, as indeed was the American delegation. Professor Kristensen gave as his reason
for the gathering that he was able to reach
most of the European parliamentarians in
O.E.C.D. through the Council of Europe, which
meets regularly at Strasbourg, but the Canadian and American parliamentarians are not
often in Europe and there is no parliamentary
branch for O.E.C.D., as there is for NATO.
Professor Kristensen, who was Minister of
Finance in his own Scandinavian country before he assumed the office of Secretary General
of O.E.C.D., made a remarkable speech that
night. He discussed the essences of the
economic problems of the west. He desires,
and would dearly like to see, the establishment of a parliamentary arm for O.E.C.D.
There are some parliamentarians on this side
of the water who resist this idea. They think
there are perhaps too many parliamentary
bodies. I would hope, however, that on some

occasion there would be an opportunity to
make available to backbencher parliamentarians from all of the O.E.C.D. countries
the opportunity available to them through the
NATO Parliamentarians' Association to become familiar directly with the work of
O.E.C.D.
O.E.C.D., to me, is a very important body.
It looks primarily at the economic, political
and social problems of all western countries.
It has been defined as the economic and social
policy arm of the whole Atlantic community.
I would hope that at some time the desires of
Mr. Kristensen to have a parliamentary arm
for O.E.C.D. will be realized. I hope it will be
along the lines of the parliamentary arm
established for NATO or perhaps through
association with the Economic Committee of
the NATO parliamentarians' group. It would
be helpful to parliamentarians in all those
countries to be able to take advantage of the
work done by the staff of the O.E.C.D. and by
the people who attend the meetings. Of course
most of those who attend the meetings of
O.E.C.D. are ministers of government. It is a
ministerial committee.
I am afraid, honourable senators, I have
departed too far from my original plan of
discussion.
Let me say in the first place that the
Economic Committee of the NATO Parliamentarians' Association has as its chairman
Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York, and as
its rapporteur Anthony Kershaw, M.P. of the
British House. Its deputy chairman is Dr.
Burgbacker of the Bundestag of the West
German Republic. I would particularly like
to pay tribute to the work these men have
done over the last three or four years in the
preparation of working papers, in developing
research and in pointing up the serious economic problems which confront all countries
of the Alliance both individually and collectively. I praise the leadership these three
men have given in making available to parliamentarians who sit on that committee enough
data to be able intelligently to discuss the
problems.
Senator Javits does not do this work alone
nor, indeed, does Mr. Kershaw. Some of it
he is able to get done by universities and
research organizations. I would hope before
too long that Canada would be able to participate in the preparation of some of this material. I think it would be welcomed if it came
from Canada. As an outward-looking country,
we would have a very special approach to
these problems which do affect the entirety
of the western world.
I should next like to say that the Economie
Committee is not an executive body. Its function is to conduct studies and make recommendations.

JANUARY 29, 1963
However, Senator Javits claims, and I think
quite rightly, as one of its achievements, that
from one of the recommendations of some
years ago O.E.C.D. was established. As honourable senators know, Article II of the
NATO Treaty provides for economic co-operation between the member states. It has never
been too easy to develop economic co-operation among the NATO countries under this
article specifically. Perhaps the reason lies
in the fact that NATO is generally considered
not to be an economic organization primarily, but above ail a military organization.
NATO was established to defend first of all
northwest Europe from Russian military
aggression, and it succeeded. I think it was
realized very early, however, that without
economic co-operation, economic strength
and political strength within the Alliance, the
work of the military arm of NATO would not
succeed as it should.
As was pointed out in this chamber several
years ago, again in a debate sponsored by
the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), Mr. Khrushchev said at one
time-and perhaps this is still his policythat he will not defeat the West by military
means but that he will defeat the West
through an economic offensive. This declaration was recognized by this committee in
1961 when one of its recommendations
started this way:
Recognizing that in a nuclear age the
struggle with communism is as much
economic and political as it is military.....
These people were very clear in their minds
that it was not only military but economic
and political strength as well which were
required if the NATO idea was to succeed.
I have said that Article II is not the most
appropriate vehicle for the development of
economie strength. Economic strength came
to the West in other ways, though perhaps
not so planned. The foundation of it was,
of course, Marshall aid. Out of that grew
the Treaty of Rome and the European Common Market. The instrument which Europeans themselves forged for the building of
this economic strength was that of freer
trade, to be applied not only among the
developed countries but among the underdeveloped countries as well, and in the relationships between the developed and the
underdeveloped countries.
I think it appropriate to say, honourable
senators, that at the time of this meeting in
November two issues seemed to be of
paramount importance to those who sat on
that committee: one was the British application for entry into the Common Market;

the other was the United States Trade Expansion Act. These matters are still of great
importance. We all regret today's news, if it
is true, that the British application for membership in the Common Market at the moment
is not going to succeed, because in the view
of those who attended the NATO economic
committee and, I believe, indeed in the view
of most people who attended this parliamentary conference, British participation in
Europe is not only of paramount importance
for Britain but also for Europe itself.
The problems that Europeans faced as they
tried to develop their economic strength were
very great, and the Common Market is
really a political and economic miracle in
Europe today. As a result of the establishment of the Common Market, Europe, which
was for generations the heart of the West,
is now veritably becoming the economic hub
of the West. New patterns in international
economic development are emerging. New
economic patterns generate new patterns of
social living. This happened after the Industrial revolution. It is happening today in
Europe, and I believe all of us wish that
development well. Britain's association with
Europe, economically and politically, in one
way or another is of the greatest moment.
Now may I review quickly the six resolutions the economic committee considered at
the meeting last November. Two dealt
primarily with the developed countries. The
first had to do with east-west trade problems
and the question of trading in strategic and
non-strategic goods. The committee was
unanimous in calling for consultation, particularly in the field of trade in respect of
non-strategic goods, so that NATO countries
ensure they do not as a result of trading
with communist countries become vitally
dependent upon that branch of their trade.
Another resolution dealt with the serious
problem which confronts so many of the
countries of the Alliance, namely, the imbalance of international payments. Of course,
this is a multilateral problem: it is not just
Canada which is concerned with this, or even
the United States; all countries are concerned
with it at times. Some of these imbalances
develop from huge overseas military expenditures. This is the position in which the Americans found themselves. Others developed as
a result perhaps of excessive aid going to developing countries. The problem of trying to
adjust the imbalance, so that too much will
not go into military aid and more will go into
the work of helping the underdeveloped
countries, engaged the attention of this committee at some length.

(d) to do all such other things as are
incidental or conducive to the attainment
of the above objects.
The promoters of this corporation wish to
co-operate with a similar organization which
exists in the United States called The Good
News Broadcasting Association Incorporated,
a corporation having its head office in Lincoln, Nebraska. For more than 21 years, six
days a week, this association has brought its
religious message to the world. The Back to
the Bible broadcast was begun in 1939 by
Theodore H. Epp. In addition to its radio
programs, it supports more than 200 missionaries and publishes and disseminates
religious literature such as The Good News
Broadcaster, a 16-page monthly newspaper
for adults with a subscription list of nearly
200,000.
The promoters are asking for the usual
powers contained in legislation of this kind.
If the bill receives second reading today it is
my intention to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills, before which the promoters
will appear to give all the detailed information that the committee requires.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable senator what the position of this group
is with respect to the Board of Broadcast
Governors?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): I do not
think this corporation will have anything to
do with the Board of Broadcast Governors.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Will they not have to
have a licence?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): If this
bill is passed then this organization will be
able to function, and I suppose besides preparing literature it will broadcast its message
by buying time on the different radio stations
in Canada, as is now being done in the
United States. I do not think it will have
anything to do with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or the Board of Broadcast Governors. This bill has been on the
Order Paper for weeks, and neither the

Board of Broadcast Governors nor the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation have presented any objection to it. If these bodies do
have any objection, then surely they will
appear before the committee.
Hon. Mr. Davies: They are not going to
have a radio station of their own, I take it?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): No.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: This is a non-denominational group?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): Yes, it is
non-denominational.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Not
quite.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: What is it?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): It is nondenominational. The promoters of this corporation will be present before the committee to explain this bill.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Did I understand the
honourable senator to say that it is not their
intention to set up their own broadcasting
station?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): No, there
is no such intention.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Surely, this is a request
for the incorporation of an organization
which has an evangelical function to perform, and the methods by which that will be
performed are something the corporation will
work out. It will decide whether its message
will be broadcast by means of radio, newspapers, or other media. This is purely a
request for incorporation.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: It is not confined to radio
broadcasting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
if these people have any good news to impart I do not see why they should not have
a broadcasting station of their own so as to
let us hear it.
I would like to know the reason for clause
10 which reads:
In regard to any real property which,
by reason of its situation or otherwise,
is subject to the legislative authority of
the Parliament of Canada, a licence in
mortmain shall not be necessaryIs there any plan to acquire property in the
far north or somewhere outside the jurisdiction of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): I cannot
really answer that question offhand, but I
am sure the honourable senator will be able
to obtain that information in committee. It
is my understanding that in order to become

SENATE
a charitable organization able to accept gifts,
and so forth, there has to be incorporation
under another act, and I understand the
promoters are going to apply for that. In any
event, they will be present before the committee to give all of the necessary information.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher), bill referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
THE UNION OF SLAVIC CHURCHES OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS AND BAPTISTS OF
CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. Harry A. Willis: Honourable senators,
before I move the second reading of this
bill, may I be permitted to congratulate my
friend from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) on his brilliant, concise and lucid description of the activities of the NATO Parliamentarians Conference. Knowing his position in the party opposite, I wondered,
when he was speaking, if we could not devise
certain means by which we could send him
to Paris for good, or at least for two or three
years.
Honourable senators, I now move second
reading of Bill S-21, to incorporate The
Union of Slavic Churches of Evangelical
Christians and Baptists of Canada.
As I understand it, the Slavic Churches
originated in Russia and Poland and as their
adherents emigrated to Canada they formed
themselves into two local groups here. These
two groups became separate. Having been
established here for some time, they formed
an agreement five years ago among themselves
whereby they would apply to Parliament to
have these churches united and incorporated.
It took five years to bring this petition before
Parliament, and I am now presenting the bill
for second reading.
I do not propose to go through all the
sections or deal with the objects of the
measure. The bill is almost identical with
other bills presented by religious organizations which we had before us in the fall. If
it receives second reading today I will propose
immediately that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I see in this bill a clause similar to that
to which I called attention in the bill which
has just preceded this one. The clause refers
to real property which, by reason of its situation or otherwise, is subject to the legislative

authority of the Parliament of Canada, and
the clause states that a licence in mortmain
shall not be necessary.
I point this out in order to emphasize it and
call attention to it. I do not like it. The
mortmain acts of the various provinces are
based upon ancient traditions. There was a
time in England when actual fear arose lest
too much land should be accumulated by the
charitable and religious organizations. It was
then that the acts in mortmain were conceived and passed. We have kept them up,
and wisely so.
I suppose that property beyond the control
of the provinces at the present moment is not
very important socially. It may prove a
nuisance to take out a licence in mortmain;
it is rather annoying and unnecessary, one
may think, to do so even in the province.
However, we do not think so. I think we are
fairly unanimous that our mortmain acts
should be continued.
For example, there may be some place beyond Winnipeg, up in the north, where property may be acquired by charitable organizations, and later on those lands may become
a part of the province or a new province of
their own. Then, this corporate provision will
be in the way.
I think we should keep up the tradition
of mortmain in the far distant parts, as well
as we do in the more settled parts of the
country. I do not like this provision.
Hon. Mr. Willis: Honourable senators, I
did not frame this bill, but I have seen other
quite similar ones and they all contain that
provision. I presume the reason for it is that
these poor church organizations should not
have to pay out money, first to a legal firm
and secondly to the province for a licence in
mortmain.
I presume that is why this section appears
in all the acts I have seen relating to religious
corporations. However, that matter can be
debated in committee, with the honourable
senator's consent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
if I may speak again, may I say this clause
does not relieve the religious organizations
from taking out a licence in mortmain
within the provinces. They must obey the
laws of the province. Later on, when the
outlying districts become provinces or are
joined to existing provinces, these organizations will have to submit to the laws of their
provinces and may be required to take out a
licence in mortmain at that time.
One reason I have for calling attention to
this point relates to just what the honourable
senator has said. He says that this clause
appears in other bills. It appears in both the

JANUARY 29, 1963
bills before us today. However, it is only more
or less recently that we have been inserting
this provision in such bills, and 1 question
the wisdom. of doing so.

PETITIONS FOR PRIVATE BILLS

PRIVATE BILL
QUEBEC FIRE ASSURANCE COMPANY-REPORT
OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard, for Hon. Salter
A. Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, reported
that the committee had considered Bill S-18,
respecting Quebec Fire Assurance Company,
and had directed that the bill be renorted
with the following amendment:
Page 1: Immediately after clause 1 add
the following as clause 2:
2. The authorized capital stock of the
Company is hereby increased from two
hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars
divided into five thousand shares of fortyfive dollars each, to nine hundred
thousand dollars divided into twenty
thousand shares of forty-five dollars
each.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: With leave, I move that
this report be adopted now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Explain.

Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senators,
this amendment adds a section increasing the
capital stock from $225,000 to $900,000, and
was suggested to the company by the Superintendent of Insurance. He appeared before
the committee this morning and said that
this was his suggestion, that he would like
the company to increase its capital. I may
say that the company is the second oldest
fire insurance company in Canada and has
had a small capital for some time.
In view of the fact that the Department
of Insurance desired the amendment, that the
company is agreeable to it, and that it is
in the interest of the public, the suggestion
is that we accept it by unanimous consent
today.
Report adopted.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Now.

EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FILING

Hon. Charles L. Bishop, Chairman of the

presented the committee's second report:
Your committee recommend that the

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Bishop: With leave of the Senate,
now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The Senate deserves
some explanation as to why we should open
the lists in this way. We always hesitate to
extend the time for filing unless there is a
reason for doing so. I would like to hear what
reason there is.

SENATE
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) and I were
members of the political committee. I will not
deal with that as it is not a subject assigned
to me today.
As a prelude to telling of our trip to
Germany I would like to read the resolution
passed by the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference in regard to West Berlin. As honourable senators know, West Berlin is under the
jurisdiction of the four occupying powersthe United States of America, France, the
United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. NATO
has nothing to say about the administration
of West Berlin. However, this is the resolution passed at the NATO Parliamentarians'
Conference:
NATO pledges anew its full support
to the three powers (a) to condemn the
unnatural and illegal divisions of Berlin,
symbolized by the prison wall illegally
erected by the Soviets and their satellites;
(b) to stand firm against continuing
Soviet attempts to impair the rights and
responsibilities of the Western powers
with respect to Berlin; and
(c) to insist that the freedom and viability of West Berlin be maintained, including access by land, water and air.
As I stated previously, the delegation, even
before leaving the shores of Canada, was
invited by the West German Government
to be their guests in West Berlin for a period
of three days. We were their guests in every
respect. They flew us into Berlin, they took
care of us when we were there, and they

flew us back. They were very genial and
kind hosts. Everybody who was on that trip
found it not only interesting and educational
but very revealing.
We left Paris in the early morning of Saturday, November 17, in a plane chartered by
the West German Government, as no other
planes may fly into West Berlin but those
belonging to the occupying powers. The West
German Government had to charter the plane
from Air France.
As soon as we boarded the plane we were
met by five bright, intelligent representatives
from the Bonn Government who informed
us that they were at all times at our disposal
for any help we might need or as to anything we might wish to see or do while in
West Berlin.
We arrived in West Berlin before lunch and
proceeded to the Kempinski Hotel, which is
a very comfortable one. Berlin has many
modern hotels which compare with any to
be seen in any other country, and the fame
of the kitchen of the Kempinski is well
known. Unfortunately, we were not able to

have many meals there on account of the
numerous luncheons and banquets arranged
for us. Every day, including Saturday afternoon, there were bus trips of approximately
two and a half hours, touring West Berlin.
On the afternoon of the first day, Saturday,
November 17, we were taken on a bus tour
along the wall constructed by the Soviets and
the East German Government on August 13,
1961.
The wall is not in a straight line but
twists and turns throughout the city for a
distance of approximately 45 kilometers.
Before I visited West Berlin, I had seen
pictures of the wall and read many newspaper accounts of it; but, frankly, I was
not prepared for what I saw. To start with,
the masonry of the wall is of poor quality.
Where there are no buildings the wall would
be 15 to 17 feet high with barbed wire on top.
Where there are buildings there is a sevenfoot fence on the parking lot or building, with
barbed wire on top of that. In spite of the
grave shortage of housing in East Germany,
they saw fit to move everybody from every
building within half a block of the wall. They
also bricked up all windows and left the place
a hideous sight. Every hundred yards or so
there were two sentries, one with field glasses
and the other with a sub-machine gun. The
wall is a most brutal and barbaric demonstration of the true aims of communism.
The feeling was that all this talk about
coexistence is mere hypocrisy. The impression
I got was that when the Soviets talk of getting
along with us, one must wonder if they mean
what they say and if their intention ever bas
been to live with us on a friendly basis,
except when it suits their purposes.
The wall also gives one the impression that
it is a permanent provocation and an aggressive challenge to people who respect freedom
and the dignity of man. To me it was clear
proof that the Soviets and the so-called East
German democratic regime cannot provide
for its subjects that minimum degree of
freedom which represents the difference between a state and a concentration camp. The
building of the wall is nothing more than an
annexation of East Berlin, which was under
the supreme authority of the four occupying
powers before.
In some quarters, especially on this continent, there bas been a feeling that though
a settlement bas not been reached, its postponement has been due to the building of the
wall, and that the situation today is less
explosive than previously. You do not get that
opinion by looking at the wall, and such an
illusion is dangerous.
The wall bas not decreased tension in
Berlin but bas made the situation much more
critical. No one can or should expect that

JANUARY 30, 1963
Berliners, and the Germans as a whole, will
resign themselves to the wall. All one has to
do is walk along the wall and see written over
and over again in white chalk or white paint
on the west side of the wall the words "There
is only one Berlin".
The wall has sundered hundreds of thousands of human bonds. Families have been
divided, the father and mother on one side of
the wall and the children on the other.
Brothers and sisters have been separated.
There is no permission to visit even the immediate relatives at such functions as weddings. No permission exists even to visit in
case of death, to attend a funeral or to visit
cemeteries on the other side of the wall. I
think the wall presents a true picture of the
Soviet claim to champion the right of selfdetermination. In my opinion the only reason
that the East Germany Republic exists today
is that there are 24 Soviet divisions in East
Germany.
I shall not speak further of the wall because I would like to tell honourable senators
of more pleasant things we saw in West Berlin. Many functions were held, the first being
a reception at Charlottenburg Castle by Dr.
Gurstenmoier, President of the Bundestag.
The reception was followed by dinner. It was
truly a wonderful affair. The castle itself is a
250-year-old monumental piece of architecture dating back from the era of the Prussian
kings. It was almost completely demolished
during the war but has since been rebuilt in
its original style, so that anyone who had
seen it before would recognize it and would
not know it is a new building.
May I say in passing that although West
Berlin was almost completely devastated and
destroyed during the war, there is not a sign
today of any former destruction. It has been
completely rebuilt.
On Sunday we enjoyed a sight-seeing tour
of Berlin for two and a half hours. At noon a
luncheon was given by Mr. Lemmer, Federal
Minister of All-German Affairs. In the evening many of us attended a dinner at the
home of the Deputy of the Canadian Military
Mission and Mrs. K. B. Williamson. Some
delegates later attended the opera, which I
believe was the only opera performed that
evening because it was a Sunday.
On Monday we paid a visit to the Emergency Reception Centre for refugees. Unfortunately, it was a hasty visit; we were only
able to talk to two or three refugees and had
little time to get information. However, we
saw the refugee buildings and learned something of the system they have of screening
refugees. When a person crosses the boundary
he is detained for about a month, or whatever
length of time is considered necessary.

Before luncheon we attended a reception
given by Mr. Bach, President of the House of
Representatives. At noon a luncheon was given
by Mayor Willy Brandt, Mayor of West Berlin. Many of you met him when he visited
Ottawa in 1959 and will recall that he spoke
fairly good English at that time. Today his
English bas improved so much that if you
heard him speak in Canada or the United
States you would have difficulty knowing
that he was not a native of one of these countries. The speech he delivered at this luncheon was most gracious. He made it plain
that the only reason West Berlin exists today,
and has any freedom, is because of the friends
it bas in the West.
Honourable senators, I would like to speak
briefly about the city of West Berlin. It covers an area of 185 square miles. We toured
the city in brand new comfortable glasscovered buses. A guide explained the various
buildings as we passed them, and we stopped
to look at some of them.
Greater Berlin covers a distance of about
23J miles from north to south and is 28 miles
from east to west. Our guide told us that
three of Germany's largest cities, such as
Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich, could be
put into the area that constitutes Greater
Berlin.
To give some idea of how the area of Berlin
is divided by percentage, agriculture occupies
20.7 per cent; parks, 6.7 per cent; rivers and
lakes, 6.3 per cent; and woods and forests,
17 per cent. The rest of the city consists of
33.5 per cent of built-up area; streets and
paths, 11.1 per cent; railways and airfields,
4.7 per cent.
In spite of the critical situation that exists
as far as West Berlin is concerned, you meet
people all over the city, walking, strolling,
working and laughing. The first thing that
strikes one is the industry of the people.
Everybody seems to be working, except on
a Sunday. Everybody seems to be busy all
the time. The shops are among the most
modern you can find anywhere; they are
beautiful and are stocked with first-grade
goods. When visiting shops in the main area
surrounding our hotel I found no difficulty in
conversing with anyone, since so many of the
people spoke English.
Among the many interesting things we saw
was the Olympic Stadium which has a seating capacity of 100,000 persons, and of which
I am sure most of you have heard a great
deal.
It has not been mentioned before, but one
of the most pleasant events was on our
return trip when we stayed overnight in
Ireland, not leaving there until three o'clock
the following day. Fortunately, I got up
early in the morning and found that the

SENATE
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly) had got there before us. He
had not gone to West Berlin, but had gone on
to Ireland. He had rented a small car and
was extremely kind in taking Senator Pearson and me on a tour of part of Ireland, such
as Limerick and the beautiful surrounding
Irish countryside. He was a pretty useful
guide and seemed to know a good deal about
Ireland. That was one of the most enjoyable
parts of the trip as far as I was concerned.
Honourable senators, I wish to repeat that
I feel the delegation served the purpose for
which it was sent, and that all the delegates
worked hard. There has been some talk elsewhere about night life in Paris. I know that
Senator Macdonald (Brantford) knew nothing about any night life. I have known Senator Pearson for a long time and I know that
he goes to bed before midnight, and I know
that Senator Connolly of Ottawa West is
fairly well behaved everywhere he goes.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, my purpose in rising is to say how
pleased I am with the reports we have received from the delegates who were sent to
represent us at the NATO Parliamentarians'
Conference. In fact, I am quite proud of them,
for we sent three distinguished lawyer senators and one ambassador of agriculture. I feel
they did a good job and represented us as we
would wish them to. I challenge any newspaper writer or, for that matter, any person to
say that the Canadian Senate was not well
represented at this meeting of NATO parliamentarians.
While I am on my feet, I want to pay a brief
tribute to the honourable Senator Robertson,
who was the founder of the NATO Parliamentary Association, as was stated briefly yesterday by Senator John Connolly.
I remember-I think it was in the year
1955-when Senator Robertson told me that he
was not satisfied with the way things were
going in NATO, that too much attention was
being paid to the military side of the NATO
Treaty and he thought that something should
be done to implement Article Il of the treaty.
He felt that although the military part was
very necessary the other was also very important.
After talking it over with me and quite a
number of other honourable senators, Senator
Robertson went to work on it. He even made
one or two trips to Europe and spent several
months working on this project. His idea was
to set up an organization or an association
similar to the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association, which had been very successful
in solving the difficulties that arose from
time to time in the Commonwealth. He
thought that if he could set up a similar
organization of NATO parliamentarians it

would be a good thing, and he especially
stressed the implementation of Article II of
the treaty.
After Senator Robertson had contacted most
of the NATO countries, we set out for Paris.
All that he was able to do was to arrange for
transportation-we paid all our own expenses. We landed in Paris and immediately got
down to work, and no one was more pleased
than I when Senator Robertson was made first
president of the NATO Parliamentary Association. I well remember his speech of acceptance and how proud I was of what he said
and the way he conducted himself in his
speech and throughout the whole proceedings.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He was kind enough to
ask our present Prime Minister, Mr. John
Diefenbaker, to address the meeting on behalf of the Canadian delegation. Everything
went well.
We spent a week in Paris, and we organized
everything fully and got the association
underway. It was not until after the organization was completed that we had any fun.
After spending a week in Paris at our own
expense, as I said, we went to Metz and inspected the Maginot Line; from there we
went to Soest, where our army forces are
stationed, and there spent several very profitable days. We inspected the schools provided
for the children of our soldiers stationed there
and we visited all the surrounding country,
and I came to the same conclusion as did
the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, Brantford), that our soldiers
were well received and very popular.
We then boarded a plane and went to
Baden-Baden where we spent several days
inspecting our Air Force. On the last day
before we left Germany we made a trip
to the Black Forest, a very interesting place.
We learned that whenever one tree is cut
down two are planted in its place.
Then, on the last evening we went to the
great casino. I was told that except for
Monte Carlo it is the biggest one in Europe.
There we had a little fun, and some of the
boys did a bit of gambling.
Hon. Mr. Drouin: Good clean fun.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The next morning we
left by air for home by way of the Azores,
stopping there one night where we were
entertained by the American Air Force which
had a station there at that time.
Honourable senators, you may wonder
why I am telling you of this trip. Well, I have
an object in view.
For several years after this association was
founded I was not a delegate until its meeting in Washington. It was decided that there

JANUARY 30, 1963
should be one meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Association on this side of the water,
and I went to Washington as a delegate, along
with the late Senator Bradette. We had with
us Senator Mark Drouin, then Speaker of the
Senate, Senator Robertson, the honorary life
president of the association, and Senator John
Connolly and several others. We had a powerfui delegation, I thought. However, 1 found
out that I should flot have been a member of
it at ail because from 1955 Up until that time
1 had flot been in touch with the affairs of the
association, any more than being a member of
it, and it took me the whole week that I
was in Washington to brush Up on what had
happened from 1955 until that tirne. The
resuit was that I was flot nearly as good a
delegate as I might have been.
That leads me to express the view that
the nucleus of delegations which we send
in the future should be composed of delegates who have had experience and who
have attended previous meetings. For example, I think that Senator John Connolly
and Senator Pearson should be appointed to
go to the next meeting of the association
whenever one is held, and they could take
some new blood with them with the idea of
building a good strong delegation.
In this connection I would like to mention
the Interparliamentary Union. That organization holds a convention every year, and
recently held one in Brazil. Our delegates
from the Senate were Senator Thorvaldson,
in charge of the delegation, Senator Dessureault, Senator Beaubien (Provencher) and
Senator Méthot.
We sent to that meeting in Brazil experienced delegates who previously had been to
Japan and other places and who knew exactly what they were there for and what they
were doing. Therefore, it is my suggestion
that in the future we should keep such matters in mind and make sure when we send
delegates to meetings of this kind that we
send experienced delegates. By ail means,
let us send some new blood along too, but
let us keep in mmnd the need for sending a
nucleus of experienced delegates so that the
Parliament of Canada will be represented
at these meetings in the proper manner.
Hon. David A. Croil: Honourable senators,
I enjoyed lîstening to the speech made by
Senator Hnatyshyn and to what Senator
Aseltine has just said, but I cannot resist saying how thoroughly 1 disagree with the suggestion made by Senator Aseltine as to future
delegations. This business of putting the
Senate into the hands of a small clique who
decide that thîs or that person shall be a
delegate and that he has a life tenancy in it
is, 1 think, a great mistake.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I think the only life tenancy
we have is within the Senate, and even that
is flot too certain. I do not know o! any
superior beings in the Senate. I believe we
are ahl about equal so far as capabîlities are
concerned, and there is no magic about
attending NATO meetings or taking a trip to
Brazil.
I think the best policy the Senate can follow
is neyer to send the same persons twice. Pass
these assignments around, and give anyone
who is interested a chance to, go. I arn not
looking for a job; you could flot send me on
one of these trips if you tried. The best I can
do is to attend the United Nations, because
there I arn not too f ar from home and can
get back and practise law.
I did not intend to speak on this subi ect but
I have heard the matter mentioned frequently,
and now that it has been raised agamn today I
cannot pass up the opportunity to speak on it.
I would like the Leader of the Govemnment
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) and the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford)
at least to remember what I say, that it is not
the person who has your ear who should go
on these trips, but pass the assignments
around so that everyone can obtain background knowledge. By so doing there would
be less talk among the senators as to who
have the "in" and who have not.
I believe that the delegation which recently
represented Canada was a good one; but I
think they have had it for the time being, and
that when a NATO Parliamentarians' Conference cornes around the next time there
ought to be a new delegation. Also, the
delegations that went to Brazil and Nigeria
each made a fine report. I heard the report
delivered by the honourable Senator Smith
(Kamloops), and it was one of the best I have
ever heard. It was an înteresting report, and
I know him well enough to appreciate that
what he told us was absolutely true. He really
takes these duties seriously and does an
excellent job. Yet the delegation was darmed
up and down the country by people who
accompanied the delegation, and he had to
bear part of the brunt, though I arn certain
he was not responsible for any of the matters
whîch caused criticism. From our point o!
view, perhaps, the delegates should take along
a different kind of reporter, and that mîght
help too.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I cannot let this occasion pass without saying very emphatically that I could not
disagree more with Senator Croil than I do
now. I had the privilege of attending the
meetings in 1955 when the NATO Parliamentary Association was organized, and I agree

SENATE

with Senator Aseltine that we did a very good
job. When we first went there none of us
knew too much about what we were doing,
and we all learned a great deal. You might
be interested to know that because I felt I
had not known much about NATO before
being a delegate at the meeting, I did study
it quite thoroughly and later made many
speeches in my own province about the organization. Most of those I addressed knew
less than I about it, and they were interested
to learn of the organization and its work. I
think we could do more of this educational
work.
I might mention, too, that I took a number
of photographs, and were any honourable
senators interested I would be only too glad
to put on a slide show. For instance, at the
places Senator Aseltine told you we visited,
where our NATO forces were stationed, I
obtained some excellent pictures which might
interest you.
The reason I feel strongly on this subject
right now is because of my recent visit to the
United Nations. As many of you know, I was
there last fall as a parliamentary observer
with the Canadian delegation. I found there
many people who had been attending the
United Nations representing their own countries for many years, and they are highly regarded and well known. They knew how to
go about doing things and how to accomplish
what they had to do, as representatives of
their countries, if they wanted to be successful.
I think we should certainly send as many
individual delegates as we can, but I also feel
that we should have a nucleus of well-trained
persons who can be our representatives on
delegations to organizations such as the
United Nations, the Interparliamentary Association, the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference, and the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
do not rise to enter into a controversy. I may
say, I agree with everyone who has spoken.
I do agree particularly with what Senator
Aseltine said about our delegation: I do not
think we could possibly have been represented
by a finer group than that which represented
the Senate.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Speaking personally, I
have enjoyed every word of the remarks each
delegate has made. They have been interesting and, indeed, most instructive. As long as
we can send delegations of that calibre,
whether they are experienced or inexperienced, I am sure that we shall be very well
represented.
Debate concluded.

Hon. Lionel Choquetie moved the second

reading of Bill S-23 respecting Canada Permanent Toronto General Trust Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I could be
very brief in dealing with this bill; however, I want to give the background as to
the name of the company and speak about the
bill that was passed in the Senate in 1961.
The sole purpose of this bill is to change
the name in English as well as in French and
to make it a little shorter, because it is now
cumbersome in either language.
The Canada Permanent Toronto General
Trust Company is the corporate entity resulting from the amalgamation on December 1,
1961 of The Canada Permanent Trust Company and The Toronto General Trusts Corporation, pursuant to an act of the Parliament of Canada, chapter 77 of the Statutes
of Canada, 1960-61. Under that act the company's name in French is, Compagnie de

Fiducie Canada Permanent Toronto General.
The Canada Permanent Trust Company was

originally incorporated by special act of the
Parliament of Canada in 1913, Statutes of
Canada, 1913, chapter 87. The Toronto General
Trusts Corporation was incorporated by
special acts of the Province of Ontario in
1872.
The authorized capital stock of the company is $10,000,000, of which $4,616,000 has
been issued and fully paid up. As at December
31, 1962, the company's total capital and guaranteed assets amounted to $106,456,147, and
in addition the company held, under administration in estates, trusts and agencies, assets
amounting to $860,355,602. The total assets
were $966,811,749.
The company is a subsidiary of Canada
Permanent Mortgage Corporation, which was
incorporated under The Building Societies
Act of Upper Canada in 1855, and was reincorporated by special act of the Parliament
of Canada in 1899.
The head office of the trust company is

located at Toronto, Ontario. Twenty-five
branch offices are maintained across Canada:
in

Halifax, Nova Scotia;

Saint John, New

Brunswick; Montreal, Quebec; Ottawa, Port
Hope, Sault Ste. Marie, Hamilton, Brantford,
Kitchener, Woodstock, London, Windsor and
Toronto, in Ontario; Winnipeg, Manitoba;
Regina and Saskatoon in Saskatchewan; Calgary and Edmonton, in Alberta; and Vancouver and Victoria, in British Columbia.

SENATE

He said: Honourable senators, perhaps I
should be a little hesitant, in the light of the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll), in advising the Senate that this is another bill to
provide a company with a French name.
While I do not entirely agree with the honourable senator's remarks, I would suggest
that until we have some other method of
providing for the name of a company in the
French language the only procedure available is to ask for the passage of a bill.
So much has been said on the principle of
this that I do not need to add anything more.
However, I do think that it is a move in the
right direction, and I hope to see companies
more and more using French names in connection with their business with French
clients or customers, or wherever they think
it is desirable to use French, and using the
English name when they are dealing with
clients or customers who speak the English
language.
Honourable senators, I would like to say
a few words about this particular company.
The Confederation Life Association is one of
our larger and most highly respected companies in the Canadian insurance industry.
It is the fourth oldest life insurance company
in Canada, and it was the first such company to be established in Toronto. It was
incorporated in 1871, some 92 years ago and
just four years after Confederation. No doubt
that great event was in the minds of the
incorporators of the company when they
were selecting the name.
The first president of the company was
Sir Francis Hincks, who was Minister of
Finance under Sir John A. Macdonald, and
one of its two original vice-presidents was
Sir William P. Howland, one of the Fathers
of Confederation.
The founder of the company was Mr. John
Kay Macdonald, and he had a remarkable
record of service with the company. His span
of service as managing director and as president ran over 57 years. His son, Mr. Charles
S. Macdonald, was subsequently the president of the company, and at the present time
the president is Mr. John K. Macdonald, the
son of Mr. Charles S. Macdonald and a grandson of the founder of the company. From
this it can be seen, and as we have ourselves
discovered in this chamber, the Macdonalds
are a very hardy and talented clan.
I remember Mr. John Kay Macdonald, and
I am sure there are other members of this
chamber who do also, as a very distinguished
citizen of Toronto.
The company is now completing its conversion to a mutual company. It commenced
this plan of conversion some five years ago
after amendments were made by Parliament

to the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act. At the present time it bas acquired over 97 per cent of its stock from
previous shareholders, and full conversion
will be completed by the end of June of this
year. In the meantime, the 15 members of the
board of directors are all policy holders.
The company does business throughout Canada, as well as elsewhere outside of Canada,
and has been doing business in the province
of Quebec since its incorporation.
Over 23 per cent of its entire business is
transacted in Quebec, and more than 21 per
cent of its policies have been issued in the
French language. In those policies the company has used the name "Confederation Life
Association". My French-speaking colleagues
who know the language so much better than
I do will understand the reason for it, but I
will tell you that the French name given by
the translator in translating the original act of
incorporation of 1871 into the French
language is Association d'Assurance sur la
vie dite de la Confederation. There are 10
words in that name, and consequently it has
not been used. This bill gives it a more appropriate and usable name, and I hope my
colleagues will find it linguistically correct.
The name in French is La Confédération,
Compagnie d'Assurance-Vie.
If this house approves the second reading,
I shall then move that the bill be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.

INTERNAL ECONOMY
REPORT

OF

COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the fourth report of the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien, Chairman of the
committee, moved that the report be adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the adoption of this report I would like to
say a few words in explanation.
Since the coming into force of the new
Civil Service Act of 1961 our staff is under
the jurisdiction of the Senate, and not under
the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission. Therefore, when the Government
granted salary increases to certain classifications of civil servants our employees in the
same classifications did not get the increase
automatically. Your committee has felt that
we should recommend that our employees in

JANUARY 30, 1963
each of those classifications be given increases corresponding to those granted to
civil servants under the jurisdiction of the
commission.
In the other place, the Internal Economy
Committee recommended exactly the same
increases that have been granted in other
branches of the service.
Honourable senators will notice that there
are two groups mentioned here, and that in
group A the effective date is October 1,
1961, while in group B the effective date is
April 1, 1962. The reason for having two
effective dates is that in group B there was
an adjustment upward since the last general
increase in 1960.
Honourable senators, some members of our
staff are not covered by these increases. The
reason we are not recommending any increase
now is that the Civil Service Commission has
not yet recommended increases for their
classification. If increases are recommended
in the case of those groups, we will submit
another report.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Can the chairman of the committee tell the house just
what groups are not included in this increase?
As I understand it, those receiving the lowest
rates of salary as employees of the Senate
and in similar occupations in the Civil Service
are not getting the increase, but that the
intention is to give them an increase. It
appears that those who are now getting substantial salaries are having them increased.
I do not object to that. I want to make it
perfectly clear that I agree with the increases.
However, those salaries are being increased
in one instance retroactively to October 1,
1961 and in the other instance to April 1,
1962. What about the lower-paid group, which
includes the char staff and the messenger
service, and others in grade 1? Can the
chairman of the committee say why they are
not included now or whether they will be
included in the near future?
It strikes me that if any of our employees
need an increase, those in the lower-paid
group need it at least as much as those in
the higher-paid group. I do not think we
should just let the matter drop by giving
this increase to higher-paid groups, which
is proper, without seeing that an increase
is given also to the lower-paid group.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford): Honourable
senators, first of all, the increases which have
already been granted have been granted on
what is called a cyclical basis; in other words,
they deal with one group, then another, and
another, and so on. It may be that the group
of people not affected by this increase is a
group which has not been dealt with yet.
27511-5-36k

I have here a list of the people who have
not been recommended for an increase up to
now. On looking at it, I would think they
are being fairly well paid for the work they
are doing. Naturally, I cannot speak for my
committee, but I do not know whether or
not an increase will be recommended later.
However, the question will be taken up and
dealt with, if, as and when people in the
same classification in the Civil Service are
granted an increase.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if the categories set forth in this
report are not the subject exclusively of the
consideration of the Internal Economy Committee of the Senate? This report contains
the recommendations of the Internal Economy
Committee of the Senate in these categories?
Han. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford): These are
the recommendations.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Then the other unclassified group is subject to Civil Service Commission recommendations. Is that not so?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford): No. All members of our staff are now under the Senate.
I suppose we could recommend anything we
wish. I do not think we have to be guided by
what the Civil Service does. The House of
Commons has passed a similar recommendation and we are doing pretty well what they
are doing.
Hon. David A. Croll: A point arises from
what was said a moment ago. I understood
the honourable senator to say that we are
not dealing with those other classes because
the Civil Service Commission has not dealt
with similar classes in the Civil Service.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford): I did not say
we would have dealt with them if the others:
had been granted. I say that we have not dealt
with them and are not going to deal with
them, unless the House of Commons does
something and we feel we should follow suit.
So far we have not dealt with them.
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is my point. I did not
know that our staff was not under the Civil
Service Commission. I always thought they
were. I thought all staffs were under the Civil
Service Commission.
There are certain advantages in being under
the Civil Service, and I know of no disadvantages. Now I hear that our staff is not
under it, and I am just informed that this
happened a couple of years ago. How it got
by without debate in this house is beyond me,
but apparently it did. I understand from what
the honourable senator has said that if the
Civil Service Commission recommends an increase, in all probability we will pass it and
give a similar increase to our staff on the

SENATE
same level. That is all right, but at the
moment some of these people are not getting
an increase and they have not the advantages
which civil servants have generally. They are
at some disadvantage. I cannot understand at
the moment how we permitted ourselves to
get into this position, and I do not see why
we should be in it. I think our staff should be
under the Civil Service Commission so that
they can have all the advantages and none of
the disadvantages. To have none of the
advantages is a great mistake.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: I wish to express
my pleasure at the increases that have been
given to our civil servants. We have a good
civil service, composed of conscientious, careful, polite employees-a reasonable body of
persons. I am very happy indeed that the
Internal Economy Committee has been able
to recommend these increases, and I congratulate the committee. However, I am sorely
disappointed that some employees have been
left out of our largess.

Kingdom; and we thought it better to let
them get off their chests what they had to say,
so that they might feel better.
The voice of Canada was heard very well
by everyone. There was clear and constructive
talk and all the recommendations were sound;
whereas, some others were just talking in
order to get their speeches on record.
Honourable senators, I was proud to be
associated with the Canadian delegation. I
must admit, however, that I knew little of
where I was going and what was expected
of me. I should like to take this opportunity
to thank those responsible for making the
trip possible. It came to me as a surprise, and
I thank them sincerely.
I left Canada by myself five days behind
the group. One of the reasons was that I had
to get four shots. These are not exactly the
shots which my good friend Senator Burchill
might like to see me get-they were medical
shots, needles. The delegation left on Wednesday and I left on the following Monday, with
my four shots and a box of pills. I departed
from Ottawa at 4 o'clock and arrived in Scotland at 2 o'clock in the morning by my watch
-it was then 6.15 in the morning in Scotland
and the sun was just about rising. I was to
fly from Prestwick to London at 9 a.m. but,
as one might expect, I was fogbound in Scotland until Il a.m. On arrival in London
there was more fog, and the plane had to
circle above the clouds for an hour and a
half, among 17 other aircraft flying at various
altitudes.
The pilot of our plane opened the connecting door so that we could hear plainly his
conversation with the control tower, and this
helped us to pass the time. This flight was
on a 707 B.O.A.C. jet and I had a first-class
ticket. Honourable senators who know my
weakness can readily believe that I enjoyed
the wonderful food.
Since my plane did not arrive in London
until one o'clock, my connecting plane had
gone and therefore I was transferred to one
of the motels in the airport and booked for
a flight the next morning at 9 o'clock.
The next morning there was still fog. I
was taken to the airport by car, and we left
finally at 2.30 for Lagos aboard another
B.O.A.C. jet. The flight from London to Lagos
took five or six hours. We flew over Paris,
Barcelona, Algiers and then over the Sahara
Desert for two and a half hours. Our first
landing was at Kano, an old trading post
halfway between south and north Africa. It
is a very old city with a history that goes back
to 300 B.C. The walls around it date back
to 1200. When we arrived the temperature was

97 degrees, and it was just getting dark. On
getting out of the plane we were struck by
the tremendous heat.
Honourable senators, it was there that I
had my first sight of what one might call
the primitive life in Africa. For some 20
minutes before landing we were losing altitude
and could clearly see the bush. There were
little groups of 10 or 12 huts made out of clay
and covered with palm leaves or straw, which
would take in areas of about 200 feet. These
10 or 12 huts were in a U-form, with a
campfire in the middle. They were fenced
around by straw or even by walls of clay.
There were many such groups of huts in
small areas, giving an impression of the very
primitive way of life there. I may tell a little
later on what takes place in some of those
huts, as we had an opportunity to visit a
few.
We left Kano an hour later and arrived at
our destination, Lagos, at 8.30. The temperature was 87 degrees. It was a hot reception on account of the weather, the customs
clearance, the newspapermen and the officials.
At the hotel:I met the remainder of the group
and had a chance to talk to Senator Smith
again for a few minutes.
The following morning we were divided
into three groups, Senator Smith being in a
different group. The 135 delegates were flown,
in three groups, each to one of the three
provinces of the Federation of Nigeria.
My particular group was flown in a DC-3
to Enugu, in the eastern part of Nigeria. Part
of the trip was over the Niger River, and
as we were not flying very high, possibly
4,000 feet, we could see thousands of huts
built in the swamps. We wondered how people could live in such dank and swampy
places. On arrival in the provincial capital
Enugu, we found that, in spite of the primitive
surroundings, there was a lot of activity.
There were many white people, mostly from
the United Kingdom, who had built many
industries there. There were modern legislative buildings, schools and hospitals, many
of which were constructed under the Colombo Plan. We stayed in a catering house, of
which there is one in each province and I
thought it very good, though others did not
think it was exactly suitable. One expects
such things in a primitive country and I was
quite happy.
This little motel was not air conditioned,
and we had to sleep in screened beds. I must
say that it was uncomfortably hot without
any cool air coming in. Most of the windows
of such buildings are without glass. During
the night all kinds of pests circled around
continuously, perhaps out of curiosity because
we were white people.

JANUARY 31, 1963
A day or so later we took our longest trip
by car, driving some 200 miles. This was
the first time we glimpsed sights of primitive
life along the road. We were not too happy
with the drive since we were speeded along
sometimes at 75 or 80 miles an hour on very
narrow roads or what one might call oneway streets. The roads were very crooked,
and there was oil on the surface of them.
There were not many hills but there were
thousands and thousands of people walking
on either side of the roads. Most of them were
women and children going to market, some
carrying very heavy loads of wood, fruit,
bananas, or other products. Among them
were many women carrying babies on their
backs. We saw people who were well dressed,
others not so well dressed, and still others
who were scarcely clad at all. The lack of
clothing on many of the people causes one
surprise at first, but it does not take long to
become accustomed to it. Indeed, we felt
deeply sympathetic towards them, for we
knew it was on account of poverty-they just
had nothing much to put on.
Along the road were many villages of huts,
and the bush was thick. The wild animals
have been chased out by the building of
roads. The United Kingdom built roads from
one capital to another, the distance between
capitals being about 250 miles, and we
covered such distances by plane. We stayed
possibly four or five days in these capitals,
driving 60 or 70 miles a day in various
directions, but always coming back to our
point of departure.
A banquet was held practically every
evening. These were mostly formal dinners
given by such notable people as premiers
and, in one case, the lieutenant governor, in
another by the chamber of commerce, and by
universities, industries, and cabinet ministers.
I believe we attended some 22 of these official
banquets. They were the kind of banquets
one would attend almost anywhere-people
gathered together, having a little social conversation beforehand, everybody carrying a
glass, which might contain anything from
pepsi-cola to champagne. There was always a
guest speaker.
I am sure you would like to know what we
did after such a function. I was a bit suspicious of the little car which was mentioned
in the debate yesterday. We had no little car.
In fact, as we had no place to go we went to
bed. During the night we could hear birds
and wild life in the bush. Some of our people
complained that it was a bit noisy.
Then a group of us went to the city of
Ibadan, which has a population of about one
million. It also is primitive, but it has a few
buildings. There we met some Canadian

teachers with whom we had supper, and they
told us about everything that we had already
seen.
We also went to Enugu, a large city
towards the north where we visited the
tobacco factory and cotton mills. In this
city an official supper was given. There was
no table, and everybody sat on the floor.
That was quite an experience. The service
was excellent and the food good. The officials
wore their native costumes, while we wore
our formal dinner jackets. I am sorry I
was unable to take a photograph of ourselves
sitting on the floor. I dare say that some of
our women would be quite happy to see
us in a position like that!
Then we went to Sokoto where I think
we had our finest reception. Sokoto is an
old city which dates back 2,000 years, and
has changed hands among tribes many times
through frequent wars and massacres. There
lived the Sultan of Sokoto. Senator Smith
bas a book about him and I hope to see it
some time. The Sultan is the chief of all
Nigeria. He is the spiritual and political
leader, and controls just about everything.
I do not think I would be divulging any
secrets if I say very freely that he has
many dozens of wives and some hundreds
of children. We were told exactly how many,
but I would not like to repeat it in case
I might be wrong.
The Sultan, or His Excellency-I think that
title is appropriate-is perhaps 64 or 65
years of age. He is a jolly, pleasant man.
He does not speak a word of English, but
speaks a couple of his own native languages.
He is very friendly, likes to talk and joke
with everybody and he also likes to read.
We arrived at the airport in Sokoto at
about four o'clock in the afternoon. All the
people there are Moslems, attired in white
robes and wearing wrapped headgear. We
were surprised to see possibly a thousand
Moslems, all about six feet tall, lined up
at the airport. We paused there for a few
minutes, and then left by car for the Sultan's
palace. The drive was approximately five
miles. It was said that there were about
50,000 people lining the sides of the road,
but I would settle for possibly 25,000 and
they were standing about ten deep. For about
the last mile before arriving at the castle
there was a beautiful cavalcade of cavalry
horses, with both riders and horses arrayed
in varied colourful robes. The horses were
not as large or heavy as the horses of this
country, but are small and skinny. The
other side of the road was fianked by
elephants, reminding one of a circus.
Finally, we reached the palace where we
were met at the door by guards, colourfully
attired. We then attended a reception. These

SENATE

people do not drink alcoholic beverages, so
we were served pepsi-cola, orangeade, or
other soft drinks. Also they do not listen
to music or watch television as we do. They
are very religious, and carry a kind of rosary,
which they use at certain hours of the day.
One sees them sitting on the sidewalk or
elsewhere, observing their religious customs.
At certain times of the day they turn to
the east and kneel or sit on the ground and
pray for perhaps forty-five minutes or an
hour, even in restaurants or hotels.
The next day we dined with the Sultan
again. He delivered quite a speech through
an interpreter. He was jolly and interspersed
his remarks with jokes. The Sultan has visited
New York, but has not yet come to Canada,
which he hopes to do some day. He has
visited the United Kingdom on many occasions. He is well educated, and I think lie
knows what is going on in this country.
We attended still another reception at the
palace the following day, before we left,
and lie came in attended by all his guards
and many of his sons, most of whom are
in politics, some as premiers of the provinces.
They just about control, as we say, the whole
show.
We also visited the museum in Sokoto, but
we were chiefly impressed by what we saw
at the palace and what was taking place there.
In addition we visited a mosque. The old mosques were made out of clay and were mud
packed. This one, however, is very modern.
The services of an American architect were
secured for its design and construction. It is
a large and costly building of marble. We
saw the throne where the Sultan will be
seated while the religious offices are recited,
for he is the spiritual leader of the country.
There are many buildings in that part of
the country that are of modern construction,
yet primitive life is prevalent.
Later we flew back to Lagos. That was
our longest trip, back to the conference,
which I believe lasted for 10 days. This is
where the report of Senator Smith comes in.
I want to say that our trip was totally different from visits to other parts of the world.
One may go to South America, France, Australia or anywhere in the world, and the
whirl of modern life is evident all around.
Our trip was completely different. One reads
in magazines and newspapers and sees picturcs of clay buildings with roofs made of
palm leaves, and natives half dressed and
people emaciated and dying on the streets,
but it is really hard to believe that these
conditions exist until one sees them. Even
in Lagos, which has a population of about a
million and a half, and which is supposed

to be quite modern, such conditions prevail.
One sees hundreds of cripples and beggars
along the sidewalk, even people dying.
Naturally you feel sorry for them; you stop
and look at them. The natives just walk right
by. However, there is nothing you can do;
you cannot pick them up because there is
no place to put them; they just do not belong
to anybody.
Travelling along these roads from place
to place we passed through many small and
very primitive villages. The houses are made
of clay and the walls are thick, with holes
cut for doors and windows. There is no
hardware or glass on the doors or windows.
As you drive along you see thousands of
people sitting along the road wherever there
is shade. You can see fifty or sixty people
sitting under trees, and that is their home.
If it starts to rain they remain there because
they have no other place to go.
As far as food is concerned there is plenty
of fruit. Travelling along through the wilderness we saw miles and miles of orange trees,
pineapples and bananas. All these fruits grow
in the bush and as a consequence the people
do not go hungry.
The inhabitants are not wealthy. We had
doctors in our delegation who told us that
these people did not get the right kind of food
and as a result they were not healthy. They
had no muscles, were very skinny and their
average life span is about 33 years.
If honourable senators remember, when I
came back I sent you copies of this report,
but it is made up in such a way that you have
to read between the lines. I regret that when
I made that report I got mixed up in my
bearings, east with west and north with south.
My geography was upside down.
In the Federation of Nigeria the people
speak about 300 different languages, and we
were told that in some places within a square
mile you could find eight different tribes
speaking eight different languages.
We found that practically all the people are
marked on the face, or on the ear, the neck,
or somewhere else. These are tribal marks.
However, we were told that in the last 10 or
15 years this custom has been done away with.
Practically all the people we met, such as
the prime minister, cabinet ministers, and
members, bore those marks, which had been
made when they were infants of seven days.
The reason of course was for identification, to
distinguish an individual, and to determine
the tribe to which lie belonged.
Senator Smith (Kamloops) and I took many
photographs and I hope that when Senator
Smith returns we can show our slides to you

REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 505 to 523, and
moved that they be taken into consideration
at the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, I would like
to place on record some figures as to the
operation of the Standing Committee on
Divorce in which I think you will be
interested.
At the close of the time for the filing of
petitions I announced that there were 902
petitions before us. Since then we have
recommended 520 petitions. That figure, of
course, includes the 323 petitions that were
heard during the last session but not passed
by the House of Commons, and which were
returned to this chamber and re-processed by
us. So, to date in this session the committee
has recommended and sent to the other place
197 bills. Four petitions have been rejected,
five have been withdrawn and 20 have been
partially heard. There are 353 petitions
presently pending and which have not been
dealt with in any respect beyond our receiving them and processing them in the usual
way.
The committee will meet for the first time
since the Christmas recess on the 18th
day of this month-perhaps. The new committee rooms in the West Block will not
likely be finished sufficiently by that time for
us to meet there, so we are planning to
continue our meetings for the present in the
place where we have met for many years.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by the Honourable Senator
Roebuck, seconded by the Honourable Senator Burchill, that reports numbered 505 to
523 both inclusive from the Standing Committee on Divorce be taken into consideration at the next sitting of the Senate.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: On division.
Motion agreed to, on division.
