Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In addressing you for the first time, I desire
to express my gratification at having been
selected by His Majeksty as his representative in
the Dominion of Canada, and to acknowledge
with profound thanks the reception whieh bas
been accorded to me by the people of this country. 1 accept it as a proof of their loyalty and
devotion to the Crown. 1 shall ceunt it a
happiness as well as a dnty to associate myseif
with you in your labours for the welf are of
Canada.
You enter upon your duties at a time of continuing and universal economie dîsturbance and
distre6s. World conditions are beyond the control of the Canadian people. But I rejoice that
their resolute adherence to policies designed for
the welfare of the nation has minimized the
adverse influence of external economic forces.
This period of trial ba8 shown the Canadian
situation to be fundamentally sound. The oversubseription of the National Service Loan manifese both the unity and patriotienm of the people,
and their supreme confidence in the financial

the Empire. We all realize, honourable senators, that Canada must have prudent protection for the industries that now exist here,
those that are coming here at present in large
numbers, and those that will come in the
future. But I sec nothing un-British in that
policy. There are a great many lines of
manufactured goods that we do not make in
this country and shall not be making for some
years to come, and therefore I think there is
no real reason why the members of the British
family should not be able to frame at the
Conference a preferential trade policy that
would be of great benefit to all parts of that
Empire to which we are so proud to belong.
We look forward with great expectations
to the Conference. I feel that it is bound
to help our grain producers on the prairies,
and I think it ought to benefit our exporters
of farm products, and all our varied industries
in this country should obtain good results
from it. I expect that the arrangements
arrived at by the Conference will help in large
measure to bring back that prosperity which
unfortunately has not been with us to the
extent that we should have liked during the
last few years.
I have been informed that party feeling
exists to a very limited extent in this House.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

I am glad to
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
learn that, because that is as it should be.
I understand that all legislation and other
matters that come before the Senate from
time to time are dealt with in the light of
what is considered to be the best interest of
the country, and when the important subjects
mentioned in the Speech frorm the Throne,
including the St. Lawrence waterways, transportation, etc., come here for consideration,
they will be handled here in a broad national
spirit.
In conclusion, honourable senators, may I
be permitted to state that I think we in
Canada are fortunate to have at the head of
our Government, in another place, a man of
such courage and ability as the Prime Minister of this country, who is guiding us through
these times of stress and strain.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

We on this
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
side of the House, at least, believe that with
the ship of state under his able control, it
will not be long until we reach that prosperity
to which we are all looking forward. I thank
you very much, honourable senators, for your
patient attention.
Hon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE (Translation): Honourable members of the Senate,
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

at the outset of the brief remarks I intend
to make in seconding this Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, may I be
permitted to thank the Government for having continued, by my appointment to the
Senate, the wholesome political tradition of
giving representation to the minorities of the
two great races that have founded this
Dominion.
The invitation given me to second this
motion is an honour intended chiefly for that
great province in which I have lived for more
than twenty years, the Province of Saskatchewan, and for the minority whom I
have the privilege of representing here. The
favour is increased by the opportunity it
affords me to make my first address to the
Senate in my native tongue. Such kind and
delicate consideration is highly appreciated
by my French-speaking fellow citizens.
At the beginning of the Speech frorn the
Throne His Excellency the Governor General
thanks His Majesty the King for having
chosen him as Viceroy in Canada. Still more,
I am sure, are the Canadian people indebted
to His Majesty for so judicious a selection.
Without attempting to cite all His Excellency's claims upon our admiration, I would
refer to one that concerns particularly those
af us who are French-speaking, namely, his
ability to speak our language so well.
Those who were privileged to witness on
Thursday last the ceremonies in connection
with the opening of this Parliament will
long remember the occasion. The dignity
that marked the proceedings was enhanced by
the charming presence of Her Excellency Lady
Bessborough, whose grace, beauty and nobility
were admired by all.
The Canadian people have on many occasions already expressed to His Excellency
their loyalty and devotion to the British
Crown. May we once more assure their Excellencies that since coming to this country
as the representatives of the Throne they
have won our lasting respect and affection.
Since last session the Grim Reaper, mercilessly at work among us, has taken from us
a veteran statesman: Sir George Foster is
no more. Voices more authoritative and more
eloquent than mine have elsewhere pronounced his eulogy. Suffice it for me to say,
as a tribute to his memory, that he was a
great Canadian.
Sickness also has done its work, necessitating a change in the Government representation in this Chamber. The honourable senator for Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby),
who in recent years, with so muich dignity and
talent, and so effectively, has performed the

FEBRUARY 8, 1932
functions of Government leader in the Senate,
is obliged to transfer the burden to younger
shoulders. My relations with the honourable
senator extend back nearly twenty years, to
the time when hie was leader of the Conservative party in Saskatchewan. In those days
I appreciated, as I do to-day, his upright
character, his ability as a learned and
experienced legîsiator, and his moderation and
broad-mindedness in political affairs. I know
that I arn speaking on your behaîf as well as
for myself in voicing the hope that hie may
be speedily restored to health.
The saine wish is extended to the honourable member of this Charnber who until
recently had charge of the arduous work of
the Department of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson). His unbounded devotion to duty almost
ruined his health, but we are glad to see him
with us again, and to note that bis condition
is improving and we are to have the benefit of
his wise counsel.
May 1 be permitted to greet the bonourable senators who have been sworn in during
the last few days, and especially the new
representative of the Government in this
Chamber (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). Ris
appointment does honour to the Government,
to the entire country and to this Chamber,
which will profit by his wide and profound
knowledge, splendid statesmanship and great
talent.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne is clear and concise. Most of the
matters, past and future, alluded to in the
Speech have been ably deait with by the
mover of the present motion, and it is unnecessary for me to repent what has been
said.
The Governor General's speech is encouraging in these dark days through which the
whole world is passing, for it gives us the
assurance that Canada is in a position of
financial stability whicb. is the envy of more
densely populated countries considered richer
than ours. This assurance is confirmed by the
success of the loans recently floated in Canada
and by the reports of our banks and life
insurance companles.
It is true that the reports of our railwayE
are less reassuring; but the railway problem
is nearing a solution, and we may await with
confidence the report of the commission that
bas been enquiring into this subjeet.
Mu-eh bas been said, and much written,
about the distress of our Western Provinces,
se severei-y tried by t.he crop f allu-res of the
set three years. In some places this distreas
is real, but the steps taken by t.he Government
harve succeeded net only in al.leviating misery,

5

but also in restoring to our people tâe confidence necessary for the continuance of their
work.
Moreover, it is but fitting that praise should
be given te the spirit of sol4iarity ehown by
the provinces ithat have had more favouraible
crops in the last three years. Everywhere
there bas been a splendid response to the
appeals for heLp, and once more the great
generosity of the Canadian people hais been
amply demonstrated.
But the West will survive, for, though it
bas been hurt, its injuries are not mortal.
Toil, economy and perseverance wilI triumph
over adversity. As the Qovernment is providing the farmers of the Prairies with sustenance, and witb seed grain, etc., ou-r fields
will, with the help of Providence, become
again, a.s in. the pa.st, the granary of the Empire and the source of great and increasing
revenue.
The forthcoming Imperial Conference, which
will take place here in July next, wili give
definite assurance of new outiets for our products; and establish more favou-rable trade relations for aIl the countries of the Empire,
and Canada in particular.
Already we can foresce Éhat smon our splendid country wiil enter once more upon days
of prosperity and progress. Tbanks to the
wisdom of the Governanent, the forcsight
shown in ismeasures, and the firmneas of its
decisions, we have placed our trade balance
on the credit side. Let us have confidence
in the future. The present century, as prediioted by one of our great Prime Miniisters,
belongs te Canada.
Juat one word on the subject of our representatives at the meeting of the League of
Nations in Geneva. Though Canada la a
young nation, she already, in the pst, has
spoken wîth authority at that assembly for
the promotion of world peace. We are sure
th-at our present representatives will prove
to be worthy successors of those who have
previously done us bonour amongst the wise
men of t.he world. Their mission is a noble
work. Let us pray that it may succeed.
(Text) Honourable mnembers of the Senate,
I should not like to conclude my first address
in this House without saying a few words to
those of you who may not understand French.
I wish to thank them for the kind and
courteous attention they have given me, even
if they were not able to f ollow everything I
said. Some twenty years ago, during my first
political campaign in Saskatchewan, I bad to

then, and it is true to-day. In trying to
master your language I had to work, and work
hard, and this I have been doing not only
because of a sense of duty to this country,
but because I wanted to get to know you
better, to understand you better, and to like
you better.
Honourable senators, I have the honour to
second the motion of my honourable friend
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is perhaps appropriate to answer
the kind remarks of His Excellency the Governor General, who spoke in such sympathetie
terns of the welcome that he had received at
the hands of the Canadian people. It was his
first visit to our Chamber, and I am sure that
I express the view of all the senators present

when I say that it is our fervent hope that His
Excellency and Her Excellency may fully enjoy
their stay among us during their term of office.
We have had a change of leadership in the
Senate, and it is my duty to take notice of it.
Like the honourable members who proposed
and seconded the Address, I desire, speaking
for my colleagues on this side of the House, to
express the hope that the honourable gentleman from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
may soon recover his health.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURIAND: He has been with
us for a number of years. We have admired
his qualities of heart and mind. Never has
there been a ripple of unpleasantness between
us in our daily contacts. We have met him
on the floor of this House, we have met him

in committee, and we have always appreciated
the kindness with which he approached us and
discussed whatever questions came before him
for consideration. My honourable friend from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) has spoken
of the honourable gentleman's career in that
province. We were aware of the part that he
had plaved in the West, and the knowledge
he had gained through living there. I am sure
his work will continue to bear fruit among us
for many years to come.
My honourable friend from Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) was acclaimed as he returned
to his seat. We were all very sorry to hear
that he had been overcome by the weight of
the burden placd upon his shoulders. I knew
that it was no small task he had undertaken,
for he wou'ld have to meet ail the demands
that might arise anywhere in Canada, and
that the crisis which had been feit from coast
to coast was coming to the nerve-centre, his
own good self. Fortunately he has returned
to our midst-I hope in good health. We will
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

try to see that no heavy task is laid upon

his shoulders if we can prevent it, and we
know that we shall enjoy the benefit oif the
experience gained by him -in the work of
relief in which he has been engaged during
recent months.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

I

may

say,

honourable members, that for a long while I
have been expec'ting the presence among us
of a former Prime Minister, a gentleman
living in the Capital who had for some years
directed the affairs of this country, and who,
in the serenity of the Red Chamber, might
continue his contact with public affairs. I
refer to the Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden.
However, he has felt that as to politics he
had closed his book, and has preferred to look
on from afar, oocasionally giving advice to
the people of Canada.
Instead of facing the Right Hon. Sir Robert
Borden, I behold before me a former Prime
Minister of Canada who is younger, and who
seema to be full of vitality and aggressiveness.
Perhaps it is his carmer that gives me this
impression.
Vitality and aggressiveness are
not in my view defects or drawbacks. I should
be the last to consider them as such, because
for some time after I entered this Chamber
at the age of thirty-six years I had the reputation of being some-what impulsive.
Unfortunately for the Senate, those who might
have testified against me have, with one exception, disappeared. There remains but the
one witness of my entry into this Chamber,
the honourable member for Shediac (Hon. Mr.
Poirier), who will be discreet, I hope, and not
speak too harshly of my early years in the
Senate. Impulsiveness does not avail us to
any extent in this Chamber. because, as my

right honourable

friend

(Right Hon.

Mr.

Meighen) will quickly observe, there is really
no opposition here; there is no standing
opposition to government measures. In other
words, we are collaborators in the work of
the Senate, and we are that by reason of the
fact that we are appointed for life, are independent of the clectors, and have not to
cansider any constituency as a special unit
from which we hold a mandate. Unlike the
members in another place, we do net address
the eiectors; we are content to address ourselves to the question-which is much the
briefrr wat. Long speeches, such as may protract thfe debate in the popular House, are not
made here.
The question is discussed
thoroughly from one viewpoint or another,
and we quickly reach a conclusion.

but of other commodities. When I study the

-- and could buy anything and everything on
credit; the instalment plan of purchase was
flourishing. I saw advertisements in a number of American papers urging young people
with a salary of $2,000 to marry, as houses
could be furnished from top to bottom on
credit. Manufacturers were producing two or
three years ahead of requirements. The readjustment will be a slow process.
The United States thought they could overcome the crisis by raising their tariff, but the
exports from that country have since been reduced by half because, among other reasons,
other countries raised their tarifEs also. The
result has been a contraction all around in
imports and exports. Trade is an exchange
of goods, which must flow as freely as possible. I remember reading a statement by
the President of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the increasing of trade barriers in
every country: his opinion was that the only
good result would be to bring about the beginning of the end of such a policy, and that
in time all countries would agree simultaneously to lower their walls. It has been
suggested that a world conference should be
held in an attempt to regulate production and
promote a proper exchange of commodities.
It is late in the day to make such a move.
Unless it is to be made, I can see nothing for
the future but the natural working of the old
law of supply and demand, with large numbers of victims in every country.
An allusion has been made to the adjustment of accounts between debtor and creditor
nations as a means of helping the world to
return to prosperous times. This brings up
the matters of reparations and international
debts. I will not discourse on these questions
now, because I think we all realize that settlement of them rests with the United States.
So long as that country insists upon payment
by the debtor nations, matters will stay as
they are, although of course Europe will have
to determine whether it can meet its obligations. Perhaps in the attempt to improve

Mr. DANDURAND.

their own economie conditions the people of
the United States will be in the mood to
consider an adjustment, after the next presidential elections.
The Imperial Conference is to be held here
in Juily. I saw the first steps towards such
a conference as far back as 1903, when the
late Joseph Chamberlain was carrying on his
caipaign in England for fair trade. I heard
some of his speeches at the time, and in one
of them he afterwards made some alterations.
Both a verbatim report of the speech and a
copy of it as altered by him are to be found
in the Library. His first view was that the
Dominions should undertake not to develop
their industries further, but to be content with
those that existed in 1903. He soon saw, however, that that proposal could not stand. I
remember seeing at the time in every third or
fourth window in some London streets a big
loaf and a small loaf of bread displayed in
connection with the appeal against the increased price of wheat. Needless to say, there
is not a Canadian who will not pray fervently
for the success of the next Imperial Conference. We shall watch it with very close
interest. We know that there will be very
difficult problems for consideration, but I feel
that all the delegates from the British Commonwealth of Nations will combine their
efforts to bring about success.
I should like to say a few words 'concerning
the question of disarmament. It is not a very
serious one for Canada, but in Europe it has
baffled the ablest minds. There are now
gathered at Geneva the representatives of a
great many nations who are seeking to bring
about a reduction in armaments. Perhaps I
may be allowed to review briefly the existing
situation. Germany, which formerly was one
of the most powerful nations of the world, is
now vanquished, humbled and disheartened;
but potentially, with her sixty-five millions of
people, she is still the strongest nation in
Europe. The surrounding countries are very
fearful of the possibilities of an explosion so
near at hand, and they feel they should not
be asked to disarm until their security has
been provided for. Lord Robert Cecil in
"Foreign Affairs" of October last said:
The problem is to give satisfaction to the German demand for eventual equality, while recognizing that security for France is essential.

He might well have added that security .for
Poland, Roumania, Jugo-Slavia and CzechoSlovakia is essential. I have a profound conviction that the conclusion, if one is reached,
of the present Conference will not, cannot,
satisfy Germany; for she sees that although
her military strength has been greatly cur-

FEBRUARY 8, 1932
tailed âhe is surrounded by coun tries with
powerful ai-mies, and she knK)ws that the reduction in armaments must be a slow process.
0f course, it would be raipid if the United
States were to join the League or to add
sanctions to the Paris Pact. Representatives
of the American, Government are presenit at
Geneva and will 'be aible to realize the situation
f or themselves.
Many suggestions have been made with a
view to giving security Viothe countries that
are contiguous to Germany. There w-as the
protocol of 1924, with it8 principle of ail for
one and one for ail, whikch was nlot accepted
by the nations at 'large. In September Paul
Boncour, a brilliant Frenchi orator who represented his country 'for seine years at the
League of Nations, suggested that memnbers
of the League sbould put a proportion of their
armed forces at -the diaposai e-f the League
Council, in order that wars of aggression might
be averted. Last week a proposai aiong the
same lines, for the formation of -an international police, was made on behaif of France.
But sudh a thing, I believe, is difficuit of
accomplishment. If honourable members will
a]low -me to give the result of sny cogitations
I have a suggestion which could be more easily
carried out, because the principle underlying it
is alread.y contained in -the Treaty od Versailles I wiil read articles 42, 43 and 213 of
the treaty.
42. Germany is forbidden to maintain or construet any fortifications either on the lef t bank
of the Rhine or on the right bank to the west of
a line drawn 50 kilc-metres to the east of the
Rhine.
43. In the area defined a-bove the maintenance
and the assembly of armed forces, either permanently or temporarily, and milita-y manoeuvres of any kind, as weIi as the upkeep of ail
permanent workis for mobilization, are in the
saine way forbidden.
213. So 'long as the present treaty remains in
force Germany undertakes to give every f acility
for any investigation which the Couneil of the
League of Nations, acting if need be by a
rnajority vote, may consider necessary.
At the requet of France it was agreed that
50 kilometres to the east of the Rhine should
be demilitarized, yet France is not satisfied
and is somewhat fearful because it does nlot
know what is going cn beyond that area. If
ahl the nations of Europe are acting in good
faith, why should not the Councîl of the
League be given the power to inspeet and
control nlot only 50 kilometres of German
territory, but the territory of every country
on that continent? And, indeed, why should
not that principle be extended to the whole
world? If the countries have nothing to bide,
why should they neot open their frontiere to
such an inspection? At the present time that

9

power of inspection operates only against
German sovereignty, but if ahl the nations
agreed to a general inspection they would be
on, an equal footing. If the principle of control by the League Council were accepted
loyally and generally, a commission of experts
chosen from neighbouring countries could
constantly watch over activities in all lines
in Germany.
To show what this would mean, let me
illustrate. Suppose 50 inspectors from France,
Belgium, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia were
sent into Germany and an equal number of
German inspectors were sent into those countries. It seems to me that under the regular
system of surveillance and control which would
resuit, Europeans could at last sleep on both
ears, as we sav in French, confident that no
conspiracy would develop overnight. In my
view such a system should be extended to ail
countries, whether members or non-members
of the League, including the United States and
Russia. Is something of the kind not imperative, in any event? If the countries now
represented at the Conference agi-ce to make
a certain reduction in armaments, what
guarantee have they of one another's good
faith? Does not an engagement to reduce
armaments imply a certain control on the
part of the League of Nations? If the general
control, such as I suggest, were put into effeet,
a 25 per cent reduction in armaments could
perhaps be made and a term. of five years
fixed for a test of the resuit. Under such a
plan, no nation could be victorious or vanquished in war.
It seems to me that at a timne like this,
when the peoples of every country are confronted with difficult problems and are wondering what wil happen to the world if there is
not a gradual reduction in armaments, everyone who has given some thought to the matter
should express his views in his own country.
Perhaps some suggestions made in that way
may reach as far as Geneva.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, when I entered this Chamber to-night I did not expect to address this
honourable body, hecause according Vo the
advices which I received-and a stranger or a
novice must, as you know, depend much on
advices--I felt that the honourable gentleman opposite, but noV opposed (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), would probably move the adjournment of the debate, to which I would
agree, and that if he did not do so I should
be expected to make that motion. But after
listening to my honourable friend the convition has been driven home upon my mind
that it would be rather inappropriate, if not

indeed discourteous, to postpone all references to his speech until another day. In
any event, it seemed to me that the quality
most
which honourable members would
admire in the remarks of a new leader of this
House, on a subject of such generality as that
now before us, would be brevity. It will be
possible for me to exercise restraint to-night.
I will say just a few words on the subjects
touched on by the honourable gentleman.
Before I do so, may I join with very deep
sincerity indeed in the expressions of regret
and sympathy on the affliction which has
overtaken the former leader of this House,
the honourable senator for Moose Jaw (Hon.
With that honourable
Mr. Willoughby).
gentleman I have had a close personal association for a quarter of a century. No one
could have had that association without coming to admire and to prize his character and
capacity; no one could have had it, at least
in recent years, without coming to respect
most highly the nature and quality of his
service to this country. We earnestly trust
that he may be with us, and that we may
enjoy the benefit of his experience and help,
for many years.
I also welcome back among us-although
welcome is scarcely the word for me to usethe honourable senator from Welland (Hon.
With hirn, in still closer

relationship, I laboured over many years. No
one, I think, could understand better or prize
more highlv than myself the intense ardour
of his devotion to duty. a devotion which in
great degree, if not entirely, is responsible for
the colla:pse that he suffered. I earnestly hope
that his great ability is stili in reserve and
will soon again be at the service of his
country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Permit me to
pay my compliments. in no empty way, nor
mrely because it is usual, to the mover
(Hon. Mr. Baldantvne) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) of the Address. The
mover is a verv distinguished man both in
the business and the public life of our countr. and I not onlv concur in the kind words
towards him of the honourable gentleman from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
but
express my appreciation of his generous
tribute. I am glad to find the honourable
gentleman from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte) among us. He expressed himself
in French, and though I have had very
little practice in that language in the city
of Toronto during the last five years, I found
for the first time in my life tha.t I could
follow every word of a French speech.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I venture to
ask honourable members from the Province
of Quebec to seek to imitate as much as they
can his clearness of expression, and his careful
and somewhat cautious delivery. Both honourable gentlemen have acquitted themselves
credi.tably not only to their constituencies but
to this House.
I now corme more directly to the remarks
of my honourable friend who, I am rejoiced
to know, is not opposed to the Government.
In that I think be expresses his sincere conviction. I may say that the task with which
I have been honoured I approach in no boastfuil spirit, and perhaps with less confidence
that that usually attributed to me at this
time, but I approach it in the certain conviction that my course here will be followed
by an honourable senator of great a'bility
who is thoroughly competent to oppose, even,
though be has not the spirit of opposition;
and I hasten to say at the outset that the
judgment often conveyed to me by othersfor I never heard him myself till this evening-the judgment as to his amplitude of
information, his clearness of mind and cogency
of expression has been in great degree verified
by his address to us to-night.
Permit me by way of introduction to say
in all earnestness that the years, five in number. or more, which have intervened between
my public duties of other days and the present
time have left a gap of greater extent than I
had anticipated; a gap which I know must be
bridged in order that I may be adequately in
contact with the duties immediately before me.
I hope that while I am in the process of bridging that gap honourable members will be
fairly indulgent. A great deal of ground has
to be overtaken; but I am quite certain that
the educative activities of this House, especially. on the part of honourable gentlemen opposite, are at their highest at the present time,
and that I shall receive the benefit thereof.
The honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mc. Dandurand) has dealt concisely,
but in a wav which to me has been illuminating, with the nature and function of this
Chamber as distinguished from the other, from
which many of us have come. I take no
exception at all to the distinction which be
draws. I hope that the atmosphere of the
other Chamber does not too closely pursue us,
and I promise honourable gentlemen opposite
that I will make an honest effort to escape
from that atmosphere and to acquire, even
more than in the past, the habit of addressing
myself to the question instead of to the public
at large. Indeed, I thank the honourable
member from De Lorimier for giving me to-

FEBRUARY 8, 1932
nigbt for the first time an explanation of the
unfortunate fact that my public life to date
bas flot been an unbroken and unqualified
success. It occurred ta me as he spoke that
in the other Chamber I had been addicted too
much to the practice of addressing inyself to
the question instead of ta the public, and
that the palm of victory finally went ta those
wbo addressed themselves to the public instead of ta the issue.
In respect ta, the achievements of this
honourable House, 1 doubt that there is any
over-estimation on the part of the honourable
member frorn De Lorimier. I know that men'
of long experience, men who are not harassed
ini the performance of their duties by external
considerations of politics, should be more capable than others of revising, if not of initiating legislation, and should indeed be capable
of very great and permanent service ta the
people of the country. I arn sure that 1 shal
flot ask in vain the co-operation of honourable members on both sides when I express
the hope that, while we aIl seek ta maintain
the status and the rank of the Senate, and
the proper functioning of tbis House in the
great work of government, we may seek ta
maintain them on the only sound basis upon
which they can rest-a greater usefulness ta,
the people of our. country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MFjIGHEN: The leader
of the honourable members opposite made
reference ta certain subi ects sketchily touched
upon in the Speech from the Throne. He
ventured an explanation of the economic
morass in wbicb the world is struggling at
tbis time. I take no exception ta bis explanatian, but as one who bas been more in
tbe grîp of that powerful cail than even
tbe bonourable member, I assure bim only
of this, 'that tlhree years ago I sbould bave
been mucb more free than I arn to-day to yenture an explanation af our difficulties. It is
quite possible tbat tbe barriers between nations
in tbe way of commerce bave grown, and that
tbese, bringing about a world condition, bave
helped ta paralyse trade. Each country must,
bowever, determine its awn course in the
ligbt of the po]icy of its competitors. We
have not the immediate issue bef are us naw,
and little of value could be obtained by a
very brief discussion of the matter.
Wbat is clear beyand all question is that
the world is entangled in a great coil of debt;that the world's debts, national as well as
private, are out of aIl proportion ta commodity values. This condition bas been
brougbt about by events closely associated
witb tbe War, and by macbine production.

i

Whatever may have been tbe events which
braugbt it ta pass, tbe fact is tbat the condition is upon us, and tbat bef are there can be
any escape from the impasse in which we
find ourselves, the relationship of debts ta
values must be restared ta something like
tbe proportions tbey bore ta one another at
the time tbe debts were created. Debts as
hetween individuals naturally adjust tbemselves. Tbe creditar finds that he muet adjust
or he loses all. Econamic farces bring this
about. But international debts are in anather
spbere, and it seems ta me so plain that
be wbo runs may read, that unless tbere
is a readjustment of international debts a
return ta prosperity on tbe part of tbe warld,
especially on the part of creditors, is finally
and wholly impossible. Wherever the responsibility may be, those who have it know
tbey bave it. That responsibility must be
driven home. It cann.ot be driven home from
witbouit, but it is very likely ta be diriven
home from witb.in, as the chief penalty falis
on the creditor himaelf. Realities uitimately
have their way; realities cmtrol the world;
and its suffering is mainly due ta failure an
tbe part of leaders of nations ta understand
tbe import of these realties.
I cannat follow my hom>urable friend into
the subject of disarmament. On that subjet
be bas had a long and illuminating experience.
Canada is scarcely the n"ton ta set herself up
as a teacher of disarmament, because we have
50 little ta disarm. We 'have ail viewed witb
remorse and sqome discouragement tbe situation
whicb uow confronts us and appears as a cloud
aver the wbole Geneva Conferene and the
prospects -of humanity. This, however, seeme
clear: the League of Nations, wbile still aur
bope, ta be really effective must be of wider
range than it is to-day. Witbout trespassing
upan ground wbere angels should fear ta tread,
let me say that tbe effective clauses of tbe
League of Nations are clauses wbicb are
enforceable by econamnic sanctions. The great
effective article is Article 15, the economic
sanctions of wbicb, if applied, are very powerful; but so long as two or more great powers,
like Russia and tbe United States, stand out,
those economic sanctions, if applied, say, ta
either China or Japan, would not bave tbz,
effect of strangling the trade of thase cauntries, but would transfer tbe benefits of it
into tbe lap af Ru9sia or the United States.
Tbese reflections are nat ixew ta honourable
gentlemen on eitber side, but they are so
plain that they deserve repetitian and
empbasis by public bodies the world over.
Wbile this concludes the duty wbi-cb I seek
ta disrharge. in my humble way at this tirne,
I wisb ta refer 'ta anotber observation, some-

SENATE
what in 'the nature of an i.nçterj(ction, madle
by the 'boncaurahie genitlemnan frorn De Lorimiew (Hon. Mr. Danduirand). He referred to
a resolution whi-ch passed this House relating
to the subject, of an investigation~ that took
place in the other House witbin the la-t year,
and hie emphasizied the judicial cbaracter
which should a.ppertain to and be observed
by ail honoumrble members of this House in
relation to anything affe.cting 'another honourable member. With bis observations in
that regard 1 arn in complete concurrence.
We miust real-ize that when that subjeet cornes
before u5ý we shall be aceting in a judicial
capacity. Fu-rtherrnore. I can assure rny honourablo friend that I arn in entire agreernent
ith his view that any honourable gentleman
who i's refiected uipon in any way is entitled
to rest bis honour in the custody of this
Hou'se alone. and to be heard in bis own
def'-nce Nvithout restraint. So long as I have
the privilege of aserting rny vicw within
these walls, that is the view I will assert.
Needless to say, 1 shall corne to the discharge
of mv duty without the slightest feeling of
vindictiveness or anirnosity oaf any kind towiards any bonourable members wbo rnay be
affected. This may not be necessary to say,
but I beg the opportunity of saving, that they

Nor would I have referred to this matter but
for the remarks of the bonourabie gentleman
opposite. I know, and the honourable gentlemen thomselves know, that I entertain no
such feelings as I have described, and even if
they were entertained by me I would not
permit them to prevail.
Witb tbese remarks I take my seat, expressing my earnost desire to be of some service,

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH

for an Address in reply thereto.
I should like to
Hon. C. E. TANNER:
assure honourable members that I have no
idea wbatever of disturbing the very pleasing atmosphere that prevailed in this Cbamber during the proceedings of last nigbt. We
bave ail learned during a good many years

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
in this House that, as was pointed out by the
leaders, we get along with our work pretty
satisfactorily and do it very thoroughly,.and
with good results to the country, without indulging in any of the verbal tempests that
sometimes characterize proceedings in another
place. We endeavour to devote ourselves to
the subjects that come before us and to deal
with the facts in a calm and judicial way, and
as I purpose this afternoon to deal only with
some facts which I think are of importance,
I hope that I may all the time keep within
the tradition of this Chamber. So that I may
be sure of keeping close to the subject, may
pack what I have to say within a short
address, and may safeguard myself from any
movement that might frighten away the dove
of peace that was with us last night, I am
going to refer to some notes which I have
made on the subject.
I intend to confine my remarks to the
subject of mutual trade preferences within
the Empire, looking a little at the past, and
then at the present-day situation.
I turn back a moment to the period of 1897
and later, when we were in the Colonial spirit;
when the words "CAlony," "Colonial" and
"Intercolonial Conference" were complacently
accepted as expreasing the relationship that
existed between Canada and the Mother
Country.
It is recorded that during the eleotion campaign of 1896 Sir Wilfrid Laurier, at the time
leader of the Opposition, annou'nced that if he
were returned as head of government in Canada
he would take steps to obtain mutuel preference trade arrangements with Great Britain.
He won the election. Following his proposed
policy in 1897 and 1898, he established tariff
preferences for the benefit of the United Kingdom; thereby making, as he said, a free-will
offering to the Mother Country, on which he
based the hope that he would create sentiment
in the Mother Country favourable to mutual
preferences.
A few years later Sir Wilfnid was impressed
with the belief that what he had done was
about to bear fruit. Two events worked
together to make that impression. One was
the imposition of a corn tax by the then
Government of the United Kingdom. The
other was an invitation by that Government
to the Colonies to go to London and confer
about trade relations and other matters of
common concern. The House of Gommons
Hansard of the time, April and May of 1902,
shows that Sir Wilfrid was quite confident that
he was to have opportunity to "bring Britain
and the Colonies to agreement acceptable to
all." So was hie Finance Minister, Mr. Fielding, who remarked, "That is what is happening
to-day."

13

But there was disappointment in store. What
was being said in this country was wafted
across the ocean. The news stirred the blood of
that ardent free trader and Libera leader, Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman. He sounded alarm.
He waged a vigorous campaign against protectiog and preferences. The Government of
the day weakened. Canadian hope of mutual
preferences faded away.
The *Colonial Prime Ministers, however,
were not discouraged. Nor did they remain
silent on the subject. They put into the record
of the Conference resolutions favourable to
Empire preferences. And Sir Wilfrid and his
colleagues buttressed the resolutions with statements on behalif of Canada in which the trade
advantages freely given to the Mother Country
in 1897-98 were pointed out and the benefits
which had accrued therefrom were impressed.
The resolutions are as follows:
1. That this Conference recognizes that the
principle of preferential trade between the
United Kingdom and His Majesty's Dominions
beyond the seas would stimulate and facilitate
mutual commercial intercourse, and would, by
pronoting the development of the resources and
industries of the several parts, strengthen the
Empire.
2. That this Conference recognizes that, in
the present circumstances of the Colonies, it is
not practicable to adopt a general system of
free trade as between the Mother Country and
the British Dominions beyond the seas.
3. That with a view, however, to promoting
the increase of trade within the Empire, it is
desirable that those Colonies which have not
already adopted such a policy should, as far as
their circumstances permit, give substantial
preferential treatment to the products and
manufactures of the United Kingdom.
4. That the Prime Ministers of the Dominions
respectfully urge on His Majesty's Government
the expediency of granting in the United
Kingdom preferential treatment to the products
and manufactures of the Colonies, either by
exemption frorn or reduction of duties now or
hereafter imposed.
5. That the Prime Ministers present at the
Conference undertake to submit to their
respective governments at the earliest opportunity the principle of the resolution, and to
request thern to take such measures as may be
necessary to give effect to it.
And the foMlowing significant statement
follows in the record:
The representatives of the Colonies are
prepared ta recommend to their respective
Parliaments preferential treatment of British
goods on the following lines:
CanadaThe existing preference of 33j per cent, and
an additional preference on lists of selected
articles(a) by further reducing the duties in favour
of the United Kingdom;
(b) by raising the duties against foreign
goods;
(c) by imposing duties on certain foreign
imports now on the free list.

SENATE
And after this come statements on behalf
of Australia, New Zealand, The Cape and
Natal.
The -memorandum placed on record by Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and hie colleagues declares for
mutual Empire trade preferences, urges the
Government of the United Kingdom to accept
that principle, and reciprocate by granting preferential terme to the products of the Colonies;
partioularly presses for preferenitial treatment
of the food products of Canada; and, in
addition, as I have just noted, offers to consider further reductions of Canada's tiariff in
favour of Britain, upward revision of the tariff
against foreign goods, and imposition of duties
on foreign goods at the time admitted free.
I make two observations here. We have
heard a good deal of criticism of what is
called "bargaining" in tariffs. It would appear
that Sir Wilfrid was not fearful about approarhing the matter in that spirit. And it
would also appear that Sir Wilfrid did not
ronsider it improper to urge the Mother
Country to modify her domestie tariff for the
purpose of bringing into operation an Empire
preference policy.
I now refer to the concluding paragraph of
It is quite interesting.
the memorandum.
There are persons in public life in Canada who
might go so far as to describe it as an ultiimsatumu to the Mother Country. I will, however, speak of it as a warning. It says:
If after using ev-ery effort to bring about
soc h a recadjutmicent of the fiscal policy of the
Emcpire. tie Canadian Governsent should find
that the priiciple of preferential trade is not
acceptalble to the Colonies generally, or to the
Mlccer Countru, then Canada should be free
to take such action as niglct be decmed necessar in tie presence of such conditions.
It will bc observed before I have concluded
that in suibstance there is striking similarity
between what Sir Wilfrid Laurier asked for
in 1902 and what Mr. Bennett asked for in
1930. Both urged acceptance of the principle
of Empire mutual preferences; the details to
be worked out later.
And now I want to take a moment or two
te glance at our constitutional evolution.
When, in 1902, Sir Wilfrid Laurier was asked
in Parliansent to tell what he intended to do
at the "Intercolonial Conference" that was to
bc held that summer, he very deferentially
explained in these words:
We owiil first listen to tice propositions made
ta us by the British authorities. I assume from
the statemsents I hav-e in hand that the Governcnct of Great Britain has propositions to make
to tie Colonies upon this matter of commercial
relations; for, if not, it would be worse than
follY to ask us to discuss tie matters.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

That reveals the spirit of Colonial days. It
is now nothing more than a memory. But
although Sir Wilfrid displayed a deferential
spiri.t, he was, as I have pointed out, moved
to assert a distinctively Canadian spirit in
the pronouncements he made to the Conference.

gave startling impulse to the slumbering constitutional questions. The time was arriving
for positive movement forward in the matter.
That great Canadian and Empire statesman,
Sir Robert Borden, was quick to read the
signs of the times. He led the way.
There followed during a period of years
conferences of statesmen of the Empire, including Mr. King when he was Prime MinColonial status with its

ancient procedures, precedents, dogmas and
limitations was brushed aside. The book of
the constitution of the Empire was rewritten.
The Dominions took their places as nations
of equality of status with the Mother Country
and one another in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.
When therefore, in 1930, the Prime Ministers
of the Dominions assembled in London for
conference they represented nations. not
colonies. They embodied equality of authority and responsibility, and were charged with
cduty of speech and action in matters which
related to the common interest and advantage
of the Commonwealth. It was not an "Intercolonial Conference." It was a conference of
free nations of equal standing with one another, met to consider matters that any or all
of the nations might deem te be of benefit to
tie whole.
I think it is surprising that a public man
who played a part in bringing about these
changes and ushering in the new constitutional era should be heard saying that Prime
Miniter Bennett took too much on himself
and roughly swept aside methods of procedure
at Imperial Conferences when he submitted
Canada's view-s in regard to preferential trade
lu the Conference of 1930. One might almost
think that ie expected Mr. Bennett te posture
as a deferential Colonial; to wait in that spirit
for some mythical "authorities" to speak; and,
if such "authorities" had nothing to submit, to
pîack his trunks and return to Canada. And
this would apply to the Prime Ministers of
all the Dominions.
Critical persons have said that the Conference failed. I disagree with that. We see
now that it did good work.

hazardous, further discussion of the principle is
surely unnecessary. The time for action has
corne.
And he stresses the necessity of stability in
trade in these words:
I need not point out to you that to enjoy
prosperity a country must be assured of stability
in trade conditions. A preference, therefore,
which cannot be regarded as enduring is worse
than no preference at all. And, to be enduring,
it must be predicated upon mutual benefit. A
preference on any other basis is ianifestly
unsound and ephemeral.
He goes on to suggest a basis of ten per
centum increase in prevailing tariffs; but
points out that if the principle of preferences
be accepted there should be an adjournment
for at least six months to give committees and
economists opportunity to make searching
analysis of everything involved in the matter.
And he says he will invite the Conference to
resume at Ottawa.
When Mr. Bennett has finished we hear the
Prime Ministers of the other Dominions, and
we note that they approve of the principles
and proposals made by Canada's Prime Minister.
Having put down a fair report of the proceedings of the Conference, I now purpose
placing alongside of it a statement of the
criticisms that have been made. I take the
speech of Mr. King, delivered March 16, 1931,
as setting out the criticisms. It is an elaborated address, but analyzing it, I think it can
be, without unfairness, reduced to this summary of grounds of complaint in the language
he used:
He complained that Mr. Bennett roughly
swept aside the accepted methods of procedure
at Imperial Conferences and laid down the
law to everyone present before anyone else
had a chance to be heard. He denounced the
attitude as a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum,
declaring that Mr. Bennett's method of
approach resembled nothing more closely than
presentation of an ultimatum to an unfriendly
nation on the eve of war. In one breath he
declared that Mr. Bennett's proposals amounted to the greatest possible humbug. In another, he pronounced them to be an attempted
invasion of Great Britain's domestic field of
administration. He predicted that the then
Government or any future Government of
Great Britain would not negotiate on the basis
of such proposals. Describing the Conference
as being more of a quarrel than a conference,
he declared that people of the Mother Country
were indignant at the proposals and their
presentation; that Canada's relations with
England and with the Empire at large had
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

suffered; and that the prestige of Canada in
the Mother Country was lower than it had
been at any time in the past.
There is the record of the facts. There are
the faultfindings. One does not need to study
them very long to reach the conclusion that
the faultfindings are not supported by the
facts. As to the predictions, events of the last
six months wholly upset them. And it is
surprising that, in these circumstances, Mr.
King should feel himself moved to repeat
some of the accusations and introduce new
grounds, equally untenable, as he did in a
speech delivered at Winnipeg last January.
Talk about "arrogance" is meaningless unless
there is a background of facts; and there is
no background in this matter. Talk about
the dangers of Empire economic isolation is
also meaningless, in view of the fact that Mr.
Bennett has no intention whatever of suggesting that a wall of exclusion be erected
around the Commonwealth. In fact, as the
quotation I made a few minutes ago shows,
he is opposed to any such policy for the
Commonwealth.
It is not flattery to add that there is now
before our eyes ample evidence to convince
fair-minded Canadians that the Prime Minister of this country and his Commonwealth
policy have appealed powerfully to the British
people; that goodwill-not indignation-towards Canada prevails in the Mother Country;
that instead of the prestige of this Dominion
being lowered in England. it never stood
higher than it does to-day; and that Mr.
Bennett is entrenched in the confidence of the
leaders and people of the whole Commonwealth, and is recognized as being one of the
Empire's great statesmen.
On the other hand, assuming that we have
the interests of the Commonwealth at heart,
if we reflect on the past thirty years and more,
and recall the delays and disappointments
which have marked the chain of efforts of
Canadian statesmen to bring about understandings and action in regard to mutual preferences within the Empire, and then observe
that mountains of difficulty have recently been
levelled, and that hopefulness is ripening, and
if we realize how imperative and important
it is now to convert talk into practical and
effective actions and results, we are bound to
think that it is not whole-hearted statesmanship to drag the great problems that confront
the Commonwealth into the cockpit of petty
party strife. It is not good Canadian service.

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, in an address delivered at the annual
meeting of the Freight and Ticket Agents'
Corporation on September 9, 1931, and entitled 'The Business Depression and its Effect
on the Railways," Mr. L. F. Loree, President
of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Corporation. expressed some very sound ideas
concerning the causes of the depression and
the possible remedies. Mr. Loree considers
the depression as it affects not only the railways, but the world at large.
It is probable that the causes of the present
depression are quite mysterious to most
people. and that the innumerable theories and
proposed remedies which are constantly being offered to the public contribute in many
cases to obscure the issue and to make the
subject appear hopelessly complicated, but
as Mr. Loree is a business man of world-wide
reputation, his opinion will, I am sure, be
appreeiated by this honourable House. He is
a member of the Transportation Commission
appointed by the Government. Without beHon.

Mr. TANNER.

ing pessimistic, Mr. Loree gives us in plain
language the underlying causes of the present
situation; he shows that through our past
mistakes we have all contributed to bring
about the depression, that we are now atoning for our sins, and that it is useless to hope
for a business revival until we have, through
certain necessary sacrifices, corrected the maladjustments which we have intýroduced into
oui economic life. I will attempt to summarize the most constructive views expressed
in his address.
Economic depressions are brought about
through maladjustments in industrial life due
to inventions and improved methods in the
fields of production. mineral extraction, transportation, manufacturing and merchandising.
It would seem that economic depressions are
the almost inevitable result of industrial progress; they are like the "growing pains" of
business expansion. The trouble lies not in
the expansion or the progress, but in the fact
that progress leads to over-optimism and an
undue rapidity of expansion, thus bringing
about maladjustments, which must be corrected by a period of depression.
The World War caused shortages to develop
everywherc and created a great temporary
market for American products, and the advent
of several new industries opened up new fields
of activity. At the same time business expansion was greatly stimulated by the development of instalment buying. In the case
of farm produots, over-production was encouraged and stimulated by the extension of
too much credit to farmors, and by artificial
price maintenance. Business became geared
to a condition of steady expansion, which was
reflected in high real estate and security
prices. As usual, commodity prices were unduly high in comparison to costs of production.
As a result of this inflation and discounting of the future, production was
over-expanded, and the means of production were undulv enlarged.
Accordingly,
stocks
of commodities,
mostly
unpaid
for, accumulated in the hands of consumers,
until they became so large that it was utterly
out of the question to move more to the
market or to liquidate them at current prices.
The business and financial machine was
stalled. The time necessarily came when
prices began to decline: first, commodity
prices, then prices of real estate, and finally
stock prices. Commitments made on the basis
of past prices then represented a source of
loss; credit became strained and loans became
frozen. The situation was further aggravated

Ail this may be summed up in the one

period of depression in which we now find
ourselves is necessary to correct these maladjustments. We are atoning for past economic sins; paying up past debts; liquidating
frozen boans. We have had over-production,
and are now readjusting production ta consumuption. Prices of many commodities, such
as copper, cotton, wheat, and wool, were infiated. They are now being deflated. First
the prices of raw materiais and of many farm
products were too high in comparison witb the
prices of manufactured products. Now most
raw materials are unduly low in comparison
with finished products, and farm. products
have fallen mucb below average in comparison with most manufactured goods. In
general, retail prices have failed ta come down
in proportion ta wholesale prices, and the
cost of living is stili higb in comparison with
the prices whicb the producer gets for his
products at wholesale. This is the custama.ry
Iag, due ta the effort of the retailer ta limit
bis lasses.
These price maladjustments must be corrected before we can expect a resumption of
normal business. Business consists in buying
and seliing, and as long as markets are flot in
normal adjustment and we bave in prospect
declining prices for finisbed products and commodities sold at retail, business will remain
backward.
Ail titis is nothing new. We bave passed
tbrougb other 'new eras," as in 1907, 18M and
1873, wbich are quite comparable with the
present one. The difference is mereiy a
matter of degree.
It is discouraging, bowever, ta find that we
have not profited by these past experiences.
In most major panics there bave been the
same efforts ta talk ourselves out of a bad
situation. The "sunsbine" clubs and "business
as usual" movements of the past, in spite of
their futility, bave been ail too mucit in
evidenoe during the past two years. And the
same may be said of the attempts ta remedy
the excesses of inflation by more inflation and
"credit injections."
In times of depression the body politic becames infected with social parasites and other
harmful organisms. To-day we are threatened
with socialism in variaus forms; we also find

necessity of correcting the fundamental maladjustmenta which afilict us.
Especially should we be on our guard
against the insidious workings of inflation and
the dole system. This hegins with proposais
to spend bundreds of millions of dollars for
public works solely for the purpose of giving
employment. It includes the idea that paying high wages will make business good, wbich
if pushed to its logical conclusion would lead
is actually to raise wages regardless of the
productivity of labour or the earnings of
ousiness. Then there is the proposai for a
vast system of unemployment insurance to be
supported by the Government. Ail these
schemes are in the last analysis only an
attempt ta beat the game. They do not
alter the fundamental conditions. They al
involve increasing the burden of taxes, and
they ail mean taking money from one class
to give it ta another.
It is time for us to take stock of our situation. We sbould make studies of the causes
whicb led up to the crisis, in order that we
may prevent, or modify, such a deveIopment
in the future. We sbould learn and record
for the benefit of the next generation the
futility of farmn boards. untimely credit injections, artificially maintained wage rates,
optimistic propaganda, and the like. We
should carefully note what measures and adjustments prove helpful.
A certain amount of natural relief bas
already taken place, and there is evidence
that the period of correction and adjustment
is weli under way. On ail sides we see incompetent management failing; we find the
least efficient labourers forced ta seek new
jobs or temporarily out of work; we find
economies of ail sorts being adopted. Many
men, drawn away from the farms during and
after the War, have returned to the farms,
wbere tbey can at least live a beaithy life
and be free from want. The production in
some industries is exceeding the production
for the preceding year, and industry by industry, recoveries will be made on normal
lines.
The sound methods of procedure which
may be adopted for the purpose of facilitating business recovery would seem to be as
follows:
1. Encourage the prompt and tborougb correction of the existing maladjustments, particularly those which, stili exist among commodity prices.
2. Actively promote economy so that expenses may be reduced to a minimum and a
profitable condition be restored; even, if
necessary, as low as pre-war price levels.

20

SENATE

3. Adjust consumption to income and earnings. Many of us are still maintaining an
inflated standard of living, which must be
deflated.
4. Get rid of much hampering legislation.
5. Adjust wage scales in harmony with the
other eliminations of maladjustments. Since
1914 the cost of living has increased by about
40 per cent, while wages have been more
than doubled, so tbat workmen, if on full
time, are actually obtaining an advantage by
the depression. The income that is necessary
to encourage the co-operation of capital and
to induce business enterprise to function is
uncduly reduced. Then industry as a whole
suffers, including the workmen themselves.
It goes without saying that unavoidable
economic suffering nust be relieved. and we
imust all be prepared to contribute within our
means to a large amount of charitable work
which will have to be carried on during the
next few months. This, however, should for
the most part be regarded as a local and
temporary expedient. The fundamental thicg
is to proiote efficiency, encourage the readjustment in commodity prices, and restore
the balance between consumption and production. Through such processes we have
always recovered from depressions in the
past.

A. BELCOURT:

Honourable

members, mnay I crave the indulgence of the
House while I follow rather closelv the notes
that J have prepared on the subject that we
are now discussing. I am constrained to do
so because, unlike wine, my memory is not
improving with age, and because I wish to
avoid repetitions and redundancies.
The economic conditions of the world,
which since, and mainly because of, the
World War, have been getting worse and
worse, and have now reached the present
depressing, alarming and for some almost
hopeless stage, have compelled and must continue to have the most earnest, keen and
anxious consideration of both the statesman
and the man on the street all over the world.
The distressing picture exposed to the universe at large is made up of universal depression, mass unemployment, national deficits

largest deficit in the last fifty years), financial
collapse,

logical and equitable conduct of affairs-international, national and even domestic-has
become greatly hindered and in many instances rendered almost impossible, because
of fear, envy, greed, mistrust and jealousy,
because of the dominating selfishness of individual, class and nation.
The world is floundering among conflicting remedies suggested for the solution of its
ills. Never before have there existed so much
unrest and anxiety. The expenditure on war
armaments bas increased more than fifty per
cent over what it was before the Great War.
For the past or future wars, out of every
dollar appropriated in the budget, there is
an expenditure of 70 cents in the United
States, 65 cents in Great Britain, and 69 cents
in France. Many, in fact. think that the fate
of modern civilization is really involved. No
doubt the present situation cannot be long
continued without the gravest consequences.

especlly if it is to be permanent, must b,

of course, to such modifications as local interests or conditions may require or permit.
The evil is not merely domestic or national,
it is world-wide; the remedies must be sought
and applied in each national domain and extended internationally in so far and as soon
as that is possible. The responsibility for the
present depression rests upon each of the contemporary nations, and upon all of them
collectively.
The world is economically,
socially and politically very ill. Its return
to normal health will require long, radical,
and sustained treatment.
Modern science, ils discoveries and applications in practically suppressing time and
distance. bave brought the peoples of the
earth much nearer to one another, rendered
their relations much more frequent, intimate
and interdepenlent. and tightened their bonds
and their solidaritv. The amazingly rapid
extension of mechanical development has
radically altered aill industrial activities regarding production, transportation and distribution.
It would be utterly futile to
attempt to arrest that development, and it
would be folly. Readjustment, co-ordination
and regulation. nationally and internationally,
conceived and achieved in good-will and
restored mutual confidence, will relieve world
depression.

great deal of truth in the statement made
by several of the most eminent statesmen of
our day, that the Great War was the inevitable result of the ever-increasing trade rivalries and trade restrictions of the last few
decades?
Goveruments have been in many instances
singularly oblivious of or impervious to the
lessons taught by the epochal changes to
which I hâve referred. They have persisted
in the fatuous policy, or practice, o! continuing to isolate their nations and peoples,
thereby impedîng and arresting their inevitable march towards international dependence,
social and economic advance, world co-operation and general progress. 1s that any longer
possible, and if possible is it desirable?
There is no country which to-day can be
independent of the rest of the unîverse and
insure prosperity to itself, as well as cultural,
scientific and economic advanicement in ite
mîdst, by contenting itself wîth its own inve.stigations, its own scientîfic and cultural
researches, its own activities, its own experience, its own discoveries, its own markets.
The present world .problems are *mainly
economie ones.
The Soviets, with their five-year plan, or
any other plan which they may invent a'nd
endeavour to carry out, cannot successfuliy
isolate themselves commercially. They must,
for instance, export lumber, wheat, furs and
oils, and import automobiles, inachinery, and
many other cominodities.
0f ail the countries in the world there was
flot one which could have made an sttempt
at economic isolation with as much chance of
success as the United States of America; and
no nation affords to-day a more eonvincing
demonstration of the fallacy of such a policy
in our contemporary world. There is no need
to make a demonstration of this, because
every one knows that, for m-any obvious
reasons, the United States was in a better
condition than any other industrial nation to
practise isolation and high protection. No

New channels, new methods, must be f ound
and resorted te. The custome and mea.ns
which adequately met the activities and necessities of modern civilization up te the end o!
thc last century must he replaced hy newer,
more effective and more general instruments
of action. Old ideals must give way to new
ones. The nations of the civîlized world are
now compelled, almost overnight, to change
their attitude and their relations te and with
one another, and adapt themselves to the new
knowledge and -technique which have been
developed.
The practice, almost general, of isolation
and egotistical sufficiency, which has mainfested itself especially in the erection of high
tariff and numerous other trade barriers, is
no longer possible. and if it were possible,
would be wholly undesirable. This method
must gradually bc abandoned. as wholly unsuitable to the enlargement of our contemnporary world and the new necessities of
national and economie interdependence. During the last fi! t> years especîally, protective tariffs have not onl>' dominated industrial
and commercial relations between nations, but
they have gravel>' affected their political
action. Particularly during the last three
years, tariffs have mnultiplied. The HawleySmoot tariff, 1930, raised then existing duties
on 890 products. In -the samne year there
were six general tariff revisions upward in
Europe, and over twenty in South America.
And new tariff barriers have been erected in
France, in Spain, and generally. In 1927 and
1928 Australia and New Zealand made tarif!
revisions, generally upward. Asiatic countries
su.ch as Siam, China and Persia did likewise.
Tariff increase has been followed by higher
tariff increase, and the world has become
divided into many tariff sections or compartment&. Trade antagonism, trade war, has become universal. I have here a list o! the
tremendous increases that have taken place
du-ring the last fifteen or sixteen years.

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
Reciprocity industrialnatural outgrowth of our
developinent under the
wderf ul is the
domestic policy now firmly established.
The period of exclusiveness in past. The
expansion of our trade and commerce in the
pressing problem. Commercial wara are unprofitable. A poiicy of good-will and friendly trade
relations will prevent reprisaIs. ReciprocitY
treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the
times; measures of retaliation are flot.
If perchance some of our tariffs are no longer
needed for revenue, or to encourage and protect
our industries at home, why should they flot be
employed to extend and promote our marketa
abroad?
But the politicians would not heed such
advice. An appeal to pride, self-sufficiency
and splendid isolation constituted a good
election cry for the Republican or the Democratic party-a winning slogan in the
general elections of a nation whose commercial
achievements, whose wonderful industrial
progress and abounding prosperity had created
the belief-the delusion-that it did not need
to depend upon anything outside of itself for
its continuous progress and prosperity.
It is no idie guesa that even the man ini
the street is now gradually, if slowly, working
himself out of the auto-intoxication in which
lie has been induced to indulge for many years
past. Nor can it be seriously doubted that
the Republie is to-day realizing that its tariff,
especially that of 1930, has already caused
incalculable damage to its trade and commerce. Such a policy has brought about, or
will soon bring about, universal retaliation and
reprisais from the rest of the world. In the
words of President McKinley, "Can the United
States repose in fancied security, and think
that tbey can for ever seil everything and
buy littie or nothing?" "Can they believe that
if such a thing were possible it would be best
for them, or for those with whom they deal?"
Can they maintain the standard of if e in their
country unless that of other countries is also
maintained, or uplifted?
Dislocation in world trade, finance and industry bas brought about the present depression and ruin. As an example of this dislocation I may mention the fact that to-day
the banks in Germany are exacting a minimn interest on loans of 8 per cent, whilst
across the border, in Switzerland, depositors
have to pay the banks to accept their deposits. This distorted conception of business
is even manifest in different States od the
Alnerican Union, in the attempt made therein to carry to the limit the "buy-at-home"
practice of trading and keeping the money
at home. I will mention but two instances.
Among a large number of the cîtizens of the
State of Illinois, and in its newspapers and
trade publications, and even in legisiative

23

proceedings, there is an attempt to enforce
the idea that the State of Illinois should buy
nothing produced i other States which is or
can be produeed within its own borders. Another instance: the State of Penneylvania
has found it expedient or necessary to incorporate in its laws the following provision:
It i. uniawful for any administrative body
of the State to specify for or permit to he
used in or on any public building or other work
erected, constructed or repaired at the expense
of the commonwealth, or to purchase any
supplies, equipment or materials manufactured
in any State which prohibita the specification
for or use in or on its public buildings or other
works, or the purchase of supplies, equipment
or materials not manufactured in such State.
This is tbe idiotic policy or practice which
nowadays governs the economie relations of
the nations of the world i their futile
attempt to create or maintain prosperity at
home, whilst injuring or destroying it in the
other nations. History bas shown, especially
during the last haîf century, that once higb
protective tarifas are resorted to they develop
irresistible momentum, not only within the
nation which erects tbem, but beyond. Intended to protect infant industries, to foster
some occupation of supposed national necessity, the list of beneficiaries inevitably
widens and lengthens. If one group can benefit from a tariff wall, other groups insist upon
similar treatment. So instances become
general, and everyone thinks that bie bas a
prior right to the home market. Domestic
producers dlaim virtually the whole of the
borne market, and thereby stand in the way
of foreign commerce. So the world is divided
and subdivided into tariff sections. The instrument bas become more and more blunted
and bard; rate schedules, imposed quotas,
licence fees, systems of restrictions and exclusions, reprisaIs, and even embargoes, have
been and are being rutblessly, savagely employed.
This is how the thing works out. Protection
is granted to a manufacturer for the establishment of an industry, or maintenance of one
that may be almost new or more or less
advanced in age and stability, and the result
in a raising of prices te, the consumer. The
cost of living, consequently, goes up. Because
of the increased cost of living the labourer
demands and receives bigher wages. Then
the manufactu *rer demands more protection,
on." the ground that bis cost of production in
bespoming heavier. Up goes the tariff, and
%vithit the cost of living. Thus at every turn,
the consumer is squeezed tigbter, wbile the
labourer gains little or nothing, for the raise
in his wages'is absorbed by the increesed cost
of living. At the same time the manufac-

SENATE
turer's profits continue to expand, and the
colossal accumulations of capital go on unchecked, unregulated and uncontrolled.
But things and times have changed. Modern
progressive nations cannot any longer depend
upon their home muarkets alone for prosperity.
The attempt to bring about good times for al
by subsidizing everybody has been demonstrated as uttcrly futile. Equaily futile and
fruitless is, of course, the isolation which high
protective tariffs inevitably create and maintain.
Nations like individuals, whethcr they are
purchasers or producers, need one another.
If they buy they must selI, and if they selI
they must buy. There is no one-way trade.
No tariff, however high, can any longer evade,
or even substantially modify, the application
of the inevitable requirements of the present
interdepcndence
of peoples.
Tariffs-high
tariffs--are the main cause and the warst symptoms of the presenit world depression, universal
unrest and fear of collapse. Tarifas, embargoes,
restrictions will hinder and impede commercial
relations of every country and cause financial
loss, even ruin ta aIl. AIl such imipedimrents
will ren(lcr more difficult and more ancrous
the supplying of the needs of humanitv, and
will hereafter fail to bring prosperity to the
nations which resort to them.
Nay, such
tactics will inevitably intensify the general
depression which bhas occurred and will certainly again occur from time ta time. The
impasitian af trade restrictions and reprisaIs
has 'brought forth, and will always bring forth,
counter reprisaIs. Trade wars have flot iffrequently fomented international wars. To
produce war you necd more than mon ey,
munitions, arms and armies. In addition you
mu.st count on enraged nationalism or deep
desire for revenge. The mast prolifie causes
of war are the spirit of conquest and economie
rivalry.
Only reccntly Europe could not exercise
reprisaIs say against the United States with
regard ta many essential commodities, such
for instance as wheat, cotton or ail, but reprisaIs equally serions have now become quite
possible, in fact are now being taken by
different nations against the United States
manufacturers of cinema films, automobiles
and machinery in general. Many people in
bath hemispheres have not hesitaýted ta affirm
that the United States of America bas largely
contributed ta the present universal depression, because of its high tarif! wall.
The UJnited States is the country which
produces the largest quantity of raw material
and mineraIs. Some of its own statesmen and
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

publicists have not hesitated ta give unequivocal expression ta this responsibility of
their country in the present crisis.
"Foreign Affairs"' for April, 1931, contains
an article by a well-known American economist who says, speaking of the tarif! of 1930,
wvhich 1 say was an act of almost incredible
folly:
That action was an autright contradiction of
the interests and purposes ta which we seem ta
be cammritted. It imipaverishes groups of foreign
producers who were aur customers, and whose
efforts in miany instances we had directly or
in(lirectly financed. It closes aur market, in
whole or in part, ta gonds produced by American
interesta operating abroad-as when it blocked
the mavemient of vegetables fromn Mexican farmis
flnanced in San Antonio, and transported on
the Southiern Pacific ta Mlexica. By swiftly
wouniding fareign industry, it intensified the
faîl in raw material markets, from which al
Amnerican producers sixffcred, such as copper.
cotton, lead. hides and cereals.
Industrial
depression abroad wveakened the public credit
of niany of the gaveromnents that are aur coimpetitors. so that naov we wait anxiously ta se
wlhether Brazil. Aiistralia, Mexico and Germany
ean mieet tlir
debts.
It would appear that since this was published
the samie bas become truc with regard ta
France, Italy and Great Britain.
Furt.her on he adds:
We wouîd like ta seek in isolation a security
that seenis lost.
This strongly cmphasizes thc necessity of
ohserving the dictates of the law of econamics and of guarding against the evil which
now menaces every anc of the gavernments
of the day. One cannot escape the conclusion
that party leaders in the neighbouring republic have pursued a policy wvhich is not
consistent with the interests of its people.
Nat later than Se~ptember, 1930, the Amerieau Government became a party ta an international accord, which condemned the use of
tarif£ restrictions and em'bargocs. It signed
aud ratified the "International Convention
for the Abolition of Import and Export Prohibitions and Restrictions."
The American
Secretary of State wrote ta, the League of
Nations:
The Amnerican Government views with approbation any endeavour ta facilitate worîd-wjde
econarnie relations, and remnove discriminating
ecanoiei measures, and bas for this abject
signe(l and ratified the Convention for the
Abolition of Export Prohibitions and Restrictions, and bas co-operated with other international activities looking ta the betterment of
econamnic conditions throughout the world.
This gesture of the United States Government gives ground for the belief that it is naw
reaîizing the fallaey of its tarif! policies of the
last f orty years, and the hope that it will
begin ta reduce substantially its tarif! barriers.

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
This accord bas been ratified by Great Britain,
Japan, the Netberlands, Norway and Portugal.
It remains to be, seen wbether the United
States will now practise what it solemnly suhscribed to and preached.
Unbridled trade rivairies and commercial
greed, not the assassination of the Austrian
Arcbduke, precipitated the Great War. Unrestricted and unregulated capitalism is responsible for the perplexing problemn wbicb
bas gravely threatened the' economic life of
the world, the social and even the political
fabric of modern states. The rapid and
enormous accumulation of wealth in the
bande of a few bas made the modern capitalist a real menace to political and social @tability, not only for nations, but for the world
at large. Whist nations, thanks mainly to
the work of the League of Nations, are gradually, though slowly, learning that peace between themn can be brought about only by cooperation and goodwill and are striving to
develop and inaintain more friendly relations
and a permanent desire and will to collaborate, it is apparent that the envy, jealousy and
hatred of the individual against the capitalist
have not abated, but have become intensified.
The primary cause, the main cause for this
ii the ever-increasing trade barriers, trade restrictions and prohibitions which have brought
about the equally increasing accumulation of
wealth in the bands of the great capitalists.
The capitalist, for bis own sake and the
sake of bis wealth, should no longer ignore
or be indifferent to the situation whicb hie bas
created, and hie should be the first to suggest
and apply the proposed remedies, some of
whicb bave been indicated, or some other
adequate solution. Capitaliste bave acquired
the control of tbe instruments of production,
transportation and distribution, whose power
bas been increased a bundredfold by steamn
and electricity. The power of money has replaced the power of mental activities, the
creation and elahoration of ideals, the culture
of art and science, and the dictates of bumnan
solidarity. To correct this evil, various ref orms bave been suggested, vastly different,
but all inspired by the samne motive, the saine
desire, namely, that tbe accumulation of
wealth be controlled and limited in such a
way that tbe masses shahl be relieved of the
economic despotism.that, now prevaile.
It is matter for wonderment that tbe great
business leaders and capitaliste have so generally failed to realize the very abnormal
situation which bas been created by their
fabulous riches. 1 have often wondered that

25

tbey have so long failed to sense the imminent
peril to whicb. they and their acquisitions are
liable. I wonder that it bas nlot occurred to
tbemn that the world is confronted with a
situation 'wbich cannot possibly endure, and
wbich it bebooves themn probably more than
anyone else to endeavour to allay.
Industry in general, or at least tbe essential
industries of every nation, muet find the
means of assurîng to the wage earner a larger
measure of security and continuity of employment and a better stabilization of the purcbasing power of tbe employed. It is true
that some of the industrial producers bave
initiated a polîcy of relief, in the establishment, for instance, of a measure for sbaring
profits with their employees, but that is
limited to very few employee-9 and done in a
very smail way. There may be several ways
of solving this menacing problemn.
So far as I know, tbe system of profitsbaring between employer and employee is
probably the best. Industrial and. financial
Croesuses must realize that their munificences,
such as the founding of public libraries or the
endowment of universities, whicb benefactions
are to take effect mostly after deatb, will not
satisfy the natural desire and legitimate ambition of the masses for a more substantial sbare
of wordly tbings.
One must not be misunderstood. No one
should be an enemy of the capitalîst, nor
should the capitalist be denied tbe legitimate
fruits of bis initiative, his genius and energy;
nor sbould there be a desire to limit unduly
bis rewards. To-day bis profits have reached
so high that be bas become a very real
and serious menace to economic and political
saféty, national and international. Capitalism
cannot be taken out of the picture, but it
muet not be allowed to monopolize it.
The National Bureau of Researcb is authority for the statement that 1 per cent of tbe
property owners in tbe United States holds
33 per cent of the national wealth, and 10
per cent own 64 per oeit.
It muet be conceded that tbe capitalistie
regime will persiet, and even that it ail ords as
good and as fair a basis as bas been so far
devised and tested for the buildinig up of
permanent and soundly economic structures.
Capitalism, tbough in part reeponsible for
present conditions, is nlot by any means the
greatest offender. The point I wish to emphasize is that labour is just as necessary as
capital, that they are more than ever interdependent, that botb capital and labour bave
now enlarged mutuel duties as well as comnmon obligations to the community at large.

LZ

SENATE

Because of their solidarity with the community, both capital and labour must be stvbjteted to government control and governmenu
regulation, nationality and internationally.
The division, or rather the apportionment
of international labour, which so largely contributed to increase wealth before the War, is
again asserting its rights. Present-day industrial
conditions
imperatively
demand
earnest and equitable collaboration in regard
to both capital and labour from aIl the nations
in the world. Those engaged in industry, as
well as governiments, must seek a just solution
of this most important economic and social
question-important nationally and internationally.
Trade
conventions,
commercial treaties
witb Europe or the rest of the wurld, will not
cause any nation the slightest danger, but,
on the contrary, will best serve the interests
of ail. Neither the United States of America
nor any other nation should look upon such
agreements as "entangling alliances," social,
economic or political. The real or assumed
danger representcd by the expression "entangling alliances" belonged to the eighteentb
century. and does not belong to the twentietb. To-day the expression is mcrely an
anachronism.
On the other hand, trade
agreements offcr the only means of assuring
industrial peace and security for nations, for
capital and labour, for employer and emplovee, for sound and stable economic progress, for national and world prosperity, for
world pecace. Trade treaties have become international necessities as much as peace
treaties, since commercial aggression is the
most fruitf nI producer of armed aggression.
Military disarmament is predicated on coinmercigl disarmament.
England is not the only nation of sliop
keepers. The shop kicepers of the world-and
they are ail ox er the world-whilst flot
abandoning fair commercial ri\ a1ry, must
learn 10 carry on iiuchl ini the sanie way as
ordinary traders dIo *in their own immediate
communities.
It is but rccntl 'y that Mr.
Gerard, the former Amcrican Ambassador to
Cermany, declared that the Uinited States
are now under the financial and industrial
control of fifty-nine financiers and manufacturers, whose names lie mentioned.
About a year ago, Mr. McFadden, Chairman of the Committee of Congress on
'Banking and Money," stated in the House
of Representatives:
The War has put our financial and industrial
leaders in touch with the principal financial and
induistrial leaders of the rest of the world. One
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

of the eonsequencoe of this contact has been the
acceptance by our magnates of the control of
great affaîrs everywhere. A typical case is that
of the Morgan group.
It actually controls
international exehange, borrowings and coinnierce. This world-wide association of financial
agencies under a central surveillance marks a
new epoch in the history of world finance. It
is the cause of the greatest danger which bas
mnenaced free governments for centuries, as it
aspires to govern not only finance, but also the
polities and enterprise of nations.
The Communists of Russia have been
afforded a powerful motive and weapon in
the fabulous concentration of capital in the
hands of a few for the gigantie Communistie
seheme which they are attempting to carry
out.
If the countries of Europe and America
fail to take in hand the present unregulated
and uncontrolled economic situation of the
world, and, for lack of earnest collaboration,
fail to adjust and co-ordinate it; if the
present world commercial situation is not
remedied and put in order; if this grave and
dangerous practice of the unlimited hoarding of money by individuals and corporations

knocking loudly at the doors of London, Berlin, New York and Montreal.
We have
rcached a x'ery real crisis in the industrial
and commercial civilization of the world. The
world is in the throes of a profoundc economie
transformation.
As I have already stated, the remedv which
I respectfully suggest. in at lcast its general
liues, is internationally democratie in the
sense that it should and must be world-wide.
World economnie co-operation has become
essential. It is absolutely necessary to put
forth and render effective the ability for
group or nation to co-operate withi group or
nation. The principal remcdy is in lowering tariffs, because these are the greatest
obstacles to the betterment of our cix ilization.
Triff harieis, uf course, cannot be wiped
out comipletcly and immocdiatelvý, but onîvitradually and in accord with geographical,
clitnatic ami other natural conditions and requiremients.
The main and most essential rcmedy is for
ail tariff protectcd countries to set about extirpating tbe vicious mystemn, not suddenlvý
but gradually, even if in consequence of the
exponditure of time and energv in securing
trade conventions a temporary loss sbould
follow. This is essential to the restoration
and maintenance of economic peace, whicb is
the paramount essential of world peace.
I cannot think of any good reason why
Great Britain, for instance, should depart fromn

FEBRUARY 9, 193
its old-time policy. It may be, as apparently
some unwisely believe, that the change aet
preserit suggested may afford some temporary
,relief in hier present economic situation. At
hest, it would be only very ephemeral and,
if persisted in, would inevitabiy result i
sericus and permanent injury. We know,
everybody knows, that English capital hias
been învested throughout the world, and that
hier powerful maritime, commercial and financial jn'terests are dependent upon her world
trading. We know that England muet sell
two.4hirds of hier products outside of the
Empire. We know aiso that the whole of
the British popula.tion throughout the world
is oniy 65 millions. She must buy in about
the saine proportion. Since other countries
can produce foodstuffs and provide raw
inaterials at least as cheaply as the Dominions,
and since Germany, Italy, France and other
countries ran buy these, Britain must do likewise, or lose in the competition with lier rivaIs
in the remaining markets of the world. 0f
ail the nations Great Britain will suifer the
most if she resorts to economic warfare.
With reference to our own Dominion, the
policy of isolation and high protection appears
to me to be a disastrous one. Canada produces an abundance of foodstuifs, tlie greatest
of all being its wheat. Canada lias great
natural resources, far in excess of its own
needs, and it lias, witli its railways, canais,
highways and factories, set up an economic
structure altogether disproportionate to its
very limited and sparsely settled population.
It must depend on selling its products abroad,
and it cannot sell them abroad unless it also
buys abroad. If we cannat seîl abroad, wliat
shaîl we do with the products of our mines,
our forests, our fisheries and our farms, ahl of
%wýhiclinow exceed, and some of which already
getyexceed, our national requirements?
What shall we do witli the two or three hundred million bushels of wlieat which the
Prairies are now -ann&ially producing--and they
can be made to produce tremendously in exeess of our needs--if we cannot seil it abroad?
A nation like'ours, witli its stable Government
and sound financial institutions, with a virile
and wide-awake people, willing and eager te
use its brawn and its brain, and filled, wi.tli
hope and faith in the future of the country,
cannot practise isolatiomsm witliout seriously

close ýour doors, liow cati we expect others to
open theirs?
SMutual advantages in trade, transportabion
and distribution must be the principal motive
and factor in bringing about with other comnmercial nations those accords and conventions
which, iii removing or limitiiig tariffs and other

barriers, will permit of development and expansion, and restore prosperity. 0f course,
we must admit that in order te bring about
sucli accorde and treaties, persistent goodwill,
time and very serious effort and collaboration
.are necessary. We shaîl have te be sa'tisfied,
for the present at least, with slow progresa,
as it will take time, probably mucli time, te
learn the lesson of present- world economic
solidarity and stiil more te put. it into f ruitful
practice. The task of the world in adjusting
world economics is so enormous that only
partial successes can be lioped for; and it will
be possible to solve the criais oniy very
slowly.
France and Germany have recently made
definite working agreements i some fields of
their respective industrial activities, and
extensive trade relations have been established
under the Franco-German Commercial Treaty
of 1927, more especially witli relation to the.
great commodities of iron, ore, coal, textiles,
leather, fruit, machinery, pulp, sugar and
woods. If France and Germany can forgive,
or at least f orget for the time being, their
old antipatliy and quarreis, and trade witli
one another, surely the rest of tlie commercial
nations can do likewise. In sucli treaties will
be found the real and iasting remedy for the
present depression and the establishiment of
sustained prosperity. Trade treaties are indispensable to efflcacious peace treaties. Tra-dc
treaties must precede, or at least accompany,
treaties of arbitration and conciliation.
Modern science lias definitely made the
world a composite entity. Any serious setback
to civilization, or economic disaster in any
one part, liowever remote geographically, will
seriously affect tlie whoie. A policy of selfiali
isolation on the part of any nation lias, for
several decades at least, ceased to be justifiable, or even possible without serious danger
te ail. Goodwill and real collaboration-not
uncontrolled greed, whether individual, corporate or national; not harmful restrictions on
trade and-commerce; not trade war; not noise
and speed; not accumulation of gold or
armaments-will restore prosperîty and peace
to the world or to any nation.
Some of the many remedies--oftentimes
very confiicting and contradictory-wbicli are
now being suggested or attempted by many
states, may bring some temporary relief here
and there, but the only real and permanent
solution of the present situation is a rational
and equitaýble world-wide economic readjustment, a readjustment wbich must be courageously undertaken at once and perfected as
soon and as completely as possible. The
ultimate solution will be found not in the

28

SENATE

-home market, but in the world market. Trade
disarmament will have to corne before effective
military disarmament. Prosperity will return
and the world will continue to advance only
if by and through the earnest collaboration of
the nations trade peace is first secured.
Political peace will f ollow as a logical consequence.
For a long time the conviction bas been
growing witb me, and it is now profound, that
tbe main and essontial function of the League
of Nýations is economie, rathor than social or
'political, and this has non' become clear. The
solution of the world's troubles is first and
abovo ail in the economnic domain. The present social and political problems are largoly
incidenta].
M'bat the world needs is an
"Economic League of Nkations," fully aware of
and alive to its ossential mission, having the

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, in the first place, of course, there
is the custom-and even though it is worn
and thread-bare, it is a good one-of paying
compliments to the mover and the seconder
of the Address. I arn very sorry that the
honourable gentleman from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyno) bas disappeared, because I was
going to, cover him with flowers.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Speaking seriuusly,
the nomination of the honourable gentleman
is a very good one. 0f course there are

no polities in this House, and, as one who
sits on this side, I take great pleasure in con-

gratulating the Government upon bis appointment. If I had had the power I would
have appointed the same gentleman, even
though he is a convert. Like many of the
English Liberals of this country, he was converted on the Conscription issue, and he
richly deserves bis reward. He is a man of
substance.
Upon entering the Government
he bad to give up the presidency of the
Sberwin-Williams Paint Company in order
that he might devote bimself to the service
of bis country. During the war ho raised a
regiment. It was a strain to do so, but ho
did it very well. I first knew bim in 1909.
At that time ho n'as a Harbour Commissioner
of the Port of Montreal along with George
Washington Stevens, wvho was chairman of
the Board, and Mr. Geoffrion. These gentlemen succeeded in putting the Commission
on a business basis. The honourable mcmber from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) had
been president of the Manufacturers' Association, ho bad the confidence of the business
people of Montreal, and bis business ability
made him a verv valuable member of the
Harbour Commission. Since that time we
have always had gond Harbour Commissioners. There n'as some talk last session of
the Government taking over the administration uf the harbour, but it bas enough to
do wifhout that, and sbould allow the Harbour Commissions to romain. I amn very glad
to welcome the honourable gentleman te, this
Houso. I hope ho may ho bore as long as
I bave been. By that time ho will ho ready
to go to the good place.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As to the seconder
of the Address, I must say that ho spoke
very gond French. Even the right bonourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meigben)
understood him; sO ho must have spoken
good French and spoken it very distinctly.
Ho also will ho a credit to this Huse, and
I commend the
Government upon bis
appointment. The French people in the
Northwest are not very numerous; nevertbeless, they are entitled to a few senators.
Previously we bad one from Alberta; now we
have one f rom Saskatchewan.
So long as
the Goverament continues that policy we will
support it.
Non' I come to, the right bonourable gentleman (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen) who Ieads
this bouse. It is a great bunour to, the Senate
to bave as its leader a gentleman who twice
bas been Prime Minister of Canada. I may

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
remind him, however, that hie is not the first
Prime Minister to lead in this Bouse. When
I firat came here we had another gentleman
leading this Bouse who had been Prime Minister of Canada, though not for as long as the
right honourable gentleman opposite. I refer
to Sir Mackenzie Bowell. Be was a dear oid
inan, and well liked hy everybody. Although
he was at, the .bead of the Orange Order,' he
showed no partiality. Be often told me, and
I really believe it was true, that ail the Irish
Catholic priests in Bastings had supported
him. 0f course when Sir Mackenzie Boweil
came te, us he was already weighted down
with years. Now we have as leader a comparatively young man, a man who appears to,
be in excellent health. I have no douht that
we shaîl get along very well together. I
admire the right honourabie gentleman's
clarity of expression. By a few turns of bis
able tongue he yesterday deait the League
of Nations the worst hlow that I have ever
heard. May I read ýtwo or three lines? Be
said:
The League of Nations, while stili a hopeStill a hope.
-to be effective must be of wîder range than
it is to-day.
This means that the League as at present
constituted is not of much use. One does
not have to be very logîcal to come te that
conclusion. Then he adds that Article 15,
containing the economic sanctions by which
pressure may be brought -to bear, is not of
mueh use. And why? Because the United
States and Russia are not bound hy it, and
if we were to invoke it we should simply
be tbrowing away any chance we might have
of making money out of it. I think I can
read the thoughts of the right honourabie
gentleman even though hie did not state them.
As a good lawyer lie knows that if there is
no sheriff to enforce lis judgments a judge
on the bench might as weil be singing as
rendering judgment. Bowever, I do not wfant
to gloat over the difficulties of the League at
present. De mortuis nil nisi bonum.
Memory is the greatest gift that Providence
gives te, man, and in that respect the right
honourable gentleman who leads this Bouse
bas been favoured, for lie has a wonderful
memory. I remember an occasion when lie,
as Prime Minister, was leaving for London,
England, to attend a conference. I happened,
while speaking in this Bouse, te have given
him some good advice, telling hima to, beware
of the wiles of the people in England. I hope
the right honourable gentleman will not take
the reference as disparaging. As an ardent

2

admirer of Sir Wilfrid Laurier I could not
give different advlce. I said: "See what theY
did ýto Sir Wilfrid Laurier." The first time
hie went over there they got a preference, for
which we got nothing in return. The next
time he went over they worked him into the
Navy, and hie had with him the Minister of
Marine, Mr. L. P. Brodeur. Mr. Brodeur,
Nvhen hie came to Montreal was more than a
Liberal; hie was more than a Radical or a
Socialist; hie was a Nihilist; and when the
Czar was put to death the honourable mnember froin Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
telegraphed to Mr. Brodeur: "A.t last you
must be satisfied. The last of the Romanoifs
bas gone."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: It was a very
humble member of this honourable Bouse
who had undertaken to give advice to, the
right honourable gentleman. When the right
honourable gentleman Teached Montreal on
bis return from England hie remembered what
had happened, and said to this member, "Did
I mind what you said?" I thought it was
wonderful that a Prime Minister of Canada
sbould take such an interest in what had been
said in this House as to, remember it when
hie was across the Atlantic. Be remembered
my remark and said hie was guided by it.
That made him a great friend of mine, and
I hope hie will continue to be guided by what
I say.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In the Speech
froin the Throne reference is made to the
coming of prosperity when international
settiements have heen made. Well, if we are
to wait tili then for prosperity I arn afraid flot
many of us will be alive to, see it, for I do not
helieve those settiements are going to, be
made very soon. I think that statement
might as well have been left out of the Speech
from the Throne. Ail the money is owing to
the United States, and they are not going to
forgive one cent of the debt. As the other
nations are not getting the money due them,
they cannot give it. So how is the settiement
going to take place?
Germany has no intention of paying. In
1919 I made a long speech in the Senate on
this subject. In 1017-to speak from memory
-the Germans said: "We will spend a lot
of money, and if we win the war we wili make
the conquered nations foot the bills. If we
lose the war we shaîl go bankrupt, but we
shail have the works upon which we have
made the expenditure." So they went to

du

SENATE

work and built no less than twenty-nine
canais in Germany. Those who are familiar
with the geography of that country know that
four large rivers-the Rhine, the Weser, the
Oder and the Elbe-run almost due north and
empty into the North Sea. Between those
rivers there are huge mountains. And what
did Germany do? She built canals connecting those rivers, and encouraged all lier different states, or provinces, as we should call
them, to go into ail sorts of expenditures,
whispering to them on the quiet, "You will
never have to pay a cent for it." She said,
"If the Allies win the war they cannot take
these works awav from us." This went on
during 1917 and 1918. and the Reich, the
central governing body, put up the money in
paper marks which were never to be redeemed. To give you an idea of the importance of this work I may tell you that a
canal was built from the Rhine over the
iountains to Lake Leman in Switzerland,
aMd in spite of an elevation there of 600
mcetris, 1,900 feet, there is now a canal with
locks 1,000 feet long. They had solved the
problin of hiow to supplv the water. At each
lock t 'heyv
turnod the water into power so that
hy ciould distribute electrie energy ail over
the place.
Ail that equipment cost them
nothing, bueeius they paid for it with deprecdUed currency and if theyv had won the war
they would have made their enemies pav for
it. Thei made up their minds at that time
iot to pay.
I was struck with the gambling in marks
iait was so general wlien people bought them
at two or thrce cents. Who can sav how
manv millions of dollars they gathered from
the sale of those marks? Germany actually
encouraged the people by printing these
marks, whicb became so cheap that for a
lundred dollars you could get an astronomical
number of them. Since then the Germans
have borrowed all the money they wanted,
and out of every' three dollars they borrowed

they paid one dollar back to their creditors,
and kept two. Thev have spent money
galore on railhay stations that would make
the proposed Canadian National Station in
Montreal look like nothing at all. They
c-roe-<d the corridor, to the east of which they
built a station that cost thousands and thousands of pounds. It is easy to spend money
that you have no intention to pay back. See
Hansard of 1919, which gives all the details.
If the Germans do net make payment,
those who were to rec-ive this money cannet pay the United States. and if prosperity
depends on that we shall all be very hungry
before it arrives.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

This has been a rather quiet afternoon; so
perhaps we might have a little levity and I
might tell of a recent meeting in New York
of some very important financiers who were
talking of present conditions and mentioning countries on the gold standard. Here
are the countries that they said were on the
gold standard: France, United States of
America, and Bennett.
Having mentioned the name of the Prime
Minister, I should like to say that the speech
I heard him deliver yesterday was a marvelous performance. His wonderful vocabulary
and the rapidity with which he speaks remind one of a great torrent sweeping down
the side of an abrupt mountain, and boiling
and foaming. I admired his oratorv. I felt as
if riding on a thoroughbred, and I was carried
away. It was like a train going 75 miles an
hour-and running past the station. He said
Sir Wilfrid Laurier had built two transcontinental railways. The right honourable
gentleman was going at such a speed that
he went right through Edmonton, and
never stopped until lie got to the Pacifie
Ocean.
Now, the right honourable gentleman knows that
Sir Wilfrid Laurier
never voted one cent of moner to Mackenzie & Mann or the Canadian Northern Railway to spend west of Edmonton. I
think the statement should be corrected at
once. It bas been said-and even Liberals
believe it-that Sir Wilfrid built too many
railroads. The Prime Minister yesterday in
another place actually said that it was all the
fault of the Liberals that the railwar situation
of this country was in such a mess. The
right honourable gentleman opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) did not always see ere
to eye with the Prime Minister on railway
matters. However, there were few lines, as
mentioned in the Drarton-Acworth report,
which gives the whole story. I need not read
it, for I know it well. In 1896, when Sir
Wilfrid Laurier rose to power, there were
18.000 miles of railroad in the country. In
1911, when he went out, there were 24,000
miles. He had a good Minister of Railways,
the rigltî honourable member for Eganville
(Right ion. Mr. Graham), and he said, "We
have enough to go around the earth; so we
ean stop." There haci been 300 persons per
mile of railv ar- in 1896. After fifteen years,
dluring which the mileage in the country had
been increased by 6,000, from 18,000 to 24,000
miles, the population per mile was 286 instead
of 309.
In 1901 the population was five
millions odd: in 1911 it was seven millions
odd: so in the fen years there was an increase
of forty per cent in the population. Then the

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
Con.servative Party came inte power, and
everything stepped; the population did flot
increase; there was stagnation, according to
the Drayton-Acwerth report.
Sir Henry
Drayton said, six years afterwards, thaît there
were then seven and a haif million people.
At the samne time, six years afterwards, the
railways had dncrcased fromn 24,000 to 40,000
miles. I invite anyone to read the report.
These figures wcre not invenited by me, but
were given by Si, Henry Drayton, who was
afterwards Miniister of Finance and then was
Chairman of the Railway Commission. In the
four Western Provinces there were only 120
persons per mile of ra'ilways; stili the people
in the Northwest wan'ted more lines.
Right lIon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: AlI those
railivays. exccpt the Pacifie extension, were
guaranteed by the Governien-t which went
eut of power. The railways were projected
and the contracta made by it.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Be that as it may,
the facts are there. Drayton does not say
that in his report.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
most important fact.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: However, I have not
read it in the report. We had 40,000 miles,
with oly 120 persons peT mile of railroad in
the four Western Provinces, whilst in the
United States, wit~h their tremendous maileage
of 240,000 miles-ten tâmes snround the world
aýt -the equator-there were 400 persons to
support every mile of railway. Everybody
who knowvs anything of raidlway stocks in the
United States knows that. Now, what chance
have we, with iletss th-an 200 persons a mile, te
support our railways? That is the great
question.
I suppose the Commission that ie sitting now
is not a court of juistice, and we have a right
te speak bore. It haîs been suggested that
three or five of the principal men of each of
the railroads-some fromn the C.P.R., and an
equal number from the Çanadian Nationalshould formn a board, and if they could not
egree on a chairmian, then the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court, I suppose, woudd appoint
the chairman.
I arn against governinent
operation froin start to finish, because I believe
that what is evenrybody's business is nobody's
business. The United States, a muoh wea.lthier
country than we are, started governinent
operation and were losing millions every day,
and they handed back the railways te private
owners. Those railroade, were net only in a
bankrupt state, but the road-bed, the rollingstock and ail the equipment were dilapidanted.
Xnotwith.qtanding that it was made by a big

31

and wealthy country, and during the war,
when tbey were pil-ing up money there, the
experiment was not profitable.
The plan of eppointing a joint board is net
îny own, but I think that in such a way we
coufld save duplication. Is there any sense in
the present methods? Look at the time-tables
of trains ieaving Mon-treal on both lines et
the saine time, and aýrriving here ait the saine
turne, with tracks over practicalay the saine
territory; and this dupliocatien ocours every
day, and several turnes a day. Is there any
sensge ini it? Could that net be stopiped et
on-ce? The. Board cf Railway Commissioners
are rerniss in liheiýr duty. They should suimmon
Mr. Beatty and Sir Henry Thornton and say:
"You cannot afford this. TLhore are not enough
passengers in the twe trains te fill one train
preperly, and a great many of the passengers
are travelling on passes, whieh do net help
the revemiue." Lt is perfectly right te make
the ton per cent redjuctien that is proposed,
but that is only a flea bite. Loek açt the
extravagance that is going on with thoe- raill,roads com.peting oeaegainst the other. If the
ceuntry were rolling -in wealth it could net
afford that. The wages of the .railway people
are reduced. They went ýup because the cost of
living bad gone &ip. New the cost of living is
down. Twe dozen of eggs can be bought in
Moutreal fer what one dezen used te cost;
three bags of potatees Sen be had for what
used te be the price ef one bag. If the wages
were reduced proportionately we shouid be
alI triglit.
Much has been said about trading outside
ef Canada. It is aIl right if you can do it,
but for a couple cf centuries Canada lived
very weIl within itself and progressed. I have
tried te find statistice as te what our external
trade was before Confederation. The amnount
was very little. People provîded for theinselves. The honourable member for De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béiquie) will tell you
that where be was brought up the total sumn
spent by the family in a year was very sinali,
and it was nearly ail spent in the country. I
do not know thet the ordinary farmer would
in a year spend mere than twenty er twentyfive dollars on imported commodîties for hîs
wife and family cf seven or eight children.
There is net a thing that we cannot manufacture here, and yet we import by shiploads. There is ne reason why we cannot
manufacture eur sugar in this country.
England, the country that owns nearly all
the cane plantations in the world, uses more
than haîf beet root sugar. After the war with
Napoleon, France could net get any more
sugar because England was in control of the

32

SENATE

seas, and the cane could not be brought in.
French scientists said, "We will make sugar
ont of beet roots," and to-day enormous
quantities of sugar are shipped from France
across the Mediterranean to that immense
French territory where there are sixty million
coloured people.
We have fifteen artificial silk factories.
Cotton we (1o not need at all. When we were
young there was very little cotton in the
country; people had linen, which was mucih
better. If y ou went into a farmhouse in our
province you would see a loom there. The
honourable gentleman frem De Salaberry says
people used te make their own sheets and
blankets and quilts right where he was brought
up. Nowhere els, were boots made so cheaply
as in Canada; and it is a strange thing that
though there was no duty on boots going to
the United States. boots from Canada could
never he sold there. For sorne reason or other
the Aitericans did not like the shape of them.
That is sonething that cannot be explained.
I am afraid I am straying a little from the
pathRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is seldom
the beaten path. anyway.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: I thought it would
he interesting te get a cop- of the Statute of
Westminster. This reminds me of the Imperial Conference. The Statute is not long,
and when youi bave read it all yon do net
make verv mnuch out of it. I have also a
copy of the debates in the Imperial House of
Commons on this Statute. We all remember
that when the Prime Minister, Right Hon. Mr.
King. came back, he made the statement that
ev erything was changed, that we were going
to be an independent nation, and so on.
Theie was another Prime Minister who was
returning at the same time and passed
through
Montreal-Mr. Bruce, the Prime
Minister of Autralia. At lunch I asked hin,
"Is there any change?" He replied, "Not a
bit-no change at all." So it looks as though
the representatives who attend Imperial Conferences talk a great deal. but everybody goes
hone with his own story, whatever it is. Mr.
Bruce thought that I was an Imperialist. If
there is any one thing I tIo not like, it is this
independence business. If you want to break
up the Empire you are going about it the
right way. I have lived long enough to see
that you cannot have independence here
and independence there. The first thing you
know, Australia will go one way and New
Zealand another, and then South Africa, and
it will not take them long to go. And the
Irish Free State might go too. Then what
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

would Canada do? Of what value would be
its independence and its ambassadors at
Tokio, Washington and Paris? Now suppose,
for instance, that our ambassador te Tokio,
the Hon. Herbert Marler, wanted to make
some remonstrance. He would be like the
League of Nations, without any force to support him. He could only say. "I ask you to
do so and se, if you will, but I cannot make
vou dlo it. I have no fleet nor army." It is
truc that we have a couple of gun boats. By
the w-ay, I wonder who is the Lord of the
Admiralty in this country who ordered those
boats to go down to San Salvador. I think
the right honourable leader of the House
should not snile, for it is a serious matterit is a casus belli.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
is infectious.

Your smile

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
I thought those
boats were stationed at Esquimault, on
the Pacific Coast. It is quite a long trip that
they have taken, and the cost of the coal
they consueido
nust be a considerable item
in these hard days.
Suppose they went
tht-oitaih the Panama Canal: in addition to
all the other costs they would have to pay
tolls of 81.25 a ton, which for a boat of
10,000 tons would bo 812.500. Why did we
send them down there? Would it not be a
good thing for the right honcurable leader
of the Senate to give us an explanation some
time during this session? After ail, although
we are not the custodians of the public purse
and have no right te vote money, we have
a righlt t see that i't is net spent improperly.
I should like te know who is the chief of the
Admiralty in this country. Mr. Desbarats,
the Deputy Minister of National Defence,
sure-ly would not take the responsibility of
sending our boats. Perhaps if we questioned
the Minister of Marine. whose name I do net
rocall ait the moment, he could enlighten us.
However, I an told that the boats are coming
ba-k and that none of the crew caught hay
fever or anything else.
To my mind this independence business is
absolutely wrong. I believe in the unity of
the Empire, and if that means being an Imperialist, -thon call me an Imperialist. I have
no confidence-and I say this with all due
respect-in the Conference that is to take
place here. There will be many fine speeches
and dinners, and I suppose plenty of champagne and so on, and everybody wi:ll be
pleased.
But what can it achieve?
The
delegates will have no special mandate. I
dream of the day, and I think it will come,

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
when there will be a truly Imperial Parliament, a Parliament for Imperial affairs. When
that time comes our representatives will have
a vote and we shall be able to do some Empire
business. To-day we have no such vote. If
England were to go to war-and the decision
to do so might be made in the British House

of Commons by a sma-ll majority of members,
elected by comparatively few votes-we should
have no say whatever in the decision. The
Prime Minister of Canada, even if he had a
solid Senate and a solid House of Commons
behind him, would have no more influence in
stopping England from going ito war or in
the making of peace than the wildest flathead
Indian in our Prairies, or the filthiest Esquimaux in the land of the aurora borealis, or
the blackest kaffir in South Africa. Some
people may say that Canada does not have
to go to war unless it chooses to do so, but
that is not the way the thing is done. I
remember a statement by Sir Robert Horne
at a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union
in Washington. The honourable gentleman
to my left (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) and the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) were present. An Irish delegate,
I think Mr. Dillon, proposed that if England
were at any time to engage in war the Dominions should not necessarily be at war also.
Sir Robert Horne said: "That would be a
very convenient thing; of course, it would
mean less territory to defend. But I must say
we are not asking for this eleemosynary aid.
And it must be borne in mind that a belligerent
power wou-ld not be prevented from attacking
any Dominion simply because that Dominion
happened to say ·that it was not at war.
If the enemy decided to do so, it could try
to take possession of that Dominion's territory,
whether the people living there considered
themselves to be at war or not."
The world never before saw such an empire
as ours, which occupies one-quarter of the
earth's surface and contains one-quarter of
the population of the whole world. It would
be a great mistake that we should be so
indifferent as to let that Empire go to pieces.
Now, if we in Canada were British citizens,
instead of being, as we are, British subjects,
we should have some influence in an Imperial
Parliament. Perhaps that body would sit on
the shores of the Thames, but it might sit in
any other part of our world Empire. We
should not be by any means an insignificant
minority in this Parliament, for I suppose the
representation would be based on population.
I am not alone, honourable senators, in realizing the danger in independence for the
different parts of the Empire. A great many

33

people are afraid of what would happen in the
event of disunity, with one part pulling
against another, but they are afraid to speak.
In the same way, a great many people do not
like to say what they think about the League
of Nations. I feel confident, honourable senators, that there will be an Imperial Parliament, although I may not live to see it. If
not, the only alternative is disruption of the
Empire.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I had intended to move the adjournnient of the debate at this stage, but I understand that it would fit more conveniently
into the plans of the right honourable leader
of the House if I spoke now. I shall make my
remarks as short as possible.
First I should like to say how fortunate it
is for us that the Government has selected such
able and outstanding men for appointment to
this Chamber. I desire to join with honourable members who have already expressed congratulations to our new leader (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen). And may I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to our former
leader, and of expressing my sorrow that ill
health forced him to relinquish his leadership.
I want to tell him that those of us who followed his work during the last session felt
the greatest admiration for the courage with
which he carried on his duties in spite of great
physical and, I am afraid, mental anguish. And
to our new leader I should like to say that
though perhaps the five years of his absence
from public life seemed long to him, they
seemed still longer to his friends in Parliament. And I think that probably they seemed
even longer to the people of my province
than to those of any other province. I say
that advisedly. A large share of the burdens
of the War fell on the shoulders of the right
honourable gentleman. It was often and often
repeated that lie was responsible and held
responsible throughout the country, and especially in the Province of Quebec, for most of
the sins of that hectic period. But that is
not true. He has many followers in Ontario,
where be now lives, and in the West, where
he made his home for many years, but if he
travelled throughout the Dominion to-day, I
doubt that he would find anywhere else as
many devoted friends as in the good old
Province of Quebec.
This afternoon we have listened to a number of addresses dealing yith existing conditions. It is probably true that this country,
within the lifetime of any person now living,
never experienced such strenuous times as
those through which we have been and still
are passing. But we have reason to hope that

we are n*ow on the way to better conditions,
and that though the whole werld may be
suffe'ring from. depression deeper than has ever
before been known. Canada is suffering les
than any other country and in many respecte
can be considered as in a specially fortunate
position. Perhaps it would flot be amiss to
quote here a letter issued on the 5th of this
month by Babson, whose competence in bis
own field no one wvill challenge. This je what
the latter says:
To niy Canadian friends 1 can give a distinct
word of cheer based on fundamental business
0f course, the Dominion je now
statistice.
paesing through the usual mid-winter quiet, but
sev eral factors point toward a forwvard movenient when spring arrives. Construction activities which in 1931 were 31 per cent below the
preceding year, should show a moderate upturn
during 1932. As eprinig advances considerable
construction and maintenance work will be
opened up, including road building, sewage
systelis, track laying, and general repair work.
Somue of these contracte alrcady have been
aNvarded.
Another important factor is gold production.
$55,000,000 of gold in
Canada produced
1931 compared with $43,453.600 in 1930 and
$39,861,663 in 1929. In 1932 production miay
be expected to further increase to around
$60.000,000. A favourable factor for the mines
ie the stable price of gold. whereas production
costs have been lowered and profit margins
inereased. Recent gains have also been sean in
production of automobiles and tires and in crude
rubiser imports. 0f course, world conditions
are stil] in confusion, tariff problems unsolved,
andl financial markets unsettled; but thse fondamiental position ot business in Canada is sound
and in fact better than in most other parts of
thec world.
There is. it seems, another factor that should
help to boister up our confidence in the future.
At the lat meeting of thse League of Nations
at Geneva it was patisetie to witness thse grand
nid statesman of France, M. Briand, facing
tise colla-pse of buis dream of the United States
of Europe, on which ha had based so mucis
hope. It seemed as if the different counitries
of Europe would continue along their separate
ways, each isolated by impas-saible tariff barriers. To-day the counitrics of the British Empire are in a muceh happier position, for tisey
are on tise eve of cntering into an agreemient
wisich wvou.ld resoîit in greatly stimulating their
trade. In the Britishs market, wvhich absorbs
yearly $650000,000 of imports, Canada participates now ondy tu thse extent of $50,000,000,
but under preferenice this country ought to
inercase its share in that trade very materially.
Honourable senators, -ie are undokubtedly
iacing a difficuit siWuatinn here at home. Our
finanicial condition is sucb that we have to
remit S300.000.000 to foreign countries every
year. or almnst a million dollars a day, and

loni .Mr.

BEAUBIEN.

exebange. Neyer before have we been saddled
with sucb a heavy burden.
Then we have a serinus railway problem, but
of that I prefer flot to speak at this time. An
able Commission bas been charged with the
duty of examining into thse whole matter, and
[ feel that we rnay well leave the problemn
to its wisdom. But I should like to speak
briefly on une subject which is of interest to
the whule ýof Canada and pamrticularly to
Quebec, and that is the St. Lawrencee waterways. The devel.opment of tise canal system
to its present stage bas been tise work nf botis
parties for the last sixty years. Expressed in
simple terms, that development has been
notising but tise enlargement of our canais in
an attempt tu kcep pace with the growing
demands nf shýipping. In the old days oanals
of 9, 12 or 14 feet were sufficienýt, but an additional increase in capacitv is required to provide accommodation for modern vessels. Viewed
fmom, that angle, there is nothing extraordinary
about it, un-less we regard tise Welland canal
as sonicthing out of tise way. Why sbould a
waterway of siýmilar size, from Lake Ontario
to Montreal, be iooked upon as an exceptional
accomplisisment for tise Goverriment, sometising quite out of tise way, something perbaps
unwise? We felt the nccessity nf improving
nur wvatcrways from Lake Ontairio west in
order to meet the conditions imposed by new
develapments in the world nf sipping,. Fmom
that point of viýew I do flot know that there
can be any very serinus objection to, tisis
projeet, but 1 must say tisat in many sections
ni the country tisera is an impression that perisaps tise time bas not been as well chosen as
it ýmight be to initiate a work which entails
sucis an expenditure.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

A billion dollars.

I realize that in
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
tise lives of nations as well as in thse lives nf
individual'i there are circumstances that, snmetimes compel themn to do things tbat tbey

that we are now feeling the natural pressure
ni fifty-,seven million peuple tributary to tise
St. Lawrence waterways. perhaps tise ricisest
peuple in the world, a peuple who produce
more per isead tison any other peuple in tise

worid. We must flot lose sight of the fact
that if they do flot flnd an outiet through the
St. Lawrence, which is the natural way, they
wiii find a new outiet through the New York
Canal from Oswego to Albany.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
beiong.

That is where they

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is where they
belong? Imagine how happy we in Canada
should be if ail the trade fromn the West, the
enormously important trade of these fiftyseven million people, should take the route to,
Albany instead of the route to Montreai.
What wouid we -then say to those who had
been responsible for letting this tremendous
opportunity slip from our grasp? What would
we do with the investment already made in
our canais? Is it possible to conoeive that
we couid run the risk of seeing the enormous
trade from that western portion of the continent turned away from Montreal and directed
to Albany? The risk may be regarded by
certain members of this House as neglîgible,
because it is true that the territory traversed
by the New York Canal is by no means as
suitable as that of the St. Lawrence rýoute;
but to make the New York Canai as useful
as the St. Lawrence route would entail an
increase in expenditure of but two or three
hundred million dollars, and what is that to
t.he United States with its colossal wealth?
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 8 o'ciock.
Hon. Mr. BEAUI3IEN: Honourable gentlemen, I want to be very careful not to go too
deeply into such a vast projeet as the St.
Lawrence waterways. I shail endeavour to
keep cioseiy to the argument which I intend
to iay before the flouse. 1 arn fully aware
that in a rnatter of this importance opinions
cannot be unanimous. I know perfectly well
that a great rnany factors upon which the
success or failuTe of the projeet will be determined are not now availabie, and will only
become so in the course of time. In other
words, as to the positive menit of the project
we have nothîng to go by but expert advice,
and, as we ail know, that is not necessarily
infallible. But I believe we shail have to consider whether we must go on with the work
sooner than we otherwise would, on account
of circumnstances over which we have no control. I arn thinking of existing political conditions in the neighbouring republie, which
are such that we may soon find it advantageous to enter now into certain negotiations.
41767-3à

35

I cannot deny that the time appears propitious
for us, £irom tha~t point of view. It may be that
political pressure wiil force the United States
Government to make a decision before the
next presidentiai elections, and should that
decision not be in favour of the natural route
by the St. Lawrence, then of course the other
available -route may be adopted.
But though the presenit time may be appropriate for negotiations, we shahl have to
give very grave thought to the cost of the
proposed underta-king. I know that the National Advisory Cornmittee suggested te the
former Government, led by the Right Hon.
Mackenzie King, an apparentiy simple method
for flnancing the entire schesne, and it seems
to me that we should examine the Committee's proposal, not with a view cd following it,
but !a-ther with the intention of carefullY
avoiding it. As aIl honourabie members know,
the Committee oonsidered the projet as corprising two sections, en international and a
national one. It was suggested that the
United States should pay for the entre work
in the international section, including the
canalization andi the develcspment of 8ome
1,100,000 horse-power -for Canada and a like
amýount of bydro .power for the United States.
So fan so gooti, but it seems to me that the
Committee's proposal as to the apportionment
of tshe cost of develcoping t.he national section
is most unjust. With youïr permission I shall
reati a couple cf paoeagra 4phs from the Committee's report:
We have oarefully considereti the financiai
aspects of the projeet. If it were seriousIy
suggested that Canada shouiti undertake to
finance as a public undertaking the immense
outiay that would be required even in the
domestic section of the St. Lawrence, or assume
one-haîf of the fresh financial obligations
invoiveti in the project as a whole, we wouid
unhesitatingly recommenti that no action be
taken until such time as the Dominion shal
have had opportunity to necoven from the heavy
finaniciai burdens imposed by the war, by our
raiiway obligations growing out of the war, and
by the necesaity, since the war ended, to flnd
the large sums requireti for needed public works
throughout the Dominion.
It la for honlourtable «nembeTs of this Bouse
to consî-den whether the conditions therein
referned te are not evenl worse at the present
time. The next paragr&ph reads:
We are of opinion, however, that an arrangement might be made which wouid niake possible
the undertaking at littie, if any, public expense,
s0 f ar as Canada is concerned. The St.
Lawrence, between Montreai and Lake Ontario,
consista of a national and an international section, and, with the exception of the Welland
Canai, the international pnoblem continues
throughout to the head of the Lakes. We
believe. that the flrst concern of this Committee
shouid be, and of the Government will be, the
national aspects of the proposeti undertaking,

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
decides to proceed with the project the cost
will be apportioned equitably for every part
of the Dominion.
Some honourable members may say that
this is flot the tirne to begin a work of such
great dimensions; that we should wait until a
better day dawns. That view may be right,
but engineers say that the international section cannot be completed in less than ten
years, whilst the national section could be
done in less than five years. So it is quite
possible that arrangements may be made to
proceed witýh the development of the international section, and in. the meantime Canada
can wait for the return of a more prosperous
period before assuming any burden in conne ction with the national section.
Il improveinent in world conditions can be
hoped for, it behoves us to ascertain how we
can the better hasten it along. It seems to
me that in this respect the primary and
fundamental necessity is the establishment of
permanent world peace. 1 may be wrong, but
it seems to me that, far removed as we are
from ithe source of aIl the troubles that have
visited Europe during the centuries--for
Europe has been nothing but a battlefiel.d-we
are apt to mistake sadly the conditions
essential to assure peace, 40o release oredit,
and thereby to re-establish economie prosperity. I hear people say, "It is abominable
to see how certain countries are monopolizing
the gold of the world." Will you allow me
to state briefly in this respect an explanation
given to me in Paris? It is this: People generally believe that the French nation captures
wbatever it can get of the gold of the world.
They fail to see that gold is sent to France as
Lo a country of refuge. That gold is left on
deposit and has to be invested. To-morrow
conditions may be such that France will no
longer continue to be a country of refuge, and
then the gold, like the birds, will take wings
and fly to some otheir refuge. What then will
ha.ppen to, France? France widl have to pay.
France, having invested the gold in her own
securities, will have to sell those securities, and
they will faîl in value. Just as soon as the value
of those securities drops, other consignments
of gold will be recalled, and more French
securities will be thrown on the market, thus
depressing values still further, and very soon
all the gold sent to France for refuge will
seek a haven in another -country. Do you
want evidence that gold concentrates in certain lands in an endeavour to seek protection?
Are you aware that HoLland has a gold cover
for her specie that exceeds 1,50 per cent?
About the sane condition exiats in Switzerland. Why? Because, rightly or wrongly,

37

the people thiroughou.t the world-in Germany,
perhaps, more than anywhere else-send their
godld ito the -countries where they think it will
be in safe keeping until such itime as they
require it.
This brings me down to disarmament. If
there wvas one. thing above any other that
impressed nie at the last meeting of the
Assembly of the League, it wvas the unanimous
accord on the essential fact that the only
foundation upon which better times could be
built gradually, but surely, was confidence.
Admirable speeches drove this conviction home
to the delegates. Sir Robert Cecil, for instance, gave a magnificent picture of conditions
throughout tbe world and showed bow it was
that people who were disposed to lend their
money to a country hesitated and then ahstained when they learned thait it could be
devastated, nay, practieally destroyed, overnight, by an attack froin the air with explosives and poisonous gases. Sir Arthur Salter
said that through lack of confidence the flow
of credit ivas suddenly interrupted in 192ý,
the stoppage leaving a gap to the extent of
two billion dollars in the usuwl credit requirements of the world. After lending lavishly,
the creditors of the world abruptly ceased providing funds, and this lef t a deficiency for the
normal needs of the business of the world.
How can it be supplied? Sir Arthur Salter,
like everybody else, affirms that the primary
condition for the reconstruction of the economie and financial activities of the world is
confidence.
It seems to me that in this country, as in
many other parts of the world far removed
from the immediate point of danger, people
look to disarmament as a means of security.
But, if 1 may venture the statement, the reverse is true. It is security that is the means
to attain disarmament. Do you believe that
any argument, even the most convincing,
could induce people to lay down their arma
and bare their breasts to the attack of the
enemy who, they know, or they think tiey
know, lurks just over their frontier?
It may be useful to bring to this Chamber
a whiff of the atmosphere of the Assembly
of the League at Geneva. Strange as it may
seem, those wbo comre from places farthest
removed from. the point of danger clamour the
loudest for disarmament. In other words, the
intensity of the demand for disarinament is
in direct ratio to the distance that separates
th-ose who make the demand fromn the danger
zone in Europe. 0f course we are vitally
interested in the peace of the world; neyertheless it is difflcult to conceive how anyone

what Lord Cecil may think about it now; perhaps he will not think I am going too far if I
eay that like myself he probably would not be
sorry if such an institution were ready to fune-

tion among the nations.
But what was not done and what perhape
can never be done again in the same way, muet
be sought in another form. We are drawing
near to the conclusion of a term, to a date towards which the peoples are looking with increasing expectation. When, on February 2nd,

all the nations of the world, representing the
highest ideal, the sum of authority and the sum

total of force, are met here solemnly together
for that particular purpose, when they are all
itting round the same table and have to consider thie twofold problem-the reduction of
armaments combined with recourse to juridical
guarantees and sanctions relating to securitywhat wil'l they do? That will be a solemn
moment; and I proclaim here and now that
never before has such a heavy responsibility
lain upon the nations. That will be a decisive
moment. Will they, who have power to do anything they choose, leave unanswered, staring
then in the face, that terrible question-mark
that still haunts us? That is the issue.
When that moment comes, all they need do is
to utter the necessary words to supplement in
the matter of security and mutual assistance
what has already been donc; all. they need do is
solemnly to affirm with a full rea.lisation' of the
consequences which their words imply: "No
more war! In no case. for no reason, in no circumstances will we allow war, which we have
pilloried as a crime. to blaze forth again and
still remain unpunished!"
They will have power to ensure that such an
event shal never occur again. They will say
whether they wish to establish contact with one
another and to create between themselves reciprocal conditions of security such as to render
it impossible.
But I must not weary the House. Suffice
it to say that most of his audience must have
convinced that before demolishing

proceed to build up security.
security can be built in two ways-either by
the use of the weapons that already belong to
the League, or by throwing back of it the

weapons that the big Powers hdld in their
grasp, and especially by their coalition against
aggression. Therefore, the whole problem is
not disarmament, but security.
A word on the cancellation of international
debts. Of course, we are interested deeply in
any move that may permit the re-establishment of prosperity, and particuilarly of foreign
trade. We must not forget that Canada
reacts very deepily to any commotion or
disturbance felt in Europe. We are the fifth
trading nation in the world, and conditions in
the wide universe affect vitally our commerce and foreign trade. Now, I want to lay
this before you. Is it true that the cancellation of all international debte would have the
beneficial effect that is often claimed for it? I

will give you just one authority. If the request

39

that seems to be made by a great many people
should be granted, the result would be this.
Listen to Sir Walter Leighton: "If aill the
war debts and reparations were wiped out,
somebody would have to pay. A rather
strange picture would emerge. -Germany would
be lef t with oniy £500,000,000 sterling of international debt, or £8 per head; France with
approximately £2,300,000,000 of international
debt, or £56 per head; the United States with
£3,200,000,000 of debt, or £27 per head; Great
Britain, after allowing for the elimination of
the debt to the United States, with international debts of £6ß00,0O0,000, or £150 per
head. And (pemeive that Germany, after
wiping her slate cldean of past indebtedness
through her first failure, and when perhaps on
the verge of repeating the operation, would
be given a quittance which would ailow her
to enter the race without a handicap, while
all the other competing nations in the industrial field would have crushing debts such
as I have mentioned." Germany's debt would
be $40 per head; Canada's-do not forget
this-Canada's, $250 per head; Great Britain's,
$750 per head. Is this reasonable? Will
anybody, knowing exactly the consequences,
such as are pointed out by Sir Walter
Leighton, agree to the proposal?
And that is not all. In what condition is
Germany to-day? Germany is poor; yes,
Germany is terribly poor; she is absoiutely
unable to get the £80,000,000 required to pay
her yearly indebtedness under the Young plan.
That is true. She is poor in money. But
anybody who has traversed Germany knows
how rich she is in all that is necessary for her
industry and exportation.
I am not going to give you my own testimony, though I went through Germany at a
time when she was building her industrial
equipment at a tremendous rate, with the
marks she was selling throughout the world at
what she could get for them. They did not
cost Germany a cent except just the machinery
and the paper and the industry to sell them in
foreign. countries, get the cash in, and put the
cash very deeply and solidly into structures
firmly anchored in the soil. And when such
constructions and equipments are complete,
who can take them away? Besides, Germany
has a population perhaps more efficient than
any other in Europe, hard-working, intelligent
and systematic. All is ready and in waiting,
but the moment has not come. But if it does
come, and if there is a cancellation of debts,
what chance has Canada or Great Britain to
compete with Germany? Not one in a
thousand.
Therefore, when it is repeated that there is
only one way out of the difficulty, and that

FEBRUARY 9, 1932
privilege, the honour, the luck, and perhaps
in sorne instances the discomfort, of sitting in
another place and developing facility in debate. Partly on account of my youth and
partly on account of my lack of ability and
of experience, I feel that I arn here rather to
get than to give information. But to-night I
humbly venture to make a few remarks.
Most of the important problems facing this
country have been thoroughly discussed.
Much bas been said about Imperial trade, and
the necessity of finding some means to, improve it. Let us hope that an effective means
will resuit froma the next Imperia] Economie
Conference, ta be held in Ottawa. Reference
xvas made also to the question of international
disarmament, and I am sure we ail trust that
the present conference at Geneva will make
real progress towards a settiement of this
grave question.
The bonourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) alluded to our
railway problem, which is a vital one to-day,
and mentioned the fact that about twentyfour hours ago, in another place, the right
honourable the Prime Minister laid the blame
for tbe existing mess at the door of the party
to ivhich he does not belong. I agree with
the views expressed by the honourable senator
on this matter, and I think there is considerable exaggeration in the accusation against
the party now out of power. 1 wish to add
a thought that bas occurred to me. We have
in Canada now three transcontinental railways, which have been finding it very difficuit
to earn enough to, meet expenses, yet in an
attempt to relieve the unemployment situation there is now being built a fourth transcontinental highway, which must inevitably
resuit in increasing the competition that the
railways already face. We ail know that their
severest competition to-day cornes from
motor trucks, and to the extent that the new
highway facilitates truck traffie it will make
successful railway operations; more difficuit.
The financial situation of our country has
been fully dealt with by honourable members
wbo are more able than I to handle huge
figures. 1 believe that whenever an effort is
made to curtail public expense there should
be a simultaneous attempt to lower proportionately the cost of living. My honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
spoke in a very interesting way about the
deep waterways. As I have always been more
or less fearful of swimming in deep water, I
will not tackle that subjeet, although I wish
to say that we should be very careful in ahl
our dealings with the republie to the south.
As a reminder of how we have fared in the

pa.st we need only glance at the map of Canada and notice the buge indentations which
the States of Vermont -and Maine make in the
international boundary line. If that reminder
be not sufficient, we can look at the Alaskan
Panhandle. In spite of the abilitty with wvbich
Canada's dlaims to that territory were asserted
by the veteran senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Ayleswortb), the representatives of the Mother Country gav e their
decision in favour of the United States.
My main purpose in rising this evening was
te, refer to wvhat I consider to, be anc of our
most serious problems, and one that dernands
an early solution, namely unemployment. I
think' it is not only distressing but ridiculous
to undertake huge public works for the sake
of giving employment to a limited number of
men in certain localities, while elsewhere an
equal number of persons are dismissed from
their positions. In my opinion the remedy
on which we can with most reason pin aur
bopes is a systematically organized movement
back to the land. By that I mean two things:
first, some means of enabling the unemployed
in our cities to move from the cold and dry
pavements, where carrots and turnips cannat be grown, to the soul that gave a living to
their ancestors; and secondly, the instituting
of a scheme of repatriation whereby many of
our fellow countrymen who have emigrated
to the United States would be induced to
return ta Canada. I was pleased to note a
few days ago that, according to a report presented in the Quebec Legislature, over 800
families bad returned from the United States
to this country in the course of the last
twelve months, as a result of the invitation
land co-opera-tion of a far-seeing Government
that even went se, far as to give financial
assistance to people who wished to return ta
the land of their forefathers.
One of the leading financial authorities in
the City of Montreal, Mr. Beaudry Leman,
General Manager of the Banque Canadienne
Nationale, said a little while ago that in order
to get relief from some of our most pressing
burdens we shall haee to increase aur population. The more people we have bere, the
more traffic there will be for our railroads;
and the larger the number of our consumers,
the less likely'are we ta bave over-produc'
tion. The more taxpayers we have, the
greater will be the receipts of the Canadian
treasury, wbile the propartionate share of aur
individual taxes will be lowered. As aur
population grows the northern part of aur
country will be developed. We should be
grateful ta Providence that we do nat have

SENATE

42

to look to a neighbouring country for room
for our people. It has been stated by an
authority in colonization matters that the
northern part of one province alone can give
a living to 300,000 families.
I think that careful study should be given
to the possibilities of a back-to-the-land movement, especially at the present time, when we
are finding it so difficult to take care of the
unemployed. In the Province of Ontario, the
Government bas removed squads of young men
to the north to help in the building of the
transcontinental highway; but the relief given
in that way is only temporary, for after they
have been separated from their homes a few
months they will flock back to the cities and
help to inake the problem as bad as ever. On
the other hand, if our Governments would
sincerely endeavour to open up new lands in
the north and give financial assistance to
families, the resulting relief would be permanet. I happen to come from one of the
largest industrial centres in Ontario, and I
au sorry to ay that conditions are such there
that I besitate to quote figures for fear of
startling lionourable members.
But I wili
s ta te this, that I arn a member of a relief
connii
uittee, in one of Ithe border municipalitics,
where froi 75 to 85 per cent of the people
are livina on public funds. Such a stite of
affairs is more than alarming. Of course, I
rcalize that the situation is partly due to the
faet that we bave been trying to take care
of about 22,000 people who formerly worked
in the Citv of Detroit, and many of whon
we have had to feed this winter.
As a doctor, I believe that back-to-the-land
movement is one of the most effective remedies
that can be prescribed for our national ills.
It would not be necessary for people to take
the treatment three times a day, before or

Next Thursday in the City of Montreal

honourable members some more detailed and

INSURANCE COMPANIES
DOMINiON
STATUS AND POWERS BILL
FIRST READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN introduced
Bill Cl, an Act respecting the Status and
Powers of Dominion Insurance Companies.
He said: This is a companion to the Bill
respecting Britibh and Foreign Companies,
which was introduced two days ago.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
Bill be re ad the s.econd tinte?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

To-morrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the right honourable gent lentan sawv any advantage in our
taking the second reading imnimediately, in
order that the public, and particularly the
parties specially interested, might examine the
Bill before it is referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, to which probably
the right honourable gentleman will desire
to send it. we might take the second reading
to-morrow with the consent of the House.
The discussion of the proposed measure might
well be postponed until the Committee mets.
I do not suppose there will be any discussion
on the principle of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am grateful to the honourable senattor for the suggestion. The reason I mentioned to-morrow
was that I anticipated that the second reading of the companion Bill will be moved then.
I should be very glad if the House would
follow the suggestion of the honourable
senator and permit the second reading of this
Bill also to-morrow, because I know it would
bc wise to allow time to intervene before the
Committee takes the Bill into consideration,
in order that those specially interested in insurance might have an opportunity to peruse
the Bill and to be heard.

THE JUDICIARY
APPOINTMENT

0F SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. McMEANS rose in accordance
with the f ollowing notice of motion:
That a Special Committee composed of the
honourable senators Bureau, Oasgrain, Gillis,
Griesbach, Hardy, Logan, MeGuire, MeMeans,
Planta, Robinson and Tanner be appointed to
examine into the system of appointing judges
as at present existing, and report upon the
necessity of taking some steps by which the
number of judges may be reduced, and the
systemi of appointments equalized.
He said: I would ask that with the indulgence of the House the following words be
added to my motion:
That the said Committee be authorized to
send for persona, papers and records.
Also that the namnes of Senators Bar-nard and
Laird be added to the names of members
of the Committee.
The proposai to appoint a committee to
deal with this matter received the unanimous
approval of the House last session. When
the Committee met it was f ound necessary
to obtain a great deal of information from the
different provinces in regard to the number of
judges and the, work they had to perforai.
During the intervening time the Deputy Minister of Justice has been endeavouring to get
the information for us. Some of it-not ail.
I understand, but a great deal-has corne to
hand. We hope that if this special committee is appointed we shall be able to present
a statement to the House before '.1e end of
the session.
I do not think there is anything further to
be said, and I would move the motion with
those amendments for which I have asked
the indulgence of the House.
The motion, as amended, was agreed to.
THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
APPOINTMENT

OF SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That a Special Committee of nine senators
to be bereafter named, be appointed for the
purpose of taking into consideration the report
of a Special Committee of the House of
Commons, of the last session thereof, to investigate the Beauharnois Power Project, in so far
as said report relates to any honourable members of the Senate, said Special Oommittee to
hear such further evidence on oath bearing on
the subjeet-matter of such report in relation to
any such honourable members of the Senate as
it may deem desirable and in accordance with
constitutional practice, and that the said Coinmittee he authorized to send for persona, papers

and records.
He said: I beg to put this motion before
the Senate. There is nothing that I desire

to say at the present time further than to
confirm my statement as to my personal attitude, and the attitude which I believe should

and does exist on the part of every honourable member of this House.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: Honourable
senators, I beg to move. seconded by the
honourable senator from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) :
That the fourth report of the Special Comnmnittee of the House of Commons appointed to
investigate the Beauharnois Power Projeet, laid
on the Table of the Senate on the lst of August,
1931, be referred to the Special Committee of
the Senate appointed for the purpose of taking
far as
into consideration the said report in s0 of the
it relates to any honourable members
Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn under the
impression that the evidence did not accompany the report.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Shall we leave
it to the Committee to move for the tabling
of that evidence?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator is right. I had some question
in my own mind as to whether the Committee
would be in a position to obtain the evidence
without the interposition of this buse, but
I had corne to the conclusion that the point
might well be lef t to the Committee. If they
choose to ask that we intervene and obtain
the evidence, we can quickly do so. However,
1 have no doubt that, should the honourable
senator (lion. Mr. Dandurand) care to confer
with me on the subjeet, if a better method
could be found, we could agree, and it would
be followed.

The motion was agreed to.

an inapt illustration. Ha had a wonderful
power of throwing before the eye a gleaming
picture of his presentation, so that young and
old of ail classes, however iii they might have
been versed in the subject beforehand, knew
just what he was driving home. He was a
master of the platform, perhaps the greatest
stumper this Dominion bas produced.
In bis later years the role of gladiator wvas
thrown aside and bis whole life was devoýted
to service in a sphere which had captured his
imagination, indeed saized his whola being.
He devoted the evening of bis 11f e to, trying
to advaace the cause of one of this world's
great necessities, a cause which was impressed
upon bis mind indelibly by the tragic avents
of the War. His interest in the Leagua of
Nations was such that to promote its mission
there was no service too arduous, no toil too
bard. In those years he forgot what domestic
enemies and political opponents were; hie was
the great Canadian, fighting for what he halieved te, be a high and noble ideal, ona that
in his judgment mankind had to achieve if
the world was to be saved.
I speak with some emotion of Sir George
Foster, and I know that in racording the
affection that I feel for bis memory I do
little more than refleet the feeling on the
part of aIl bonourabla members of this House.
To bis widaw, I am sure, goes out the sympatby of aIl bonourable senators. We trust
that those lef t to, moura in the familles of the
four departed will ever rest assurad that tbey
have the very tenderest good wishas of the
surviving colleagues of those who have gone.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
membars of the Senate, it is witb some diffidence that I risa to follow my right honourable friend in speaking of the matter wbich
is now before us. Witb sncb felicity of
thought and language bas bie discharged bis
task. that 1 might refrain fromn adding anythiag. However, as I have sat for a number
of years with the senators Nvhosa nainas bave
been meationed, I feel it my duty to join
with the right honourable gentleman in declaring that the departure of our late colleagues
is a great loss to, the Senate. I will not
repeat what bas been said of their careers.
They eadeared tbemselvas to their colleagues
by their geniality, their humanîty and their
devotion f0 their work ia this Chamber.
We recognize wbat Canada owes to the
Maritime Provinces when we bend over the
departed. Senators Farrell, Crowa, Curry and
Foster aIl were bora in tbe Maritime Provmnes. Three of t.bem ef t those provinces and
enricbcd other communities by their preseace,
their work and their talents. Senator Crowe

45

weat to Vancouver, helped ta build that city,
and developed with it. He was racognized
by aIl as a leader, and wüs esteemed and belýoved by aIl. Sanatar Curry extendad bis
activity to the city of Mnntreal, where hie was
interested in many financial and industrial
undertakings.
His advice was sougbt by
many, and, as the right bonourable gentleman
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighen) bas sajd, hae played
an important part in the development of
industry in this country.
As to Sir George Foster, he is now part of
Can-adian history. It is difficuIt to, picture bis
carear within the comipass of a few phrases.
It stands to ba portrayed at greaiter langtb.
He wss a schoilar, a man of c-ulture, -an oratar.
H-aving been a university profeasor, hae had
acquired a training that prepared iim for bis
public work in the -country and in Parliamant.
Ha bad as clear a mind as could be met with
anyweee, and during the fifty years of bis
public life no one in Canada st'ood bigher la
oratorical ability. Sir Wilfrid Laurier more
than once told me be had the greatest admiration for the talents cf our late colle-ague,
who, hae said, bad no pear as an orator in the
Housa of Gommons during the -time hae sat
there. Not only for bis record in this Chamber and in the buse of Commons were w-e
proud of ihim, but also for bis accamplishmaats
abroad, and especially at Genavu. I had the
advantage of hearing hlm there in 1929, and I
know that bis speeches rank am.ong the best
that were delivered by -the most brilliant
statasmen fromn ail the countrias reprcsanted
at the session of the League of Nations thiat
year. I am sure that Canadas prestige
throughout the world was enhanoed by the
rapu-tation hie made then, aad at othar meetings of the League, in 1920 and 1926.
I join with my right honourable friand la
axprassing the sympathies of this Chambar to
the families of our departed firiands.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER: Honouraible
senators, the death. of aur four departed colkcaguas is a serious bass to the Senata and to
the whola country. I wish to refer particul'arly ta Sir George Eulas Foster. Sinýca I
first eatared this Chanbr-and that is a long
time ago--I have witnesad the daparture of
very many membars. Among them nana was
more prom-inent than Sir George Euilas Foster.
Ha occujpied -a peculiar, a unique, position in
the parliamentary annals of Canada. Ever
to the fr-ont, in the thick of action, equally
formidable in attack and defence, hae neyer
rose to the siipreme conmma.nd; yet in hlma

certainly was among the greatest orators that
this couintry-and I might say the Empirebas produced. As the right honourable leader
of the Býouse bas said, hie was equally ýat
borne on the rostrum -and in Parliament. The
definition of an orator wbich an ancient
rheteorician has left us, "a virtuous man, versed
in tbe art of diction," applied to him. For
besides being tbe great speaker that we al
knew bima to be, hie was essentially virtuous,
or, as we say now, an honest man. Tbe activitýics of bis life beg-an with Übe teaaobing of

bis country and to, bumanity. Be is gonegone for ever. We shal rneet him in tbe

BOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING
Bon. G. H. BARNARD moved the second
reading of Bill AI, an Act with respect te
Hospital Sweepstakes.
He said: Honourahie senators, after the
three v.ery cloquent addresscs te which w'e
have just listened, upen the careers of our
departed colleagues, I feel that it is possibly
a somiewhat ungracieus act te corne down te
the commooplace business of the day. Bowever that rnay be, thoughi ment may corne and
rnen rnay go, the business of the country
muiiit go on. Something bail te be taken up
as the first itrni on the Order Paper, and it
happenied to be rniy motion, the proposai of
w hich at this tirnte rnay net mciet with the
approval of ail honourable încrnbers, or even
of a rnajority. But bail soute other ineasure
pi eccded rnine, it aiso iiiglit have failed te
rneet with entirc approval.
The Bill, with the exception of an amendment to whichi I shahl refcr later, is the saine
as ene that 1 introduced last session and that
aftcr a sornewhiat storrn3 career fell by the
waysidc-argeiy ewing, pes.,ibly, to the cequence of one of our departed friends. Notwjtlistanding the discuss~ion of lait ycar, I
hav c ne[ changed iny opinions in the least,
as te the rneasure.
11011. Mr. POIRIER.

ht is net nccessary for rne to make a lengthy
explanation of the Bill. To put it shoirtly, the
objeet of it is te legalize, under the auspices
of the Attorney General of any province that
rnay sec fit te take advantage of it, a systemi
of sweepstakes, the proceeds te mnure te the
benefit of hespitals in the province in which
it is hieIn. I do net need te elaborate upon
the conditions, financial and ether, cf hospitais
in the different provinces. Lt is sufficient te
say that these conditions are even more
deplorable te-day than they were twvelve
menths ago. In my own Province of British
Columbia the Provincial Government bas
stîx ed notice upon these institutiens and the
inunicipalities that ewing te the absolute necessity for the strictest economy the grants
te the institutions are going to ho eut.
Subseriptions frem private individuals have
I
always been another source of revenue.
irnagine it is net necessary te tell bonourable
rnernbers of this Bouse that private incornes
throughiout the whohe country bave been
serieusly dirninished during the last year. In
addition te our other troubles, we are ail
faced with the prospect of greatiy increased
taxation by the Dominion and Provincial
Gevertnncnts, and, in my ewn part of the
ceuntry, by the municipalities. The resuit of
ail these circum-itances undouhtedly will ho
1hat tbe provincial, municipal and private
grants te bespitals wvill be extensiveiy reduced. Since I arrived in Ottawa a few days
ago I have reeeived an appeal f rom tbe
directors; of the Provincial Royal Jubilee
Hespital in Victoria, which is, I think, the
largest public Protestant hospitai in the Province of British Columbia out-side the city of
Vancouver. The appeal reads in part as follows:
Existing cenditions threugheut the world are
baving a direct effeet on the financiai position
of the Provincial Royal Juhilee Hospital.
The directors of tue institution are rnaking
every effort toe conoinize on rnaintenane
expendi tu res. but ini spite of their endeavours,

I bappen te be aware of serne of the facts

FEBRUARY 11, 1932
Unless something is done to relieve the situation, the final outcome will nlot be in the
best interest of the people nor of the province.
If this Bill becomes law it ivili, 1 believe,
provide a source of revenue which cannot
be obtained in any other way. It will be the
means of getting contributions-I do not
mean in a philanthropie sense-from. untold
numbers of residents of British Columbia who
otherwise would not think of giving one cent
te hospitals, although they might be quite
ready to receive the benefit of their services
in time of need. And then, no doubt, tickets
would be sold in the United States, and thus
a certain revenue would be received from
people in that country. A further resuit of
the Bill would be to put a check on the flow
of money that has been going from this
country-at least, fromn my province-to, purchase tickets for sweepstakes in various parts
of the world, such as the Irish Sweepstakes,
the Calcutta Sweepstakes, the London Stock
Exchange Sweepstakes, and others.
I have already mentioned that the present
Bill is different ini one respect from the one
previously introduced. Last session the honourable senator from. De Salaberry <Hon. Mr.
Béique) gave notice of intention to introduce
certain amendments, the effect of which. was
to provide that the sale of tickets on any
authorized sweepstakes in any province should
be confined, within the Dominion of Canada,
te the province in which the sweepstakes were
authorized. That is te say, if we chose to
take advantage of this plan in British Columbia, we could not seil sweepstakes tickets in
Ontario, or Quebec, or any other province, but
we should not be prevented from selling them
in the United States, for example, or in any
other foreign country. I was agreeable to such
amendiments last year, and I have incorporated
them in the Bull.
One point that perhaps was flot given as
mucb consideration last year as it should have
been is that the proposai is not to legalize
the operation of sweepstakes for the bene-ft of
any individual. The Bull provides that the
Attorney General of any province which decides to take advantage of this plan shahl have
the power te appoint a committee to conduct
the sweepstakes, and that hie may make regulations as to the percentage of receipts that
may be allowed respectively for expenses of
operation, contributions to hospitals, and
prizes. Furthermore, the Attorney General
may make regulations providing for the auditing of the accounts of the conducting coinmittee, in a manner satisfactory to himself.
Sbould any of my honourable friends froni
Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, or any other prov-

47

ince, feel tbat they cannot conscientiously
support thie Bill, or that the people they
represent would not like to see it become law,
may I remind them that if the Bill is passed,
the Attorney General of each province-and,
I suppose, his opinion would be that of bis
Governnment-would
refuse to authorize
sweepstakes if the public opinion of the province were opposed to tbem. Ail that this Bill
does is to enable sweepstakes to be hehd in
any province in which, in the opinion of its
Government or the principal law officers of
that Government, the public would desire it.
I understand and appreciate quite well that
there are in thîs country a number of people
wbo conscientiously objeet to money being
raised in this way; but the oly arguments
which. I have heard adduced in favour of their
contention do not appeal to me. 0f course,
it is a matter for every man's conscience; but
to my friends who have so strenuously opposed this messure in the past I would say
that this Bill is at least a fair, honest, and, I
think, practical attempt to deal witb the solution of a problem which is presented. If they
do not agree with it, if they feel constrained
to vote it down, ail I can say to them is that
I think it behooves them at least to suggest
some other method of financing the institutions to which I refer.
With these few remarks, I beg te move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. L. McMEANS:
Honourable gentlemen, I want -to congratulate the mover of this
Bill on the very plausible way in which he
has introduced it. I believe it contains many
meritorious clauses. However, I would point
out this fact, that sometimes a Bill passed by
this Senate and sent te the otber Chamber,
no matter how meritorious, is simply put upon
the lise of private members' Bills, to which
only one hour a week is allotted. Then if
anybody wants the Bill defeated, it may be
put down at the bottoin of the list and neyer
be reached. I think we have had a good deal
of experience of that kind. On no less than
four different occasions, 1 think, this Huse
passed a Bill in regard to divorce, it went to
the lower Chamber, was sponsored there by a
private memnber, and, as only one hour a week
was given to private members' Bills, it met
the usual fate of such proposais.
Though I voted against the present Bill
last session, I am not inclined te vote against
it this year, so far as my present knowledge
goes. But the point to which. I desire to caîl
attention is this. After the Upper Chamber
bas spent time in deliberating upon this or
any other Bill, and has passed it, why should
the other House treat us in such a way that,

FEBRUARY 11, 1932
My honourable
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
friend, not beiog an expert, should flot talk
on this.
Hýon. Mr. DANDURAND: But what 1 want
to draw attention to is the 'fact that by
voting for this Bili and thus opening the
door for these very laudable institutions
throughout the country, we are sanctioning
pro tanto the principle of the lottery. 0f
course 'the hospitals are undoubtedly suffering
to-day from lack of funds. I need flot go to,
the Pacifie Coast for experience in that
respect. I notice it in Montreral. I arn not
disposed to alter rny views in this matter. I
shall not be scandalized 'if there is in this
Chaniber a rnajori.ty that differs with me, but
we must proceed with our eyes open and see
exaetiy to what principle we are adhering.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honouraible gentlemen,
I arn not .going to repeat the reimarks I made
last ye-ar, but I wish to say a few words. The,
logic of the honourable senator from. Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. MeMeans) was that we shouid
report this Bili and let it be defeated later.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I did not say thaýt.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I have not changcd my
mind on this question since last year. Our
action in defeating this measure then bas met
wit'h the approval of people ail over Canada.
Wherever I have gone in our Western country
I have been miith surpriscd to find that the
people, particularly the chorch -people, 'have
very strongly commended the Senate for defeating the Bill.
I quite agree with the honourable senator
from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) that the
hospitals are in distress, but their situation is
sirnilar to that of rnany other institutions.
We are struggling along. Our hospitais are
being fairly well supported, and I think that
support wiil be continued even if this Bill is
defeated, because hospitaIs are institutions in
.upporting whieh the people of this country
take great pride.
I think this should be pointed out as a very
serious matter, that the passage of this Bill
would result in notbing more nor less than
a systern of public gambling which would tend
to lower the moraiity of the people of this
country. That being the case, I think this
House, foilowing the course it took hast year,
should vote this Bill down. At any rate, I
arn going to oppose the second reading of the
Bill.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: HonourabIe members, 1 shouid like to say a f ew words in
favour of this Dill. If ail we hear said
about it is true, I :arn wondering what kind of

49

people those Irish people are. I had the
pleasure of visiting them a couple of years
ago, and I thought they had a loveiy country,
and that they were good people. I did not
think they were depraved gamblers; they dîd
not appear to be; and I came away from Ireland under the impression that theirs is just
as good a country as ours, with people just as
weil behaved as wc are, notwithstanding that
tbey carry on these sweepstakes.
0f course I may be bad myseif. Perhaps I
should make a confession. I began my
gambling career many years ago. I arn sure
rny first depravity occurred at a cburch bazaar,
where 1 threw dico for a picture of Daniel
0'Connell. I won the picture, and I have it yet,
and arn proud of it. 1 do not feel one bit
the worse for having thrown dice. 1 think
I have bought lottery tickets by the hundred
-at church bazaars or from religious organizations, if you please-and I nover feit any
worse, and I neyer saw that the religious organizations were any worse.
I have been amused at what happens sometimes in Nova Scotia, particuiarly in Halifax,
where we have a few Chinarnon. Those poor
f ellows meet in the evenings, above their
laundry shops, to play a game of fan-tan,
and the first thing they know, the patrol
wagon is down at the door, and the police
bundie them in and take them to the lockup.
Thle next day they are lyrought before the
stipend-ia.ry magistrato. Yet flot more than a
hundred yards away are men and wornen
pi'aying poker and forty-five and euchro and
several other gamaes for rnoney, but not a
word is ever said to them-I suppose,
beoause they are Christians. The poor Chinaman is locked up in jaii because he plays a
littie garne of fan-tan.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

That is garnbling.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Is this thing wrong,
or is it right? I go out to this race-course
near Ottawa, or to one in Montreal or
Toronto, and buy a ticket. I bet on a horse.
I may pay $2, which wili buy two tickets.
Everyhody says that is ail right, and the law
says it is ahl right. There is no fine, no moral
off once. Dut if I buy a ticket on a horse in
the Irish Sweepstakes, or the races at Epsom,
or any race over in England, I arn at once a
crimainal. I arn headed for the jail if anybody
finds me out. Where is the principie of the
thing? Where is the principle in letting
religious or any other kind of organizations
run lottories if it is wrong to do so? If the
lottery is wicked, if it is immoral, why do we
not wipe it out? Why make a law that
aIiows me to buy a ticket on a race at Ottawa

41767--4
RM-IBED
EDITION

SENATE

and prevents me from spending ten shillings
on a race in England? Where is the logic of
it? It is said, "Oh, too many people will buy
tickets." As I see it, under this Act the
lottery can be regulated-it can be brought
under control. For that matter, I should
judge that if the Attorney General wanted
to do so he could make such strict regulations that he would know the nane of every
person who bought a ticket. What is the use
of shutting our eyes to the facts? Everybody in Canada is buying sweepstake tickets,
and the money is going somewhere else. We
know it. People tell me they have tickets,
and I know of people in this city, and in
Nova Scotia, who have bought thea by the
book. You cannot stop the practice. Is it
not better to try to regulate it and bring it
under authority? I cannot see where the principle comes in if we legislate to let John
Smith buy a ticket and refuse to let Tom
Jones buy one. John Smith wants to buy a
ticket on a race at Toronto; Tom Jones wants
to buy a ticket on a race in England. One
man is all right, a Christian, a good-living
man; the other is a criminal. That is what
we say.
We have tried the plan of making people
good by law, and we know how we succeeded
in regard to the liquor business. I say we
ought to be reasonable about this. There are
certain laws and regulations that appeal to
the consciences of the people, and that they
are willing to obey; there are other laws that
do not appeal to their consciences, and that
you cannot make them obey. All you do by
laws of the latter kind is to make crirninals.
On this continent we have made more
criminals under the liquor laws than have
been made by any other system ever invented, and we are still making criminals
every day by trying to enforce laws against
people making a bet on a horse. People are
being chased around by policemen and contables, and are declared to be criminals when
they are not. All they want is to be free.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members. when this Bill was before the
House last session I had the pleasure of supporting it, and I intend to support it again.
I have been reading the arguments directed
against the Bill by that peerless orator, that
Rupert of debate, unsurpassed in forensic
eloquence and clarity of expression, whose
voice will never again be heard in this Chamber, and I am of the firm opinion that the
right honourable gentleman had a wrong
mental attitude when he approached the subject. He said:
Hon.

ir.

TANNER.

It is, in fact, the complete apotheosis of
chance. Through it the winners of prizes are
determined by chance, and chance alone, and in
that respect it is the most dangerous and most
demoralizing form of gambling.
I am surprised that such a master of English,
a gentleman who so well understood the
meaning of words, shouid have fallen into the
idea that this Bill was in nature a gambling
Bill. I have taken the trouble to look up the
word "gambling" in the Oxford Dictionarythat "well of English undefiled"-and nowhere
do I find a definition that covers this case.
Not only does the definition of gambling not
cover this case, but it says that all games
of chance are not gambling. I will read it:
To play games of chance for money for unduly
high stakes; to stake money in extravagant
amount on some fortuitous event. As the word
is, at least in serious use, essentially a term of
reproach, it would not ordinarily be applied te
the action of playing for stakes of trifling
amounts, except by those who condemn playing
for money altogether.
Now, gambling is playing for stakes. In
buying a ticket on a lottery nobody is playing
for stakes. The right honourable gentleman
says:
In the first place, there would be a reversal
of the policy and practice of Canada since
Confederation-to go back no farther. It would
resuit in the exploitation of human weakness
such as is evinced in an inordinate desire for
money, or to get sonething for nothing, or to
"get rich quick" at the expense of someone else.
That, I think, is a definition of gambling, but
the essential element of getting rich quickly
at somebody else's expense is entirely wanting
in a lottery snch as would be authorized by
this Bill.
I need not go further. The honourable
gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
has shown the absurdity of the contention
and the hypocrisy of the statement that such
a Bill as this authorizes gambling. I have
gambled, but the only place I ever had an
opporttunity to do so was in that great, public,
lawful casino, the stock market.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
out?

How did you come

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Lost
every time. Not only have we established a
stock market, but we have framed that
monstrous thing the cornpany law of the
Dominion of Canada in order to permit,
foster and encourage gambling of every kind,
colour and description; we have gone back to
the condition preceding the passing in England
of the Bubble Act, the purpose of which was
to restrain gambling-gambling wbich was
disastrus to the whole world. We encourage

and facilitate gambling by extending and extending the chanices under our comjpany laws,
and that a people tike oureives, whose chief
industry is garnbling, should. condem.n this Bili1
passes my understanding.
The only otheT thing I have to say la thoit
the honourable gentleman f rom Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. MocMeans) is quite uniresonable.
He has said that a Bill thaît passes tii House,
a branch of Parliament, hma no ehance in the
House of Commons, but is pushed aside. He
must remnber that this is a deinocratie
oountry and that the voice of detmocracy la
the voice of God. Perhap tihat la the reason
Vhey do not listen to it.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable gentlemen,
I move tihe adjournment of the deibate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the debate

who introduced the Bill wouîd give us figures
showing how rnuch money IredIand has been
rnaking out of this systesu. I arn surprised
at the last speaker (Hon. Mr. Lyncb-Staunton).
He comes from Ireland, and il lie votes for
this Bill lie will not be weleomed back thlere.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ýCASGRAIN: Perhaps the honourable gentleman who introduced the Bill
would tell us how mucli money Ireland is
getting out of the sweepstakes. Why, in my
own house in Montreal tickets galore have
been bouglit for the next sweepstake in
Ireland.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: 1 do not know

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I cannot tell my
honourable friend the total amount of money
that has been received in respect of these
sweepstakes in Ireland, but I can give hima
some details from the report on the last one,
the Mancliester Handicap, which was run in
November. The total prize money was
£1,942,164, which was divided into nineteen
prize units of £100,000 each and ten prizes of
£4,216 8s. each. 0f the total received-and
ail the money was not Irish money; mucli
of it went from Canada, which is one of the
points in favour of my BilRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What was the
amount of the balance lef t for Ireland?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I will send the
information over to my honourable friend, if
lie wants it. Out of the total amount 20
per cent, I think, is allowed for expenses, and
30 per cent for hospîtals. I say that subject
to correction. The balance goes in prizes.
The debate was adjourned.
BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSURANCE
COMPANIES STATUS AND POWERS
BILL
SECOND READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill B 1, an Act respecting
the Status and Powers of British and Foreign
Insurance Companies in Canada.
He saîd: Honourable senators, possibly I
owe a brief explanation to the House of the
purpose of this measure, and of its companion measure, wbich, was introduced to-day.
There has been a series of deliverances of the
Privy Council affecting the powers of the Dominion of Canada, and differentiating them
from the powers of the provinces, in relation
to the status, powers, control and regulation
of insurance companies chartered hy the Dominion. The decisions affect similarly the
status, powers, control and regulation of
British or foreign companies-known as aliens
-doing business in Canada.
The most recent of those decisions is of
very late date, and its effect is known, I arn
sure, to the lawyers of the House. That decision in an important respect was in favour
of the provinces, and this Bill is designed to
meet the situation as it lias developed. It
seeks-as I think it ouglit to seek-to maintain by virtue of the powers of this Parliament sucli measus'e of jurisdiction as is
essential to protect the public, in their relations with insurance companies, against bankruptcy or insolvency on the part of the coni-

panies. I do not need to go further into the
reasons based on the Privy Council's decisions.

Honourable members will have an opportunity of reading the Bill, and will very easily
see the principle upon which it is based. So
that the import of the Bill may be fully
studied by those immediately concerned, it is
intended to allow an interval before the
measure is taken up by the Banking and
Commerce Committee of this House.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

NEW BRUNSWICK POTATOES
NEWSPAPER

STATEMENT

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON:
Honourable
members, before the Orders of the Day are
called, may I rise to a question of privilege?
I notice in one of the newspapers published
in the metropolitan city of Ottawa this morning the following remarks:
New Brunswick is famous for potatoes, but
New Brunswick polities is generally small
potatoes. Inspired by the New Brunswick peer,
Lord Beaverbrook, a resolution of potato
dealers has been passed threatening to boycott
British trade. Great Britain has survived
Chinese, Indian and other boycotts: the threat
from New Brunswick will hardly cause the
Federation of British Industries to call an
emergency session.
I can understand, of course, the desire of
the editor to have a little joke at the expense
of the Province of New Brunswick. While our
potatoes down there may be small, they might
have been a little larger if we had net been
hornswoggled into Confederation.
Potatoes
have always been more or less mixed up with
politics in New Brunswick. But this is a

FEBRUARY 12, 1932
ýýerious matter, and I am calling attention to
it in the belief -that the more advertising it
gets, the better for us in the Province of New
Brunswick. We have a very difficult situation
The potato growers are not
down there.
aliowed to export theiT potatoes to Great
Britain. If our friends of the newspapers
would study the question closely they might
corne to the conclusion that the potato
growers of New Brunswick bave a good case;
and now that the newspaper writers have had
their 'amusement, I hope they will lend a hand
towards improving the situation.
IRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I join with my
honourable friend in lamenting the character
of the article; but I tbink hie did a stili
greater injustice to the province when hie said
it had been hornswoggled into Confederation.

want the Committee perfectly free to carry on

example, the Committee, after this House

be rather reprehensible on our part that we

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senaýte resumed from yesterday the
adjourned ddbate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill Al, an Act with respect
te Hospital Sweepstakes.

Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable gentlemen, in speaking in support of the Sweepstakes Bill introduced by the honourable
senator from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard),
I quite appreciate that a considerable portion
of our Canadian people are adverse te secalled gambling. Not a few of them would
entirely prohibit gambling of all sorts, were
that possible. With those I frankly disagree.
lt might not be amiss to review very tersely
our national attitude towards gambling.

As a whole are we Canadians a gambling
people? That is a blunt question. My answer
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

is: we are, both by inheritance and by
environment. The British race has long been
recognized as a race of sportsmen. It was
the boldest and best sports of their day,
both French and British, who tempted fate
and discovered this Dominion, later exploring
it te the Pacific and te the Arctic. We never
tire of referring with pride te those ancestors,
to their spirit of adventure and te their
daily gamble with life and death. Adventure
is akin te gambling; the two are inseparable.

As the descendants of those adventurers,
what outlet do we find te the spirit that is
inbred in us and that we in turn shall pass

on to our children? Speaking for myself, I
have found an outlet in the commercial life
of the Dominion, and I am sure many other
honourable senators can say the same thing.
In that life there are many gambles. As I
look back on the long years I have spent in
business I realize that some of the greatest
gambles I ever took were in my commercial

ventures.
Undoubted'ly, many of you
honourable gentlemen have had similar experiences. When the gamble turns out well,
when we win, we are given credit for unusual
business acumen; when we lose we are said te
have made a poor gamble. Such is modern
business.
We come from races that took their chances.

Should we-indeed, can we-eradicate in our
generation the spirit that we have so well

inherited? I do not believe we can. Would
it be wise te do it if we could? I do not
think se. That spirit has been responsible
for the development of the Dominion te its

present position. The restoration of that
spirit of adventure-or gamble, te use the less
polite term-would perhaps do more than
anything else te bring about the return of
prosperity.

With such breeding, instead of destroying,
should we not endeavour te control and direct
the avenue through which this national spirit
may find its outlet?
I do not share with the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) the
fear that the adoption of sweepstakes may
undermine the morale of our people. By our
approval of the pari mutuels in several provinces-for example, in my own Province of
British Columbia, in Ontario, and, I believe,
in Quebec as well-we have not only authorized gambling, but we have reconciled the
public conscience te the necessity of it. We
have gone a step further by taking as our
quid pro quo, for the benefit of the public
treasury, a rake-off from that particular enterprise, a form of gambling that many people
say fails te give the public a fair run for

FEBRUARY 12, 1932
their money. If it is true that througb pari
mutuels we have accepted the principle of
participating in the profits of gambling, why
should we not deal with the wbole matter in a
thorough, comprebensive way, under praper
public control?
The bonourable senator from Victoria (Hon.
Mr. Barnard), who is sponsoring the Bill, bas
referred ta the money going out of Canada
in connectian with the Calcutta, the Irish
and other foreign sweepstakes. I find that a
great many people in Canada to-day, aware
of the fact, are beginning ta feel that we
should keep our money at home and at the
same tume give aur citizens a f air gamble.
No doubt these people bave not entirely overlooked the little odd change that sweepstakes
might bring in ta us froni other countries.
Perbaps the present burden of taxation and
the need for new sources of revenue may
accaunt for this softening of aur national
conscience with respect ta these matters.
Serjous thought is being given throughout
the Dominion to the possibiity of raising
funds by some such means as proposed in the
Bill, and I arn sure that the discussion bere
and in the other Hanse, if honourable senators see fit to give third reading ta the measure, will serve a useful purpose.
I intend ta vote for the Bill because I amn
in favour of its principle, but I cannot say
I arn very enthusiastic about the idea of putting nine provinces into the sweepstakes business with nine different managers. I sbould
greatly prefer federal sweepstakes, the net
proceeds ta be devoted ta the retîrement cf
the public debt. If our tender national conscience frowned upon contributions fromn suob
a source, then I sbould like ta see the proceeds
applied ta unemplayment relief, the burden
cf which is likely ta be with us for some time
ta corne, with the ever increasing difficulties
cf financing the same.
I hope banourable members will see fit ta
pass the measure and send it ta the G'ommons.
There the discussion as ta the financial value
cf sweepstakes would probably be more detailed -than it could be in this Chamber, the
proposal should thus receive wider publicity
and become a more general topic cf conversation througbout the country. I think the
sweepstakes issue will attract increasing publie
attention in the near future. The discussion
an the present measure in this Chamber and
elsewhere sbould therefore prove ta be cf
an educational and generally useful obaracter.
The bonourable
Hon. E. MICHENER:
member for Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard),
who introduced this Bill, bas given US some
plausible reasons why it should be passed

Having been mentioned as the seconder of
bis motion, I sbould be remiss in rny duties if
I did nlot speak to it. There are two sides to
every question. It is not rny purpose to review the arguments raised by my honourable
friend, nor to repeat those which have been
stated by honourable menibers who hold
opposite views. I will say, however, that I
think the incorporation of the amendment to
wbicb my bonourable friend bas referred bas
weakened rather tban strengthened bis Bill,
f or if we may bave in one province sweepstakes ini whicb tbe people of tbe otber eigbt
provinces cannot participate, then the menit
of tbe whole tbing is largely lost. Tbe only
virtue in tihe sweepstakes would be the providing of revenue for the bospitals in one
province. But why sbould the people of
Alberta, for example, be denied the rigbt ta
buy tickets for the benefit of hospitals in
British Columnbia? This brings up a point
which my bonourable friend from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) stated in support of the
Bill, but wbicb, in my opinion is really a
reason wby 'he sbould oppose it. He said he
did nat believe in legisiation which could not
be readily enforced, and I arn sure we al
agree witb bim on tbat. But if this measure
passed and only one province took advantage
of swee]pstakes, would it be possible to prevent people in tbe otber eigbt provinces froni
buying tickets for those sweepstakes? On
the contrary, would there flot be a great
number of lawbreakers in this respect? It is
commonly said that bundreds of tbousands of
people in Canada are illegally participating in
tbe Irish and other sweepstakes. It seenis to
me that if the honourable senator from Halifax follows bis argument to a logical conclusion, he will bave ta appose tbis Bill on the
ground that if it became law it would be
unenforceable.
My honourable friend froni Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) bas expressed the view
tbat we are gamblers by force of heredity and
circunistances, and possibly to a certain extent
he is right. But there is a difference between
gambling for sport and gambling with the
object of contributing ta hospitals or reducing
taxes. One of the great public virtues is tbe
ready and generous response that is made to
appeals for donations to hospitals and other
charitable and pbilanthropie institutions. It is
perbaps the crowning glory of humanity that
it follows that noble impulse to help those
who are in need. I arn convinced, that people
always will continue to give of thefr means ta
charitable obj ects, and 1 tbink it is undesirable ta substitute sweepstakes for tbe higher
incentive ta wbich I bave referred. As far

Government, and to the people of Canada.
The civilian population are dependent on a
variety of organizations, such as hospital
committees, church organizations, the Red
Cross, and the Daughters of the Empire.
Their revenues corne from fees reeeived from
paying patients, publie subscriptions, endowments, and in rnany cases provincial and
municipal grants. Also, the provincial and
municipal governments have set up certain
classes of hospitals; for instance, sanitariums
for tubercular patients, and asylums for the
treatment of those suffering frorn mental

receive, to a greater or less degree, municipal
or provincial government support.
That being so, I prefer that it should be
left in the hands of the constituted authorities
to make up any deficiencies that may occur,
rather than that the hospitals should be
dependent upon chance, as I think they would
necessarily be under the present proposal, or
upon the enactment of further legislation. Of
one thing I feel certain: if we adopt a
measure of this kind, we shall find that the
source of revenue now available will dry up.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, I should like to clear up certain objections of a practical nature which seem to
attach to this Bill. I cannot but congratulate the honourable member from Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Barnard) upon the crisp and clear
way in which he has presented this measure,
and the very sincere effort he undoubtedly
has made to restrict i'ts application to
provinces which might desire to adopt the
sweepstake method of raising money for
hospitals. Nevertheless, I question very much
whether the honourable gentleman is really
presenting a practical proposition to this
Hou-e. Is it true that if this Bill is pased
every province will be free to accept it and
mxake use of it, or to reject it? I a.m extremelv
doubtful that it will be possible to prevent
the flooding of 'this whole country with
tickets for sweepstakes, should even one
province take advantage of the provisions of
this Bill. The reason for my doubt is that
although the authorities are at present armed
with the weapons of the criminal law, and
have the assistance of the arsenal at the
disposal of the Post Office Department, they
do not seem able to prevent the permeation
of the whole country by tickets for sweepstakes which are being operated thousands of
miles from here.
Now, honourable gentlemen, if a lottery is
established in the Province of British Colum.bia, do you think it will be at all possible

to prevent the tickets of that lottery, which
have been legally issued, from being sold in
the other provinces? In my humble opinion.
based upon the example that we have before
us, it will not be possible. If money is required in a province for the purposes that
have been mentioned, and a sweepstake is
authorized, the only means the other provinces will have of keeping within their own
boundaries money that would be likely to go
to such an enterprise will be to institute
lotteries of their own, and appeal to their
people to patronize them. Therefore, in every
province of the Dominion sweepstakes will be
organized from time to time, and tickets will
be sold. What will be the result? Although
in theory the liberty of each province is
preserved, in practice every province will be
constrained to make use of this law in order
to protect itself.
But that is not all. If we now create a
precedent by granting such extraordinary
privileges for the purpose of maintaining
hospitals, where are we going to stop? I can
name many meritorious objects which are
deserving of consideration in this respect. For
instance, we have in my own province, in the
city of Montreal, a Refuge for Incurables. I
know of no more praiseworthy endeavour, no
more necessary institution. Should the Province of Quebec decide to make use of this
law, could we refuse such institutions as this
the right to conduct a lottery in order to raise
necessary funds? Think of all the meritorious
undertakings of this kind that would be entitled to consideration. We have our insane
asylums. They are not hospitals.
Hon. Mr. BOURQUE:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Yes, they are.

No, they are not.

They are refuges. That they are not hospitals
is demonstrated by the fact that patients are
forced to leave the hiospitals when once ilt is
determined tha*t they are incurable. I know
that the rule in all hospitals, at ah events
in Montreal, is that incurable patients must
find some other refuge; and that admirable
institution, the Sakcred Heart. receives these
unfortunate people who, having no further
hope in this. life, seek a haven in whieh to
pass the remainder of their days. Where are
One organization after
we going to stop?
another will knock at the door of this Senate
asking for measures similar to this one. If
we grant the request now before us we shall
be creating a precedent that will tic our hands
in the future.

But suppose that we are all converted by the
very excellent argument of the honourable
member frorn Victoria, and that sweepstakes

SENATE
are instituted in every province. What then?
Competition will arise, and we shall see one
lottery competing with and underbidding
another. I understand that out df every three
dollars subscribed to lotteries, two dollars go
to the people who carry them on as a means
of making a livelihood, or to the holders of
lucky tickets, and only one dollar goes to
the support of the institution for which the
funds are being raised. In seeking a means
of raising funds for hoapitals, would it not
be more practical to look for one in whioh
sixty-six per cent of the money subscribed
would not be actually wasted, and more than
thirty-three per cent would be applied to a
useful purpose? Further, when competition
commences, the cost of raising the funds, instead of being sixty-six per cent, will be
seventy or seventy-five per cent, or even more.
Where is it going to stop? When institutions
of this kind are set up all over the country,
lottery tickets will 'be sold in the streets of all
the big cities of Canada, as they now are
in the city of Buenos Aires. In that city, on
the most frequented business highways, where
rentals are tremendous, you will sec every
two or three blocks enormous stores with
windows all plaearded wilth nothing but
lottery tickets. Aside altogether from the
moral point of view, is that a healthy condition? I am appealing to you, honourable
gentlemen, purely and simply on practical
grounds. Is it good business to authorize the
throwing away of two dollars out of every
three raised, simply because one dollar is to
go to a meritorious cause?
Our honourable colleague has made good
use of the argument that the money is to be
raised for an excellent purpose, but I think
that the means of raising it are rather doubtful. After all, Canada is the offspring of
Europe. We have learned many lessons from
Europe. Lotteries existed in many countries
of Europe years ago. Where are they now?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: In France.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Ah, my honourable
friend makes a terrible mistake. Years ago
France made two lottery issues, the City of
Paris and the Panama; but that was at least
thirty years ago.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I beg to differ with
my honourable friend. I happen to have a
few of the 'bonds issued by the French Government in 1919 and 1920.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am glad my
honourable friend has brought that to my
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

attention. It is passing strange to me. Remember, honourable gentlemen, the City of
Paris bonds and the Panama bonds are not
really lottery tickets, because although you
may lose part of the interest on your money
you are sure of the principal. A lottery is
something in which one's investment, if you
may call it that, depends absolutely upon
chance: he either wins, or he loses it entirely,
the result depending on whether fortune smiles
or not. In the case of the City of Paris bonds
and the Panama bonds the investor was sure
to get back his capital, although he might be
deprived of part of the interest on it for a
certain number of years.
Are we not going to benefit by the example
of Europe? The people there have found,
probably through an excess of such undertakings, that they were obliged to abolish
them. After all, is it unreasonable to say that
if lotteries are permitted in one province they
must exist in all; that if they exist in all they
must compete with one another; that if they
are permitted for one good purpose they must
be permitted for all good purposes; and that
when hundreds of lotteries are functioning in
this country we shall be obliged to put a stop
to them and to revert to the situation as it is
to-day?
Just one last word. My honourable friend
says we are suffering the pangs of conscience,
which should have been apparent long ago.
Lotteries, he says, exist on the race-track, and
are operated in the cause of charity. I may
be permitted to say that it is not a crime to
take a drink; at least, having been brought
up in the Province of Quebec, I have absolutely no misgivings about that; nevertheless
it is a folly to permit the retention of the bar,
because what in use is commendable, in abuse
may be fatal. When a lottery ticket is put
into the mail it will travel anywhere in the
world. You cannot stop it. The disease, instead of being confined to a small area, permeates all the people. I will not attempt to
speak of the moral danger, because that aspect
has been pleaded so well by a voice that we
shall never hear again; but from the practical
point of view it seems to me that if we permit
lotteries at all they will bring about such an
abuse that before very long we shall be constrained to forbid them altogether.

commissioner, I think the one for the
Dominion, died. Then the Dominion Government accepted the Alberta commissioner,
and he and the representative of British
Columbia proceeded to do the work. Until
1924 this work was carried on. They extended
and marked the boundary. It was not a case
of altering the line; it was merely a case of
ascertaining it. They marked it for some 252
miles, I think, and on reaching the point they
did in 1924 the Governments of the day decided that, as they had got to the territory
which was uninhabited and unproductive, they
might as well stop there and save expense, and
there has been no more surveying snce.
It is now necessary that the surveys so made,
and registered in the form of maps in the
proper offices of this Government and of the
Provincial Governments, as well as marked on
the ground, should actually be established by
legislation of this Parliament, and such is the
purpose of this Bill. It is true that a line bas
length only, and no width, but as far as proper
jurisdiction is concerned it does not matter a
particle who owns the territory on either side
of the line-whether the Dominion, the province, or John Jones. It is all a question of
establishing under the termas of the British
North America Act the boundary between
British Columbia and Alberta.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: When the survey
was made the land had not been transferred
to the provinces: they did not own it. Now
this Government has no further interest.
Right H'on. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have, of
course, no interest in the land where this line
lies; and I do not know that we had any interest in it before. It is not a question of
whether the land is owned by this or any
other government. We are trying to fix a
bounda'ry line between two provinces. The
ownership of the .land does not affect the
question any more than the ownership of
land at the South Pole.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that the Dominion of Canada has no interest
as to where the line is drawn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not a particle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The two provinces have agreed as to the line. Perhaps it
has advanced into one province at one point
and receded at another. What is of interest
to this Parliament is the fact that the legislatures of the two provinces have passed legislation agreeing to the line, and this Bill simply
ratifies what has been done.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
agree.

They couldi not

They are going to make a new line.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are ratifying the line accepted by their legislatures.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bills of
their legislatures fixing this line are in my
hands, but the line is not finally established
until this Parliament, in accordance with the
British North America Act, makes it permanent.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Friday, February
12, the adjourned debate on the motion for
the second reading of Bill Ai, an Act with
respect to Hospital Sweepstakes.
Hon. 'Mr. BARNARD: Honourable members, I suppose that in the absence of the honourable senator from Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe), unless some other honourable gentleman wishes to speak, I may as well close
the debate, so that we may go to a division.
I do not think the argument on this Bill can
be furthered by anything more that I can
say at this timeHon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
before the debate is closed I should like to
say just a few words. This Bill appears to
be divided into two parts-the one intending
to provide for the maintenance of hospitals,
the other having to do with horse-racing pure
and simple. I have no particular objection to
horse-racing as a sport, and while in a great
many countries of the world, including Canada, it is carried on as a business, good or
bad, desirable or undesirable, this is the first
time to my knowledge that an attempt has
been made to link it up with a charitable
object. Why this attempt is made to link up
two objects that should, I think, be kept
apart, has not been very clearly explained.
The honourable gentleman who is promoting
the Bill (Hon. Mr. Barnard) emphasized the
charitable side, but did not lay so muoh stress
on the other side, and he gave me the impression that he wished the meritorious features of the Bill to take care of the unworthy
ones. That, I think, is unwise legislation.
Another thing that struck me while the honourable gentleman was speaking was that he

SENATE
seemed to argue that we were justified in
doing a little evil that a particular good might
follow. The temptation to do that is about
as old as the human race; it is very insidious;
and to yield to it is, I think, very unwise.
I got the idea from the remarks of my
honourable friend that even though part of
the Bill might be bad or wrong, we could
legislate to put the responsibility upon the
Attorneys General of the provinces, and that
the Bill would apply only to British Columbia,
and we might lot the people cf that province
look out for t1hemselves. I think that would
be very undesirable. The duty of Parliament,
if I understand it aright, is to legislate not for
any particular province or part of Canada,
but for Canada -as a wholle; therefore we
should bear the responsibility ourselves and
not try to put it upon the shoulders of the
officers of the provinces.
I have read speeches deldivered in favour of
and against this Bill-more particularly those
in favour of it-with the idea of trying to
discover an argument that wouid justify us
in legislating in the way proposed. I should
like to refer first of alil to the remarks of the
honourable leader 'on this side Of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
The lhenourable
senator pointed out that some years ago, in
the Province of Quebec-I think, in the city
of Montreail-,the law alllowed lotteries of a
character somewhat similar to what has been
outlined to us, and that they became very
objectionable. I shal read his words as found
on page 48 of Hansard:
I need rot explain the system on which they
had been operating. At first there were drawings once a week. Then there came to be
drawings once a day and art lotteries were
being orgaized in all quarters of the city.
They had to be abolished. They had become
a nuisance, and worse-a menace, I should, say,
to the dharacter of the people. That is an
example that we ought to consider carefully
before legislating in the way suggested. Then
the honourable senator said this:
Hemeaning the promoter of the Bill-as
spoken of the opinions of some members
of this Chamber being governed by conscience.
I may say that my attitude has not been
governed in that way. With me it is rather a
question of social policy.
With all due respect to the honourable gentleman, I cannot for the life of me see how a
sound social policy can be established if you
eliminate conscience and aIl reference to the
moral law. I think the honouraible senator
must have been misreported at that point, or
he must have slipped in his logic. It appears
to me that we must consider legislation of
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

this kind according to our consciences, and
according to the Divine Law. I think that
all proper human legislation is founded on
and must be in conformity with the Divine
Law.
Hon. Mir. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend 'that I intended to saythough pe1ihlaps I failed to use an expression
that I should have used-ithalt I did not
approach the matter primarily from the conscientious point of view, but saw the importance of approaching it fror the social angle.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I am glad to have
the explanation of the honourable gentleman. I think it is desirable at this stage of
the proceedings.
I have read with considerable interest the
remarks of the honourable member from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), to which I shall
refer very briefly. At page 50 the honourable
senator makes this statement:
On this continent we have made more
criminals under the liquor laws than have been
made by any other system ever invented, and
we are still making criminals every day by
trying to enforce laws against people making a
bet on a horse.
As I see it, the honourable gentleman was
there trying to compare things that are not
comparable. I agree with him that there has
been a great deal of unwise legislation for the
purpose of suppressing the liquor traffic, but
I do not think that that business can be
regarded as coming within the same category
as horse-racing, betting on horses, or gambling
of any kind. It is no offence against the
moral law for any man to take a glass of
wine or beer or whiskey.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

If he can get it.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Give us one.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I say it is no offence
against the moral law, for Our Lord Himself
partook of wine, and provided it for others.
But horse-racing, betting and gambling are
entirely different things. We have no divine
sanction for any of these things as far as I
know. Drunkenness is a terrible evil, and it
is the duty of legislators to legislate against
the man who abuses wine, so that he may be
fined or put into prison. But, as I see it, you
might as well legislate against partaking of
food as against partaking of wine. The taking
of food to excess constitutes gluttony, and is
a great crime against the individual and
against society.
I think the honourable
senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) did
not consider the matter very carefully when
he tried to compare betting and drinking.

The British race has long been recognized as
a race of sportsmen. It was the boldest and
best sports of their day, both French and
British, who tempted fate and discovered this
Dominion, later exploring it to the Pacifie and
to the Aretie. We never tire of referring with
pride to those ancestors, to their spirit of
adventure and to their daily gamble with life
and death. Adventure is akin to gambling; the
two are inseparable.

way. Of course, it might be said that all life
is a gamble, that fate plays a large part in
human existence. At the same time I think a
man can stand up and say:
I an the master of my fate,
I an the captain of my soul.
Thetre are a few other words I should like
to quote:
One ship sails east, another sails west,
While the selfsatme breezes blow,
But its the eut of the sails, and not the gales,
JTat decides where the ship shall go.
And so it is with human life. The same
breezes blow on a great many men at one
time, but it is the eut of every man's sails,
how he guides himself, that determines what
he will accomplish in life. We are no a
nation of gamblers. When I heard an honourable gentlernan
read the definition
of
ganbling" from the Oxford Dictionary I
came to the conclusion that a lottery ticket
is farther down in the scale. Gambling means
pla uingfor a stake, and is sometimes in the
nature of a gane of skill whereby judgment
and intelligence are brought into play. Perhaps
A man ecan be said to gamble when he makes
bid on the strength of some information he
has. A man may gamble for money by mteans
of a giune of cards, but he must know sormething about the game and he is required te
use intelligence to a certain degree. But a
lottery ticket places the moron and the cololge
professor on the same level, for intelligence
has nothing to do with the buying of the
ticket. Neither is gambling in stocks or in
wheat on the same plane as gambling on a
sweepstake. Surely before a man buys wheat
ie uses some intelligence: in all probability
he has studied market conditions and knows
whether there is a surplus or a shortage and
what the current crops are like. When he
buys stocks on the exchange he uses brains
and ability.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

And lie loses.

to a horse-race in this country-and though
I have never bet in my life, I am no joykiller; I do net think ià is wrong to have a
little fun sometimes-it seems to me that if
he bets he has to use some judgment. Perhaps
he will walk down the paddock and look at
tlhe horses, and for some reason or another
he will faveur one in particular. He may
win or lose, but that does not alter the fact
that he has had to bring his intelligence into
play.
An honourable senator used, in support of
the Bilil, an argument which I think is a good
one for opposing it. He said that later on
sweepstakes might be resorted to as a source
of funds for the Red Cross and other institutions, and even for the Government itself.
It seems to me that one of the most dangerous
features about a Bill of this kind is that we
do not know where it would stop. We should
be taking a downward step if we endeavoured
to support our phiianthropic institutions with
money received through lotteries.

Many a man has lest, no doubt, through the

on a horse-race is different from buying a

you do not know anything about the matter,
and a drawing is made for you. That is a

0F INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. PARENT: .Honourable senators,
in presenting 'notice of înquiry I desire to
say just a word by way of -explanation. In
a recent edition of the Concise Oxford Dietionary I find the word "billion" defined as
follows:
. billion. A million millions; (in U.S.) a
thousand millions.
[lFrench, côined in the l6th century out of
hi- and million to denote the second power of
a million; meaning afterwards changed in
France (so U.S.),but not in Englaxd.]
I should like to know what is the situation
in Canada, and I intend to put the following
question:
For purposes 2of curyency, or otlherwise, is the
money of the Dominion of Canada puit on such
basis as to mean that*one "billion" represents
,one. thousand millions or one million millions?

should perhaps be helpful to the other House,
and certainly should be helpful to the country.
The question of international trade receives
more attention and is more widely discussed
than any other subjeet, not excepting war
debts, reparations and disarmament, and this
is to be expected if we realize that trade,
perhaps more than anything else, differentiates the civilized man from the savage. But
notwithstanding this almost universal discussion, I fear there is widespread misapprehension in regard to the fundamental principles
of the subject.
The Hon. the Minister of Trade and Commerce, before the Montreal Board of Trade,
or before a number of businessmen of that
city, declared last summer or autumn that
for the first time in many years the balance
of trade was in our favour, that our exports
exceeded our imports in value. The same
honourable gentleman in his "Survey of the
Economic Position of 1931" states that for the
four months from July to October the favourable balances of trade aggregated $20,000,000.
The Right Hon. the Prime Minister, answering the Winnipeg speech of the Leader of
the Opposition advocating lower tariffs,
states: "Changing an unfavourable visible
trade balance of $73,755,000 for the last nine
months of 1930 to a favourable trade balance

of $10,000,000 for the last nine months of 1931
was a step essential for the maintenance of
our national integrity." That is a fairly strong
statement. The Montreal Standard of January 16 last thus summarizes the New Year's
radio message of the Premier to the people
of Canada: "The worst is over. Our financial institutions have weathered the shock and
The balance of
are fundamentally sound.
trade has turned in our favour." And the
Government, in the speech with which His
Excellency opened Parliament, states: "Within the last few months a favourable balance
of trade has been established."
Our Government is not alone in holding
the views which I have mentioned; they are
held by many of the leading newspapers, by
many eminent bankers, by many experienced
businessmen and by many political economists. This is true not only in Canada but
in ahl other nations, with the possible exception of Great Britain.
Now I quite reialize that it would appear
to be ridiculous, perhaps indeed ludicrous, for
an obscure country merchant and farmer to
challenge the soundness of such an array of
informed public opinion, but if I believe ail
this informed public opinion to be wrong,
I have to say so, even at the risk of being
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

laughed at. I shall lay down in a few propositions the principles I believe to be sound,
and I should like to have them examined and
criticized.
Generally speaking, when imports and exports exactly equal eaoh other in value, and
the exports pay for the imports, tIhere is
neither profit nor loss in the trade, except
whatever profit there may be in the business
of transportation, which is certainly a useful
industry.
When our imports exceed our exporits, and
the exports pay for the imports, we are trading
at a profit; and the measure of our profit is
the difference between our imports and our
exports, unless we are borrowing abroad ýto
the extent of the difference.
Wdhen our imponts exceed our exports, and
our exports not only pay for our imports but
enable us to make investments abroad, or
reduce our obligations ahroad, our profits
equal the difference between our imports and
exports, plus the value of our foreign investments, or the reduction in our foreign obligations.
When our exports exceed our imports, and
our exports are only paying for our imports,
we are trading at a loss, and the amount of
our loss is the difference between our exports
and our imports. If, however, we are at the
same time m'aking investments abroad, and
these investments equal the difference be'tween
our exports and our imports, our loss may be
cancelled; further, if these foreign investments
are greater than the difference between our
exports and our imports, we may be trading
at a profit.
Therefore, the method of thinking which
causes us to believe that when our exports
exceed our imports we are trading at a profit
is wrong. The exact opposite of such thinking would be much nearer the truth. Ahl
profit in trade, international trade ait all events,
is made by taking things frora where they
are comparatively cheap to where they are
eomparatively dear; therefore the imports of
all the nations of the world could be greater
than the exports of the same nations, and if
tîhis happened aIl the nations would be trading
at a profit.
To me these propositions are sound, but
owing to my faulty presentation they may not
appear so to others
I would therefore be
deeply grateful if my honourable colleagues
would examine them. We surely ought te be
able to arrive at a unanimous decision in regard to the fundamental principles of trade.
Surely the prineiples of trade are not an
abstruse or occult seience about which honest

MARCH 3, 1932
men may constantly differ. They oughit te
be capable of mathematical, or almost mskhemaitical, dernonsfiration.
Peilhaps a conorete exemple of an actual
business transaction would make my view
clearer. I shiail give -one: If I purchase a cargo
of wliet, say 100,000 buahe-ls-and for the sake
of easy comiputation let us say it cost one
dollar per bushel-.and send à, bo England
and sl it oit a profit cg fi.fty cents a buahel,
I have $150,000 with Wkach to b'uy goods in
England. The expoe't entry is $100,000, and
if 1 buy goods the im~port enbry is $150,000. 1
certiainily have made a profitable transaction,
and one thiat is just ais profitable Vo my
country as -te me. lIt goca wi'thout saying that
this woul apply to ail possible oommodities.
1't aiso goes without saying that the re-verse
of this would be true if I sold the wheat
at a loss: I should suifer and my country
would suifer, t'hough the exporta would, be
greater than the imports and the balance of
trade wouid be favourable. But suppose I
were flot an importer, and instead of bringing
back goods I brought back a bill of exchange.
That wouid inake no dijference at ail. Seme
man w1ho was an importer could buy $150,000
worth of go"od in England and a bank in
Canada couid give him the money to pay for
thesu, or I could give him the money to pay
for them. Again, suppose no goode were
intported to balance this transaction, but I
made an investrnent in England, or in sorne
other country, or paid off an obligation in
England or in some other country, or enaibled
some othai, Canadian Vo do these things. What
I fear is thiait wbile the so-.oalried balance of
trade is tturning in our f avour we are not
making any foreign investments nor paying
off any foreign obligations teo equal this
balance. And if we are not doing ci-bher of
these things we are trading at a baos.
If the views that I have had the temerity to
put forward be sound, it follows that our
Government and many other governments
have erroneous conceptions in regard to trade
matters. Hence the unwise legisiation of high
tarifas, which are to be found almost everywbere, and which have had not a little te do
with -the present world-wide depression. It
also follows that governments would be well
advised to interfere as little as possible with
businessmen in matters of trade, and certainly
should neyer put impediments in their way.
Trade, or exehange of goods, is carried on by
merchants individually or in companies, and
no two individuals or companies will engage ini
trade unless they think it will be to, their
mutual advantage; certainly they will flot
continue te trade unleas it is actually to their
mutual advantage. If, therefore, individuals
41767--5 j

67

or companies continue to trade, and if they
belong to different countries, it may surely be
taken for granted that euch trade is to their
mutual advantage; and if se, then it f ollows
as the day follows the night, that it must be
to the advantage cf their respective countries.
Therefore, governmenits need not worry about
what their nationals may be doing in trade
matters; their nationals will take care of
themsclves.
Now, 1 do net mean te say that under al
circumstances the principle of protection is
wrong. Circumstances might arise when it
would be well te use it in seif-defence, or te
accompiah a specifie purpese, juat as a skilful
physician might administer a deadly poison,
such as arsenic, to a patient for a special purpose; but ne physician outoide an insane
asylum would prescribe arsenic as a daiiy food
for the well. Again, ail laws, human and divine, allow us te do whatever may 'ho necessary
te proteet our lives, even te the killing of an
assailant, and common sense makea thia a
duty; but nobody outside a madihouse wouid
recommend homicide as a national pelicy. If
protection were regarded as a necessary cvil
wvhich might be employed temporarily, but
put aside as soon as possible, I de net think
it would ever do mueh harm. But if our
delegates and those from. some cf the sister
Dominions go te the Imperial Economie Conference with the idea that protection is in
itacîf a good thing, and that their duty is te
push experts as much as possible and impede
imports as much as possible, the Conference,
as 1 sec it, wili ho a failure, and it would b2
better if it were neyer held.
At a meeting in Montreal and at another in
Ottawa iast year, the Hon. Minister of Trade
and Commerce advocated, I think, a bimetallie currency and favoured the monetization of
silver, or seme arrangement cf that kind that
weuld enable us te seli aur produets te China
and ether silver ceuntries and take payment
in that metal. For many years prier te this
century, 16 ounces cf silver would purchase
one ounce cf gold. Since then the value cf
silver bas fluctuated wildly in the gold standard ceuntries,' and now it would take about 80
ounces of silver te purchase one of gold. This
prevents the gold standard countries from
trading with the silver standard countries, and
taking paymcnt in the white metal. But why
take payaient in metal at ail? Speaking in
a large sense, if we take payment f or our
goods in any kind cf matai, befere that metai
is any good te us we have te exehange it for
geeda with the country from which we got it,
or with some other country. Would it net
be as wcil te make the exehange cf goods for
goods in the firat instance?

SENATE

As I see it, all these things show the inadvisability of governments putting impediments in the way of trade by tariffs and such
like legislation, and then trying to get around
or over these barriers by other legislation.
The simpler way would surely be the better
way, but apparently simplicity does not appeal
to the statesmen of the world. I can see no
objection to the nations of the world having
two metallic currencies instead of one, particularly if the monetary value of the two
were kept close to their intrinsic value. If
this were not done, people would hoard the
more valuable metal and use the less valuable,
and we should come back to one metallic currency again. I would, however, welcome any
device that would make the exchange of goods
easier. I cannot help thinking that God, in
His infinite wisdom, in creating this world
with all its variety of soil, of climate, of
seasons and productions, must have intended
His children to exchange these productions
with one another. Such an exchange would
do more than anything else to promote the
material happiness of all, and would be a
large factor in the promotion of civilization
itself.
Further, I cannot help thinking that in
niatters of trade we make gold and silver
altogether too important. I think I should
be safe in saying that ninety-five per cent of
the trade of the world is carried on by means
of bits of paper, a means which necessity and
the common sense of the merchants of the
world have evolved, and which admirably
serves the purpose. In 1923, when the Bank
Act was being revised, the late Sir Edmund
Walker said that 96 per cent of the world's
trade was carried on in that way. When a
shipper sends goods to another country, or to
another part of his own country, he makes
a draft against the shipment, the amount of
which his banker puts to his credit. Against
this credit he writes and uses in his daily
business other bits of paper, called cheques,
which are cancelled after being paid, and
when the draft is paid it is cancelled and the
transaction is ended. Warehouse receipts and
letters of credit, also bits of paper, serve a
similar purpose. There is practically no limit
to the number and value of the pieces of
paper that can be issued in this way, and so
long as they represent value there is no
possible danger of over-issue or under-issue,
of inflation or deflation; the whole thing takes
care of itself.
Gold, becanse it has an intrinsic and an
international value, is very useful for the
settlement of ordinary international balances,
and is, of course, alse useful as ai basis for the
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

redemption of bank notes. But when the
principal nations of the world undertook to
pay their war debts to the United States in
gold, and when the United States insisted
upon being paid in that metal, a colossal
mistake was made. To begin with, I doubt
whether there was enough gold in the world
with which to pay those debts, but even if
there was enough, such a sudden and enormous demand for it was bound to inflate its
value and make the payment of the debts
practically impossible. If the debtor nations
of the world had insisted upon paying their
debts in goods, or in kind, they would have
been discharging their obligations honestly,
would not have been impoverishing themselves, and would have been giving the United
States something useful; but the tariff laws
of that country would not permit this to be
done-another illustration of the folly of protection.
The United States got payments in gold,
and when she received more than she could
use she had to hide the surplus by burying
it in holes in the ground, where it is, of
course, useless. Before it can be properly
used it has to be taken out of these holes
and exchaged with other nations for goodsbe it fifty, one hundred, five hundred or five
thousand years from now. Of course, the
exchange might as well have been made in
the first instance. The United States, since
the War, has made loans to Germany and
other nations, but she will have to take goods
in payment if she is ever to get either interest
The late William Jennings
or principal.
Bryan said, in one of his election speeches,
that the American people were being crucified
on a cross of gold. I do not know whether
that statement was truc at the time it was
made, but I feel sure that it is true now, and
that it would apply to the people of every
ether nation as well.
The Government proposes to cut the salaries
of civil servants and the indemnities of members of Parliament by ten per cent. I approve
of that and I advocated it last year, but I
went farther and said the eut should apply
to every person either directly or indirectly
in receipt of government pay. That would
certainly include the Lieutenant-Governors
and the judges. At least one judge has told
me that the judges should be included, and
that he would make the offer to reduce his
own salary, but he did not wish the publ'icity
it might bring him. His Excellency the Governor General cannot be too highly cornmended for and congratulated upon his noble
offer to take his eut with the rest of us. "There
is something in the English, after all." I must,

MARCH ý3,ý1932
*however, say that I think the eut should ho
on a sliding scale,-the lower paid persons
with dependants perhaps- not reduced at aIl,
the more ýhighly paid persons perhaps seven
or edght per cent, and those most highly paid
perhàps twelve or fifteen per cent, so that the
cut would average at least ten per cent.
Again I say, why should the bondholders be
untouched when cuts are being made? I know
I shahl ho met by the cry that these people
have a contract with the Government and that
contracts are sacred things. But have not the
people whose incomes are being reduced also
contrac.ts with the Government? And is one
contract more sacred than -another? 1 know
that in our way of thinkIng, and in our legislation for thousands of years, property bas been
more sacred than humanity, and that it is
hard to get away from what has been bred ini
the bone. I know that because of the inflation
of the gold dollar the debtors are paying the
creditors two or three times over, but in the
estimation of many that kind of thinig is al
right-the creditors are entitled to their pound
of flesh, and the sacredness of contracts must
not lie disturbed.
The riglit honourable gentleman who leads
this Bouse and: who has the ability to go to
the heart of, and to clarify, every subject he
discusses, made the following statements during
the present session:
Wbat is clear beyond ail question is that
the world is entangled in a great coul of debt:
that the world's debta, national as well as
private, are out of ail proportion to commodity
values. Debots as between individuals adjost
tbiemselves. The creditor finds that lie must
adjust or lie loses aIl. Economic forces bring
this about. But international debts are in
another sphere, and it seems to me so plain
that lie who runs may read, that unless there
is a readjustment of international debts a
return te proeperity on the part of the world,
especially on the part of creditors, is finally
and wholIy impossible.
1 agree whole-heartedly with every one of
these statements, and I ask the riglit honourable leader of the House, if there is any difference in principle between -public and private
delits, or between national and international
delits. If it is- necessary for the salvation of
the. world, and of the creditors themselves,
that international debts should ho adjusted, is
it noit equally necessary for the salvation of
the nations, and of the creditors themselves,
that national debts should ho adjusted? And
thus appears to lie especially necessary wheoe
the national debts- are of colossal proportions.
If weo go on inecreasing taxation and con'tnually
borrowing, municipally, provincially and
federlly, the time will soon corne when the
great majority of' the people caný pay no

69;

more; and when that time arrives -the bondholders and the Governments will ho as poor
as everybody else, and we shail have gone
back to the beginning of things. Would it not
be better for the bondholders and the creditors
generally to adjust matters while there is yet.
time, and, in the words of the right honourable leader of the Blouse, take part of what
may lie legally due themn rather than run the
risk, of losing ail? 1 do lot think this coun.try,
or any other country, can endure if the incorne of the average farmer, who works twelve
to fifteen hours a day, conjtinues to hoý not
equal to that of the, average man in other
occupations. For the farmer there is no eighthour day; he would ho quite satisfied if he
could make a living by working twelve hou-rs
a day. We have long been told that farming
is the foundat.ion of our industrial life, that
if the farmer is not prosperous nobody else
can lie. If this be true, -the count;ry is in bad
shape, because farrning has been shot to
pieces, and ou.r wliole industorial if e is out of
proportion.
The nineteenth century was undoubtedly the
age of invention-the mechanical age-when
labour-.saving devices were astonisbingly multiplied. These inventions enormously increased
the productive power of Europeans and
Arnericans, and raîsed the general standard of
living in ail industrial countries. The masses,
however, spent as they went, while some of
the captains of industry arnassed fortunes.
But not satisfied with getting rich in the
ordinary way, they saw that by. restricting
the exchange of goods and contre1ling the.
channels of trade their power would ho
enhanced, and that hy getting legisiation
which would enable sorne of the people to
exploit all the people, the chan-ces of adding
to their fortunes wou'ld be increased; hence
The beneficiaries of

such legislation were not slow to ascribe the
general irnprovernent to their own particular
device.
In addition to this, the enormous natural.
resources of the North Arnerican continent
were being exploited- by the few for their
own particular advantage, and this resulted.
in large additions to already huge fortunes.
While this was going on, the Great War was
launched, very rich men became millionaires,
millionaires. became multi-millionaires, the
UTnited States becarne the creditor nation od,
the world,, and. the conditions so clearly
visioned. and so, aptly deseribed by the right
honourable leader of this House a short time,
ago were upon us. 1 read recently in a report,
issued by the Treasury Departrnent of the
United States that three per, cent of the peopleý

SENATE
of that country own ninety per cent of the
wealth, and ninety per cent of the people do
not own their own homes. There are men
in the United States who are paying taxes
on incoines of five millions of dollars and
more, while tens of millions of people are
starving.
Conditions in Canada are nlot so
bad, but thev approximate. This is capitalism
gone mad, and if drastie remedies be not
applied, conditions will get worse. The United
Statos is not likel *y to cancel willingly the war
debts. In this respect she is like most other
creditors, whother national or individual.
If
Europe would take Mussolini's advice and do
xvhat suited itself, regardless of what America
might think or say, the United States would
likely faîl into line, because she could do
nothing else, and the world might be saved.
At some place in Canada, 1 tbink shortly
aftcr bis return from England last summer,
the Prime Minister made this public and
solemo declaration: 'Onýly the gracu of God
can save the world." 1 believe that in that
doclaration lie put bis finger upon the cause
of aIl our troubles and proelaimed the remedy.
A f ew y cars ago, 1 think, hoe held different
vicws. if experience and responsibility have
caused him to change his mind in that regard
bie is to be congratuilated, and hoe is also to
be congratulatcd upon having the courage
and the honesty publicly to announce the
change. If God created not only this world,
but the universe of wbich it forms a part,
and sustains it during evory moment of its
existence, thon, as reasoning beings, we must
surolv conclude that Ho has the power to
intorvene, in a spccial niannor if nocossary,
and save it from destruction, and that Ho
wiIl likely do so if His morcy be invokod. In
the first place, is there a God? If so, did Ho

He w'ishcd tbem to do? The immensi'ty of

would bc an answer to the first question. The

from the grave, prove lis divinity.
That

But I shaîl submit what appears to me to be
additional proof; neot that it is at ail nocessary wben speaking in the presonce of

St. Pauîl, Who had been one of the brig'htest

to hunt out the Christians and destroy them.
The miracles of Jesus and His resurreetion were
discussed by overybody; they were the ves'y
reason for the existence of the Christians. What
happencd? St. Paua, from being the greatest
persecutor of the Christians, became the
greatost defender of Christianity, and in
some respects pechaps the greatest of the
Apostles. The evidence that convinced and
converted bim would, I think, ho sufficient for any court of justice in the world
that would proporly consider it, and it is
certainly sufficient for me. Perbaps it would
do no harma to add that the explanatiom which
ChriËtianity gives of the Creaition, and of
tbings as xve flnd them, is far more rea.sonable

Prior to the Chiristian era there were, four
or five great empires. Wbere are they now?
And %what

suppose there were several causes, but some of
theni stand out prominently. The riglit
honourable 'leaýder of the Sonate believes, as
stated in bis address on "The Price of Silver,"
that the fali of the Roman Empire "wau due
more than aJl else to a concentration of the
procious metal supply and to a failure of
governmeatal authorities to maintain a volume
of currency adeqiîate to increasing production."
Thiat xvas doubtless a eontributory factor, but
I think the real cause or causes went mueli
deeper. I ask, what caused the downfall of the

MARCH 3, 1932
older empires? I agree with those who beaieve
that the decay and final collapse of those
empires were caused by the corruption in high
places, the concentration of great wealth in
the ha"id of the f ew, the profligacy and
immoradity which usually accompany such conditions, sud the consequent enfeeblement of
the race. And are not ail or moot of these
causes in the world to-day? We are more
guilty than the pagans of dld, because we have
had the -benefit of the Christian revelation.
Woe unto thee, Chor azin! woe unto thee,
Bethsaida! for if the mifghty works, which were
done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and aehes.
Andthou, Capernaum, which art exalted unte
heaven, shait be brouglit dowýn to heli: for if
the mighty works, which have been done in
thee, had been doue in Sodom, it would have
remained until this day.
If God is to be believed, it was not the
shortage of a metallic currency that caused
the destruction of those cities and peoies. If
we are following in their footsteps, can we hope
to escape similar punishment? Possibly this
world-wide depression may be sent as a
chastisement, and if accepted in the right
spirit may save us from stili greater and more
enduring evils.
A short time ago I read in the newspapers
of the antics of a very wealthy society woman
in the States, who stayed at Reno, Nevada,
just long enough to satisfy residence requirements so that she could get a divorce from
her hukband. While technicatly residing at
Reno, she came to Montreal to meet another
man, who later became her husband, a wealthy,
titled English nobleman, and to arrange
the details of ;their wedding. The couple were
married at Reno on the same day the lady
obtained ber divorce, and they left immediately for California on their honeymoon.
The papers went on to say that the newlymairried received -the congratulations of
hundreds of friends on bath sides of the ocean,
and :that the wedding presents were fabulously
costly. If this were an uncommon occurrence
it would not be so bad, but what an ocean
of immorality we must be living in that su-eh
conduet can 'he legal, honourable and even
fashionable!
It is said that when the wealthy meet at
the fashionable resorts and ask each other
how many wives or husbands they have had,
the questioned party has to stop and think for
a moment or so, lest he or she might make
a mistake in the numnber. And to come to
our own country, several doctors have told
me that since the automobile and the scanty
attire of women came into vogue, the increase in immorality has been ap.palling.

During the Great War ail the Christian
nations that were engaged in the struggle implored God to give them viotory. At la-,t
victory came to the Allied nations, and their
representaitives met at Ve'rsailles to arrange
the terms of peace. Was Jesus invited? Oh
no 1 The victorious nations did flot want Hum
any more. They had won the War by their
own prowess and generalship, and they could
settie the terms of peace. Moreover, five evil
spirits were invi.ted, and there was no room
for Jesus. The evil spirits were pride, anger,
hatred, revenge and vengeance, and they
dominated the pr.oceedings. We know the
results. The League of Nations was established. Has Jesus been invited to any of the
meetings of that body? No. Pride prevented
that. Generally speaking, the representatives
of the nations went to those meetings with
the idea of seeing what advantage they could
get over their neighbours by manipulation
and manoeuvring, a*nd not for the purpose of
seeing what servi-ce they could give to one
anotiher. To say the least, it would have been
inconvenient to invite Jesus while places had
to be found for the evil spirits of prude,
undue fear, suspicion and covetousness. The
League of Nations has accomplished some
good, but not much, and while the nations
of the world feel towards one another as they
do, it wiJl flot aocompylish much.
There is in this world another 'league of
nations, in w~hich we have a patent voice, and
that league will meet in this city in JuIy
next. The Prime Minister of Canada will
have a -commanding position at that meeting.
He has declared, and honestly declared, I believe, ithat "only the grace of God can save
the world." Do we need the grace of God
and shall we need His presence at that meeting? If so, we can have these blessin.gs for
the asking, for God himself bas said so; but
we must ask for thema in the proper way, and
not as the Pharisee prayed in the temple.
Here let me digress for a moment, to mention what I read in the newspapers a few
weeks ago. The Archbishops of Canteitury
and York composed a prayer which they
wishcd to have read in the -churches under
theïr ju-risdiotions. The prayer reads as
follows:
In the policy of our Government for the
restoration of credit and .prosperity, Thy will
be done.
Beeause we have been selfish in our conduct
of business, setting our own interest and that
of our clase before the interest of others, forgive us our trespasses.
Bec.ause we have indulged in national arrogance, finding satisfaction in our power ove-.
others rather than in our ability to serve thei'

CLERKS ASSISTANT 0F THE SENATE
EXEMPTION FRO?, CIVIL SERVICE ACT

Hon. J. W. DA1?NIEL rnoved the following
resolution:
Resolved, that the recommendation of the
Civil Service Commission, dated 18th January,
1926, exempting froin the operation of the
Civil Service Act in se far as appointmemts
are concerned, the Senate positions of First
Clerk Assistant, and Second Clerk Assistant, be
approved. (Vide Senate Journals, 1926, page

He said: Honourable senators, I thînk that'
perhaps a slight explanation of this resolutien would be in order. In June, 1925, the
Senate passed a resolution to the effect that
aIl officers occupying seats on the floor of
the 'Senate, to whom the Civil Service Act

the Senate. A copy of that resolution was

them to give effect ta the resolution of the
Senate by exempting the positions of First
Clerk Assistant and Second Clerk Assistant
on the Senate staff from the operation of the
Civil Service Act, in so far as appointments

were concerned.

The Commission sent a re-

port recommending that this resolution be
carried out. and the report was laid on the
Table of the House in the succeeding month,
February, 1926, but was not formally approved. The reason for the omission to approve the report was that the then Speaker,
the late Hon. Senator Bostock, who was a
lawyer, and the Law Clerk of the Senate, as
well as the Clerk of the Senate, agreed that
as the report of the Civil Service Commission
was based on a resolution of the Senate, tbat
resolution itself was sufficient ta make the required exemption effective. However, last
suinmer the Civil Service Commission asked
the Department of Justice for a ruling as to
whether, in view of the fact that their report
had not been formally approved, the appointment that was made in 1926 was really valid;
and the Department suggested that in order
to remove all possible doubt for the future it
w.ould be better if the Senate did formally
approve the Commission's report.
The motion was agreed to.
BOARDS OF TRADE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 3, an Act ta amend the Boards
of Trade Act.

He said: Honourable senators, this Bill was
introduced in another place and passed there

on the 12th of last month. If an explanation
of its details is required I shall be glad to
give it, but it seems ta me that one is not
particularly necessary at this stage, on account
of the very clear and direct remarks made
upon the measure by the Hon. Secretary of
State in the other House.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I do not desire to delay the disposal of this order, but I think my honourable friend might place on Hansard the explanations contained in the brief that he

that the honourable gentleman has before

ta give us to-morrow, or whenever we go

Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that the Dominion Board of Trade is now
non-existent and that the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce has replaced it. But I do not
know where that body meets, how often it
meets, nor of what boards of trade and chambers of commerce throughout the country it
is composed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There will be no
objection whatever to giving the explanations
requested by my honourable friend when we
go into committee, which in the ordinary
course of events should be to-morrow. My
thought was that we could perhaps facilitate
the business of the House in that way. I
understand that one of the purposes of the
Bill is ta prevent confusion arising from the
use of the name " Board of Trade " or
" Chamber of Commerce " by any organization in a district where there already is a
Board.

BOARDS OF TRADE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On the motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,

the Senate went into Committee on Bill 3,
an Act to amend the Boards of Trade Act.
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.

MARCH 4, 1932
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I asked yesterday that the Senate
be informed as to the reasons for these
amendments to the Act, which were not given
us on the second reading. I desired to know
what had been the activities of the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce, which is substituted
in the Bill for the Dominion Board of Trade.
I take it for granted that the Canadian
Chamber is a federation of boards of trade
throughout Canada, but I have not seen
anything of its action in the past.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen, I cannot enlighten the Committee very much about the operations of the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce. I do
recall one very considerable enterprise which
they launched in the interest of Canadian
trade, in having a visit made by prominent
industrialists of this country to the West
Indian Islands and to various countries of
South America. But I am not here in any
capacity representing that association, which
was organized under a Dominion statute.
The charter under which it operates was
issued on the 12th of January, 1929. If my
history is at all accurate, the honourable
gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
had then a great deal to do with the Government of Canada; so I should expect him to
be very familiar with the operations of the
company then launched. However, whether
it did very much good or whether it did not
I really cannot say; but what it wants is to
obtain certain amendments to the Act. Those
amendments, in the main, have passed the
Commons, but there are certain further
changes that we desire to make.
The honourable member leading the other
side asks for an explanation of the changes.
They are not very momentous. The Boards
of Trade Act appears in the Revised Statutes
of 1927 as chapter 19. Section 3 is to be
amended by the changing of the word "person"
to "persons" in subsection 2, added as part
of the first clause of this Bill. The section
itself is a restraining section, preventing persons from using the words "Board of Trade"
or "Chamber of Commerce" unless they are
in a duly chartered board. I presume this
is for the protection of the public, the idea
being to prevent the unauthorized and confusing use of the name. The purpose of the
section is very clear.
Perhaps while I am on my feet I might as
well proceed to give the reasons for the
additional changes. Section 2 of the Bill
provides as follows:
2. The provisions of subsection two of section
six of the said Act shall apply to any application for incorporation under any special or
general Act of Parliament of Canada, with the

75

right to use the names "Board of Trade" or
"Chamber of Commerce" or any other name so
similar as to be liable to be confused therewith.
That is to say, it is forbidden to use those
words; and spurious boards of trade, as we
may call them, cannot overcome their difficulty by applying for a charter with that title.
Section 3 provides:
Any board of trade duly registered as aforesaid under the provisions of this Act, may
become affiliated with the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce-which is the name of the central organization-on duly complying with all the terms and
requirements of that organization, and may be
represented at all its ordinary or special general
meetings, held from time to time.
I intend to move a further amendment to
strike out the words, "all its ordinary or
special general meetings, held from time to
time," and insert the words, "its annual
meeting."
Subsection 2 reads:
(2) The delegates or representatives to the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce shall be
elected at a general meeting, duly convened,
of the board of trade desiring such affiliation
as aforesaid.
It will be moved in amendment that after
the word " to," in the first line, the words
"the annual meeting of" be inserted; also
that after the word "convened," in the third
line, the words "or by the Council" be
inserted, and that the word "affiliation" be
changed to "representation."
The whole effect of these changes is that
the machinery is hereby provided for representation of the individual boards of trade
at the central Chamber of Commerce. The
method of election and the purpose of the
election are somewhat altered by the amendments which are to be moved. The election
is simplified, and the duties of those elected
will be merely to attend the annual meeting.
That is the only meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce as a central body, though the
executive of the Chamber meets frequently
during the year in different parts of Canada.
There is no purpose at all in having members
elected by the individual boards of trade to
the executive of the Chamber of Commerce.
They will naturally be elected by the Chamber
of Commerce itself. This is the effect of the
amendments proposed and those which I am
about to move.
Section 4 of the Bill provides that the
secretary, and not the president, shall furnish
the duplicates for record in the office of the
Secretary of State. None of the amendments
is of world-shaking importance.

Riglht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I should like
to ask my right honourable friend a question.
Does he believe that if the Parliament of
Canada subsequently passed an Act incorporating a body of men with these names
which section 1 says, in effect, shall not be
tolerated, the later Act would not override
this legislation? In other words, can Parliament by passing the present measure declare
that it cannot pass any Act that might override this one?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Trade. I believe it was constituted not by a
special Act, but under Part 1 of Chapter 19,
section 3:
Any number of persons, not less than thirty,

who are merchants, traders, brokers, mechanies,
. . . may associate themselves together as a
board of trade and appoint a secretary.
As such boards were not established by a
direct act of our Parliament, my right honourable friend will understand why they did net
come under my review. Seeing that the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is to replace the
Dominion Board of Trade as the federal body,
I wondered whether my right honourable

of the disappearance of the Dominion Board,
and its replacement by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

honourable friend tell us whether the section
itself gives the power te that body, created

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should like te
know where is the authority under this Act
te impose such regulations?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
Most of our
towns and cities now have boards of trade,
and I should like te ask whether they have
been consulted about this Canadian Chamber
of Commerce and have given their consent to
this change?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They have
been in that organization all along. The
Chamber of Commerce is in effect the central
organization of these boards of trade. It does
not impose regulations.

eHon. Mr, STANFIELD: Are. ill of themn
in it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: It is the
central organization, very muQh in the Mame
sense as the Centrel Liberal Association, and
woul be elected, I presume,: by the various
consqtituent, bodies throughout the country.
Right, Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does the right
honourable gentleman accept those regulations?
.Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
the Canadian *Chamber of Commerce is the
present successor of the Dominion Board of
Trade, which was neyer incorporated, asý far
as I know-and I havehad somne littie connection with it. The Dominion Board of
Trade, with the consent of those who comnprised it and participated in its deliberations,
changed its name vohuntarily to the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce and took out a charter.
But there are many boards of trade in the
Maritime Provinces that have no connection
with the Canadian Chamrber of Commerce,
and they are not obliged, to join that body.
Many small boards oftrade in towns ail over
Canada function independently. In the East
we have endeavoured to f orm a central organization, which is known as the Maritime
Boardsý of Trade, and we try to meet once a
year. Last year our meeting was held at
Halifax, and the preceding year at Moncton.
Individual boards of trade who send delegates
to any such meeting do se in a voluntary way.
Dealing with the question raised by the
honourable gentleman from Colchester (Hon.
Mr., Stanfield), I. doubt that many boards of
trade know anythirg, at ahl about the existence
'Of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. On
the other hand, I enu see no possible reason
why any board of trade should obj ect ýto this
*
Bill, for as I gather from the amendments
read by the right honourable leader of the
House, their purpose is .merely to make legal
what. is beizig practised at the present time.
H1on. Mr. BELGOURT: My honourable
friend maust understand. that ýthe,.practice to
which he bas alluded, in the, Maritime Provinces, wihh not be possible in future. if, this
Bih is passed.
*Right'Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN. O.h, yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUJRT: Oh, no. Under
section 1-it, wilh not be possible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the ëffect ýof it et. aIl.
,Hon» Mr. ýBELCOURT: The: exphanatory
note on section 1 says:
The purpose, of .this.amepdment is to prevent
the possibility 'of persons or organizations using

-77

the -name "Board of Trade" or "Chamber of
Commerce" within any district occupied by a
duly constituted Board.
So in future the practice that my honourable
friend from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
has described will nlot be possible.
RKight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is entirelywrong. It wlll not
be possible for any board of trade or any
chamber of commerce within a district in
which there is already a duly c.onstituted
board to use either of those terms in its titie
unless it is duly registered in accordance with
the Act.
Hon. Mr. BELjC'OURT: That is what I was
trying to say.
Right Hon. M'r. MEIGHEN: But any board
of trade does nlot need to becQme a part of,
or to have anything to do with, the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce, as I rea d the Bill.
AhI that section 1 says ie that neither of these
names can be used by any body of persons
within any district in which. there is a duhy
registered board of trade, unless they are
registered under the Act. ,That does not say
that such e body must be part of the central
organization. I have no doubt that the boards
of trade to which the honourable gentleman
from Westmorland referred are duly registered.
What he said was that they had nothing to
do with the Can-adian Chamber of Commerce.
Hon; Mr. DANDURAND: The adhercnce
is voluntary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: Yes. Section 3 of the 'Bill provides an amendment to
enable any duhy registered board of trade to
become affiliated with the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce, but there is no compulsion
about it. Section 1 of the Bill provides
that the following subsection shaHl be added
to section 3 of the Act:
(2) No person shall within any district in
which there is a Board of Trade whieh is
registered under the provisions of this Act,
use the words "Board of Trade" or "Chamber
of Commerce" as part of the name under -which
tbey are incorporated or doing business, or any
other words so similar as to be liable to be
confused therewith, VinIess they are incorporated
as. a body corporate and politie under this Act
or under a special or general Act of the Parlisment of Canada.
EvQry registered board of trade bas a certain ares delimited in thç memorandumn which
is the basîs of'its registration. After every
such board is registered, no other :body of
men within that. distFict or area can organize
and caîl themselves a board of trade. .Any
board of tradeso registered may,,if it chooses
so to do, become afflliated with the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce and elect delegates

SENATE
to that body, but it is equally at liberty to
snap its fingers at the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If the central body
does net choose to accept the application,
that is an end of it.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I still think I am
right. This amendment would prevent any
number of persons from using the words
" Board of Trade " or " Chamber of Commerce " anywhere.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do net know
what my honourable friend means by " the
central body."
If he means the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce he is 'incorrect.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

No, it would

I think it would.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Only within
any district in which there is a registered
board of trade.
Precisely. But
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
what is meant by "district"? There may be
a registered board of trade in the city of
Saint John, for example, or the city of Montreal, and no body of men could organize
under the name of " Board of Trade " or
" Chamber of Commerce " in a suburb of
either of those cities, because of the prohibition against the use of such names in those
districts. I repeat that what has been going
on in the past, as described by the honourable member from Westmorland, cannot continue in the future if this Bill becomes law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

That is not

SO.

Section 6 of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Act, chapter 19 of the Revised Statutes
of Canada, is informative. It says:
6. Where the district is situate wholly or
partly within a district for ewhich there is an
existing board of trade, the certificate shall be
acconpanied by a statutory declaration of two
or more of the persons signing the same as to
(a) the facts in that regard;
(b) the population of the existing district;
(c) the population of the proposed new
district:
(d) the population of the existing district
as dininished by the proposed change;
(e) any facts or considerations which made
the establishmsent of the new board expedient.
2. In snch cases
(a) the existing board of trade shall be
afforded an opportunity to show cause against
the proposed change;
(b) the certificate shall be recorded only
with the sanction and authority of the Governor
in Couincil.
According to that section an application
may be made for approval of the formation
of a new board of trade in a district in which
there is an existing board, but the new board
will be required to prove that there is need
for its establishment, and the existing board
will be given an opportunity to show why
it thinks the application should not be
granted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: There is another point
that may be interesting. I am speaking subject to correction, but I believe there are
in the country many boards of trade that have
been functioning for twenty or twenty-five
years and have never been registered. They
have been formed in various localities by
groups of men who desired to organize. I
imagine that if anything in this Bill would
take away from these businessmen the right
to call their organizations boards of trade,
there would be very strenuous objection.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I am making.

That is the point

I thought
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
the honourable gentleman's point was somewhat different, but whether it is the sanie or
not, it is wrong. There is nothing in this
Bill to compel registration, but apparently the
existing law gives the privilege of registration
and provides that any board desiring to be
registered shall set out in its application the
district it desires to have allotted to it. For
example, if a board of trade in Saint John
chose to be registered, its application would
probably specify its district as the city of
Saint John. If the application for registration
were granted-and that would be donc by the
office of the Secretary of State-then, according to this Bill, no other body of persons
organized within that district could use the
words "Board of. Trade" or "Chamber of
Commerce" as part of their name, without
first applying to the Secretary of State and
giving the particulars set out in section 6 of
the Act, as read by the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
If the office of the Secretary of State chooses
to consider the application, it will communicate with the existing board of trade in Saint
John and give it an opportunity 'to be heard
in opposition to the application.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall we now take up
the Bill section by section?
On section 1-use of names restricted:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I move that the word "persons" be
substituted for the word "person."

MARCH 4, 1932
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there any necessity for that? The word "persan," according to the Interpretat-ion Act, is either singular
or plural.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, but one
ought to use the right word. A person is not
going to cail himseMf a board of trade.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
But the Interpretation Act says -the word "persan" means
person or persans.
Right Hon. MT. MUIGHEN: Regardiess
of the Interpretation Act, it is always well
to have legisia.tion worded so that the wayfaring men, though fools, shall fot err therein.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps the
word "persans" should be used here,- because
,no one person can form a board of trade.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Better refeT it to
the Supreme Court.
The amendment and the section as amended
were agreed to.
Section 2 was agTeed to.
On section 3, subsection 1-board may
affiliate with Canadian Chamber of Commerce:

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND

READYING

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH moved the second
reading of Bill 17, an Act to amend the
Marriage and Divorce Adt.

79

He said: Under the Act as it now is, a mni
can legaîiy marry either his deceased wife's
sister or the daughter of his deceased wife's
sister, but cannot legaiiy niarry a daugliter of
his deceased wife's brother. Similariy, a woman
can now iegaiiy marry either her deceasqed
husbarad's brother or the son of her deceased
husband's brother, but not a son of her
deceased husband's sister. The a.mendments
proposed are in the words underlined in the
Bill, and axe designed to remove these
anomalies, which wouiïd seem to have been due
to oversight.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Quite clear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 have here a
memorandum on legiÉiation on this question
by the British Parliament. In 1907 it amended
the law so -as to legalize a man's marriage with
bis deceased wife's sister. In 1921 the Act of
1907 was amended by the insertion of the
words, "or between a man and his deceased
brother's widow." In 1931 the British Act
was furither amended by the insertion of the
words:
or between a man and any of thefollowing
persons; that is to say:(1) His deceased wife's brother's daughter;
(2) His deceased wife's sister's daughter;
(3) His father's deceased brother's widow;
(4) His niother's deceased brother's widow;
(5) His deceased wife's father's sister:
(6) His deceased wife's mother's sister;
(7) His brother's deceased son's widow;
(8) His sister's deceased son'a widow.
I arn instructed that if the Bill which I have
here is passed, not only will the English law
concerning marriage contain ail the provisions
of the Canadian marriage law, but its provisions wîl1l stili remain wider than those of the
law of Canada. 1 mention that merely Vo
reassure those who think we are going too f ar.
I move the second reading.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would ask the
honourable gentleman whether these marriages
are now prohibited in Canada by statute.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I assume that mnasmuch as they are not provided for in the Iaw,
they are theraby .prohibited. Such marriages
have been takiDg place, and I fan-cy that
where there is an illegal marriage, even though'
the parties are not aw-are of the prohibitions
of the law, the chiIdren will be illegitirnate.
I fancy, moreover, that the amendinents made
to the Iaw from time to time are based on
actual occurrences connected with prosecutions.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Is there much demand
for this -law now?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Well, there wouid
be a demand from at least two persans, I

should say, for these two amendments. In the
English law, where it provides for the man,
it provides consequentially for the woman,
on the opposite side of the problem. We do
not seem to have donc that; therefore we must
legislate specially. This Bill has passed in
another place without much difficulty. It
seems to be a reasonable proposal; in fact I
am sure it is.
May I ask
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
the honourable gentleman this question?
Would the passage of this Bill have the effect
of liegalizing marriages that otherwise might
not bo considered absolutely legal? . In other
words, would it be retroactive?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
question.

That is a legal

I would ask the
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
honourable gentleman to tell me, if he can,
whether there is any law in Canada to prevent
the marriages provided for in this Bill?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am instructed
now that it would be retroactive.
Perhaps my
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
honourable friend would answer another legal
question. Is he quite sure that we are not
infringing on provincial rights? Is it not
purely and simply a question of civil status?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In this particular
case it is just possible that the two parties
may reside in different provinces. In any
case there would seem to be marriage and
divorce legislation in Chapter 127 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada. I take it the
question had been thoroughly discussed at the
time that legislation was passed, and it was
decided that it was within the jurisdiction of
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
have my doubts.

It may be, but I

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman's question is quite pertinent.
I should think tha't if the proposed legislation
were not retroactive it ought to be. There is
no reason in the world why, if we legalize
marriages on a certain basis, we should
maintain the illegality of marriages contracted
in the past on the same basis, a.nd decline to
protect the status of the children. Now, suppose it comes about after this that a certain
marriage is challenged, and the marriage was
made ten years ago. The law says, "A marriage is not invalid merely because"Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is a
little word there, the word "is," that bothers
me.
Hon.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
only word that can be used. It does not say,
"A marriage shall not be invalid"; it says, "A
ma-rriage is not invalid." Even if it said
"shall not be," I think it would probably
apply to past marriages; but with the word
"is" it seems to me there is no doubt about it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What was in
my mind was what the right honourable leader
bas expressed--that if it is right to make these
marriages legal in the future it -certainly
ought, in behalf of the children, to be retroactive.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: After the passage
of this Bill nobody could challenge such a
marriage, because notice would then be taken
of existing conditions.
I would ask the
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
honourable member whether the marriage
ever was invalid.
Hon. Mr.
question.

BELCOURT:

Another

legal

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is not
a Goverment measure. The invalidity of
marriages has not been governed, as far as
I can recall, by Canadian statute. Probably
it has been established by virtue of the clause
which imports into Canada the British law
prior to the passing of the B.N.A. Act. By
virtue of the common law of England there
were certain classes of prohibited marriages.
I fancy that the prohibition which is implied
here as having existed bas a derivation as
far back as that. I do not think there is any
absolute prohibition in Canada.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The Bill to permit
marriage with a deceased wife's sister was a
very difficult one to pass. It was thrown out
on three different occasions by the House of
Lords before it became law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

We should

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: If, as appears to be
the case, this Bill is to be retroactive, are we
not in danger of legislating away some civil
property rights that have grown up under the
existing law?

is always inquired into carefully, because a
child's mind is very impressionable and it is
not always easy to determine when a child is
teilling just what happened. I do not like the
practice of changing our criminal laws almost
from day to day, at the request of certain
classes of people. I suppose this measure
originated with a children's welfare association or similar social organization. Personally,
I heartily agree that any person who endeavours to bring up a child in crime, or to
make any criminal suggestions to a child,
should be liable to .punishment. But I do not
think a magistrate or anyone else should have
the power of depriving a parent or guardian
of his liberty solely because of a story that a
child may tell. It seems to me that the House
should be given some stronger reason than
has been given for the passing of this amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have read the
explanatory note with a view to seeing if there
is any justification for the Bill. I should like
to say to my honourable friend that the proposed amendment does not appear to be any
more vague than the Act itself. I see no
special objection to it. The Act was passed
for the protection of children. Juvenile courts
are constantly dealing with cases where
children are in very grave danger because of
the immorality or vice of parents or guardians,
and it has been found that in certain instances
the law does not go far enough to reach
accused persons who are guilty of having
exercised immoral influence over children. It
is therefore proposed that the Act be amended
by the addition of the following subsection to
section 33:
It shall not be a valid defence to a prosecution under this section that notwithstanding the
conduct of the accused the child did not in fact
become a juvenile delinquent.
If this amendment were ipassed a guilty
parent could net escape conviction by pleading that the child had not become a delinquent. Of course, much can be said about the
danger of the administration of criminal law
by justices of the peace, but I confess that I
can find no special reason why this Bill should
not become law.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is alpparent that
this legislation is being asked for by a number
of provinces. I would draw te the attention
of the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) the last paragraph of
the explanatory note:
The purpose of the present amendment is to
make it clear that it is an offence to do any act
which is likely to make any child a juvenile
delinquent, whether as a result of such act the
child did or did not in fact become a juvenile
'on.

Mr. McMEANS.

delinquent. The amendment is put forward at
the instance of the Attorney General of Manitoba. and is supported by the Attorney General
of Nova Scotia; the Solicitor to the Attorney
General's Departnent, Ontario; the Attorney
General of Alberta; the Attorney General of
Saskatchewan and a number of officials and
societies interested in the enforceinent of the
laws relating to child welfare.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I think the case for this Bill would
be seen in a clearer light if a hypothetical instance were to be given. Let us suppose it is
brought to the attention of the authorities
that a girl of twelve is living with parents
who are maintaining grossly immoral conditions. It undoubtedly was intended that the
maintenance of such conditions should constitute an offence under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, which was framed, as the honourable gentleman opposite has said, for the protection of children. Now, under the Act as
it stood for many years, if those parents were
brought to court to answer for their misconduct as related to that child, and if the defence counsel were able to show that the child
was net yet in the condition defined by the
Act as delinquent, they would escape conviction. Their offence would be exactly the
same as if it had had its natural result, but
because the child had net degencrated, possibly because it was too young to be influenced by the conditions about it, the parents
could net be punished. It can hardly be
argued that they should escape in this way.
Surely, if the Act is to have any real and
substantial effect it should apply in such a
case. In order that it might be made effective
in this respect, Parliament in 1921 passed an
amendment to make it applicable te parents,
guardians, or other responsible persons whose
conduct was such as to be likely to contribute
to the delinquency of a child. But a case
under this law went to the Court of Appeal
in Manitoba, and the Chief Justice of that
province held that despite the insertion of
the words "to be likely te," Parliament had
not succeeded in altering the law as it previously stood, and that in respect of the
defect sought to be cured by those words the
Act was a nullity. Now this Bill is brought
forward to provide that no longer shall the
ineffectiveness of the conduct of parents or
guardians be a defence, if their conduct is
sucb as the Act declares to be wrong, having
regard to their duty to the child. That is
the sole object of the Bill.
The honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) fears that Parliament
is unduly intruding upon the liberty of the
people and adding unnecessarily to the list of
offences.
But this Bill would not create

MARCH 4, 1932
any new offence; it would merely add ta
the law a very common-sense provision in
respect of the conviction of an accused person
for conduct that is already deemied ta be an
offence.
The honourable gentleman referred also ta
the care that must be exercised in dealing
with the evidence of a child. There is fia
intention to change the law with reepect ta
the effeot ta be given ta a child's evidence,
and the quantity and quality of evidence
necessary ta establish an offence. I know
that courts are careful about accepting unsubstantiated evidence of a young child. They
should be just as careful after this Bill is
passed as they have always been.
While I arn on my feet, may I say a word
or two for those wha are interested in this
type af legisiation, chiefly the members of
children's aid societies and like arganizations?
I do flot know of any people who render a
more unselfish or practically useful and admirable public service than those very people.
There is one gentleman in this city who is
keenly înterested in this legisiation. I refer
ta Mr. W. L. Scott. As long as I have been
associated with Parliament, and that is a
long time now, hie has given very unselfish
service ta this cause. I knaw similar men
in Manitoba. I think they are seekcing, nat
ta interfere, but rather ta do samething of
very real value. And they are doing it. They
ask-and they have associated with their request the Attorneys-General of a number of
the provinces-that an avenue of escape, which
obviously Parliament neyer intended shauld
be left open ta those guilty of off ences
covered by the Act, shall be closed once and
for ahl. I think that we ought ta accede ta
their request without hesitatian.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Section 1 was agreed ta.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hanaurable
senators, I desire ta move that the Bill be
amended by'adding thereta section 2, ta read
as follows:
The said Act is further ainended by adding
to section 37 thereof the f ollowing subsection:
(3) Application for leave to appeal under

Supreme Court judge may see fit ta fix either
before or after the expiration of the said ten

Under the Iaw as it naw i&--this information was conveyed ta the Departmnent of
Justice by Mr. W. L. Scott, and the proposed
amendment was suggested by him and concurred in by the department-there is no time
limit whatever ta an appeal, under section 37
of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. Surely there
should be a limit; otherwise a conviction may
hang betwecn heaven and earth forever, or as
long as the sentence in any particular case
is being served.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Why are the words
"Supreme Court judge" used? There is fia
Supreme Court in Manitoba.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This amendment has been cancurred in by the Department of Justice, and I prestime there is a
definition covering that matter. The Manitoba Court that is analogaus ta the Supreme
Court of Ontario is the Court of King's
Bench.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It wouhd be
the Superior Court judge in Qoebec. I suggest that the Bill be left in Committee, and
perhaps the Department of Justice might
change the proposed amendment ta make
it applicable ta ail the-provinces.

had better leave the Bill in Co-mmittee. 1
move that the Committee rise and report

CRIMINAL CODE (CONVEYANCE 0F
PROHIBITED ARTICLES) BILL
SECOND READI-NO

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 11, an Act ta amend
the Criminal Code (Conveyance of Prohibited
Articles).
He said: Honourable members, the purpose af this Bill is ta apply ta. express coinpanies, ar other agencies of canveyance, the
prohibition against faciIitating the commission of offences in the nature of games of
chance. The Post Office, under the Post
Office Act, is forbidden ta carry mail matter.
that is used as part of the machinery of
these chance organizations, and they resort ta
the express companies foar anather means of
conveyance.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
senators, I should hike ta get a little information. In the reading-roamn this morning I
happened to see a news item which stated

SENATE
that a newspaper publisher in Western
Ontario had been awarded the sum of $5,000
by a Montreal paper-the name of which I
cannot recall at the moment-for making the
most nearly correct guess of the total population of Canada as determined by the last
census. The competition was open to persons
who got subscription orders for the Montreal
paper, on the basis of seven guesses for each
subscription, and the winner had secured a
large number of orders. Would a competition
of that kind be considered a game of chance,
within the meaning of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
his intelligence.

He would have to use

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The question
which the honourable member asks is not
pertinent to the Bill. I want to say that first.
The Bill does not change in any way the
present law as to what constitutes a game
of chance as prohibited; the law remains just
the same. The Bill deals entirely with the
enforcement of the law. As it was, the law
was enforced by prohibition of the use of
the mails for the purposes of the offensive
act as defined. This extends the prohibition
to express companies. That is as far as the
Bill goes.
I do not know that I am able to answer
the honourable gentleman's question, which
is really a question of law. I think it quite
probable that the case to which he refers is
not within the definition. It was apparently
a competition; not wholly chance, but a
competition in capacity to estimate the population; very much in the nature of a competition that might be engaged in in trying to
decide a man's weight, or the age of the honourable member, or something of that sort.
I fancy it is not within the prohibition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
Act before me, but I know there has been
considerable discussion during the last eight
or ten years over amendments to cover games
of chance carried on by newspapers, mostly
in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Oh, no.

OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 12, an Act to authorize
an agreement between His Majesty the King
and the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I think members of this House will give
me credit for at least a little courage-which
I may not always have-if I refer to any
agreement between the City of Ottawa and
the Government. I have no objection to
the present Bill, but I would warn honourable
members of this House that if they attempt
at any time to discuss the expenditure arranged between the Government and the
City of Ottawa they will be liable to undergo
a verv severe criticism in the newspapers on
the following morning. I took occasion at
one time, in my simple way, to call the
attention of this House to the tremendous
expenditure of the late Government in making
Ottawa the great city of the Dominiontearing down hotels, opening roadways, and
all that sort of thing. I merely pointed out
that the expenditure of public money on so
vast a scale should be more closely criticized.
The next morning the press of this enterprising city contained a very severe attack on
myself. Though I have no objection to the
present Bill, I want to take courage to stand
up and say that, so far as I am concerned, I
am going to object to the expenditure of more
public money in the city of Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I thought the
honourable gentleman was rising to ask for
a ten per cent cut.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I could not say
whether the case cited by my honourable
friend is covered.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I should be very
glad to do so if there were any chance of
getting it.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
I think that after
we get a few more of these barbed wire laws,
to keep our morals attractive, we shall be
very good people.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Perhaps I
should explain-it should have been done
previously-that this Bill is to extend for
one year the agreement under which the
Government pays Ottawa $100,000 a year in
view of fire protection and other civic services.
For a number of years the amount stood
at $75,000, and in 1925 it was increased to

ORDERS IN COUNCIL BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act relating to
the submilssion to Parliament of certain Regulations and Orders in Council.
He said: This Bill, frankly, is to cure a
defect, a non-compliance with the provisions
of a previous Bill. The law provides that
at each session certain Orders in Council
under the Dominion Lands Act and the
Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks ActI think I have named them correctly-shall
be laid on the Table of each House, and shahl
be confirmed by resolution of each Bouse,
and if there is any failure in that regard,
then the eff ect of the Orders in Council
terminates on the second day after the session
closes. These Orders in Council were laid on
the Table of the Commons and on the Table
of the 'senate hast session, but, while tbey
were approved by resolution in this Bouse,
there was the omission of a resolution in the
Commons, and consequently they lapsed at
the close of the session. This Bill provides
that they shail be considered to bave continued in f orce in the same way as if they
had been approved in accordance with law.
I may say a similar omission occurred in
previous years, and it was cured by a similar
Bill in 1928.

the sentiment of honourable members of all
political opinions when I say that we hold
in high regard his long and honourable career
of public service and his intimate personal
association with us, and that we extend to
those who honour him as a father our deep
and sincere sympathy.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I have known the late Senator
Legris for more than forty years, and been
an observer of his long, active and useful
career. I have often noticed the able manner
in which he dealt with matters affecting agriculture and the lot of the farmer. He was a
farmer himself, had lands of his own, knew
the conditions which farmers had to meet,
and became very early in life their champion.
It was a decided advantage to him that he
was able to discuss with his own people, in
a way that they thoroughly understood,
various questions in which they were closely
interested. He was well equipped for his
work, for he had spent a great deal of his

Senator Legris. It will be appreciated at

perhaps the least intimate association with
him, and consequently am not in a position
to speak with that personal knowledge which
other members might summon to their aid.
I can only make such references to our late
colleague as can be made by a citizen of
Canada who bas learned of his life and work, spare time in endeavouring to educate himself.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before that
he had served as a member of the Legislature
of the Province of Quebec. His public life,
therefore, was one of the longest of which we
have record, and I feel that I can say without
exaggeration that it was one of the most
creditable. Born near Rivière du Loup, in
the Province of Quebec, be early took an
interest in agriculture, made a specialty of it
throughout his career, and became one of our
most interested and intelligent authorities on
the subject. Indeed, so clearly recognized
was his position in this field that in the early
part of the century, at the request of the then
Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, he
assumed the chairmanship of a very important
commission investigating the subject of colonization. His record as an official of his parish
was also long and creditable, extending over
two decades. In the Senate lie made himself
known and beloved of all on both sides, and
I am sure his rather sudden passing is deeply
regretted by every senator. Although for

hand, is comparatively easy, and I have known
English-speaking farmers who had no greater

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is a very
great eulogy to pronounce on a French-speaking man who bas had but a primary education
to say of him, as can be said of the late
Senator Legris, that by making the best
possible use of the means at his disposal
he succeeded in so mastering the French
language that he could write it most creditably, and when addressing his people he was
looked up to as a man of superior culture.
His example bas influenced many of his
fellow countrymen to try to better their condition. I have seen him in the Quebec Legislature and in the federal arena, and I can
say that as a representative of the farming
element in my province of Quebec he had

moved that it be amended by the addition of

was raised as to whether or not the amendment was f ully effective, because it contained
the words "Supreme Court judge." Some
honourable gentlemen doubted the apropriateness of that term because in certain provinces
there is no Supreme Court judge, the corresponding officiai in those provinces being a
judge of the Court of King's Bench or a judge
of the Superior Court. I have learned meantime that the term "Suprerne Court judge"
is defined in section 2, paragraph j, of the Act

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When the

the phraseology imported into the Bill, it
would be retroactive in effect. I do not think
any honourable member had any objection
te the substance of the Bill, at ail events if
its effect was entirely prospective and applied
only to marriages hereinafter contracted. I
had expressed the opinion, purely as a private
member of the House, that the Bill was retroactive: The honourable gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) raised the objection
that if such were the case civil rights might
be involved and seriously disturbed, and this
he feit would be unfortunate. What the
honourable member from Viotoria had in
mmnd, ne doubt, was that if hy the terms
of a will, for example, certain properties were

legitimacy of the children.as a prerequiflite

JUTVENILE DELINQUENTS

BILL

M

SENATE

this Bill which would later on legitimize the
cbildren, might conceivably, though not iikely,
have an effect that was flot intended. I expressed an opinion without much opportunity
for reflection and with none at ail for investigation. I have had that opinion checked by
higher authorities, and I may say to the
Huse that it bas been confirmed, but with
the very wise qualification, frequently empioyed by iawyers, that there is room for a
difference of view.
It is a principie of jurisprudence that the
terms of the legisiation itself must make very
clear that its effect is retroactive, and when
such an interpretation is adopted any other
interpretation must be virtually impossible.
However, the language of this Bill iS so explicit-that a marriage is not invalid because
of such and such a contingency-that, according to the opinion given to me, it is quite
probable the court would apply this law to
marriages noxv existing. It is for honourabie
members of the bouse to decide whether or
not they care to pass the legisiation in its
present form. It seems to me quite presumable that no injustice would be done even if
a calse arose where the retroactive effeet was
applicable.
In legisiation passed in Great Britain many
years ago, and in this Parliament in 1882, the
language employed was very specific. It said:
Any marriage hieretofore or hereafter entered
iilto and then went, on to express what the effect
of such a marriage would be. Legislation

that was passed a few years ago, bringing
about the effect stated by the honourable
member for Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
in bis introductory remarks, namely, Lte
legitimization of certain marriages of deceased wife's sisters, was similar in terms to
the legisiation 00w proposed. Undoubtedly
the draftsman of this Bill had that legisiation
in mind and followed it hecause it appeared
proper not to give nise to any additional
question, but to confine anything that ever
could be submitted to the courts to the same
compass as anything tbat could be submitted
under the earlier legisiation. It seems to me
that was the wise course; and as we are now
simply adding to the list of valid marriages a
corresponding ciass, it is probably wise on our
part to empioy the same phraseoiogy as was
then employed. Personally I see no objection to the Bill. I speak as a private member,
not as a member of the Governent.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Can the honourable
gentleman inform us whether marriages made
between such parties heretofore are invalid?
.Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Otherwise there would be no object to the legisiation.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is just the
point. A man opposed to the Bill miglit show
the marriage to be invalid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does flot the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans) recognize that in the case of
a man who desired to repudiate bis wif e for
that cause, we shouid be standing on solid
ground in asking him, to show some other
cause?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I bave no objection
to the Bill. I amn mereiy asking for an expînnation.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn responsible
in n measure for injecting into the discussion
the retroactive effect of the Bill. When the
Bill wvas up before, the right honourable leader
of the Governrnent, in bis private capacity,
said he thought that if it was not retroactive
it shouid be. I adhere to that view. I amn
confixrd in my oýpinion abotthese marriag-es
largeiy fromn my association with the late Sir
Wilfrnid Laurier. A delegation of weii-meaning
persons brought before Sir Wilfrid and myseif,
as a cornittee of the

Covernment, a, pro-

posai that certain things should be deciared
to be crimes. Sir Wilfrid impressed upon
those people the tact that to accede to their
request wouid expose the iiiegitimacy of many

people who did not dream of anything of the
kind. H1e refused to pass any such legisiation
as was, advocated, and convioced the deputation that they would bave to wvnit at ieast
until the older generation had passed away
before they could hope to have such an enaet-

ment placed on the Statute Book.
Brushing aside, if you wili, the legai question, of which 1 know nothing, I think it is
the duty of Panliament to proteet those who
are unable to protect themnseives. If chiidren
should wake some day to find that, owing
to the gneed of some person who desired to
seize what they had thought was their birthright, they were decia-red illegitimnate, Parliament could not very weii escape its
responcibility.
To my mmnd any civil
demand-any legai demnnd, if I may use the
termn-pales into insignificance before the
human deimand of the cbild. If thizs Bill is not
retroactive, I wouid have it strengthened in
order that ehiidren who have always thought
they were legitimnate may be iooked after
as it il the duty of Parliament to look after
them.

SENATE
The amendments proposed are in the words
underlined in the Bill, and are designed to
remove tiese anomalies, which would seem to
have been due to oversight.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me to ask him a question?
I think he said that a certain type of marriage
would not be in accordance with the law, as
lie has been instructed by learned counsel.
Can he tell us what the law is, or where it
is to be found, that prevents certain kinds of
marriages?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I take it that the
law is to be found in Chapter 127, Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
prohibit anything.

That

does not

I do not
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
want to be taken as assuming sponsorship of
the Bill, but I think, from what we do know,
the presumption is clear that the new matter
that would be enacted by this Bill as law is
not now law. The Marriage and Divorce Act
-and in order that the subject may net be
unduly complicated, I will deal only with
the clause that would be replaced by the
first clause of this Bill-reads now:
A marriage is not invalid nerely because the
woman is a sister of the deceased wvife of the
man, or a daughter of a sister of a deceased
wife of the man.
It is a clear presumption that prior to the
enactment of this clause the kind of marriage
there provided for would have been invalid.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

That is not very

convincing to me.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, it
should be convincing to this extent: Parliament enacted that law some years ago, and I
think we may assume that Parliament was
not enacting something that was already law.
Some time ago it certainly was net law in
England that a man could marry his deceased
wife's sister, or a daughter

of

his

deceased

wife's sister. We know this because the
British Parliament, after very long deliberation and controversy, passed an amendment
making such types of marriage valid. The
law in England as of a certain date is the law
in Canada unless altered by Canadian statute;
and as the law in England at one time was
that a man could not marry his deceased
wife's sister, or a daughter of lis deceased
wife's sister, I do net think we are assuming
anything extraordinary when we assume that
such was the law in Canada until the passing
of our enactment on the subject. Now the
purpose of this Bill is to extend the law by
making it possible for a man to marry a
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

daughter of his deceased wife's brother, and
for a woman to marry a son of her deceased
husband's sister.
What I have sought to bring home to
honourable members is that if we assume we
are now enacting something which already is
law, we must also assume that when Parliament enacted the Marriage and Divorce law
in its present form it enacted something which
then was law. That is a rather remote possibility te start with. We must also assume
that at some previous time Parliament had
changed the English law. I have not heard that
Parliament ever did se, and I am certain that
in my own time it never did. Consequently,
there seems to be sufficient evidence that the
law prier te the passing of the Marriage and
Divorce Act in its present form was that a
man could net marry his deceased wife's
sister, or a daughter of that sister, and that
the law at the present time is that a man
cannot marry a daughter of his deceased
wife's brother, nor can a woman marry a son
of ler deceased husband's sister.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
tLem, perhaps.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The right honourable gentleman's argument is only another illustration of that great ingenuity of
lis with which most of us are familiar. But
I must say it is net very convincing.

its convincing chaýracter as he gets older.

ADMIRALTY BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend the
Admiralty Act.

MARCH 8, 1932
Hie said: Honourable senators, under the
present law the Exchequer Court, acting in the
execution of its duties as an Exchequer Court,
aside from Admiralty, submits its rules of
court to the. Governor in Council. and when
appr.oved by the Governor in Council they
become law. However, when it has been acting in the execut ion of its duties in the
Admiralty Division, its rules of court have
had to be submitted to His Majesty's Government in England, after being approved by
the Governor in Council of Canada. It is
now held, and I suppose can be assumed, that
because of the Statute of Westminster, which
is imagined to have brought to this country
the new and larger freedomn, we no longer
have to submit our Exchequer Court rules
to lis Majesty's Government in England;that we eau give themn sufficient sacrosanetity and validity by having themn approved
by the Governor in Counci] of Canada. This
Bill provides that Exchequer Court rules in
relation to Admiralty matters, as heretofore
in relation to ail other 'matters, are to be
pyromulgated and made valid after submaission
to and approval by the Governor in Council
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I understood that
the passing of this Bill would prevent differences in Admiralty matters throughout the
Empire. I may say I asked a judge of the
ýidniralty Court about the Bill, because I
take an interest in such matters, and hýe told
me that the object was to have the same rules
throughout the British .Empire, as far as
possible, due regard being had to different
conditions that exist in various countries
under the British flag.

91

Right Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This measure
is made necessary by the Statute of Westminster. I think that others could becorne
more enthusiastic over that Statute than I
can, but it seems to me that inasmuch as it
is law, it becomes the flouse to pass this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is permissible,
under the Statute of Westminster, but not
necessary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is
contemplated under the Statute, and in order
to harmonize our position under the Statute
we ought to pass this legislation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 0f course, it may
lead to confiict.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may, but
the burden on rny head will not be very
serious.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: Is there any
necessity of going into Cornmittee? I think
these rules ean hardly be amended by the
Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn not
pushing the matter at all, if there is any desire
to consider the Bill further.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the

'rhe motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third tirne, and passed.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the very
reverse of what the Bil proposes.

PRIVATE BILLS

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
doubt that that was the purpose of the law
as it stands, and I should not like to argue
too strenuously that the law as it stands is
flot just as good as the law that is proposed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But this is a departure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think we shail
have this session a Bill concerning the
Merchant Marine, drafted along lines that
have been agreed. upon by Great Britain and
the Dominions. This is but one of the effects
of the Statute of Westminster.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- But it does not
touch the broader question of maritime law,
which I think will corne before Parliament
f or review this session.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE moved the second reading of Bill Dl, an Act respecting the Quebec,
Montreal and Southern Raidway Company.

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE BILL
MOTION

FOR

THIRD

READING

POSTPONED

On the Order:
Third reading of Bill 17, an Act to amend
the Marriage and Divorce Act.-Hon. Senator
Griesbach.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
in the absence of the honourable member for
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), I beg to
move that this Order be discharged and placed
on the Orders of the Day for to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
motion carnies, and without seeking to accelerate the progress of the Bill, I may say that
I happen to have had an opportunity to
investigate the law and am now in a position
to place certain facts upon record for the
information of honourable members, or for
criticism. I do not sec the honourable member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) in his
seat. I am sorry, because what I have to
present to-day might go some distance in
convincing him. It is in full accord with the
opinion expressed yesterday as to the present
state of the law, and with the assertion that
unless this Bill is passed the prohibitions that
do exist will remain.
The prohibitions took root a long distance
back, in the Act of 32 Henry VIII, Capter
38.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
on marriage.

U
He was an expert

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: These prohibitions, and many more, ail took effect by
virtue of that statute, and the Colonial Laws
Validity Act, 28 and 29 Victoria, Chapter 63,
prevented Canada as she then existed from
modifying the law relating to marriage. It
will be observed that up to Confederation the
prohibitions existed by virtue of the British
law, running back to the time of Henry VIII.
Since Confederation certain changes have
been made. In 1882 this country repealed,
"both as to past and future marriages, and as
regards past marriages as if such laws had
neyer existed," ail laws prohihiting marriage
between a man and the sister of his deceased
wif e. The Act of 1882, however, contained
certain provisions as to rights of property in
existing cases. In 1890 the Canadian Parliament went further: it repealed in the same
way and to the same extent ail iaws prohihîting marriage between a man and the daughtcr
of his deceased wife's iister "when no law relating to consanguinity is violated." The
saving section as to property was again inserted. It will be observed that up to this
time the only prohibitions removed were as
to marriage between a man and his deceased
wife's sister or marriage hetween a man and
the daughter of his deceased wife's sister.
Under the Marriage Act, Chapter 105 of
1906, the following provision appears:
A marriage is not inva-lid merely because the
woman is a sister of a deceased wif e of the man,
or a daughter of a sister of a deceased wif e of
the man.
This Act merely embodies the effect of the
previous removals of restrictions.
In 1907 a further statute was passed which,
though on the same subject, is immaterial.
In 1923 Parliament went further, however,
and in amending the Marriage Act provided
as f ollows:
A marriage is flot invalid merely because the
marn is a brother of a deceased husband of the
woman, or is a son of such brother.
Nothing further relevant to these points
has heen donc by statute. It would look as
though the various amendments to the old
English law, which had effect in Canada, were
made in anticipation of special cases, and no
general review of the real merits of the question took place at ail. We have gone on
to remove the restrictions piece by piece, and
the present Bill provides for the removal
of still another of the restrictions.
The Order was discharged.

of the present convention are intended to

Article 28, of course. needs legislative sanction. It should be noted that a Bill, the provisions of which are intended to cover this
article and the reservation, has already been
mntroduced in the Hou-.e of Gomimons hy
the Secretary of State and has receiî ed bts
second reading. The reservation, the adoption of which by Canada is recommended,
provides that wherever these marks, or any
other marks constîtuting an imitation thereof,
have in the past been used for a Iawful purpose, tliose having se used thiem may continue
to do so, but must not use them for nny
other purpose. I am sorry that I am not in
a position te inform honourable members as
te jtist wvhat practice thm.t is intendcd to

lurpose te be served; and it is my understanding that lhe reservation in ne way interferes with the acceptance of the convention.
Its whole effeet is evident from bts termas.
It nîerely records another development in the
sIowv and painful process of broadening the
cîrcle of sympathy and humanity, and making
war less hideous.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: CouId the right
honourable gentleman net take up the second
resolution at the same time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: If the Senate
has power to consider two resolutions at once,
I have no objection at ail.
The second resolution is somewhat different
from the first. It deals with the treatment of
priseners of war, and reads as f ollows:
Thlat it be reso]ved:
That it is expedient that Parliamient do
appreve of tlîe International Convention relative toe lc I'eatinent of Prisoners of W/ar,
Geîieva, Jîîly 27, 1929, signed on behalf of
Canadfa by the plenipoteiitiarv% named therein.
on January 29, 1930, and that this House do
approve of the same.

The Red Cross Convention of 1864, which,

as we ahl know, rendered very great service,
wvas revised in 1906 at an important conference
held in Geneva. In 1907, at the Second Hague
Conference, bts provisions were adapted to
maritime warfare.

MARCH 9, 1932
The history of the efforts made before the
Great War to afford proper treatment ta
prisoners of war somewhat parallels the history
of the efforts on behalf of the wounded and
sick in armies in the field. The principles respecting the laws and customs of war on land
were first laid down in the second convention
of the Hague Conference of 1899, and were
revised in the fourth convention of the Hague
Conference, 1907. The agreements reached
and the regulations annexed thereto covered
the subject-matter very thoroughly, and were
ratified or adhered to by nearly all the nations
of the world. They may be regarded as being
to some extent the basis of the International
Convention relative to the Treatment of
Prisoners of War, Geneva, July 27, 1929, which
is the convention we now seek to have ratified.
Among certain subjects discussed at the
Tenth International Conference of the Red
Cross, held at Geneva in 1921, was the preparation of an international code relating to
prisoners of war. Draft regulations were prepared by an international committee, which
sat at The Hague in 1921, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Younger. At the Eleventh
International Conference, held at Geneva in
1923, the Red Cross Societies put forward an
elaborate draft convention on the subject. In
1924 the International Committee of the Red
Cross.proposed that the question of preparing
an international code relating to prisoners of
war should be laid before the Diplomatic
Conference. Meanwhile the appropriate authorities in Great Britain and Canada were
giving attention to the report of Lord Justice
Younger's committee.
In August, 1925, the Swiss Government enquired whether the Governments concerned
would be willing to take part in a conference
for the revision of the Geneva convention of
July 6, 1906, and whether they would agree to
entrust to the Diplomatic Conference for the
revision of the Geneva convention the task
of preparing a code for prisoners of war.
In 1929 the proposals of the Swiss Government were accepted, and the Diplomatie Conference met at Geneva for the purpose of revising the Red Cross Convention of 1906 and
preparing a code relative to prisoners of war.
The two conventions which Canada has
signed are now before Parliament for confirmation. The purpose of these conventions
is to lessen as far as possible the evils inseparable from war, and, as I expressed it
before, to perfect and complete the provisions
of previous conventions, which, as everyone
knows, served to lighten somewhat the awful
burden of suffering entailed by the late war.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members, I need not emphasize the fact

95

that ·I am fully in accord with the motions
that have been proposed by the right honourable gentleman for the approval of these two
conventions. I thought both might well be
submitted to the House at the same time,
because they bear on practically the same
subject-the consequences of war, and the
effort to reduce to a minimum the sufferings
of the wounded and sick in the field, and of
prisoners of war. All I desire to say is that
these two conventions were prepared during
the years preceding 1928, and gradually were
given definite form at conferences held in
Geneva. I mention 1928 because prior to that
date, under the Covenant of the League of
Nations, war was recognized as a possibility,
and any effort to diminish its dire effects
would seem to have been quite logical and
natural. But after such a solemn gesture as
the signing of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, by
which the nations of the world agreed to
abandon war as an instrument of national
policy, it might have been thought that conventions such as these would be unnecessary.
Yet we have them before us to-day. I suppose war can still take place. We have heard
of clashes between two countries that are not
at war, but in which these conventions would
play an important part. It is to be hoped
that as time goes on the need of understandings of this kind, -to reduce the sufferings that
accompany war, will become less and less
apparent. Those who live for the next ten
years will see whether the world is moving in
the right direction. There may be a reduction of armaments, and the desire for peace
may-be evidenced by official action at various
conferences such as are now being held at
Geneva, but peace must enter the soul of
man before it becomes universal.
I notice that reference was made in the
other House to the order in which the signatures appended to these conventions appear,
and the fact that the President of the German
Reich signed first. The reason why Germany
appears at the head of the list is rather
amusing. Although the German representatives to the League take very good care to
speak German on the floor of the House,
and sometimes in committee, yet Dr. Stresemann attended the Assembly as the representative, not of Germany, but of Allemagne.
This placed his country at the head of the
alphabetical list of nations. I said to him
one day that he had better beware-that we
might feel justified in denouncing him for
appearing before the Assembly as the representative of a country bearing a French name.
These two conventions are humanitarian
agreements to which we can readily subscribe, always with the hope that their provisions need never be called into play.

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I should like to ask
whether these conventions will apply where
war actually exists, though it has not been
formally declared, as between China and
Japan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The point
the honourable senator makes is not only important, but difficult to answer. His question
is whether, if these conventions were adhered
to by China and Japan, those countries would
be bound by the terms of the conventions
in respect of the hostilities that are now
taking place between their armies, though
neither country has declared war, each, I believe, protesting that it is not at war. On the
point in question the convention reads as
follows:
The President of the German Reichand a multitude of others-being
equally animated by the desire to
lessen, so far as lies in their power, the evils
inseparable from war and desiring, for this
purpose, to perfect and complete the provisions
agreed to at Geneva on the 22nd of August,
1864, and the 6th of July, 1906, for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and
sick in arines in the field,
Have resolved to conclude a new Convention
for that purpose and have appointed as their
plenipotentiariesand so on. Then proceeding to page 7:
Who, after having communicated to each
other their full powers, found in good and due
form, have agreed as follows:Article 1. Officers and soldiers and other
persons officially attached to the armed forces
who are wounded or sick shall be respected and
protected in all circumstances; they shall be
treated with humanity and cared for medicahly,and so forth. As far as I have been able
to glance over the terms of the treaty, having
this question in mind, I should say they contemplate war. They do not say that war
must be declared. Apparently they are based
on the mere presumption that a state of war
virtually exists.
Being equally animated by the desire to
lessen. so far as lies in their power, the evils
inseparable from warthey indicate that the purpose of this convention is:
to perfect and complete the provisions agreed
to at Geneva for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in the armies in
the field.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Taking the two references together-and they
are the only ones I can find bearing on the
point-I should think that so long as there
is an actual condition of war, the convention
would apply, even though there is nothing
in the ivay of a declaration. War, even when
it is admitted by each side to exist, is not
always preceded by a declaration. Undoubtedly the convention applies when war is
admitted on both sides. There may be some
doubt when one side does not admit it, but
I should say that so long as there are armies
in the field, and the evils of the actual practice of war prevail, the convention applies.
The proposed resolution to approve of the
International Convention for the Amelioration
of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick
in Armies in the Field was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons, to acquaint that House that the
Senate doth unite with the House of Commons
in the approval of the International Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of
the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field,
Geneva, July 27, 1929, signed on behalf of
Canada by the plenipotentiary named therein,
on January 29, 1930, subject to the following
reservation:
"That the Government of the Dominion of
Canada will interpret article 28 of the convention in the sense that the legislative measures
contemplated by that article may provide that
private individuals, associations, firms or companies who have used the arms of the Swiss
Confederation, or marks constituting an imitation thereof, for any lawful purpose before the
coming into force of the present convention
shall not be prevented from continuing to use
such arms or marks for the same purpose."
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That it be resolved:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the International Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War,
Geneva, July 27, 1929, signed on behalf of
Canada by the plenipotentiary named therein,
on January 29, 1930, and that this House do
approve of the same.
The motion was agreed to.

Hoa. Mr. DANDURÀAND:
right honourable f riend will explain.the reason
for the proposed withdrawal. I received MY
notice this morning too late to attend the
committee meeting.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senatorM these Bil were prepared by the
Department of Justice ini consequence of a
decision given by the Privy Council luat fall.
which decision to some degree kmited what
were considered to be the powers of the
Parliament of Canada with respect to insurance. The Bis as drafted, while submitted
as within the jurisdiction of the Perliament
of Canada, were taken exception to on the
part of the provinces, and many of the corapanies affected also feared that if the Bills
became law they would involve the country
and, the provinces in renewed, litigation on
the question of jurisdiction. In these circumstances the Committee on Be.nking and
Comnmerce endeavoured to effect some compromise, to arrive at a conclusion which should
be as far as possible ini harmony with the
views of the provinces and of the insurance
companies that were very closely concerned.
In the process of thre discussions it appeared
certain that this resuit could be arrived at
only 'by a complete redrafting a.nd reprintiaz
of the Bills. It is probable that more than
two, Bills will be presented in lieu of those
now souglit to be withdrawn. I do flot con.aider it essential to go further at the present
time, except to, assure honourable members
that at the earliest possible date the redraîted
Bills will be submitted to the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bills
were withdrawn.

TIIIRD READING

Bill 17, an Act to amend the Marriage and

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING BILL, 1931, No. 2
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 21, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to
authorize additional provision of money to
meet expenditures made and indebtedness incurred during the calendar year 1931.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
reminiscent of the ,events cf several years
gone by. The provision which it la sought
to make by this Bill has frequently, I think
usually, been made by way cf supplementary
nrr

98

SENATE

estimates. The supplementary estimate, were
that means adopted now, would be applicable
to the year 1931-32. Instead, the method of a
separate Bill hias been adopted.
The purpose of the Bill is to appropriate
a sum of eleven million and some hundred
thousand dollars for the Canadian National
Railway Systemn in order to enable the Systemn
to provide, for the deficit of the past year,
a sum in addition to the provision that was
made by Parliament last session, which provision turned out to be inadequate to the
extent of the amnount stipulated in the present
Bill.
Honourable senators are entitled to know
how this amount is arrived at. The figures
are somewhat complicated. As I proceed I
shahl do everything in my power to simplify
them. That, I think, I shall do best by
naming the debit items llrst, and not mixing
them with the credits.
Parliament estimated a year ago that
$31,000,000 would be required for the purpose
of paying the interest on the indebtedness
outstanding to the public, irrespective of the
indebtedness outstanding to the Crown. It
was estimated that the railway would earn
enougli to pay the balance of the 852,000,000.
Instead of earning enougli to pay that balance
it lias earned only 81,000,000 over and above
operating expenses. Therefore the provision
Iast year should have been $51,000,000 instead
This heaves a deficit of
of $31,000,000.
$20,000,000, which lias to be made Up.
Under the heading of equipment, principal
payments, sinking fond, etc.-a classification
that lias been in effect for some time-an
additional sumn of $492,000 was required, and
as this lias not been provided, it must be provîded at this session. The estimate of hast
year under this heading was $3,000,000, but
to fulfil the requirements it should have been
$3,492,000. Adding together $20,000,000-the
differonce between $31,000,000 and $51,000,000
-and this $492,000, we have $20,492,000.
There wvas in addition an item of 811,000,000. The -plan adopted by the System, and
known as the Philadeiphia plan, for the financing of equipment by means of equipment
bonds, proved inapplicable last year owing to
the money stress. Usually twenty-five per
cent is paid, the balance being in the f ormn of
equipment liens, which are very readily sold
in the cnoney markets. Last year these liens
were not sold, and consequently the Government had to, provide the money directly.
This $11,000,000 plus 820,39,000 makes the
total of the debits up to, the present $31,392,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

By some process of addition that was not
xncluded in my education, the figures given in
the other Chamber total $32,393,000. 1 think
that the 851,000,000 appeaýring in the record
should be 852,000,000, and that the de6icit on
the first item should be $21,000,000 instead of
That would make the total
$20,000,000.
debits $32,393,000.
W*ere there no credits, we should have f0
provide this additional sum. But there are
credits, as follows:
Last year for additions and betterment
there was submitted the figure of 820,687,000,
but, as the sum spent was 86,900,000, there
was lef t on hand a balance of $13,700,000.
Under the provisions of the Act savings on
one vote could be allocated against deficits
on another; we are therefore in a position
to credit the 813,700,000 against the summation of the previous debits.
Then last year there was an issue of bonds
to the extent of $70,000,000, and the proceeds
were handed to the road for certain specified
purposes, including the Montreal terminal,
the Toronto terminal, brandi lines, and the
Northern Alberta ]Railway. The appropriations allotted to these several items were not
wholly spent. As to the amount provided for
the Monireal terminal, $4,293,000 was flot
spent; as to the Toronto terminais, 81,356,000;
as to branch lines, $1,635,000, and as to the
Northern Alberta Raihway, 845,800. In the
total there was a saving of $7,331,000.
So we have two items of savings, 813,700,000
and 87,331,000, or a total of a little over
820,000,000. The deduction. of this sumn fromn
the debits leaves the balance as provided in
this Bill.
If honourable gentlemen should require further details I could give them. The figures
so far are round rather than accurate, thougli
to get thcma as accurately as I have done lias
necessitated going to the Special Committee
Honourable
of the House of Gommons.
gentlemen will see that in respect of three
separate appropriations the road required $32,393,000 more than it got, and tliat in respect
of two others it required about S21,000,000
less than it got. We therefore now have to
make up the difference of $11,000,000.
Hon. Mýr. DANDURAND: I did not quite
understand the reference made by the riglit
honourable gentleman to this item being
brouglit in in tlie form of a Bill instead of
supplementary estimates. I realize that the
supplementary estimates whinh would contain
such an item as this would be supplementaries
for last year. We generalhy have two, sets of

MARCHI 10, 1932
supplementaries during the session, one to
cover deficîts in the year previous, and the
other to cover items of expenditure to be
made, which have not appeared in the main
estimates. Did we proceed lust year by way
of a vote of Parliament to the Canadian
National Railways, or by a Bill to finance the
Canadian National Railways?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 'I think it
was done last year by a supplementary estimate. If the House will pardon me, I will
read from the remaTks made 'by the Minigter
of Railways in introducing the Bill. He said:
This Bill is really one which in the pust has
been put through the Houe as a supplementary
estimate, where necessary, for the Canadian
National Railways.
If those words did not need qualificationand I have no reason to think they didthey mean that last year we put through a
supplementary estimate, if an estimate was
required, and that this is the first time we
have prooeeded by way of a Bil.

Mr. BARNARD:

The honourable

'to stand.

Hon. Mr. PARENT inquired of the Gov'erriment:
For purposes of currency or otherwise, is the
money of the Dominion of Canada put on such

basis as to mean that one "billion"' represents
one thousand millions or one million millions?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The word
"billion" has two meanings: (1) ia the French
system of numeration, usually f ollowed in the
United States and in 'Canada, a thousand
millions; (2) in the English system, a million
millions.
While' in ordinary commercial and financial
practice la Canada the word "billion" would
be taken as meaning a thousand millions, confusion is avoided usually by the publication of
statistics or amounts in numerals, or, where
they are written, as ini official documents, by
the amount belag expressed both in words
and in numerals.
As the inquiry refers specifically to currency
in Canada, it may be added 'bhat the figures
of our currency are considerably under one
thousand millions and there is little likelihood
of confusion on account of two meanings of
the word ",billion."

SENATE

CRIMINAL CODE (CHEQUES WITHOUT
FUNDS, AND GRAND JURIES) BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 22, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code (Cheques without Funds, and
Grand Juries).
Hon. L. MeMEANS:
Honourable members, when Hon. Mr. Ross was leader of this
side of the House, and for some time before,
lie took a very great and careful interest in
ail matters relating to amendments to the
Criminal Code, and I may say to the honour
of that gentleman that the Code to-day contains many amendments proposed by him
after reference to a committee. I am going to
ask the right honourable leader if, in accordance with the same procedure that was
followed by Hon. Mr. Ross, he will have this
Bill referred to a committee of the House,
so that we may obtain more information
about it than we have at the present time.
I have no objection to the Bill at present,
but I believe a similar measure was amended
by the Senate some time ago and our amendments were rejected by the other House
swhen the Bill was sent back.
I should like to know whether a law such
as the measure now proposed is in force in
any other country, and if so, what is the
effect of it, and what would be the effect
of it here. I do net like to see a Bill that
bas passed in another House without receiving consideration accepted by this House
without a good deal of study. We might
obtain much information from the Department of Justice: we might learn something
of the reasons for the Bill, and something
of the effect it would have.
I have in my hand a copy of The Ottawa
Citizen issued about the time the Bill passed
the House of Commons. It contains a short
item in regard to this Bill, which says:
To the extert to which it will put down
professional worthless check issuers, the public
will be whole-heartedly behind the Bill to
amend the Criminal Code introduced by Mr.
Guthrie. But that the amendment will be open
to certain grave abuses seems apparent.
The exact wording of the amendment is as
follows:
I need not read that. Then it goes on to say:
Plainly, the amendment is aimed primarily
:at those who deliberately seek to defraud by
way of the worthless check trick. So long as
the proposed law is applied to these gentry only,
al] well and good. It is not, equally plainly,
aimed at the innocent issuer of an N.S.F. check,
which is a different thing, and those who
opposed the Bill on the ground that it would
expose honest citizens to unjust damage were
on firm ground.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I should be glad if the right honourable
leader of the House would consent te letting
the Bill go to a committee. I should like to
know exactly what is the present law. My
impression is that a man who issues a cheque
for which there are no funds, or not sufficient
funds, is liable te prosecution for obtaining
goods under false pretences; but I am not
sure of that. I think it would be in the
interest of the country at large that the right
honourable gentleman should allow the Bill
to go to committee.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I will do my best to give
the honourable member from Winnipeg (Hon
Mr. MeMeans) and the House the information that he desires. I think I have enough
information to enable the House to deal intelligently with the Bill-the information with
which the other House seemed satisfied, and
possibly a little more.
If honourable gentlemen will read the Bill
carefully it will at once be clear to them that
it deals solely with the law of evidence. It
does net make a crime of anything that was
not a crime before, but merely decides what
is sufficient evidence on a certain set of
facts to shift the onus of proof.
Possibly I should bu more in order if I
were to endeavour first to answer the question
which the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg put in the latter part of his speech, but
which really relates to the initiation of this
discussion. The question was: What is the
law to-day as affecting this point, that is to
say, the acquirement of goods by worthless
cheques? Honourable gentlemen must concentrate on the fact that this Bill does not
affect the whole range of NS.F. cheques; it
deals only with NS.F. cheques that are given
as a means of procuring goods, or something
capable of being stolen. In other words, the
Bill concerns only the case of the acquirement
of something capable of being stolen by the
handing over of what turns out to bu a worthless cheque. Addressing myself to what is
the present law, I would say this: it turns
solely upon the point of false pretences. If
a prosecutor desires to obtain a conviction
against a person who has secured goods by
means of a worthless cheque, be must establish
to the satisfaction of the court that the man
handing over the worthless oheque was guilty,
in so doing, of obtaining the goods by false
pretences. in a word, he must bring home
to that man the guilt of false pretences. I
am not seriously criticizing that condition of
the law, but the interpretation of the law,
especially in the lower courts, lias been rather
unsatisfactory in that it seems to be very

MARCH là, 1932
generally fheld there that if the acoused shows
that he had some few cents or few dollars
in the bank the allegation of false pretences
is disposed of, and he escapes. This, I say,
is the interpretation frequently given in the
lower courts, 'but I do not think it is ever
upheld in the higher courts. Suffice to say
-and I know the honourable member from
Winnipeg wil at once appreciate the pointthe law as it is turns solely on the establishment by the prosecution of false pretences.
If this Bill should pass, the law would stiil
turn on the establishment by the prosecution
of false pretences. It must stili be shown that
the accused was guilty of false pretences in
the obtaining of the thing capable of being
stolen. But the Bill assists in the discharge of
that onus, for it says that once the prosecution
estaiblishes that the man got the goods by the
presentation of a cheque which was worthless
a prima facie case is made out, and thereafter
the onus is on the accused to show that he
had reasonable grounds for believing that the
cheque would be honoured if presented within
a reasonable time. I do net know that the
Bill disturbs the succession of the onus, but it
does assist the prosecution in esta'blishing a
prima facie case of false pretences, and, at an
earlier moment than it would have been done
under the old law, the burden is shifted to
the defendant. I hope I have mnade myseif
entirely clear se far as I have gone.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH STAUNTON: Is it nlot
shifting the entire anus froma the prosecution
to the defendant, presuming a man guilty
when he is not proven guilty?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
That is what it
means.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman has already been answered by
the honourable member for Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans) and it is with some deference
that I venture to offer an amendment. The
prosecution i8 stiil compelled to establish false
pretences. When it succeeds in establishing
false pretences, by showing, first of ail, that
the man procured goode by presenting a
cheque, and secondly that it was worthle,
then the onusis on the defendant. The prosecution must go to that extent before there
is any onus at ail on the defendant. Consequently, no man i8 adjudged as guilty until
he is proven guilty, but the law says that ho
ie proven guilty of getting goods by false protences if it is shown that he got the goods by
giving a cheque knowing it was worthless.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What does the right
honourable gentleman mean by the lower
courts?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- Ahl the courts
lower than the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec and the Supreme Court in
Ontario and in the Maritime Provinces.
We now come to the question whether it is
botter to alter the law so as to assist the
prosecutor in a case of this kind. I hope that
honourable gentlemen wir not think that
neyer before in history has the prosecution
been assisted by a presumption established in
law at a certain point. There are numerous
cases throughout the Criminal Code where the
law declares that upon such and such a thing
being shown a presumption of guilt immediately arises. This is especially so in the
liquor cases in Ontario, and I venture te say,
iu other provinces as well. Not only does it
apply in the sphere of liquor offences, but it
covers a far wider territory than that. It al
becomes a question of what, ail things considered, contributes most to the establishment
and sway of justice, and I hope honourable
gentlemen will nlot err too much on the side
of the man who gets the goods, by regarding
himn as the only man to be protected. Somotimes he is a criminal; sometimes he is not.
At aIl events, he has got something that he
should not have got. The other fellow is out
something that he should not be out, and lie
must be considered too.
The principal applicants for this legi3lation
are the retail merchants of the country. They
are asking for it through the medium of their
many associations throughout the length and
breadth cf the land. Others alsgo are pressing
for it, and the pressure on the members of the
House of Commons lias in many individual
cases been very great. 1 believe the number
of worthless cheques passed li Canada in a
year aggregates now about seventy thousand.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does the right honourable gentleman mean that seventy thousand
are not paid afterwards?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGH-EN: There are
seventy thousand cases of cheques presented
and dishonoured. I would not say that lin the
seventy thousand cases no man ever got anything. A maxi may have been paid if he
waited long enough, but hie was always put
te a degree of trouble that he should not
have beexi put to, and in maxiy cases he
suffered a very severe lems. 0f course, in jý
large numnher of cases this Bill will nlot assist
even if it is passed. 1 read the Bill to mean
that it applies, as I said in my opening remarks, only to cases in which. goods have
been procured on the faith of a cheque which,
when presented within a reasonable time,
turned out te be worthless. It would not

102

SENATE

apply to a cheque given on an account for
goods which had been supplied on credit ini
the first place.
Han. Mr. MeLEAN: Would it apply in
the case of a man who borrowed money and
gave a cheque?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Money is the samne as goods, and consequently
if a man gets money for a worthless chaque
the onus is shifted to him. But if a man,
already having consumad the goods supplied,
and slept in the bed furnished, pays a hotel
bill by a worthless cheque, the hotel-keeper
would flot be assisted by this Bill-though
possibly he should be-because the man has
flot ohtained by means of a worthless cheque
goods capable of being stolen.
Such are the limitations of the application
of the law, and such the limitations of its
affect when applied. 1 submit that we are
now in a ara of kite-flying cheques, when these
cases are epidemic over the length and hreadth
of the country, especially in our towns and
cities, and that it is probahly going to be
worth while to try at least to minimize the
devastation that is being wrought by this
thing among our retailers. 1 do flot think
that any Inan who with honest intent gives a
chequa that turns out tu be worthless will
have any real difficulty. Many a time we
give cheques without having money in the
bank, but having every reason to expeet that
they will be honoured. Perhaps they have
been honoured for months. There may be a
regular habit of overdrawing. If in such circumstances a man is accused, ail ha has to do,
as soon as the onus is placed on him, is to go
into the witness box and say: "I had every
right to think the cheque would be honoured.
I had a running account. I was neyer told
that 1 would ba allawed no furthar overdraft. I issued, the chaque in good faith,
expecting it to ha honoured." Then it is for
tha court to decide whether or nut ha wvas
acting in good faith. It should not inflict a
vary great hardship on anyhody to ba tald:
"Let us know 'the facts. Tell us why you
thought that chaque was good." Undar this
law the issuer of the cbaque may hava to
explaîn that a little soonar than before. It
is much aasiar for him to do it than for the
othar fellow to tell wbat wvas in this man's
mmnd whan ha gava the chaque. It is not
unreasonable to say to the man who has the
goods, and wbo douhtless refusas to, raturn
them: "AIl right. Your chaque is no good.
Go into the box and tell us why you say
you ware honest in what you did." Suoh is
the extent of the measure, and no more.

has been givan as to why this i5hould flot
apply ta hotel bilis? Hotal-keepers parhaips
suifer as .much, proportionately, as the retail
marchants. Many hotels display a sign saying that thay will flot honour any cbaques,
and as a rasult a man whose cheques ara good
is hiabla to suifer incanvenienca, tbough in
anme cases, when the hotel-keapers know the
man and know that ha is boncst, tbay will
accept his chaque. I was wondering what
rea.son thare could be for not including
cheques givan to hotal-keepers. I am amenabla
to, reason.
Righbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should say
thare are t'wo raasons. First of aIl, a botelkeeper who has givan a man room and board
and run an account with him witbout receiving a daposit in advance, who has simply
accepted tha man on his face and is given a
chaque which the hbank refusas to bonour, is
raally in the saine position as a storakeaper
who, aftar ha has let an account with a
customar run for soma days, gats a chaque
which turns out to ha wort.hless. Naither
the storekeaper nor the hotal-keeper has any
recourse under the Bill, and I do flot know
bow it could ha made applicable to a person
wvho givas a wvorthlass chaque for roomi
and board obtained on credit, if not applicable to one who givas a w'orthless chaque
in paymcnt of a standing account. In
the second place, aven if means could ha
found ta maka sucb a distinction, it must ha
borna in mind that section 407 of the Criminai
Coda providas certain rernedias for the hotelkeepar. Under th-at section a man who runs
a liotel account and doas not pay, or gives
a worthless cheque-and ýthat means hae dma
flot pay-may ha .prosecuted and is hiable to
punisbment. But the retail storekeeper bas no
special remedy at aIl.
Hon. IR. DANDURAND:
Honourabla
sanators, I hava read this Bill and I feel inclined to apprave it. It seems to me there
would ba no hardsbip imposed an a man wha
in good faith givas a chaque which later
proves ta ha wortbless, for, as the right
'hanourable gentleman bas said, the man can
return the gaods obtained in exohanga for the
chaque. But if he intands ta ratain the goods,
then I tbink tha anus of proving bis innocence
should be upon him. There may be many instances like the hypothatical ana citad by my
rigbt hanourabla friand, where a hotal-keaper
advances some credit, but somatimas the hotel
has a lien on the traveller's luggage. 0f
course the lien may ha ralaased for a chaque
wbich La dishonoured later on. We might

MARCH 15, 1932
proceed witli amendments to the Criminal
Code ta caver sucli cases as are contemplated
by the Bill, and leave the consideration of
other types of cases for the future.
It is a provoking thmng to receive a worthlems cheque. Yet thousands of such cheques
are issued, though not always ini exehange for
goods. Sometimes the issuer has but a f ew
cents ini the bank. A few days ago a banker
told me lie fit justified in noti-fying a mn
that his account was closed and sending him
a choque for the balance to his credit, wlien
that balance was, say, seventy-five cents, sud
there had been presented against it ten
cheques for -large suins. The issusuce cf
worthless cheques is a fraud committed upon
thousands of people, who itake the chieques in
good faith. I do not see why we sliould not
protect su-eh people, who provide goods or
services in exebange for that kind of document.
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: But are sucli people
giving their goods away? In the last twentyfive years the channels of trade in this country
have completely clianged. In the old days
there was in each village, town and township,
especially in the West and in the Province
of Quebec, a gener>l store. The proprietor
knew ail his customers, wlio made their payments either li cash or by chieque. The law
did noet presume suoli off ences as this Bili
contemplates, and I do not like the creation
of thern now. I think the facts should be
clearly proven against a mn before he is
convicted. At one time I represented the
Crown in the old city cf Montreal, and over
a much longer period I acted as defence
counsel. In ail those years I neyer saw an
innocent person f ound guiity, althougli I saw
many guilty persons escape.
We shouid net multiply offences of the kind
referred ta liere. To-day business is done
through the banks, not on a cash basis. Everyone bas a current bank account, wherein
sometimes there is a credit balance, but very
often, perhaps oftener, a debit balance. Now,
it lias happened that thle President of sny
bank, tlie leader on this side of the Hous
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), bas given a chieque
when lie well knew that his bank balance was
net 'large enougli ta meet it; -but lie knew
also that there wouid be sufficient funds there
within a few hou"s.

I-

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Let us flot create
new offences based on legal presumption. It
is terrible to think that a man might be
sent to jail or penitentiary for presumed guit.
As I have said, the channels of trade have
completely changed; they have been revolutionized. To-day the customer does not go to
the manufacturer, but the manufacturer sends
his agents or retailers ta sinaîl merchants and
other people in villages and towns, and makea
them alluring offers of a piano, a pianola, a
radio, an organ, or what not. For cash? No.
The purchaser may pay by instalments. He
is told: "Give a few dollars to begin with,
and we shall cail f or the balance in five
months. You will have ample time to pay
the balance." That sort of thing is one of the
causes on this continent of the commercial
revolution and the present crisis. People are
commonly lured ini that way, and Vhey give
cheques which tliey know will be honoured,
although they may not always be sure that
there will be sufficient funds when the cheques
are presented at the banks.
It would be easy to persecute a man by
bringing him before the courts and having
him f ound guilty upon legal presumption.
Let us not make that kind of law. I amn
willing that this Bill should be sent ta committee, as suggested by my honourable friend
from Winnipeg (Mr. McMeans), and be
thoroughly sifted there. We should be carefui not to multiply offences. Our Criminal
Code is as nearly perfect an institution as it
can he, but it is very heavy and we must
not burden it with additional classes of
offences. I1 would rather punish the man
who seils an the instalment system a.nd
imposes his wortliless merchandise on guilible people who live in isolated country
places and do not realize the full amount of
money they ultimately pay for goods bought
in that way. If the adoption of the Bill
were ta be voted on to-night I should have
to vote against it.

Hon. G.,LYNO.H-STAUNTON: Honourablet
mexubers, it may be that mny eduicatian 1fr
the principles oaf British institutions and
justice has unduly prejudiced me against the
modern innovation of presuming a man guilty>
before the charge against him is proven. 1

104

SENATE

boast of British law-and counsel commonly
say, "Better that ninety-nine guilty men
should go free than that one innocent man
should be found guilty." Throughout thé
British Empire, wherever British law obtains,
every judge, every lawyer, has it instilled intd
him that the Iaw throws the greatest possible
protection about an accused person. But I
notice the present tendency is away from that.
Now and then, in the regulations of government departnents, there creeps in the clause,
"It shall be presumed." In an Act which I
consider is a disgrace to the Statute Book of
Ontario there is a provision that the presumption shall be against the citizen and irt
favour of the prosecution.
The right honourable leader of the House
tells us-and I have no doubt that lie lias
been given this information-that there is an
average of 70,000 bad cheques issued in
Canada every year. Well, if that be so, therd
must be a great multiplication of suckers in
this Dominion. An annual total of 70,000
means a weekly average of 1,500; so it should
be notorious that these cheque frauds are
being perpetrated. But I must say that
although I read the local papers and pay
particular attention to legal news, I do not
see two of these cases reported in the city of
Hamilton in a year.
Let us consider what this Bill means. The
right honourable gentleman says that to an
extent the false pretence is proven by the
issuance of a worthless cheque in exchange for
goods. With great respect I say to him that
when that presumption arises under this statute
no false pretence is proven. If a prosecutor
went no further than this statute says lie
must go to raise the presumption, the courtbe it high court, low court, or any other kind
of court-would dismiss the case, because there
would not be evidence of intent to defraud.
No false pretence is proven, no prima facie
case of false pretence is made out, until the
intent to procure by a false pretence is made
manifest. This Bill recognizes that fact, for
it seeks to amend -the daw so that there will
be the presumption of guilt against a man
who, as the law now stands, would have to be
regarded as innocent. It is true that a man
can go into the box and explain things. But
could any honourable member of this House
be paid to place himself in the position of
having to go into the witness box and be
called upon for his defence? That is a dreadfui position into which to put a man. It marks
him for all time to corne as a meRmber of the
criminal clas. I do not care whether a man
is found guilty or innocent; once lie is put
into the witness box and is called upon to
defend himself, his reiputation is destroyed.
Hon.

Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

What is the necessity for the Bi2l? Suppose
I go into a shop, where I am a stranger, and
offer a heque in payment of goods. The storekeeper lias a teleiphone by means of which lie
aan communicate with the bank. He need
not take my cheque. It would not be as though
the storekeeper were defrauded in some outof-the-way place. If lie cannot get satisfactory
assurance from the bank that I have sufficient
funds, lie can tell me that lie will wait until
he sees whether the cheque is good, or lie can
say that lie will send the goods when the
cheque has been cashed. He does not need
the extreme protection that is contemplated
here. If lie suffers it is because of his own
stupidity.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Suppose you go to
his store after banking hours.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
storekeeper has no reason for asking us to
go to this extreme length, a length we will
not go to in any other case of fraud, as far
as I know, or even in a case of murder. We
are asked to put the presumption of guilt upon
a man accused of a certain class of offence
when we would not dream of doing so if lie
were accused of any one of thousands of other
crimes. I say the Bill is absolutely unreasonable, improper, and not according to British
ideas of the administration of justice.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable members, I am not willing to let this
measure have its second reading without saying at least a word about it. I am prepared
to vote against it, if I have the opportunity
of doing so, but I put my objection to the
Bill more upon its second than its first
clause.
The first clause, dealing with the
issuing of a cheque for which there may be
insufficient funds, may be comparatively
harmless, but it does make a considerable
inroad upon what we have always been taught
to think is a first principle of British justice
or of British criminal law, namely, that a
man must be shown to be guilty, and guilt
must not be presumed. It reverses that
natural order of justice and presumes guilt,
presurnes fraudulent intent, unless the accused
is able to satisfy a court to the contrary. For
that simple reason I certainly dislike it very
much, and I am prepared to vote against the
second reading upon that ground alone.
But I do want to protest even more strongly
against the clause of the measure which proposes to abolish in the Province of British
Columbia the institution of the grand jury.
I have all my life regarded, and I think
rightly regarded, the jury system, both grand
and petit jury, as the great bulwark of British

MARCH 15, 1932
liberty; but the grand jury, the Grand Inquest
of the County, I have always looked upon as
perhaps the greater safeguard of the two. The
function of the grand jury la nlot merely to
protect the criminal, or the accused, but
equally to pi>otect the publie; to see, on the
one part, that no one is presented for trial
unless evidence la produced that warrants bis
trial, and, on the other part, that any accused
person who ought te be put upon trial is duly
presented te the court for trial.
We are told ini the note to the BibI, as a
reason for proposing thla change in our institutions se f ar as British Colunmbia la concerned, that the Attorney-Generail of that
province hais written to the Minister of Justice
a letter saying that he wishes it. And that la
the only reason given. I presume that la the
onily reason that could be given. This measure
now be-fore us for second, reading comes before
the Parliament of Canada simply because thc
Attorney-Generai of the province wishes àt to
become law. Under the British North America
Act our provincial auithorities are asigned the
duty of adminÀsterin-g justice. That la their
duty andbheir night, but it la ours to frsime the
criminal law of the Dominion; and this la in
every sense purely a feature of the criminal
law. The whole question is whether, province
by province, by the wish of the offcials cf the
provinces, the grand jury system may be
abolished throughout Canada. For my part
I am entiredly .too old, too oad-fasbioned-, too
conservative, if you pleaise, in my ways and
thought, te be willling to agree to that for
elne moment.
I am very sorry te see that, Manitoba is
among -the provinces which no longer have
any grand jury. I was -not here when the
change in the law was -nade by this Chanxber
and 'by the Bouse of Commons. If I had been
I certain.ly would have raised sny protest, even
though it might be feeble, against any such
measure. I want to protest now. I think it is
aIl wrong. I think the grand jury la one of
the most valuable features we have in the
administration of crimino)l justice. In my own
experience I have known more th!an one case
presented -te the petit jury whieh neyer woul
have been se presented if it lied not been
that in seme of the counties of Ontario we
posseased grand j.uries. Many a man who
ought te be tried has escaped com.mittai for
trial because of some too friendly local maglatrate; and if such an occurrence takes place,
what protection h«s the public except thaît of
the grand jury? True, it may be said that
under the proposed system the Crown Prosecutor may, by leave of the court, I suppose,
or in some other manner, bring the matter to
the attention of the court; buit if the accusedl

105

person ia oble to seoure from -the magistrate
before whom he is brouglit for preliminary
hearing a dismissal of the coixiplaint, or a
refusai te commnit, ordnarily there is an end
of -the natter unless you have a grand jury
before whom the facts may be brought for
revision of 'the mnagistrate's work.
May I
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ask,' had we reached the grand jury section
of this Bill? I thought we were taking only
the faise pretences.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are on the
second reading.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUTNTON: I should
like to say a word about the grand jury. I
feel exactly as does the honourable gentleman
who has just taken his seat, but I neyer could
have expressed my feelings so eloquently or
so clearly as hie has done. I know this matter
has been debated more than once through the
courts, and I do not think I arn overstating
the fact when 1 say that the opinion expressed
by the honourable gentleman from North York
(H1on. Sir Allen Aylesworth) is that of most
of the thoughtful people of the Province of
Ontario.
The only argument the Attorney-General of
British Columbia advances la this:
As you know, the reason which justified the
creation of this institution wae to provide a
meaeure of protection to the public, but the
necessity lhas long ago passed out and to-day
there are so many safeguards againat miscarriage
of justice in Canada, of which the grand jury
is not one, there seems no good reason to retain it. It is perhape a matter of sentimental
regret that new conditions arising necessitate
such a change.
The fact that a gentleman concerned with the
administration of justice in a great province
can find no other reason f or the abolition of
the grand jury than this "matter of sentimental regret" indicates to me that it is not
out of his experience he has learned that the
grand jury is no longer necessary. The grand
jury system was founded in remote times and
has prevailed through ahl the developments
of our civilization, and in England is still considered a valusible institution. We shauld not
act like the base Judean, who "threw a pearl
away richer than alI hîs tribe." Let us give
this matter our serious consideration.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUTE: Honourable gentlemen, I am disposed to vote for the second
reading of this Bih, but I hope that the right
honourable leader of the Bouse will consent
to the Bill being referred to a special comnmâttee. As to the first section, I am entirely
in accord with the remarks that have been

106

SENATE

made by the right honourable gentleman; but,
as at present advised, I do not think I should
be disposed to support the.second clause.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not like to appear in the role
of the sacrilegious opponent of the ancient
and tried institutions that have made our
British Empire, but I must confess that in the
present case I do not feel very guilty or very
timorous as to the future of our law, our
institutions, or our country.
The Bill has two parts. Possibly when I
rose I should have made some remarks on
the second section, which is entirely different
from the first, and effective in an entirely
different sphere; but as attention and criticism
had been directed entirely to the first section,
I confined my few observations to that.
I may say frankly that I do not see that
this is a Bill for a special committee. There
are no facts that I know of that require
investigation, and no particular details to be
ascertained. The Bill involves a question of
principle, the question whether or not it is
botter, all things considered, to change the
law in respect to matters of procedure, and
only to matters of criminal procedure, which
are said to be affected. The Bill, of course,
can go to Committee of the Whole House,
and a freer discussion can take place. I am
not saying that if there were a general desire
on the part of the House to send the Bill
to a special committee, I would resist it; but
this Bill does not appeal to me as a subject
for a special committee. Oertainly if it were
the desire of the House to postpone consideration, I would agree. If it were the
general desire to have a committee, I would
not oppose it.
I want to say that I hold in the highest
respect, because of the sources from which they
come, the remarks of the honourable gentleman
from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)
and the honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), both of whom
doubtless have had far greater experience in
the practice of law and in our criminal courts
than I. But, dealing again with the first clause,
I observe from the mild way in which the honourable senator from North York put his objection that he is not very set in bis conviction
as to the profanity of this amendment. He
says it is another invasion of that principle of
British justice which concedes a man to be
innocent until he is proven guilty, and places
the onus of proof upon the Crown. That is
a principle of British justice, and in the
administration of that principle the Imperial
Parliament and the Parliaments of the DoHon. Mr. BEIQUE.

minions have sought to be fair to both the
prosecutor and the accused in defining the
stage at which the onus of the one should be
discharged and that of the other assumed.
Because we say tha.t at a certain point a
presumption shall arise, surely honourable
members need not come to the conclusion that
we are making crimes by presumption. As
a matter of fact, we are making here no crime
that was not a crime before; we are making no new offence; we are merely saying
at what point the presumption shall arise
that shifts the onus from the prosecution
to the accused. If this is making a crime
by presumption the Code is a whole series
of such crimes, for I venture to say that
I could keep honourable members until a
much later hour than this by reading clauses
out of the Code defining when the onus of the
Crown is ended and the onus of the defence
begins. I shall read one or two examples that
I have been able to locate during the short
time that I have sat listening to the brief
remarks of honourable gentlemen. If honourable members will turn to section 464 of the
Criminal Code, which I think is still British
law, they will find this clause:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to five years' imprisonment who is
found
(a) having in his possession by night, without
lawful excuse, the proof of which shall le upon
him, any instrument of housebreaking.
It might be merely a saw. The Crown does
not have to go further and say that he was
found breaking into a house. If the instrument
is found on him by night, he has to show why
ho had it.
Then I go on to subsection c:
Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to five years' imprisonment who is
found
(c) having his face masked or blackened, or
being otherwise disguised, by night, without
lawful excuse, the proof whereof shall lie on
him.
So, if the honourable senator from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) should as a mere
escapade blacken his face, and a policeman
should find him by night in that condition,
and bring him to court the next morning and
say that he had found him last night with
his face blackened, the principle is that he is
guilty. And that is British law.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
British law; Canadian law.

say that I can read from the British CodeHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: You cannot read that from the British Code. The

MARCH 15, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The onus of
guilt is established by the proof of possession.
A man rnay have no criminal jutent whatever,
but the Crown does not have to go to the
extent of prying into a man's mind to establiali
bis guit. The Crown bas te go as far as the
legisiators of the land decide is fair before
it can force a man to go on bie defence. It
is ail a question of where it is best to fix
the line. There is *a-certain class of offences
in which the lime of division must be place
nearer the door of the aocused than in other
classes, because the proof is very difficuit;
indeed, it is impossible unless the law says that
at a certain point the onus is sbifted to the
defence. Such are the liquor -cases. I know tbe
legislation in that regard is very drastic-perhaps it goes too far; 1 arn not saying it does
not-but the only reason the legisiators have
dlecided that it rnust go so far is that it is
impossible to enforce the law on any other
basis.
We bave reaicbed, a point wbera there are
seventy thousand wortbless cheques a year. I
a2k rny honourable friends to accept these
figures. They corne frorn tbe Department of
Justice. We know tbat the practie of
hand*ing out worthaess chieques is vastly more
prevalent tban it wa-s years ago. As the bonourabla senator <rom, Rougemnont (Hon. Mr.
Lernieux) lias said, the wbole system of payment to-day is different from. wbat it was.
Cheques are far more in vogue than tliey
were years ago, when cash 'was about the only
means of payment. We have got to the stage
wbere the use of cheques is alinost univesa.
It is evident that tlie law at presant is iusdequate to the circumstances, and the Crown
finds it impossible ito discharge the obligation
wbicb up till now the law lias placed upon it.
Tbe Crown cannot pry into a man's intention;
the Crown, and the people, con judge only
from wbat he does. The Bill says that if a
man puts before you a chequa as a means of
getting goods8 out of your possession into his,
and the chaque is wortbless, he cannot make
you show that lie knew it was worthless.
Surely it is only <air that lie should go in and
.show that lie thougit. it was good.
Hon. MT. COPP:

That niay be impossible.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We shahl
bave to decide at wbat point it is best in the
interest of the public, that the line of demarcation be drawn. I venture to tbink tbat the
lionourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lyncli-Staunton) is rather empbatic in bis
reference to the terrible disgrace that is
supposed to attacb to a man who goes into
a witness box to clear bimsalf of a charge

107

under this proposed law. I admit tliat 1
sbould prefer not to bave to take the stand
and show that I issued a chaque honestly,
but I think that if it did become necassary
for me to do so, and if I wera able to
prove my innocence, I sbould rise the next
morning, dress as usual and go down. to
business.
lon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But doa
.he rîglit honourable gentleman realize that
ha would have to go into the dock before
ha went into tha box?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I do
not tbink a man's position in society or bis
self-respect depends upon the exact geographical position in wbich ha bappens to ha placed
in a courtroom. 1 think it depends upon bis
own conscience, upon whether lie is able to
show to bis own satisfaction and that of bis
fellow men that lie bas acted as a man ought
to act.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But suppose a man
is convicted, what then? Thousands of convictions are made by magistrates in smaîl
towns.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A man naed not
appear in court if lie returns the goods the
day before the casa is called.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not provided in the Bull.

That is

Riglit Hlon. Mr. MEIGREN: We cannot
pass any law to improve the intellect of
magistrates or of auy other people, but wa
cau pass a law that we think is in tbe interest
of the public and tbat we consider to ha fair
as between both aides of a criminal action.
Now, s to the second feature of tlie Bill, I
bava a great deaq of oym1pathy witi zny
bonourJble friand <rom Hamilton (Hlon. Mr.
Lyneh-ýStaunton) and 'the lionourable Senator
<rom. North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth).
I believe thiat the Minister of Justice, Who expressed hirnself in another 'place, would prefer that -the liaw with (respect te grand juries
should remain as it is. I do not feel as deeply
about the matter as ha does. On tibis subject
I speak witb a great deal of diffidence, because
I bave not been in the crirninal courts as
counsel, nor in any other capacity, for about
fifteen years. It was stated elsawbare that
the grand jury systemn had neyer beau astablishied in Manitoba, but, as the lionourable
senator from North York bas .pointed- out, it
was in operation in the province at one
tima. During the years that I was engaged
in the praetice of law it was functîoning. I
believa it served a purpose; at lest I thouglit

108

SENATE

so at the time; but I always felt it was a very
cumbersome and empensive piece of maschinery
for the work that it did. The Provincial
Legislature decided that the machinery ws not
worth its cost of upkeep, and they asked that
the Law with respect to the grand jury be not
applied to Manitoba. Parliament aoceded to
that request. Although that was nany years
ago, I have not observed any breakdown in
the administration of 'law in that province; on
the contrary, as far as I have been able to
observe, the criminel courts there have been
just as effective, just as efficient and just as
fair as they had been formerly. I have not
heard members of the Bar of that province
deplore the passing of the grand jury. Of
course, in this matter I am in the hands of
honourable members who perhaps have been
more closedy in touch than I have with affairs
in Manitoba in late years, and it may be that
some lawyers would prefer a return to former
conditions. I have, however, heard many
members of the Bar, some of them eminent
members, say that the abolition of the system
was a good thing and had not resulted in any
appreciable loss. I am not quite sure what the
situation is in Saskatchewan and Alberta, but
I observe it was stated there never had been
grand juries in those provinces.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That is right.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: We do not want them,
either.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am told
they are not wanted. I am sure they would
not be wanted now. Having regard to the
work they perform, they are too expensive
for the people of those provinces to sustain at
the present time. Two of the Western Provinces have never had the grand jury, another
one has tried it and abandoned it, and in not
one of the three has there been any demand
for the return or the establishment of the
institution. Now the people of British Columbia are asking through their AttorneyGeneral, who I suppose speaks for 'their
Government, that in these distressing times
they be relieved of the burden of the grand
jury. Though we have an attachment for it
as an instrument of British procedure that has
existed for a long time, we do not feel that
we ought to stand in the way of a province
which itself has to pay the piper and claims
the right to call the tune.

ASSISTANT CLERK OF THE SENATE
RECLASSIFICATION OF POSITION

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, on
behalf of the honourable gentleman from

Saint John (Hon. Mr. Daniel), I beg to
present the second report of the Standing
Committee
on
Internal
Economy
and
Contingent Accounts, as follows:
The Committee have had under consideration

the following recommendation from the Civil
Service Commission:-

"Dec. 7, 1931.
"In accordance with sections 12 and 61 of the
Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Commission, at the request of the Clerk of the Senate,
submits the following report for approval:
Assistant Clerk of the SenateIt is recommended that the compensation of
this class, which is at present:
Annual: $4200 4380 4560 4740
be revised to read as follows, effective from
April 1, 1931:
Annual: $4560 4740 4920 5100.

MARCE 16, 1932
It is considered that the present compensation
provided for thîs olasa je inadequate for the
duties performed.
Respectfully submitted,
W. J. Roche,
Chairman.
J. Emile Tremblay,
The Comnaittee reosmend thàt the recominendation of the Commission be approved.
Ail of which je respectfully submitted.
I beg to move that the report be concurred
in.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I ask
the honourable member to explain the
report?
Hon. Mr. KING: In the main estimates
of 1931 the Government provided for an
increase in the salary of the Assistant Clerk
of the Senate and made the salary the samne
as that paid in the Commons, namely, $5,120.
After the Supply Bill of 1931 was passed, the
Civil Service Commission was asked to, revise
the salary in accordance with the saiary voted
by Parliament. Parliament prorogued before
the Commission had taken action; consequently it was flot possible to submit the
reclassification to the Internai Economy Committee at an earlier date. The reclassification
by the Commission was made effective from
the Tht rof April, 1931-the saine as the date
fixed hy the Government in the estimates.
The estimates fix a salary of $5,120, but the
Civil Service Commission, in its reclassification, provides that the sum, be reached by
annual statutory increases. As no statutory
increases are granted this year, there wîll be
no increase.
The motion was agreed to.
THE ECONOMIC SITUATION
DISCUSSION ANI> INQUIRY

Hon. F. B. BLACK rose in accordance with
the. following notice:
That lie will call the attention of the Government to some phases of the economnic situation,
with some suggestions for further economies.
He said: Honourable senators, I have no
intention of wearying your ears or insulting
your intelligence by attempting to offer any
solution of the financial probleme whicb
confront this country and the world at large
to-day. At the outset may I caîl attention
to the fact that this is not the firet period
of depression that Canada has experienced,
nor in ail probability wiil it be the last. I
desire to congratulate the Oovernment upon
jts proposal to put certain economies into
effeet. On May 20, 1924, 1 made in thus
House some recommendations which seemed

to me to be appropriate and which I thouglit
would, if carried out, lead to considerable
saviags in the country's expenditures. I am
very glad to see that although the Government of that day, in its wisdom, did flot think
that the economies I proposed should be put
into effect, moat of my suggestions have been
adopted hy the present Administration. As
our memories are very short, I may he
allowed to, quote a f ew of the remarks I made
in 1924, which I think are as applicable to
the conditions of to-day as to those of 1924.
This ie what I said on that occasion:
I have in my hand three newspapers published in three different portions of the
Dominion of Canada, and in aIl those papers I
read articles written by different people who
were independent, not poditicians, speaking
before public gatherings which were not
polîtical, and aIl voicing practioally the saine
sentiments. I am going to read one of these
articles to illustrate what I mean.
"Canada is the only Anglo-Saxon country in
the world that is still paying the peak of
taxation and that bas flot substantially meduced
the national debt.
"Canada is the inost over-governed country
on the face of the globe. Members and Cabinet
Mfinisters, senators and Speakers at Ottawa
drew salaries exceeding $1,585,000 last year,
whille the total wage bill for 39,200 civil
servants in 1923 exceeded $50,000,000. There
is Government maohinery in Canada sufficient
to, govern a nation of more than five times the
ountry's population."
That particular extract was from a newspaper published in London, Ontario. At the
same time I referred to two other papers,
one published ini Vancouver and the other ini
the East, ecd of which called attention to
practically the sa.me thing. I remarked then:
It seemed to me exceedingly strange that in
three parts of Canada distant from each other
in one case 500 miles and in another 1,200
miles, three persons speaking on the saine evena-ffiliation. so far as we
ig having no give utterance to praotically the
knw, should political
saine sentiments.
The suggestions I made at that time were,
first, that there should be a straiglit reduction
in the indemnities paid to members of both
Houses of Parliament; a similar reduction in
the salaries paid to Cabinet Ministers; a
reduction in tic nuxnber of Cabinet Ministers
and an amalgamation of some of the portf olios; a reduction of ten per cent in the
salaries of civil servants, and a reduction of
from. ten to twenty per cent in the salaries
of Canadian National Railways employees
who receive more than $1,500 a year. I did
not advocate any reduction of incomne below
that figure. I also urged that tiere siould be
a reduction ini the salaries of ail the judges
in Canada paid out of tie federal treasury.
I made various otier proposals at the time,
and pointed out that if the Canadian National

SENATE

110

Railway System made a eut in its pay-roll
the Canadian Pacific Railway would undoubtedly follow the lead, and that the Governments of the various provinces would reduce
their expenditures if the Dominion took such
a step. It was demonstrated that had the
cost of administration of the various departments and institutions which I mentioned
been reduced at that time as suggested, this
country would have saved from $80,000,000
to $100,000,000 a year-a very large sum of
money. Had those savings been begun then,
the federal treasury alone would have been
better off to the extent of about $600,000,000,
barring undue extravagances in other lines.
It is quite true that the depression in this
country in 1923-24 was not as great as it is
to-day. But, as I have said, our memories
are very short, and if we look through the
files of newspapers and financial journals for
the years referred to we shall be reminded
that the depression was very serious. In 1921
and 1922 there was a period of abnormal
prosperity, but the peak did not go so high
as it went in 1929, and as a consequence the
depression of 1923-24 did not fall so low as
the present one. But the effect on the country
of both depressions was practically the same.
Now I want to quote a few figures to show
what would have happened if my recommendations had been followed. In 1922 there
were employed in the Civil Service of Canada,
according to the records of that date, 39,200
persons. By 1930-31 this number had increased
to 45,581, a very large increase. It is truc that
in the eight years that elapsed there was a
considerable growth of population, but in percentage it was by no means as large as was
the increase in employees. The amount paid
to those 45,581 civil servants in 1930-31 was
Since 1923 there has been an
$94,310,982.
increase in the Civil Service personnel of 6,175,
but the pay-roll has dncreased by approximately $20,000,000. If a ten per cent cut had
been applied in 1924 there would have been
a total saving to date of approximately
$60,000,000. That might have taken care of
perhaps a portion of one year's deficit on the
Canadian National Railways.
As I have said, my suggestions of 1924 included a reduction in the indemnities .of
senators and members of the House of Commons. No one desires a decrease in his own
income less than I do, but economy, like
charity, should begin at home. I did not see
then, and I do not see now, how we as members of Parliament could expect to impose
economies on the Dominion at large unless
we first demonstrated our willingness to economize by cutting our own pay. It is truc that
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

if we had done so the saving in dollars and
cents would not have been very great, but the
example would have been a good one and
the people of the country would have appreoiated it very highly. I think all honourable
members will agree with me when I say that
our people as a whole are appreciative of the
cut that we have made in our indemnities
this session. Perhaps nothing appeals more
strongly to the residents of the smaller country
districts than the fact that their representatives
in Parliament have voluntarily reduced their
If the indemnities had
own remuneration.
been reduced by ten per cent some eight
years ago, the aggregate savings up to the
time would have amounted to
present
$3,750,000.
It is with some hesitation that I refer to
the salaries paid to judges, because I understand that in another place it was stated by
those who are conversant with the facts and
the statutes that we have not the right to
interfere with such salaries. Without attempting to dispute that at all, I must state my
inability to understand how Parliament, which
fixes the salaries in question and makes the
laws of this country, has not power to reduce
the salaries when occasion demands it. All
other 'Government employees, with some
exceptions such as soldiers who have a contract for a definite period of time, have had
their pay reduced. It may be that the judges
have a similar contract, though I do not
know anything about it. I do not see why
judges should not have a reduction in income
when members of Parliament, civil servants,
railway employees, and industrial workers
throughout the country have had a reduction.
Now, if the judges' salaries had been reduced
in 1924, the saving to date would have
aggregated $2,800,000.
The aggregate saving from the sources I
have already mentioned would have been
$66,550,000.
I now come to the Canadian National Railway employees, and before I quote figures
with respect to them I want to say they
show how seemingly small economies amount
in the long run to huge totals. If a ten per
cent cut in the Canadian National Railway
pay-roll had been put into effect in 1924, the
amount saved thereby between that time
and the present would have been $105,000,000.
If you add that to the figure already given,
you will find that with these economies carried
out there would have been in the treasury
money which is not there now, amounting to
$172,000,000 or thereabouts. That is a very
sizable sum of money, which the people of
Canada could use at this or at any other
time.

MARCH 16, 1932
In the year 1923-24 there were employed
by the Canadian National Railways 99,520
persons, and the salaries at that time
amounted to $140,515,000 and some odd. In
1930 the annual pay-roil had increased. to
$148,600,000, or more than $8,000,000 in excess
of that of the year 1923. When we corne to
1931 we find that owing to reductions made
in the number of employees the pay was reduced to $127,896,000 in that year. Because
of changes ini the methods of transportation
and because of the depression, neither the
Canadian National Railway nor any other railway -opeiating in Canada or the United States
could use as many ernployees as it had previously. The fact remains that during the
seven-year period a ten per cent reduction
in the number of empioyees wouid have saved
to the people of Canada, on payiments made
to the empioyees of the railways alone,
$98,000,000; and this added to the items
already given wouid have made a total savmng
of $270,000,000. Upon that very large sum
of money which has been spent, we are paying
interest, and our children and our chiidren's
ehildren will have to pay interest for years
to corne. Rad it not been f or that expenditure, the interest charge would have been very
materially reduced, our borrowing power would
have been increased, and our credit in the
money rnarkets of the world would have been
better.
Now I want Vo refer to one or two ruatters
relating to railways, for I do flot know of any
particular brandi of industry ini Canada that
has been more responsible for the public debt
and the feeling that there has been extravagance for the past three or four years.

I could give you a list of seven such cases.
Not only do these involve an annual charge
on the people of this country, but they
necessitate maintenance and thus pyramid
the debt.
Referring to steamships, I wiil speak only
of those on the Pacifie ooast. I was out there
a year or two ago, and, so, far as I could see,
the line of steamships runnung from Vancouver to Victoria and down to Seattle was
quite capable of taking care of ail the business
that offered, and more. Yet, in the wisdom
or lack of wisdomn of those conducting the
Canadian National Railways, they deerned
it advisabie Vo spend rnany millions of money
in order to put other ships on that route,
taking business away from another cornpanyone in which I have no interest, but in which
the people are vitally interested-and adding
to the deficit of that cornpany as well as to
the debt of the country.
Not very long ago *an important officiaI of
one of the great railway systems of Canada,
in giving evidence before a parliamentary
cornxittee investigating railway matters,

If I am doing anybody an injustice, I
apologize for it, but I say that from a financial
standpoint this was a crime and never should
have been permitted.
Now I come to another question that affects
the railways and the country as a whole, and
that is the system which we have here-and
it prevails all over this continent-of issuing
passes. I do not believe that the giving of
passes is a good thing. Members of Parliament travel free, not by virtue of having
passes, but by law; nevertheless, in the eyes
of the public they travel on passes. I am
quite willing to admit that probably there
are very few men who get more real use
out of their transportation than I do, for my
business keeps me on the train a good deal of
the time; but if, in the interest of economy and
to do away with what I regard as a very great
evil, it were necessary that members of Parliament do without free transportation, I would
say by all means let us do without it. If
desirable, each and every senator or member
of the House of Commons could be given a
travelling allowance based on the average cost
of the transportation now provided for members of Parliament.
Honourable gentlemen are aware, I suppose, how the system of passes in vogue in
the United States and Canada operates. In
this country free transportation is granted
under certain conditions drawn up by the
Railway Association of Canada. A similar
arrangement is in existence in the United
States, and the two organizations work together almost as one. The general basis is
this: If a man employed on a railway in
Canada, whether as a sectionman, or a brakesman, or otherwise, has served one year, he is
entitled to three passes over the territory
within a radius of 1,500 miles; after two years'
service he is given four free passes; after the
third year five, the fourth year six, and the
fifth year seven. After three more years he
is entitled to one foreign pass, which will take
him from the Atlantic to the Pacifie, down
the coast to California, and back by some
American roads into Canada. After a man
has been employed for ten years by either of
our railways he receives a pass for himself and
his wife, which is good every day in the year
in the region in which he resides. After
fifteen years he is given, for himself and his
wife, the same privilege extending over two
regions. After twenty years or more he has a
free pass for himself and his family, good
year in and year out, all over Canada, in addition to which he receives the yearly foreign
pass if he desires to use it.
I do not find any fault with the railway employees for making use of these passes. They
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

are quite entitled to do so in every respect,
because they do it under the regulations of
their own organizations and with the consent
of the Government, though not by law. The
Railway Act says that nothing in this Act
shall prevent the giving of these passes, and
then the railway managements, with the Railway Association, make up their schedules and
issue the passes. I do say, however, that in
periods of depression there is nothing which
makes the ordinary man in the rural district
feel more resentful than the fact that his
neighbour and his neighbour's wife and son
and daughter are going up and down to the
market towns free of cost.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Can the
honourable gentleman say as a matter of fact
whether they get reduced prices for meals on
the trains?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I prefer not to touch
on that now.
Let me illustrate what I mean. A young
man working on a section of the railroad receives perhaps $3 a day, and the man next
door-he may be this man's father, his brother
or his cousin-who works on a farm gets $1.50
or $2, and thinks ho is lucky to get it in these
times. But there is a further difference.
When the chap who works on the railway
wants to go to the neighbouring town, or to
market, where he can get things very much
more cheaply because of chain stores and that
sort of thing, than he can at home, he travels
free, and he takes his wife with him, and
brings home his truck, whereas his relatives
and chums have no such privilege. They
resent it. I know intimately what I am talking about, because this has been thrown up
to me time and again. I hear it almost daily
when I am travelling in my own locality, and
I am satisfied that any honourable gentleman
who goes about the country very much is
aware that there is a real feeling against the
railways and the railway employees because
of this free transportation, which costs millions of dollars yearly.
Let me tell you of two instances that I saw
with my own eyes. Not very long ago, on
February 28, to bo exact, there was a special
train put on, not far from here-I can name
the place if you want me to-to take some
people to a hockey match. It was a rough
night and, that train was not as well patronized as might have been expected. There were
116 passengers on the train, and of that number 72 were travelling on passes. In other
words, 72 were employed by the railway, or
were in some way connected with it, or had a
father, brother or other relative who was connected with it.

MARCH 16, 1932
Another case that I have in mmnd is this.
I got into a train in Decembar, 1930, and went
into a first-class car: it was filled up. There
were two man; the rest of the passengers
were women and children. I notioed that
they had baskets with them. Undoubtedly
they contained their lunches. It is easy to
recognize a lunch basket. I was looking to
sea whether any of rny friands were on the
car, but these people evidently had corne frorn
bayond my territory and I did not know any
of them. I asked the conductor who they
were and where thay were going, and hae inforrned me that they were going to Moncton
to do their Christmas shopping. I said:
"Have they hired the car? They look as if
they were going to liva in it for the day."'
He said they had not, and then I remarked:
"I suppose they are aIl travelling on passes."
He said they were. That car, which could accommoda4e about eighty persons and had
about sevanty in it, was dropped off, and on
the return journey was picked up again and
taken back to the place from which it came.
You cannot blame those people at all. Thay
were the wives and children of men working
for the railway, and were quita within their
,rights in going to Moncton to do their Christmas shopping. But what do the other men
and women who liva in the same town with
thara think? They cannot travel 120 miles free
-that is about the distance that particular car
wen-but have to pay for a raturn ticket
$5.85, if I arn not mistaken. That is not a
large arnount, but if you multiply it by sixty
or seventy, and if such an incident occurs once
or twice a week, it becornes a mattar of sorne
magnitude.
What I want to impress upon you, honourable gentlemen, and upon those in authority,
is that the granting of free transportation to
people, whether they happen to be railway
employeas or not, la wrong. It is wrong at
a.ny time. lit neyer was right, and I do not
think it ever will ha right. I was once in a
company which had an arrangement with the
two large raîlways wheraby we gave certain
services to thern in exchange for a number of
free transportation passes for our men. But
rnany years ago wa discontinued that systam.
So far as I arn concarned, I prafer to pay for
whaçt I get and to ha paid for what I give.
Such was the preferance of the directors of
that company, and the rasult was that wa
inade a new arrangement with the railroads,
by which we said to tharn, in affect, "«We
will sell you our services in the sarne way
that wa wiil sali them to anybody elsa; and
we will pay you for the services we get, in
the same way as wa wiii pay anyone aise."

113

That plan has worked very satisfactorily. It
is the only sound plan upon which any business can be mun. If passes are grantad to
railway employees, in whatever class they
may ha, on the ground that they are nlot
receiving as much money as they should, their
rate of pay should be increased and the passes
abolished. I venture to say that a five per
cent increase in the total pay-roll of the railroads, which would mean an additional
$8,000,000 or 310,000,000 a year, would be less
than the total amount that the country is
now losing through the various ramifications
of the present system of free passes to railway employees. In saying this I should like
it elearly understood that I have no anirnus
towards the einployees. They are working
under a system which they did not devise,
but which the railways themselves have provided.
While I arn on this subject, may I say that
I do not believe there should be any free
transportation for newspaper men. I opeak
after considerable thought on the matter, for
I have friends in this Hous who are nawspapermen, and I have myseif been interested
in a paper for many years. The newspapers
wouid flot ha hurt a bit if they were paid
for the pubiicity and advertising they now
give without charge, and the railways would
not ha hurt if they were paid for the services
they now give free. The thing would balance
ail right. I submait thera should not be any
frec transportation at ail, but the raiiways
should charge for every bit of service they
render.
Now I wish to refer to the franking of
express parcels and telegrams. These matters
may appear to be cornparatively trivisl, but
anything that has an undesi-rabie effect on the
body politic is not trivial. Furthermore, littie
things that would be overlookad in good
times rankie in the public mmnd when tirnes
are hard. While the average franking item
may be small, the total loss to the country
through the carrying of express parcels and
the sending of telegrarne without charge is a
large one. I wàil cita one instance to show
what may happen. In one week in June last
yea, a shipinent of sairnon, on which the
charges wouid have beau over 3100, was sent
by free express out of Matapedia station. The
people Who ueed franks to avoid the payrnent
of thosa eharges were not railway ernployaas,
but sportsmen who were not even conne'cted
ini sny way with a railway; .they were mereiy
friends of railway ernployeas. Why shoufld
members of that Party have been allowed to
ship fish from Maitapedia to Halifax or
Montreal at no cost whatever, when the man

who fishes for a living and ships his salmon
fromn the same station bas to pay the fulà rate
on it? Do honourable memnbers think the
fisherman does not resent that? Of course
he does. And I think he ought to resent it.
i realize that there would not be a weekly
shipment of 'the kind I have referred to, but
the instance shows how a privilege may be
abused. The franking of telegrams is another
practice that should be discontinued. I have
no figures to show the sum that is lost by that
means, but no doubt it is a very considerable
one.
I should say here that it is to the credit of
many men whom I know that although they
have permission to use franks they never do so,
because they fee they are not entitled to the
privilege. The ground they take is that they
have not given any service in return for the
money that the franks represent. But perhaps
most people who are alowed to frank do not
feel that way about it, anjd there is no legal
reason why they should. How one acts depends
entirely upon his mental attitude towards the
matter. I feel confident that if raillway passes
and the franking of express parcels and of
telegrams were abolished the resultanlt saving
wouýld amount to several million dollars
annually. That saving could be applied towards
reducing the Canadian National Railways
deficlit and helping the Canadian Pacifie Railway to get back into a dividend-paying position. Furthermore, the abolition of these

people who are finding it hard to get along

payment of services rendered, then I submit
that payment should be made in an ordinary

fashion.
My honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has asked me if I know
anything about special rates for meals served
on trains. I know that there is a schedule
which provides that train crews may get their
meals at reduced rates. I have no objection to
that, because those men are on duty.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But I
mean reduced rates to employces who have
passes.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: There is none.

peg, where he resides. He was getting adil that
transportation free, but so far as I could ascertain he had no concession with respect to meals
or sleepers, for which he had to pay at the
ordinary rates. I think the system of paying
a man in part by a pass is wrong. If long
service entitled that official to the equivalent
of the cost of his transportation, be should
have been paid in cash. He would then have
had the option of travelling outside Canada or
of epending his money on a holiday in this
country.
Perhaps I may be permitted to make a
few remarks about the League of Nations,
a subject that we have heard a great deal
about in this House. Personally I have been
more or less in sympathy with the League,
and I have never made any pronouncement
against it, publicly or privately. But I may
say that I have never been convinced that
it was going to do the great things for the
world and humanity which many pedple have
prophesied.
It is now passing through a
difficult time and I think it would be very
unjust to criticize it. We do not know how
it will come out of the world crisis, but I
am sure we all heartily hope that it will prove
a great and lasting success. Last year Canada
spent $231,694.46 on the League in one way
and another. That is a large sum to spend
in such a way when we are finding it s
difficult to raise revenue. I think we are
entitled to representation in the various
activities at Geneva, but it seems to me that
until such time as we are able to hoist our
own sails we should co-operate in some matters with the Mother Country; until we can
afford to pay our own way, we ought to use
part of the machinery which Great Britain
has in operation at the League.
As I said at the outset, I have no nostrum
to offer for the solution of the present economic problems. No man can pull himself up
by his own boot-straps. Some people say
that if we spend money more freely the
country will get rich. I have yet to see any
man get rich who when ho earned a dollar
spent 31.05, but I have known many men
who by saving five cents out of every dollar
they earned became ultimately wealthy. What
applies to an individual applios to a country.
If this Dominion is to make substantial progress it must keep its expenditures well within its revenues. Under no other system can
it succeed. The theory that an orgy of spending will bring back world prosperity i as
ridiculous as almost any other of the various
methods that have been suggested as remedies
for the present condition. Industry, frugality
and reasonable economy will put this country

to remain forever open to the citizens of both
countries.
In 1814 we corne to the Treaty of Ghent,
which was signed in Belgium. That treaty
aimply cunfirmed the boundaries fixed by the
treaty of 1783, and made peace between
England and the United States after the War
of 1812, a war memorable in Canada because
of the victory at Chateauguay, and memorable
in the United States because the British army
marched on Washington and burned down the
White House in retaliation for sornething that
had been done.
In 1842 we corne to the Ashburton-Webster
Treaty. We ail rernember that it was a Dutch
award, and that when it was finally settied,
the boundary of Maine was brought te, within
very few miles of the St. Lawrence river.
Anyone can be convinced of that by a glance
at the map.
In 1846 there was another treaty between
Great Britain and the United States. The
territory lying between latitude 42 and latitude
54.40 was in dispute. You rernember the slogan
"Fîfty-four-forty or fight !" Latitude 54.40 was
the southern lirnit of the territory that the
United States said they had acquired frorn
Russia a few years before.
Many people believed that the treaty after
the War of 1812-14 superseded and wiped eut
aIl former treaties, but we find that in 1847
the British Governrnent, in order to meet the
desire of Canada, granted to the Amenicans
the right, during pleasure, te navigate the St.
Lawrence river if and as long as Canada
desired. Lord Elgin, who was Governor
General of the country, proposed that Canada
should grant the right of free navigation if,
as a quid pro que, the United States would
allow the free entry of our goods to that
country. Nothing came of that, however, and
the proposition feil through.
Whiist 1 arn speaking of the right of free
navigation 1 rnight point out that it was always
said it would apply to rivers and canais.
Just here 1 corne to sornething 1 arn not sure
of, but I have a faint recollection that at
Whitehall, on the canal leadiing from the
Richelieu river and Lake Champlain te
Albany, a Canadian barge was actualiy stopped
because it was supposed te have no rig.ht to
use the canal. While 1 arn not quite sure that
such an incident took place, I have heard
on rnany occasions that it did. Another thing
about which I arn net sure is that Canadian
barges were allowed to navigate the Eie
Canal. That canal afforded the most econornical transportation possible, the cost of barges
being only $12 or $15 a ton. Anythîng that
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

held out water was good eneugh, and because
of the slow progress rnade by the barges
hardiy any power was required to drive themn.
The tug usually pushed the barges and passed
thern through the iocks. That method of
navigation was carried on very successfully
when the canal was only six or six and a haîf
feet deep, but it stepped wvhen the size of the
canal was increased, because the new barges
were more expensive than the oid enes, and
cost more in interest charges, and se on, when
they were laid up during the winter. We
said: "We have the right of free navigation
through your rivers and canals." But they
said: "These are net our canais; they beiong
te New York State. We can enly give you
the rig-ht te, use federal canais." The only
federal canal that I know of is at Sault Ste.
Marie, where the United States have built
three magnifleent Iecks side by side, te, which
we have access, al'though we have our ewn
canai on the ether side of the river.
The next treaty was in 1871, and deait with
the Alabarna case, the fisheries, and other odds
and ends. T1hat treaty rnust have been satisfactory te both sides, for 1'.e do net hear very
much criticisrn of it. It aise reaffirmed the
prineiple of free navigation, but exeepted Lake
Michigan.
In 1908 there was a treaty appointing surveyers te rnark a beundary line in accordance
with a decdsion that had been reached; and
in 1909, in the tirne of Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
under what was cailed the Beundary Waters
Treaty, a joint commrission xvas appointed.
That cornmission did a lot of geod work in
its day, and I suppose it is good yet. It
could deai net eniy with wvaters, but with
airnost any difficuity. I arn fairiy familiar
with the werk of that commission, because the
first chairman was the Hon. T. Chase Casgrain,
a first cousin of mine, who furnished me with
information that I couid suppiy te this Heuse
if it were wanted.
The next treaty was the Pa.ssamaquoddy
Bay Boundary Treaty; and in 1925 we heard
a good deal about the Hon. Ernest Lapeinte
sîgning a treaty affirming that Canada was
independent of everybody, even the Mother
Country. At the tirne of that treaty the
United States was represented by Charles
Evans Hughes, now Chief Justice of the
Suapnerne 'Court of the United States. That
treaty just enabled two surveyors te mark an
ordinary, everyday boundary line.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What was the
narne of that treaty?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That was always
known as the Lapointe Treaty, I think. There

MARCH 16, 1932
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Ia that why
it was made?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That was in '1925.
It was a treaty to establish on the ground the
boundaries that had been determined i 1783,
1814, 1842, 1871 and 1910.
There you have the whole story of those
treaties. Every tixne we have negotiated a
treaty with the United States we seem to
have been ahorn of territory. I do nlot know
of one under which we got an advantage. I
hope some honourable member of this House
will be able to enlighten us i this regard and
tell us that at some tirne we got something
we should not have got, or that the other aide
gave up somet-hing.
This question of the Chicago diversion.,
which I regard as of parainount imnportance,
has been before Parliamrent for a long time;
in f act, since l8», f orty-three years ago. At
first, to go back to 1822 andl 1827, when the
legisiation was passed, the ides, was to provide
for navigation by reversing the course of
Chicago Creek, called i the old days Rivière
du Chien. 1 arn sornewhat farniliar with that,
because one of my ancestors used to go there
in his canoe with furs, on hie way from
Montreal to New Orleans, when he was
allowed to seli to none but the English.
Before the Rebellion of the Thirteen Colonies
we were not allowed to trade with anybody
else. We did not rebel, but we had to go
a long way to seil our furs--up through the
Ottawa' the Mattawa, Lake Talon,, Trout
Lake, and Turtie Lake, and then down Lake
Nipissing and through the French river,
into Georgian Bay and the St. Mary river,
arounld Machillimackinac, and down the west
shore of Lake Michigan to what was called
Dog Creek, and -up this ereek and over a
short portage to Rivière des Plaines. The
journey used to be broken on the shore of
Lake Michigan, the traders stopping at the
place of a man named, Beaubien. Perhaps
hie was an ancestor of the distinguished
member for Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
I may be allowed to add that lie was said
to have had a very good-looking daughter.
It mray sur-prise honourable meinhers to learn
that when the United States sent ah engineer
to lay out the city of Chicago, which. was
to lie Iocated at the southern tip of Lake
Michigan, where the eity of Gary is to-day,
he stayed with our good friend Beaubien and
fixed. the site of the city of Chicago where it
is now situated in order that he might lie
near such a fine boarding house.
Many
people in Chicago do not know that.
Riglit Non. Mr. GRA&HAM: And there are
many other things they do nlot know.

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: The diversion of
water by the Sanitary District of Chicago
means that our birthright lias been interfered
with, that the St. Lawrence river lias actually
been depleted-tliat the navigable capacity of
the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence river,
and of the port of Montreal, is being impaired
by a mighty foreign power in order in the
firat place to provide sewage facilities for the
city of Chicago, and eventually to empty the
water into the Mississippi river. When I
learned that there was a case before the
Supreme Court of the United States in regard
to this question, 1 thought that the United
States would argue against the Sanitary District of Chicago. In that I was nlot disappointed, for the strongest plea that could
have been miade on behalf of Canada will lie
found in the brief presented before the Court.
1 have before me a brief of the case in the
Supreme Court of the United States, October
terni, 1924. It is the Sanitary District of
Chicago, Appellant, against the United States
of Arnerica, Appellee. This document that 1
have i my hand is the brief of the argument
of the appellant. Here I have the brief of the
appellee, the United States of America. You
can see fromn the way in whicli the book is
worn that I have gone through it many a time.
You will find that Harlan F. Stone, AttorneyGeneral of the United States, says that the
diversion is illegal. He says that for 319
pages, and there are 321 pages in the book.
He spoils his argument in the last two pages,
for hie says it would be impossible for Chicago
to do away with this sewage canal immedîately without cauaing an epidemic. This is
a very interesting case. 1 spoke in the Senate
about it twenty years ago. Ib sbarted away
back more than a century ago. The idea of
taking water from Lake Michigan and the
first legislation in the United Stabes regardig
it originated in 1822; and, in 1827-I suppose
the State of Illinois was nlot established blien
-the United States actually authorized a
canal of unlimited widbh and umdefined deptli,
with 90 feet on each side of the canal, te
take water from Lake Michigan to the
Illinois river for navigation purposes. lb was
in 1845 that the works were started, and this
canal has been built. Now we have the word
of the Atborney-General of the United States,
who says that ten times more water is being
used to-day than is necessary f or navigation
purposes.
The sbory of this case is a long one. The
case was before the Court for sixteen years.
It firet went before Judge Landis, who, I
arn told, is very weN known. as the authority
governing the basebaîl teams in the United
States. He was fromn Chicago. He took tihe
case and starbed hestring witnsieees. How long

do you think he took to hear the witnesses,
honourable gentlemen? He took six years; and
after the sixth year he commenced to deliberate upon the case. And there is where it
seesus very strange, because, as you will find
in this book from the United States, it was
flot necessary to go to law about it. The
Attorney-General says that the strong armn
of the United States of America could have
been used; that the army and the militia
could have been called in to stop action at
once; but thst was never done. Bowever,
Judge Landis deliberated. for six years more,
or a total of twdqve years, and then brought
down what t-hey cail a decee, or what we
in Canada caîl a judgment; but he hinted
that he might amend that decree, and in
order to make up bis 'mincI whether to arnend
it or not he took three years more, making
filteen years, and he neyer amended it at all,
but left it just as it was. The decree, of
course, was to the effect that the thing was
Anyýbody who hae ever had anyillegal
thing to do with water courses knows that
a stream cannot be diverted for the benefit
of one person to the detriment of another.
That is flot only international law, but it is
icommon law. However, Judge Landis at last
declared that 'le would not amend the decree,
and the Sanitary District of Chicago carried
the case before the Supreme Court of the
United States, in Washington. Here is the
brief of the Sanitary District, and this is the
brief of the United States.
The Supreme Court of the United States
naturally con.firmed the decee of Judge
Landis, but they could not help qualifying
as "unprecedented' the delay that had taken
place. They did not absohrtely censure him,
but referred in polite judicial language, which
the lawyers whom I sec around me would
understand, to the remarkable delay, for which
there was absolutely no excuse. During al
this time the work was going on, and then
you would have what we cali a "fait accompli"ý-you would bave the tbing donc and it
could not be undone. The sum of $100,000,000 had been spent. Is it likely, honourable
gentlemen, that that sum of money is going
to be scrapped to-day?
Tbe water that should fiow down the St.
Lawrence is going first into la Rivière des
Plaines, then into the Illinois, then into the
Mississippi and right dowvn to the Gulf. This
is an old, old story, but what we do not all
realize is the imimense quantity of water that
is being taken away. When you read in the
iiewspapers about 4,167 cubic feet per second
it looks very small. Even that figure is a
camouflage. There was a sort of treaty made
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

between Canada and the United States by
which they were entitled to take 250,000 cubic
feet per mninu te; and if you divide that by 60
you get the odd figure that I have just mentioned. This supposed treaty was entered into
and signed on the llth of January, 1909, and
was ratified by the Senate of the United
States in May of the same year, and they
were entitfled to, this 250,000 cubic feet until
lately. What is almost incredible, the three
Canadian commissioners actually agreed to
sign that treaty tbough the Chicago Sanitary
District were absolutely violating every condition of it at the very time the treaty was
being made. It is very easy to, keep a record
of the amount of water going through a canal;
but when they asked to see the records they
were absolutely denied access to any do-cuments for five years previous to the time they
signed the treaty. I do not know who those
commissioners were, but they signed that
treaty witboût knowing what they were signing. and at a time when the other party in
the case absolutely denied tbemn access to any
documents or any data in its possession. However, 1 think that in Canada, as throughout
the British Empire, a treaty is a treaty and
flot a scrap of paper, and wc must live up to
it. But why should we agree to more than
250,000 cubie feet per minute? That is the
question. In the judgment rendered bY the
Supreme Court of the United States in 1925
it was declared, "You shall fot take more than
that quantity," but they said it would be permissible for the Secretary of War to issue a
permit, and we received the news that the
permit had been issued for more than twice
the amount stipulated in the treaty. The

wvhatever is taken of them. It is just as if
the United States bad absolute control over
the wvhole matter.
The quantity that is now being taken,
600,000 cubic feet per minute, is equal to
10,000 cubie feet per second. May 1 make
a comparison in order that this honourable
House may have some appreciation of the
quantity of water that is being diverted? Take
a lake 31 miles square. It w;ould lower that
lake every day one foot. In Chicago, which
has 3,000,000 of a population, there is used in
one day, for sanitary and domnestic purposes,
as mucb water as the city of Montreal, with
one-third of the population, uses in one year.
They tell us it is for sanitary purposes. We
know Lake Abitibi. It is a great lake, 350
square miles. Well, if the daily supply were
shut off, Lake Abitibi would be emptied by
that canal in 66 days.

MARCH 16, 1932
The St. Maurice is a good-sized river. The
regulated flow of the St. Maurice is 10,000
cubio feet per second; that is, with the improvements of the Gouin Dam. Under the
régime of Sir Lomer Gouin there was built
at the head-waters of the St. Maurice river
a huge dam. It actually doubles the quantity
of the flow of the St. Maurice, hecause the
water is husbanded in the spring of the year
and is paid out during the summer. The
amount of water taken, the regulated flow,
is 12,000 cubic feet per second, but the natural
flow of the St. Maurice was only one-haif of
that. Now there is being taken in the Chicago
Drainage Canal nearly twioe as much water
as the natural flow of the St. Maurice river.
There is being developed now over 800,000
horse-power on the St. Maurice river, as I
think all honourable members know.
The Saguenay is a migbty river, emptying
out of Lake St. John. The minimum flow,
before the improvements were made there,
was just a littie more than they are dîverting
at Chicago. The Chicago Canal is drawing
just one-sixth leas water than the whole
Saguenay river. The great Chippewa power
scheme, under the Ontario Hydro-Fllectric
Commission, will develop eventually between
500,000 and 600,000 horse-power. It uses 20,000
cubic feet per second. But for the diversion
it would be able to develop haif a much
again.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is 300,000
additional horse-power?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes. The Chicago
Canal takes the equal of five-sixths of the
flow of the whole Saguenay river, and anybody who bas been down that river knows
what a large body of water it is.
Mr. Harlan F. Stone, Attorney-Getneral of
the United States, ays -they are using ten
times more water than is necessary for
navigation purposeis. They are ueing ten
times more water than the Lac~hine Canal.
You all sec -the Ottawa, river here. The
normnal flow of the Ottawa-it is regiae
now, but I refer ito the natural flow-ie 15,200
cubie feet per second, and to-day the Chicago
Sanitary District -are using 12,000 feet; for,
now ýthat there bas been thie quarrel, they are
using stili more.
1 may say that out of this canal, whieh is
about 36 milles long, at a place alled Lockport, just four or five miles noeth of the town
of Joliette, they are now deveoping 36,000
horse-power on a drop of 34 feet. If that
were going over Niagars, Falle and coming
down -to Montreal, you 'could multiply that
by ten and then you would have a~bout the
amounlt of horse-power that couzl be develqped with ihat same amount of water.

What has been the effect on our lakes? It
has had the effect of iowering the level of ail
the lakes except Lake Suiperior by one-halM a
foot. That means that an oxidinary lake

or 13,200 'bushels of wheat, that hie cannot

The American Shipping Federation--and they

the lakes, at the lowest posible estimate,

The Canadian Shipping Federation have
fled their dlaim with the Secretary of War
in the United States. The Canadian Shipping Federation say that above Montreal there
is a loss to Canadianl shipping by the lowering of the water of $273,09W. Remember, these
figures are found in the briefs of the United
States thomselves. And below Montreal
there is a loss of 3322,675. Mark you, honourable members, at Montreal the level of the

inches. You see what an immense quantity
of additionai freight can be carried by sinking

figures together, you find that there ils

anyone that a river wouîd be obstructed, if,
for instance, a bridge were too low and ahipe
could not pass under it, because the ahip
would strike the bridge. But you create just
as bad an obstruction if thxe water la Iowered
so that the ship touches thxe bottone. kn
the eye of the law an obstruction is created
in that way just as if the ship were obstructed
by a bridge, and it muet be remedied. The
Federal Government of the United States declare that you cannot impair the navigable
capacity of any river ini the United States.

No; we have only one place where we cen

members of a great Empire, the biggest the
world bas ever known-an Empire covering
one-quarter of the surface of the globe, 17,000,000 square miles since the War and 15,000,000 before; an Empire consisting of onequarter of the human race, and ail under the
rule of our King George. That is where even
the humblest subi ect cen bring his grievance.
Surely the prayer of a people ten millions

ta Ris Majesty the King we shall be heard,
and that Canada wiil get, if not ail her
rights--for we aigned eway part of our
birthright-at least the remainder of them.
Surely we have made enougli sacrifices. There

protected, and, as I have sai, there la only
one place Vo get ithat proteoîtion-the foot of
the Throne. It la only the strong and mighty
anm of England thet cen give us that protection, and Engiand la awere ai it. I took good
care that a certain paper should be sent

Hon. Chancellor of the Exchequeïr, who, pays,
I think, £55,000,000 a yea.r o -the United States.
We shall say ta him: "Bei ore you pey that
money over, remember that there are subj ects
of His Majesty who are being deepoiled of
their righte in Canada. Keep -that money
back; hand it over to O.ttawa; we need it here
and it is ours." We have proven our loyaity
to Great Britain; we cannot, provide ail the
loyalty. This is the acid test, and I arn
Lmpeoialist enough to believe that England
wiil help us and wiIl see -that the r.ights of
Canada are maintained. I believe that the oid
saying, 2,000 years old, "Civie Romanus sum,"
will apply to-day, and that when. we say,
"Civia Britannicus sumw," we shall have our
rights respected throughout the world.
Now, honourable memiaers, 1 wil nlot -take
up any more of your turne, although I have
hmr article aiter aotiole dealing with this matter. Soene of bhese articles corne from the
United States. For instance, the Detroit

I could go on for a long tinie talking about

motion, seconded by the honourahie senator

Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honaureble gentlemen, a few years ago, and up

be thoroughly familiar with ail the treaties
that have been made, and should know
whether they have been broken or observed.
I thinc this is the most important undertaking
that Canada bas ever embarked upon, and
it wouid be a crying shame for sny hoinourable member of this Ohamber not, ta
know ail about it. In discussing this projeet
with members of Parliament and other public
men I have found that very few of them have
any interest in it at ail, and that many
approve of it wbo do flot understand what it
is ail about.
It seems to me that if there is ta be an
arrangement with the United States concerning
this matter, it should be a treaty and nothing
less. No agreement made between Canada
and the United States can be a treaty. We
ire flot a sovereign power. We are a part
-and, according to the way some people talk
now, a very indefinite part-of the British
Empire. No matter what we may think,
nations regard treaties as agreements entered
into between sovereign powers, and not
agreements made between a nation and a
branch of, or a partner in, anather nation. I
am satisfied that the American Government
would hesitate to accept any suggestion to
dodge any of the provisions of a treaty made
with His Britannic Majesty; mucli more
careful than it would be if there werc an agreemient made with the Dominion of Canada.
It would look upon the one as a bargain;
il, would look upon the ather as something
iînvolving the national honour. It seems to me
childish for us in aur vanity to think it
necessary that we, the Canadian people, should
make this agreement. We should see ta it
that this agreement accords with aur wishes,
but we should see also that it is made with
the mighty Empire of whieh we are a part.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Hear, hear.
lion. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
ail the treaties referred ta shouid be befare
us. What is the idea or intention of the
American Government regarding the observance and enforcement of those treaties by the
United States? We shouid not be satisfied
if it says: "Oh, leave it ta Uncie Sam. Hie
wili do what is right." We should know what
position it wiII take. We shouid know aiso
t.he position that aur Government takes
regarding this Chicago comedy.

ta impiement that contract in the iast twentyfive years? The United Staites Gavernment
admits that the action of the State of Illinois,
or of the Ci'ty of Chicago, is an aibsolute
breach of a contract that it promised, should
not 'be broken. And what has it done? Not
oni1y has it not endeavoured to make Chicago
toe the line, but it has encouraged her ini
breaking the contract. The Attorney-Generai
and the represenrtatives of the Federal Governanent of the United States bave said:
"She is wrong, but let lier go on increasing the amount of water she is taking."
When I wae in the Soudan I came down the
NUle ta Egypt, and I was struck by the extraordinary fact that the whoie of Egypt was in
the hollow of the hand of Great Britain. If
Great Britain chose ta cut a canal fram the
top of Egypt, -on the border of the Soudan,
down :ta Port Soudan, on the Red Sea, Egypt
wouid be for ever a desert. There is a great
fail there ta the Red Sea. Just turn the Nile,
and there is na more Egypt, for it is a land
in which there is neyer any rainfalil, neyer any
frost, neyer any water that does not came
from. the lands bey-ond its borders.
I consider that we are substantially in the
Qame position in relation ta the United States
as Egypt is in relation ta the owners of the
Soudan. We shoîild have something that we
know is enfarceable, something that we know
cannat be broken, beýfore entering into any
agreement with the United States in regard
ta this matter. Wherever their interests under
the -existing treaties have conflicted with ours
they have ignored aur rights and enforced
their awn. If a confliot of interests arises in
connection with this new proposition for the
development of power, what wili be the resuit? After we have been left in suspense for
fifteen or twenty years by a baseheli judge,
we shall be delayed for another fifteen years
by the Supreme Court. And wvhat will happen
when we get a judgment? We surely must
realize that these matters are of transcendental
importance ta this country, and that their
resulte will last for ever. In a very short
time we shail pass away, like the leaves that
camne in :the spring, and I hope that aur descendants will ha able ta say, "That was a
Parliament that watched and guardad aur
interests."
On motion of Hon. Mr. Stanfild, the

-COMMERCE AND TRADE RELATIONS
OF CANADA
REPORT

0F

COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN presented the second
report of the Conimittee an Commerce and
Trade Relations of Canada, and, with the
leave of the flouse, moved concurrence therein.
He said: Honourable inembers, I should
like ta ask the further indulgence of this
-House in order thait I may explain this report.
It cames now almost like a ghoet from. limbo.
This Comimittee was formed in 1908 and has
continued ever since, though it has donc littie
beyond meeting at the beginning of each
session for no other purpose that I can
-ascertain than ta reduce the quorum.
In 1908 there was-I will nat say a stirring
in the valley of dry bones, but there was ane
of those periods when the Senate was seized
-with the idea, an absolutely sound one, that
it could do mare and better work than was
then being carried on. Hon. G. W. Rosa,
afterwards leader of the Government in this
Blouse, proposed that there should be eleven
new standing coxnmittees formed, namely:
Agriculture, Immigration, Commerce and
Trade Relations of Canada, Geological Surveys, Transportation Routes ta the Seaports
and Harbours, Coast Surveys, Fieheries, Industrial Arts and Exhibitions, Civil Service
Administration, Public Health and Inspection
of Foods, Public Buildings and Grounds.
The debate began in February and went on
until April, when Hon. Mr. Scott, then leading
the Senate, concurred in the f ollowing additions ta its standing coxumittees: Agriculture
and Forestry, Immigration and Labour, Commerce, Civil Service Administration, Public
Health, and Buildings and Grounds.
In 1919 there was aiea formed, at the suggestion of the late Senator Nichoîls, a Committee on Finance-a member of the same
family as the committees I have named, and
one which displayed about the saine degree of
activity.
With some in.formality perhaps, the Committee on Comnmerce and Trade Relations, of
which I have the honour ta be chairman,

are far-reaching in their effecte, and it was
felt that there were two reasons why we
.should become active. One reason, a general

one, ie that ini the present situation the industrial system of the country should be so
improved that it may yield more and more
of the things that are desirable for the weIlbeing of the people, and machinery ehould be
provided for the purpose of prom-oting and
facilitating the exchange of our producta.
After ail, there ie no use in producing more
than can actually be sold. Secondly, in view
of the coming lmperial Conference, it was
felt desirable flot only to gain facta, but to
take adva-ntage of whatever .publicity might be
given. ta them by reason of their being deait
with in this House.
There is noa need ta. eay anything about the
I
importance of the Imperial Conference.
think that everybody who knowe anything
about the condition of Canada and the magnituqe of the resuits that may be achieved at
the Conferenoe is fully seized of the desirability of doing everything possible to prepare the minde of the people of Canada sa
that aur representatives, in dealing with the
representatives of the other countries at the
Conference, inay inake the best use of the
information they get, from whatever source
it may come. T-here was a unanimous and
warm desire on the part of the members of
the Committee ta share in this work of securing information, and after the receas, which
is imminent, we shall ask for authority ta
carry on this work as far as we can and ta
the best of our abîlity. At the same time I
may say ta the members of thîs flouse w~ho
are inclined to be cautiaus that the membere
of the Committee were fully aware that the
people who, can do the best work in preparing for the Conference are now exceedingly
busy, and that we should not trespasa on
their lime any more than is necessary ta carry
out the abjects that the Cammittee has in
view.

The ruies are made for a purpose, and it is a
good one, narnely, that the whole membership of the Senate may have an opportunity
to read and consider eacb report before bcing
called upon to make a decision upon it.
Unless there is some necessity for adopting
this report at once, there is no reason that 1
can sc for not enforcing the mile.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: Next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I should like to
rnake an explanation to the honourable gentleman (Eton. Mr. Daniel) and to the House. I
understand that a recess is imminent. If our
report is adopted now we cmn go on with the
preparation of material, and thus no time will
be lost in getting to work when the Senate
meets again.
Hon. Mr. CRIESBACH: It is flot your

Consideration of the report of the Committee on Debates and Reporting was postponed until Wednesday next.
CRIMINAL CODE (CHEQUES WITHOUT
FUNDS, AND GRAND JURJES)
BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND REPORTED

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Cornmittee on Bill 22, an
Act to amend the Crirninai Code (Cheques
without Funds, and Grand Juries).
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.
On section i obtaining by false pretence:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Mr. Chairman, I
have some objections to this section. When
the Bill received its second reading ini this
House I asked for a comrnittee, whîch the
right honourable the leader of the Senate did
flot seem desirous of granting, and I did not
have an opportunity of fully stating my
objections. After due consideration I have
corne to the conclusion that the purpose of
this Bill is to enforce the payrnent of debts
or dlaims by means of the Criminal Code.
As has been very forcibly stated in this
House before, this«constitutes a drastic change
in the criminal Iaw of Canada. I can readily
imagine a few men meeting together and
saying that too many worthless cheques are
passed. I think the right honourable leader
of the ýGovernment stated that the number of
N.S.F. cheques issued in a year was somnetbing
like 70,000, but he gave us no information
whatsoever as to whether or not any of those
Hon.

Mr.

DANIEL.

cheques were issued to obtain goods by false
pretences. We know that the custom. of
exchanging cheques has grown up in the country. When settlement day arrives the bank
says to a man, "You must straighten out your
account," and that rnan goes to a friend and
exchanges cheques with hirn. I do not think
there is any possibilîty of showing the number of cheques issued for which there are not
sufficient funds, or what proportion of those
issued would corne within the provisions of
the Crirninal Code at the present tirne.
A man issues a cheque for which there are
not sufficient funds. What happens? The
right honourable leader of the Government,
with the great ability that he bas as a special
pleader, argued that a man would not suifer
if he had a good excuse for issuing the
cheque. That is alI very well, but the issuer
of the cheque is surnmoned to appear before
a magistrate, and, outside of the cities and
towns, where the magistrates have a large
practice and are probably eminent lawyers,
you cannot always depend on what be wil
do. The onus is thrown upon the accused
of sat.isfying a magistrate who is wrong three
tirnes out of five. I have no doubt about
that. Case after case bas been cited of maistrates wbo have imposed exceptionally sovere
sentences sirnply because they were playing
up to the feeling in their communities. This
House passed an Act whereby the sentences
of magistrates could be revised, and such
sentences have been eut down and proper sentences irnposed. I need not give instances.
They are to be found ail over tbe country.
A few members of the Board of Trade, or
the Retail Merchants Association, rocet tegether and send a petition to the Governrnent
of -Canada saying, "We want you to make the
issuing of N.S.F. cheques a criminal offence,
and to make the issuers hiable to arrest."
Notwitbstanding the argument of the right
honourable leader of the Governrnent, 1 ssy
that the innocent man wvill suifer. I say that
any man, in any cornmunity, against whorn a
charge is laid, is bound to suifer, and bis wife
and children also, particularly if he cornes
before a magistrate who is prejudiced and sets
out to make an example of hirn.
This Biil dýoes not make any difference to
the prosecutor; he does not have to pay anything. Ail ie lias to do is to caJL up the police
office and have an information aaid. But the
unfortunate individual who is cliarged, even
though he may be perfectly innocent, has to
bear the oýdium of the charge, and lia. to pay
ail the costs of defeniding hi'mself. I cannot
understand why a principle of the erirninal law
which lias been in force for so many years
shouJd be ýchanged ait the request of a meeting

which always fieretofore bas had to lie made.
No man would lie subi ect to prosecution or
could 'be liauled into a police court under this
Bill unJessf'ie is subi ect -to the saime treatment
now. Any man may be braught to the police
court if an allegaition is madle against him,
supported by affidavits, that be has comrnitted
some offence under the Code. As the aaw
exista now, if a man issues a worthless cheque
and by meanis of it obtains goods, he may lie
brouglit liefore a police magistrale next morning, and ail those hairrowing and awful things
we have heard about can, lappen to his family,
leaving his wife in tears and his chidren in
despair. This Bill woul flot facilitate that
sort of thing, which, as I say, can happen
under -the present law.
The first clause of -the Bill would flot begin
to operate untii the evidence in any case had
proceeded a ýconsiderable way in court. At
present, if a man swears out an information
against someone else for giving- him a worthiess ebheque and receiving goods under false
pretences, when the case is -called lie goes to
court and produces ýthe cheque, probably cails
a banker 'to show -that the oheque is no good,
and proves that the aocused got the goods by
means of the cheque anid would not have got
them other-wise; but the magistra-te is compelied to say to the complainant: "Ia that all
the evidence you have? It is flot enough. The
aocused may bc quite innocent of the charge.
You have to prove to -me that in issuing that
cheque lie intended to get -the goods by faise

pretences. You have ta show me that lie
acted in bad faith; that lie had no reason ta
think the cheque would ever be paid." The
complainant in sucli circumstances may feel
inciined ta say to hi'mseif: "How in the world
amn I going ta prove it? That is a character
of proof that is at his ýdisposai and flot at mine.

Because it is at bis disposai it seems ta me
that lie should lie put on his defence and
made to show -the court that lie acted in good
faitb." Now, this first clause supports the
argument of the compiainant. When lie goes
into court and produces the cheque he received
and swears that for the cheque the accused

got goods that lie otherwise woulýd not have
obtained, a prima facie case will have been
made out that the aeused had no rigbt ta
issue that cheque. From that point on, the
evidence -can better bie given by the defendant.
I have souglit very earnestly, thaugli seemingly with feeble resuits, ta impress upon
bonourable members that aur Code is lined
with similar provisions from end ta end. I
shall refer ta one that I mentioned wlien we
were last discussing the motion for second
reading-the section of the Code referring ta

the evidence of guiit *on the part of a man
who lias blackened lis face and appears an
the streets at niglit in aucb a condition. Before that section was passcd, if a policeman
discovered him and feit sure lie was endeavouring ta conceal his identity for criminal
purposes, lie could take the man ta court and
state the facts, but althougli the officer miglit
lie certain that the mnan wouid flot have dis-

guised himseif except witli criminal intent,
and that lie ouglit ta be punislied for that
offence, the ýcourt wouild say:
"N-'o, lie
may lie quite innocent. H1e may have black-

ened lis face for some other purpose. For
instance, lie may have been sceking a place an
the stage and may have wanted ta show that
lie was weli fitted

for theatiricai

work.

It

îs necessary ta prove that lie had a criminal
irîtent." In ail probability the prosecution
would fail. Ta remedy that situation the law

was clianged. It is a cammon-sense inference
that a man who is found on the streets at

niglit with lis face blackened lias not disguised himself with a view ta henefiting soeiety.

Sa it wvas enacted that when a man who lias
becn found in sucli a condition at niglit is
brauglit ta caurt the anus is tîpon him ta
shoaw that lis intentian was gaad. Is theîe
any difference between a case of that kind and
a case where a worthless chieque is issued in

arder that gaads may lie obtained?

Cer-

tainly the quantity af proof required for
prima facie evidence is mare ample under
this Bihl than it wauld be in the kind af case
I have illustrated.
The English law lias a provision similar ta
the anc we are trying ta enact here. The
hanourable senator from Hamilton (Han. Mr.
Lyndli-Staunton) seemed ta think that we wcrc
straying fram the straiglit and narrow path
af British justice and were engaging in ail
sorts of hideous undertakings, through the
raising of presumptions. There is no difference
between aur law in this respect, ar the principles that underlie it, and thc British law
or its principles.
I have with me extracts

law, in(licating that even under the common
law of England, hased upon precedents and
principles. the court wauld shift the burden

ta the defendant if the evidence which in the
apinian af the judge ivas necessary ta com-

pîcte the case were peculiarly within the charge
of the defendant. It was lield by the court
that the anus was shifted as soan as the case

got to a point w'here' the evidence required
was of sucli a character that it wvould be
wit.hin the special command of the defendant,
as distinguished fram the complainant. The

the common law in that respect, but under

case flian under common law. We have passed
similar enactmnents in Canada, and flic purpose
of this Bill is simply to apply the saine procedure in prosecutions for the issuing of

We have not given
special protection to oflier classes of people.
The reason wliy this law is proposed now is
simply that fthe clicque habit lias grown rapidly
in the last few ycars and flic difficulfies of
prosecufion have tliereby become very manifest. And wc are asked to acf on flic samne

gîven by iy honourable friend from. Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans). I do flot like the
shifting which this Bill proposes of the presurnption of guit. I quite appreciate thaf, as
the riglit honourable gentleman has said on
the motion for second reading and repeafcd
to-day, the practice of issuing cheques for
vihich there are no funds or insufficient funds
?mn
deposit lias grown to a considera:ble extent
in late years, and I can understand that those
whose duty it is to administer the criminal
law of our country desire that this objectionable practice sliould be curbed. I agrce with
the riglit honourable gentleman when lie say8
that if is very difficuif to figlifen up the law
in a reasonable way without .providing for
flic shifting of the burden of proof to flic
defendant. But I feed that flie riglit honourable gentleman treats too lightly tlie position
of a man who, withouf any criminal intent,
issues a wortliless cheque and is called upon
to prove lis innocence in the police court.
However easily a man may be able to prove
his good faitli, lie doesfl ot like to be arrested
by a policeman and faken before a magistrate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But, if the
honourable gentleman wîll excuse me, my
point is tliaf this Bill would flot facilifate the
arrest of any man for sucli a thing.
Hon. Mr. COPP: But the presumption of
guilf is flot againsf tlie man now. An absolutely innocent man may issue a clieque whcn
lie lias no funds or insufficient funds in the
bank. For instance, over a long period a bank
may have lionoured every clieque that a man
issued, aithougli on somne occasions lie may
nof liave liad a sufficient balance to meef a
particular chieque, but tliere may come a fime
wlien tlie bank decides to discontinue the
practice witliout notifying tlie man. In fliat
event, flic next clieque of lis that comes
along wlien fliere are not sufficient funds wil
he rejecfed, and if tlie clieque was issued for
goods tbe vendor of the goods may lay a
complaint before a police magistrafe.
My
riglit lionourable friend says thaf tlie accused
can go int o tlie box and, if innocent, clear
himsclf of the cliarge of obfaining tlie goods
by false prefences; but I wouId point out
tliat flic man will probably have f0 hire
counsel to plead flic case, and before hie is
tliroughlihe may have a legal bill of $100,
$150 or $250. The cheque may have been
comparatively small-perhaps flot more than
twenty-five dollars.

I voted for the second reading of the Bill
because I am in favour of the first clause,
touching "cheque artists," as my right honourable friend so well put it, and because I
think they are the only ones who will suffer.
So far as section 2 is concerned, I second
the motion of the honourable gentleman
from North York.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable members, I support the amendment. Do
we realize the importance of grand juries?
Not only do they deal with criminal affairs,
returning truc bills or no bills, but at every
assize it is part of their duty to visit the
reformatories, asylums, jails and penitentiaries and to report to the court, and thereby
to the Government. Many important reforms
in regard to such institutions have been made
as a result of visits of grand juries. I remember that not many years ago people were sent
to asylums or reformatories in consequence of
family conspiracies, and that it was through
the visits of grand jurors, who lent a willing
ear to the complaints of persons detained
against their will, that some of these people
were released. It would be a great pity to
do away with what my honourable friend
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) referred to
yesterday as the bulwark of British liberty
and British justice. I have in mind a famous
case in Montreal. Mr. Fred Perry, a man
well known in his day and generation, who
in 1849 took part in the little revolution that
occurred in Montreal at the time of the
Rebellion Losses Bill, visited an asylum in
Montreal, where he found an old lady who
had been detained there for years although
ehe was not insane. Out of the largeness of
his heart, he took an interest in this old lady,
and raised a public subscription. A writ was
served on the authorities, and she was brought
before the court. My father-in-law, Sir Louis
Jetté, happened to be a judge of the Superior
Court at that time, and the case, which
stirred not only the district of Montreal, but
the whole Province of Quebec, came before
him. Experts from various asylums, even
from asylums in the United States, were
heard, and after a long trial the old lady
was set free, and everybody offered thanks
to Fred Perry-and, by the way, to the grand
jurors who had visited the institution.
Why should an old British province like
British Columbia so lightly do away with
grand juries?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Was Mr.
Perry a grand juror when he visited this institution?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I think so. He was
a public-spirited gentleman. In later years
he was appointed Fire Commissioner for
Montreal. He wrote some very interesting
memoirs which were published in the Montreal
Star, and was a picturesque figure well known
to every citizen of Montreal.
Why should we, on the simple ipse dixit of
Mr. Pooley, the Attorney-Generad of British
Columbia-a gentleman whom I respectdo away with that old British institution, the
grand jury? I say that we should not pass
lightly -on this clause of the Bill. I shall
certainly vote against it.
Hon. ROBERT FORKE: Honourable members of the Senate, the Province of Saskatchewan has never had a grand jury, and no evil
effects have resulted. Manitoba has abolished
the grand jury, and so has Alberta. I have
served on grand juries three times, I think,
and notwithstanding the eloquence of the
honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) I would not place very much
reliance upon the result of the examination of
an asylum by a grand jury. My experience
would indicate that it is .pretty difficult to tell
who are the attendants and who are the
patients.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And who are the
grand jury.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: And who are the grand
jury, if you like. The only objection that I
have to this part of the Bill lies in the fact
that all we have is a letter from Mr. Dooley.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Pooley.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: This is the. 17th of
March. I should like to have a little more
evidence from the Legislature. Also, I have
heard to-day that of the senators from British
Columbia who voted on the second reading,
two voted in favour of the Bill, two voted
against it. I should be rather in favour of
our letting this matter stand over until we
get a little more information from the Province of British Columbia, although I have no
fault to find with the abolition of the grand
jury, because as far as the three Prairie Provinces are concerned, I do not think they have
lost anything by not having it, and I know
that they have saved a good deal of expense.
Hon. G. H. BARNARD: It is with a great
deal of diffidence that I venture to disagree
on a question of this kind with a gentleman
of the legal experience of the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen

Aylesworth), but for some years I have
Nvatched the course of proceedings, both
criminal and civil, in the courts of the Province of British Columbia and have seen
something of the practical workings of the
grand jury system.
In reply to the arguments of the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) in respect to public institutions and
the pre.sentmen.ts of grand juries to the courts,
and through them to, the authorities, I would
point out that in nîy opinion the general experience has been that to a very large extent
they wcre pigeon-holed. I have a very distinct
recollection of one occasion when a judge informed t.he grand jury that wvhile it xvas their
privilege to visit these institutions and to make
pre.entments, he wvas tircd of forwacding them,
because no one paid any attention to them.
For that reasen 1 think that function of the
grand jury is nlot a particularly important one.
As to whether or flot the grand jury is
really a safeguard for accused persons, I have
known of cases as to whichi it bias becn
currently reported that the grand jury bcd
been uscd for the purpose of enabling people
wlio ought to have been tricd te escape trial,
and, on the other ban(l, I have neyer heard
of any innocent pei's0ns being sent before
the court. As for an original jndictmcnt by
a grand jury, 1I(do not rerneinher having ever
hecard of a grand jury in the Province of
British Columýbia indicting anyone of its own
motion.
In the face. of the argumecnts of the honourcicl gentleman from North York (Hon. Sir
Allen Avjeswvorth) I hesitate to vote in
fax onr of anything that would in any way
create a difforence between the criminal law
oî W-estern Canada and that of Eastern
Canada. I think one of the great safeguards
of this coihntry as contcasted with the ceuntry
to the south of us, for instance, is that while
the various States have different laws, we have
one criminal lawv foc tlîe whole Dominion,
and whercas they have extradition betîveen
one State and another, we hav e no such thinig
as bctwcen provinces..Al
said and done,
this is merely a question of procedure. Grand
juries are a rather expensive luxury, and
financial conditions in British Columbia are
none too good. I really do not see, therefore,
why, for the amount of wock they do, twentyfour men at every spring or faIt assizes in the
province should draw five dollars a day for
from five to fifteen days.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And there is

Hon. Mc. BARNARD: And thece is the

would be just as difficult te introduce that
system thiere as te re-establish something that

MARCH 17, 1932
was abolished by the' Magna Charta, and I
have no doubt that the same remark is true
of Saskatchewan. My attention has just been
called by the honourable gentleman from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) to the fact
that the petit jury in Alberta has only six
members instead of twelve, the number in all
the other provinces. That is another distinction arising from the cause I have mentioned.
I have the best authority for assuring the
House that in both these respects there would
not be the slightest support by the people
at large, or by the Bar, of a proposal to
adopt the procedure followed in other parts
of the country. The people of Alberta think
that a jury of six is better than one of twelve,
and perhaps they have good reason for thinking so. The great risk in the jury system,
as honourable members who are closely associated with legal practice know, is the possible
corruption of a juror. Well, there is just twice
as much danger of that kind with a jury of
twelve as with a jury of six. However, I am
not arguing for Dominion-wide uniformity of
court procedure along that line.
Grand juries functioned for many years in
Manitoba, but were abolished in the interest
of economy. I presume it is quite correct,
as has been stated, that the province communicated with Parliament through the
medium of a resolution by the Legislature,
supported by the local Government. Now, I
do not know whether that condition precedent, if it can be so called, has been fulfilled by British Columbia in this instance,
but I submit that Parliament must accept the
principle that the Government of a province
speaks for the province. I do not think we
have any right to go behind a Government,
whether in Quebec, Prince Edward Island,
British Columbia, or anywhere else, and say:
"We are not sure that you represent the
people. We have evidence that there are two
views in your province-that the people are
not unanimous."
Hon. Mr. FORKE: This change has been
requested, not by the Government, but only
by the Attorney-General.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
the Attorney-General speaks for the Government.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: It does not say that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Everybody
admits that.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I mean to say this has
not been requested by the Legislature.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We surely
do not want to create'the precedent of going
41767-GI

131

behind a Government to the Legislature. We
might just as well go farther and say that we
do not believe the Legislature speaks for the
province and that we require a vote of the
people. Surely the right position to assume
is that the Government speaks for the province as a whole. Therefore I think we can
take it for granted that British Columbia does
want to get rid of the grand jury system and
save the money that system now costs.
As to the value of the services rendered by
the grand jury in British Columbia I think
the people of that province, and not we,
should be the judges. The services are supposed to be for the benefit of the province
rather than of the Dominion as a whole. My
experience was that the work done by grand
juries was of very little value, and my view
in that regard has not been changed even
after listening to the remarks made by the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) as ta a certain case. I do not
know anything about the incident, but I feel
sure that if he will look more closely into the
facts he will find that it was not as a grand
juror that Mr. Perry took his action. I do
not think he could have acted in that way
as a grand juror. One of the duties of a
grand jury is to inquire and report as to
whether any person is detained in an institution without legal warrant or authority, but
inquiry cannot be made by them as to whether
the authorities were right in having anyone
detained, or as ta whether any inmate of an
asylum is sane. In Manitoba, as in any
other province, if they find that a person is
being held without a proper legal warrant
they are required to report that to the court,
and then it is the business of the court to
see that either a warrant is provided or the
man is released. I have known of instances
of that kind. It seems to me that what likely
happened in Montreal was that in some way
or other Mr. Perry found, and was able to
prove by expert testimony, that the woman
was sane. Therefore he knew that the warrant
under which she was being held should be
cancelled and he took legal proceedings
accordingly. But such a thing could not have
happened by virtue of any function attaching
to the office of a grand juror. Consequently
the case cited by the honourable gentleman
has no reference to the grand jury system,
unless it be to show the weakness of it, for
the woman was detained over a long period in
an asylum which had been visited twice a
year by grand juries who had done nothing
whatever towards restoring her ta freedom.
I think the honourable senator from Rougemont will find that Mr. Perry learned of the
woman's plight through a visit to the institu-

CHICAGO WATER DIVERSION
MOTION AND

DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Casgrain:
That hie will cal1 attention ta the diversion
af water froin Lake Michigan by the City of
Chicaga an(l will miove, that in the opinion of
the Senate no furthcr negotiations on the St.

Senate of Canada bas exaîinied the treaty nomin force anti lias ascertained that this treatv is
bcing carricd out.
Further tliat a copy of the said treaty be
placed upon the Table of the Senate.
Right Hon. Mir. MEIGHE'N: Honourable
.senators, there are a few i'erarks that I think
,ought ta ho made with respect ta the address
delivcrcd yesterday by the honourable senator from De Lanaudière (Han. Mr. Casgrain).
I think ha is under a succession of misapprehensions.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

ilear, hear.

Right lion. Mr. MEICHEN: The honourable gentleman's address was based upon what
he considered ta be the terms af a treaty,
which I toak ta be the Baundary Waters
Treaty ai 1909. Apparently hae was of the
opinion that this trcaty made certain stipulations with respect ta the rights af Canada
ind the United States in the matter of the
liversion of water by the Chicago Drainage
Canal. The treaty cLoes no such thing. There
is no treaty stipulation af any kind hetween
Canada and the United States touching
specificaliy the Chicago diversion or any other
diversion.
Under na treaty is the United
States entitied, we contend, ta any special
change in the flow of water at Chicago. The
dlaims of Chicago, on the strength nf which
it continued and enlarged the diversion, are
based upon a proclamation or licence issued
Riglit I-on.

Mr. MEIGREN.

hy the United States Secretary ai War in, I
think, the year 1900, or, at ail events, a
considerabie time aga.
It has aiways seemed ta me that the position assumed hy the United States Governniîent is inconsistent. It contends that Lake
Michigan is not one of the boundary waters
and therefore anv diversion fromn that lake is
not covered by the treaty; but on the other
hand it savs that the reason for the diversion
is that under the treaty Canada gets more
water at Niagara Falls than the Unitedl
States. How these two contentions can ha reconciled is not clear ta me.
The Ainerican view is, in the first place,
that only houndary *waters are cavered hy the
termis oi the treaty, and that under article 1
Lake Michigan is not a haundary water;
secondly, that article II does not. give either
contracting party any right beyond that ai
protest against a diversion which would affect
navigation interests; and thirdly, that articele
III applies only ta future diversions.
The United States Supreme Court in its
judgment of January 5, 1925, did recognize in
a general way, however, the applicability of
this treaty ta, the Chicago diversion. That
judgment, which ivas rendered by Mr. Justice Holmes, stated:
XVith regard ta the second ground, the Treaty
ai January 11, 1909, with Great Britain
expressly pravides against lises affecting tihe
natural level or flow of boundary waters withouît the authority ai tise United States or the
Dominion of Canada within their respective
jurisdictions, and the approval of the International Joint Commission agreed up>on therein.
Later the Spocial Master, Charles E.
Hughes, in his report of Octoher, 1927, reierred ta the statement ai the Secretary of
State, Elihu Root. ta the Senate in 1910, as
indicating that the treaty did nat appiy ta
the Drainage Canal in any way. From the
reference that I have made ta the judgment
oi Mr. .Justice Hoimes it might ha arguable
on aur part that the treaty does apply in this
respect. But the United States Government
does nat dlaim in its communications that the
treaty provides for diversion rights.
Referring, ta the remarks ai the honourabie
senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStatînton), it seems ta me that I shouid give
the Hoùise some ýparticulars as ta the limitations flxed hy the judgment ai the Supreme
Court respecting the diversion in -future. In
1900 the diversion xvas initiated with a yeariy
mean ai 2,990 second feet. In 1909, at the
date ai the execution ai the Boundary Waters
Treaty, the diversion had increased tao an
average ai 6,495 second feet. The permit of
the United States Secretary of War at that
time wa. for a diversion ai 4,167 second feet,

SENATE

answer was given to some questions as to the

publication of an officiai history of the Great
war:
Under Order in Council dated May 27, 1921,
(P.C. 1652), the Historical Section, General
Staff, Departnient of National ilefence, is
charged w-ith the compilation and publication
of a complete official history setting forth the
participation of the Military Forces of Canada
in the Great XVar; this history to, be supplemented by more detailed histories of the work
of certain technical branches of the service.
One volume lias heen issued to date, namely,
the History of the Medical Services, written by
Sir Andrew Macphail.
In answer to another question a statement
was made as to the supposed plan of the
history, and other details.
It is interesting to observe what bas heen
done by other parts of the British Empire.
Australia and New Zealand published their
officiai histories some years ago; South Africa
hias published hers; Great Britain bias issued
the history of the West African campaign,
the East African campaign, the campaign in
Mesopotamia and the campaign in Palestine,
and, I think, now bias volumes out covering
the operations of the armies dlown to 1916.
There are two kzinds of history. The more
popular type is based principally upon information given either orally or in letters by
eye-witncsses, and the other type is principally the resuit of documentary research.
I draw the attention of honourable members
to the fact tbat the Order in Council setting
in motion the compilation of a Canadian officiai history was dated the 27th of May, 1921.
There seems to be no sound reason for the
delay that bias occurred in publication, and
a great many of our people are not satisfled
with the answers that have been given by the
Government in attempting to explain this delay. There is a very widely feit opinion that
,lhe work should be proceeded with immeliately, so that a proper history, written by
in autbority or authorities duly qualified,
should be available to Canadians in the near
future.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER (Translation) : Honourable senators. the suggestion of the honourable
membier for Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
calîs for comment. If the Government desires
a history of the Great War-and I think it
ought to desire it-my opinion is that it
should inaugurate a competition and give a
prize to the person wbo writes the best history,
in the opinion of a board of .iudges consisting
of well-informed men who are themselves
writers. Indeed the Government might give
a first and a second prize; for historv is always
written in a partial manner.
'No one can
write a history that is absolutely impartial.
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Everyone bias bis own way of looking at
things; everyone looks at the facts fromn a
particular angle. Now, what is an official
history ordered by a government? I tbink I
have read some of the best records of nearly
every race. None of tbe great histories of
the world have been written by order. The
Greeks have written wonderful histories; likewise the French, the Englisb, the Romans.
Show me amiong- the great historians any
officiai writer.
While congratulating my bonourable friend
upon having raised this very important point,

I venture to differ witb him as to the method,
preferring that this history, which is necessary,
should be written by some private individual
and that the Government should give to the
wînner of a competition the reward that hie
deservem.
Right Hon. Mr. MF.IGHEN: Honourable
,entlemen, I must confess to some sym.pathy
wîth the view cxpressed by the bonourable
ýenator who bias just taken bis seat (Hon.
Mr. Poirier).
An officiai history may be
-ssential, but I sbould very much prefer that
a man who is really an historian, flot a mere
compiler of data, really a writer as well as
a statistician, would, becauise of bis love Of
the ta.sk, undertake the work, rather than
that it should fall into the possibly crude
and lrol)ably coriimon-placc, furmi of an official
history. I understand the honourable senator
10 take the view that the dutv of the Gov~ernmient would he completed if it provided the
material, opened its files, and by such facilities
assisted real writers, in English or French
prose, to perform the task.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Both.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Both, preferably. Writers who are masters of both are
very fcw. However, with that point of view
I have a great deal of sympathy, because I
know that if we could ho sure the work would
be dlonc within a reasonable time it would
meet the aspirations and satisfy the longings
of those who are dceply interestcd in the
proper diseharge of this taisk.
I bave bpfore me the reply provided

of the honourable senator. I will lay it on
the Table, to be included in the Debates, but
I forbear to read it, because its ternis are,
word by word, those recited by the honourable senator as ziven in the Hlouse of

think that in order to make adequate atonement for its record the paper would need to
exist many thousands of years longer.
My reason for referring to this matter is
that 1 think the rernarks contained in the
article, with regard to the committee, are unjust and untruthful. 'I'at eommittee is composed of nine bonourable members, drawn
from both sides of this House, and I arn confident that anyone who has read the proceedings or attended the sittings and observed
what has gone on will agree with me wben
I say that no comrnittee ever appointed by
ibis House has been conducted with more
freedom from any exhibition of partisan feeling. The editoriai in question bas this to say:
The Senate Beauharnois iaquiry, the Brantford Expositor points out, "w-as characterjzed
by bitterness and partisanship of the worst
kzind, so niuch so tlîat on one occasion it was
forced to adjotira in an uproar."
I think that everv member of the cornmittee and ail who bave been in attendance
on its bearings know that that statement is
entirely witbout foundation in fact. It is to
me a iemarkable thing that the Toronto
Globe should take the trouble to go ail the
wvay to a Brantford newspaper office ilhich
badi no knowlcdge of the facts, and that it
should tben publisb this item on the basis
of the incorrect information that it obtained
there.
A little later on in uts staternent it says:
The people are looking for bonesty and
sincerity in puiblic life.
Wýell, ail I have to say, honourable members,
is tbat if the people are looking for honesty
and sincerity in public life, and for truth in
regard to publie matters, the last place in
which tbey bad better look for such tbings
is the Toronto Globe. There is no excuse
whatever for anyone who w~as present at the
meeting to which this refers coming to the
conclusion reached by the Toronto Globe,
apparently, on tbe statement of the Brantford Expositor. Tbe staternent bas no foundation whatever in fact; the whole thing is
invented; and, as I sc tbe matter, it is a
very unjust lihel on the members who havle
sat on that committee.
Hon. A. C. HARDY:
May I ask the
bonourable senator whether tbe remarks in
the Globe apply to the Senate committee?
Do tbey not apply to the cornmittee of the
House of Commons whicb sat last year? If
so, a question of privilege ivould lie, not in
this House, but in another place. If I read
the article aright, as I believe I do, it applies
entirely to the House of Commons committee
Hon. Mr.

TANNER.

which sat about a year ago, and it is not in
any way applicable to the committee of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
The article condernns the House of Commons committee-it
condemans the Gordon Committee; it condemns ail parliarnentary committees. Then
it explicitly condemns the Senate Beauharnois
Cornmittee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
WVil1
the honourable
gentleman pardon me?
I tbink the condemnation does flot extend to ail committees, but is specifie.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In fact, it condemns
everybody, and, as I said before, if one were
to read this article the only conclusion one
could corne to would be that there is not an
honest man in Parliament to-dayHon. Mr. FORKE:

Why worry?

Hon. Mr. TANNER: -that
the only
honest man in Canada to-day is the man wbo

is tbe only conclusion that anybody coul1

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I hope the
honourable member (Hon. Mr. Hardy) would
not think tbat, those words could possibly be
applie<l to a committee wbose decision was
unanimous. No charge of partisanslîip could
lie against such a cornmittee.
INSURANCE

BIS

FIRST READINGS

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN introduced
Bill El, an Act reýspecting the Departrnent of
Insurance, and Bill Fl, an Act respecting
Foreign Insurance Companies in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I arn glad
to be in a position to-day to introduce, flrst,
a Bill respecting the Departrnent of Insurance,
and, second, a Bill respecting Foreign Insurance Companies in Canada.
Honourable senators will remember that
shortly after the opening of the session two
Bis were introduced in this House, one relating to Dominion insurance cornpanies and
the other to British and f oreign insurance
companies. Both tbese measures had been
prepared by the draft.sman in the hope that
tbey woîîld properly interpret ail the decisions
of His Majesty's Privy Council defining the
jurisdiction of the Dominion in regard to the
subject of insurance. After this House biad
referred the Bills to the Standing Comrnittee
on Banking and Commerce, honourable members of tIîat cuîmiiittee, nut in their meetings,
but individually, reviewed, as I also had
occasion to do, the terrns of the proposed

MARCH 23, 1932
legisiation. -Considerable objection was raised
ta the Bis. 'Ewo provinces, Ontario and
Quebec, objected to thema on the ground that
they contravened the jurisdiction of the provinces, especially as established and defined by
the latest decision of the Privy Council.
Objection was taken aIso by a certain class of
insurance companies, 'notably those known
as reciprocals and New England mutuals,
which in the past have been very strong
antagonists of the former Dominion legisiation.
As the resuit of the objections raised and the
review of the legisiation that I was able ta
make, the former Bis have been withd.rawn
in order that new Bis might be introduced
which çwou'ld be more in conformity with. the
abbreviated juri.sdiction lef t to us 'by the
Privy Council.
The two Bis that I have just presented do
flot cover the whole ground that was intended
ta 'be covered by the two previous ones.
Another Bill wilI be necessary.
The Departmnent of Insurance has been 'by
law established for many decades, but the
first of the Bis that I arn now introducing
establishes the Department of Insurance
under the legisiation as it is now being revised and reformed. I thought it better in
introducing such a meaure ta keep it separate
fromn the Bis defining the duties of the
Department in respect of the various classes
of insurance -cornpanies.
The second Bill naw presented deals only
with foreign companies, or, as we might describe them, alien companies. Many of these
alien companies are doing business in Canadai
to-day. The word "companies " includes associations and exehanges of the nature of the
New England mutuals and the reciprocals.
We have flot included British companies
within the frnrview of this Bill, deeming it
better that they shouid be reserved ta be
treated a.fterwards, when the Bill respecting
Dominion companies is introduced.
On the subject of alien companies, those
whose head office is in other lands, not British,
we base aur jurisdiction upon the provision of
thec British North America Act relating ta
aliens, also upon the provision relating ta
bankruptcy and insolvency, and in part upGn
the clause reiating ta the regulation of trade
and commerce. In bankruptcy and insoivency
there is, of course, undoubted Dominion authority under the terms of the Act; nor could
there be any reasanable doubt of the coroiiary
that this authority extends so as ta enable
the Dominion Parliament ta de6ine, in relation to any class of companies, what constitutes insolvency.
I have indicated the three foundations of
jurisdiction on which the Bill is based. In

137

preparing the legisiation we have endeavoured
ta reconcile the views of the several classes of
insurance campanies--and they are many,
and their opinions are even more diverse than
could be the opinions of the partisans of the
Beauharnois Committee. We have been careful not to exceed aur own authority, and
especially have we been careful ta meet, sa far
as we possibly could, the views of the provinces. In introducing these new Bills, though,
I wish ta say this: I have no authority at
ail ta intimate that the provinces have acquiesced in their termas. Even yet, further
conferences are necessary; but these need
not delay the consideration of the Bills by
the committee. I arn in earnest hopes that
the provinces wilI acquiesce, and still more
deeply roated is my belief that in any event
the Buis are soundly based, that they invite
no attack upon themn on the score of authority, and that they wilI probably resist any
such attack should it came.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlenmen, I do not know that I thoroughly understood my right honaurable friend. I wonder
if I arn right in this, that according ta the
programme which hie ie about ta carry out,
the subject of insurance will involve the euhmission of three or four Bills.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Three.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understood that
the purpase of one of the Bills was ta define
or perhaps restrict the presen; powers and
jurisdiction of the Federal Department of
Insurance; in other words, the Bill was intended ta give a better delinition of the prosent jurisdiction af the departmnent, in view
of the judgment of the Privy Council. Then
there is a Bill with regard ta foreign coinpanties; that is, as I understand, American
companies, or foreign companies other than
British. Then there is ta be a Bill wîth regard
to British companies.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI43HEN: Dominion
and British.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Dominion ani
British together. I amrn ot going ta speak on
the Bills, but I wonder whether they are now

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, they are

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. My
thought was that if they were introduced
to-day we could have the printing proceeded

with and distribution would probably bc
effected in time to enable most of the senators to have them for perusal during the holidays. Of course, I would not attempt to go
on in committee before the House resumes.
The honourable gentleman is not quite exact
in his language as to the purport of the first
BiH. It is not an attempt to restriet or to
define. Such is nfot our intention. We cannot restrict, we cannot define, we cannot
amplify our jurisdiction. That is done by
our constitution, and is beyond our interference. But it is an attempt 'to establish the
department upon a footing which it bas a fulI
right to occupy, by virtue of the British
North America Act, its amendments, and the
decisions thereon.
Hon. Mr. B.ELCOURT:
Consistent with
the judgment recently rendered?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: Yes; the decisions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to mention
another matter.
As my right honourable
friend will remeniber, I suggested in committee that it might help towards the understanding of these matters that a copy of the
Privy Councils decision, referred to, should
be printed and submitted to the members
along with the Bills. May I add another
suggestion? I saw in the press yesterday that
at least one insurance measure of considerable
importance was introduced in the Legislature
of Ontario. It might be well to have that
also before us when considering these Bil.ls.
I have also seen in the press that the right
honourable leader has had some conferences
with the Attorney-General of the Province of
Ontario with regard to this subject. May I
ask whether such conferences have been had
with Quebec and the other provinces as well?
If so, would any information from those
sources be available to us at present?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On the suggestion to produce the judgment of the Privy
Council delivered at the end of last year:
while that judgment is of very great importance, I do net think it would be well 'to
have it printed and distributed to the committee as itself reflective of the state of the
law at the present time. There are previous
judgments bearing on the same subject, some
of which, I am compelled to say, are very
hard to reconcile with the last, and ail of
which are just as authorita.tive as the last.
There is no superior voice in any decision
because of date. The decisions of 1916 and
1921 are of equal importance. Consequently,
if honourable gentlemen have an ambition
to make of thenselves fine constitutional
Right

Mr. MEIGHEN.

authorities, they wili not be able to do so
by merely perusing the last judgmenit; they
will have to study many previous ones, and
they will have to try to draw fron the whole
of the .collected verdicts something in the
nature of a consistent result. I do not say it
cannot be done, but I do say it is very difficult to do. And many honourable senators
may sec fit to go te still other sources for
their opinions. I do not think we could undertake to present to the House anything that
would be a complete compendium of the
various authorities to which honourable senators might want to refer. We shall just have
to try to lay before the Committee on Banking and Commerce the effect of the various
decisions, and seek to show them that the
Bills as presented are not in contravention of
any of those decisions.
The honourable senator referred also to
certain bills that had been introduced, or to
one that had been introduced, in Ontario. It
is truc that a Bill was introduced on Monday
by the Attorney-General. I understand it
contains a clause under which it goes into
effect only on proclamation. My belief is
that this clause was placed in it in order that
the present Bills might be studied by the
Department of Insurance and the AttorneyGeneral. Having studied them as they take
final form in the Parliament of Canada, they
will be governed by the results of that study
in the final form of their own legislation,
if it takes any final fora at all. I have been
advised as well that a similar Bill, with a
similar clause, was introduced in Quebec, and
I feel certain I have been advised that another
one was introduced in the Legislature of
Saskatchewan. Such is the present state of
affairs.
The honourable senator also asked me if
I had had conferences with the Department
of the Attorney-General of Quebec. I certainly have had, and I expect to have another
to-morrow. I have had many conferences
and heard many opinions, and have had impressed upon me as never before in my long
life how widely and how violently lawyers
differ.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In expressing a
wish for a copy of the recent decision I was
not voicing my own desire alone, for I have
heard several honourable members say that
they would very much like to be able te
read that decision. If it had been reported
it would have been available to me, at all
events, but I am not sure whether all other
senators would know where te find it. I think
that the decision should be made available,
if for no other reason than to satisfy curiosity.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
QUESTION

0F

PRIVILEGE

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
as a matter of privilege, I wish to call to the
attention of the House an article which appeared in the Montreal Gazette of March 19.
I desire to quote the article, because I consider the Gazette is one of the most important
and best informed papers in the country. It
says:

on Hydro's signature of the agreenment with
Mr.
Beauharnois for a blocki of power.
Ferguson's evidence is likely to complete the
testimony to be taken by the committee, which
will iinmediately proceed to draft a report for
presentation to the Senate as a whole.
1 should like to ask-I suppose the question should be directed to the right honourable
leader of the House-whether it is the intention of the Senate so to enlarge the reference
made to the special committee appointed to
inquire into the Beauharnois matter as to
empower that committee to take the evidence
of Mr. Ferguson on a matter concerning the
Ontario Hydro-Electrie Power Commission, a
purely provincial affair. I do flot want to
infringe on the rules of the House in this
inquiry, and I trust that if I go too far my
right honourabie frîend xviii correct me; but
I should like to know whether it is the intention that the committee shouid have power
to inquire into a matter which did flot corne
within the reference. I need not go into the
question further at this time, for it can be
discussed later, but I should also like to know,
if the powers of the committee are to be
enlarged, whether a full investigation will be
made into the particular contract about which
Mr. Ferguson is expected to 8peak.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I have no information of any intention to eniarge the scope of the committee,
or of any doubt on the part of the committee
as to the powers that it has.

Before tbe Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
bel ore the Orders off the Day are called 1
should like permission to make a slight
correction in Hansard, in the report of my
remarks off Marchi 16. As I ief.t Ottawa on
the l7tbh, this is the first opportunity I have
had off referring to the motter. At about the
49th line off page 113 off the Debates I arn
quoted as saying "in one week in June last

that w-as franked. I do not write my speeches,
as can readily be observed fromn the poor
marner in wvhich tbey are delivered, but I

text, as far as I know. is quite correct.
Whii'e I arn on miy feet may I say for the

Further that a eopy off the said treaty be

Hon. J. P. B. CASORAIN:
Honourable
gentlemen, the honourable senator from
Hon. NIr. HARDY.

Prince Edward (Hon. Mr. Horsey) was good
enougb to move the adjournrnent off tbis
debate so that I migbt have an opportunity
to get together some notes, and, unless some
other honourable gentleman desires to speak
at this time, as proposer off the motion I
shall avail myseif off the right and privilege
off closing the debato.
My flrst words must be addressed to the
rigbit bonourable the leader off the Government in this Huse, wbo said that I was
labouring under a series off misapprehiensions.
I have look-ed up tbe definition off the word
Ilmisa pp rehension'" in the new Oxford Dictionary, and it would seem to indicato that tbe
right honourable gentleman meant tînt I
did not know wbat I was talking about. I
may say that I have neyer flirted with MissApprebension. Iff anybody bas done that, it
must bave been the right bonourable gentleman himself, because, forsootb, lie is muchi
younger thon I amn, and much more propossessing, and such conduet would be more
becoming at bis age tban at mine.
It is very difficult ffor a plain, common,
everyday land surveyor to argue witlh a
gentleman w-ho wos regarded by the lato Sir
W\ýilffrid Laurier as one off the most astute
lawyers in Canada,
but wve bave been
oppointed to do our best, and one must
bave courage and do the best one can. When
I rcod the rigbt honourable gentleman's speech
carefully I found that hoe was more guilty
than I w-as off flirting with Miss-Apprehension.
While it takes courage to differ wvithi a logal
gentleman like my right honourable ffriond,
there is one thing off whicb 1 can assure him:
thougb hoe may bave more legal ligbt than
I have, hoe cannot be more sincere. I say
now, as I have said before, that I bave nover
mode a statemont to this House that I did not
helieve to be absolutely true. While many
a timo I may bave been alone in my opinion,
I bave always thought I was right.
Notwitbstanding the foot that the rigbt
honourable gentleman bas a tremendous
advantage over mo-for hoe bas at bis ddsposal
a galaxy off vol-y able engineers w-ho are
developing and operating one off the biggest
hydro-electrie systems in the w-orld, and I
have but feeble means at my command-I
ask him as a personal favour to bave the best
off those engineers point out in the statement
that I made before this bouse the other day,
or that I shall make beffore it to-day, when
I shaîl take care to give my authoî-ities, any
misapprobension off the facts. The Ontario
Hydro-Eloctrie System is a vory great organization, having behind it the cedit off the
banner province off the Dominion, the groat
province off Ontario. Surely I am not asking

MARCH 30, 1932
too mucb of its engineers, wbose vocation
keeps them in touch with matters of this
kind from the lst of January to the 3lst
of December. If I think they are right, I
shall how most humbly to their decision. The
speech that I made the other day was largely
a repetition of one that I made in this
bonourable House seven years ago; so there
has been plenty of opportunity for anyone to
find mistakes in it, if there are any. As yet,
so far as I arn aware, nobody bas done 80.
So that there may be no slip in answering
the right honourable gentleman, I have taken
the trouble to put my remarks in writing.
With ahl due respect to the right honourable
gentleman, I may say that the public would
be well advised to regard any sensational
statements hie makes in this House with the
saine consideration and indulgence which I
hope the members themselves will show; for
we must remember that the rigbt honourable
gentleman is used to a House in wbich
political battles are waged, rather than to a
Chamber tbat exercises quasi-judicial functions
in the matter of public business, and has
therefore to be fully informed upon the questions that corne before it. Doubtless, after
the right bonourable gentleman bas been in
this buse for a number of years, he will
become possessed of conclusive knowledge on
many matters upon which haphazard guesses
are made in tbe Lower House, from wbich
hoe bas so newly graduated.
I must apologize to my honourable colleagues for taking up s0 much of the time
of the House, but bonourable gentlemen must
remernber that one wbo bas lived a longish
life feels--and perbaps witb reason-that
at another session, a year or so bence, hie
may flot have the strength or mental ability
or memory to speak, and that while hie is able
bie sbould give of bis best, so that tbe Bouse,
and tbrougb it the country, znay receive the
benefit of wbat bie has to say. Now I give
my authority, which is none other than the
grand old Book, the Bible, which one neyer
tires of reading, even tbough one read it only
because of its -literary value. 1 may say that
from tbis viewpoint the English version, which
is in the grand old language of Shakespeare,
is much better than the French version. But
I go back to sometbing even finer, the Latin
version.
Dies annorum nostrorum in ipais septuaginta
anni.

For the benefit of those who bave not the
advantage of understanding Latin I shail try
to give the exact rendering in English.

The days of our years are three-score years
and ten; and if by reason of strength they be
four-score years, yet is their strength labour aud
sorrow.
We are about to conclude a treaty. This
motion was made 80 that we niigbt have an
opportunity of looking over other treaties,
made not 80 very long ago. The Ottawa
Journal of December 12, 1931, gives an account
of the Alaska Boundary Award. In 1897 there
was, as ail honourable members of this Bouse
know, a gold rush to the Klondike, and our
good friends to the south of us, believing
that the gold mines in the Klondike mîght be
of a permanent nature, thought it would be
a good stroke of business to secure the trade.
They were reminded that they owned Alaska.
We all remember that in 1825 Great Britain
and Russia sîgned a treaty defining in a very
vague way tbe limits of Alaska, and that
many years afterwards, on the 3Oth of Marcb,
1867, barely tbree montbs before Confederation, tbe Secretary of State for the United
States, the Hon. W. H. Seward, purchased
for the United States aIl the Russian possessions in that part of the world for the suma
of r4,200,000. At the present time that territory has a population of about 50,000 people
of ahl shades and colours, Indians, what we
caîl Eskimos-mi reality they are not Eskimos,
altbough tbey have many of tbe characteristics of that people, wbo are to be found
farther to the east-Chinese, Japanese, and
80 onl. These people are not very prosperous,
because the land is rather barren.
In the biograpby of Sir Clifford Sif ton, by
J. W. Dafoe, there is a long description of
what took place bef.pre the Alaska Boundary
Award was ýqdç in 1903. In 1899 Great
Britain proposed the formation of a commission similar to the one wbicb acted in the
boundary dispute of Great Britaini with
Venezuela, 'but the United States of America
rcfused, notwithstanding the fact that Great
Britain bad got tbe worst of the bargain on
that occasion. In 1902 Great Britain proposed
the appointment of a commission of six
judges, two from Great Britain, two from
the United States, and two from outside:
cither of those countries or any of the British
Dominions. The United States again refused,
and finally, in January, 1903, proposed that
three impartial jurists of repute should be
appointed by the United States and tbree by
Great Britain and Canada. To that proposaI
Sir Wilfrid Laurier agreed, notwithstanding
the protest- of Sir Clifford Sifton. The tbiree
supposedly impartial juri.sts of repute selected
from the elite of public men in the Uni-ted
States to represent that country were Elihu
Root, who bad been Secretary of State, Cabot

142

SENATE

Lodge, and Senator Turner. At that tim2a
three men more in the public eye of the
United States could flot have been chosen.
They were supposed to lie the best men that
could be found, and to be impartial jurists.
But what happened? Those three men had
publicly expressed their opinions hefore they
were appointed. One decent, honest man,
John Hay-who, if my memory serves me, liad
been American Ambassador in London, and
knew the English -people-went to President
Roosevelt and protested against the appointments that were heing made. He used some
rather harsh language, whicli is reproduced in
the Ottawa Journal, but whicli I wiil not
repeat, because I do flot want to say anything
about a frienclly nation that might be irritating
to anyhody. W'ithin three weeks of taking the
oath of impartiality the three jurists I have
namoîl received direct instructions from
President Roosevelt that the Canadian dlaimn
was flot to ho open for dis.cussion.
Grcat Britain appointed Lord Alvcerstone,
then Chief Justice of England. and Canada
appointc(l Louis Jetté, then Licutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebcc. and for mor,than twent ' -five ycars a judge of the Superior
Court, ani the lato Chief Justice Armour of
the Supreine Court. The last namoed gentleman died suddenlY, anti Allen Aylesworth,
K.C., who wvos flot thon in political lifo, a man
who certainl 'v wvas an impartial jurist of repute. was appointed mn his place.

xvho was thon in England, and told haima to let
the British Governrnent know sornehow, prixatelv, that if no agreement wvas reached the
Unitedi States of America would seize the territorv, England or Canada nofwifhstanding.
The bluff worked. I arn sure that Sir Allen
Ayl-,-eswor-th. now an lionourable member of tbis
qeHouse, wvould conflrm everx' word I say if he
were here. Then the President of the United
States announced a great diplomatie victory,
the greatest diplomatie victory of our time. I
may say that the Ottawva Journal is much
more severe in its comments in regard to this
motter thon I amn.

ticular hurry-he said bluntly: "The St. Lawrence river is the outlet of the United States
to the Atlantic Ocean; Canoda's ouflet is
througli Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait."
It happened that a few weeks previously I
had made a speech in this Bouse against the
Hudson Bay route. I thouglit I was well
inforrned upon the subject, and, forgetting
that he ivas the President of the United States,
I cornmenced to tell haim about that route and
what I thouglit of hais suggestion. But Roosevelt was a big man and he wvas amused rather
than annoyed at rny audacity. He encouraged
me to keep on, and the discussion got quit e
hot. But we parted fthc best of friends.

Col. Hugh L. Cooper stated on oath
hefore Charles E. Hughes, Special Master
appointed by the United States Supreme
Court, that the Chicago diversion injures
navigation on the St. Lawrence to the extent
of $7,360,0OO yearly. He estimated that the
diversion was "causing an international hydro-

MARCH 30, 1932
electric Ioss to New England and nearby
States of $134,000,000," and considered that
the withdrawal of 10,000 cubic feet of water
per second would resuit in an annual loss of
300,000 horse-power at Niagara Falls.
In
order that there may be no misunderstanding,
I will read a short despatch from Washington:
Chicago Diversion Causes Big Loss--Injures
Navigation to Extent of $7,360,000 Annually,
Says Col. Cooper
Washington, December 26.-The Supreme
Court lake diversion hearing was resumed to-day
with one witness, who, qualified as an expert,
estimated that withdrawal of water from Lake
Michigan by the Chicago Sanitary District was
causing an international hydro-electric loss to
New England and nearby States of $134,000,000.
Col. Hugli L. Cooper, an electrical engineer
of Stamford, Conn., was the witness who presented this and a series of other estimates that
ran into the millions, to Charles E. Hughes,
special master appointed by the court.
Counsel for the Sanitary District and States
supporting it in its diversion programn opposed
the indication of Cooper's testimony, contending
it was speculative. Arguments wiill be heard
to-morrow by Mr. Hughes as to whether the
testimony shall stand.
Cooper aiso estimated that the diversion at
Chicago was injuring navigation to the extent
of $7,360,000 a year, as a resuit of a lowering
of the levels of the Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence river. New Eng]and alone has an
innual ash pile waste of $35,000,000, hie insisted,
bacause it is deprived of its share of the St.
Lawrence's hydro-alectric potentiality, as are
the entire State of New York and parts of
Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Colonel Cooper estimated that withdrawal of
10,000 cubic feet of water per second at Chicago
would represent an~ annual loss of 300,000 horsepower at Niagara Falis. This, hae testified,
would represent a $9,000,000 loss yearly.
Now w-e corne to another point, which may
be of more practical interest. We aIl remember that in October, 1927, the Conservative
Party held in Winnipeg a great and magnificent convention, of which there were two very
distinguished chairmen, the Hon. Mr. Rhodes,
now Minister of Finance for Canada, and the
honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien). 1 ask the honourable senator t0 listeni while I read a resolution passed
at that convention, and hae can sea whether
I have the exact wording:
This convention is of the opinion that the
St. Lawrence canal system, as an ali-Canadian
project, should be developed in the national
interest and when conditions warrant.
Amen. I agree with that absolutely. But
at the present moment conditions certainly
do not warrant the development. Is the
resolution that I read correct, according to
the memory of the honourable senator from
Montarville? Ha was one of the chairmen,
and hae must have heard what took place.

141«

The honourable gentleman remains silent. As
we say in French, "Qui ne dit mot consent."
He admits it.
I should like to ask the honourable senator
another question:
Why repudiate that
policy? Stili no answer.
Hon. Mr. BEATJBIEN: Will the honourable gentleman allow me to put a question
to him?
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Certainly, with
pleasure.
Hon. Mr. BEAURIEN: Would ha mind
going a little further and saying how that
policy was abandoned?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Ail right, 1 will
procaad with that answer. That convention
was in 1927. In 1930 there wus a Dominion
election, and the Conservative Party made
great gains in the Province of Quebec. There
had been a solid Quebec in 1921-the whole
sixty-five districts went Liberal-and in two
succeeding elections sixty-one districts voted
the same way and there were only four Tories.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They were
good onas, though.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
But this ailConadian policy resulted in great gains for
the Conservatives in my province, where, for
reasons of our own, we prefer to keep on our
sida of the fence and live in peace, minding
our own business and letting our good
neighbours to the south of us do the same
thing. We want to ha friendly with them,
and we know that for this reason it is hast
that we and thay should stay at home. In
that way quarrais are avoided.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: The honourable gentleman told us a few moments ago
of his visit to President Roosevelt.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, I did, but that
was only a social visit. Now, why repudiate
the policy as laid down at Winnipeg? That
was a good policy, I think. Is it the intention
of the present Government to make once
more a solid Quebec? I verily believe that if
any of our rights should ha ceded to the
American rapublîc, there would ha at the next
general election a repetition in Quebec of what
took place in 1921. Why commit political
suicide? There nead ha no hurry about that,
for a change will corne soon enough.
I have before me a newspapar item that
I should like f0 read. I thought at first it was
taken from the Montreal Gazette, that great
.paper we have heard about this afternoon,
but I notice it is from the Herald-and 1 arn
not with that paper now.

Sir,-In October, 1927, the Conservative
Party of Canada held a great convention in
Winnipeg ta choose a new leader and ta present
its policy ta, the Dominion. The choice happily

projct."Old
Reverting ta the Chicago water diversion,
may I point out that when the Cape Cod
Canal Bill was before the United States
Senate. Senatar MeKellar, Dernacrat from
Tennessee, and many other seniators af the
Mississippi Valley States, agreed ta support
the Bill if other senators would agree ta the
famous Chicago and Gulf ai Mexico canal.
A speciýal committee wvas appointed. Senator
Reed, Republican froin Pennsylvania, w-as the
only dissentient, and hie said that the withdrawal ai 10.000 cobic feet pier second from
Lake Michigan .by the Sanitary District af
Chicago was unjustified. But the other senatars insisted on a nine-foot navigation canal.
Majy I say here that that is the ideal depth,
because on sucb a canal one tug could tow
a large number ai barges-which do not cost
much-from Chicago down ta New Orleans
and the Gulf ai Mexico. The barges would
bring a camparatively small tannage back, as
the bulk ai the traffie is outward: for every
ten tons that go out from America, whether
ta Liverpool or other parts ai Europe. an
average ai only one ton cames back. Senator
McCormick, Republican irom Illinois, said
that this nine-foot canal would be a new
cheap route, right in the centre ai the nation;
s0 why bother about the small quantity ai
water diverted? That beautiful sheet of water
known as the American Faîl, which is not
partly bidden irom sight by nîist, as is the
Faîl an the Canadian side, bias a flow ai
1G,000 cuibie feet per second, about one-ninth
as much as ours, and exactly tbe quantity
Senator Mctbat Cbicago is withdrawing.
Cormnick said there would be compensating
works. However, tbey wauld not bring tbe
water back inta the St. Lawrence. Every drap
ai water that is diverted is lost ta us for ever.
Han. Mr. CASGRAIN.

We might get a certain amiount of compensation out af our own property; Sa those
compensating works would be simply paying
The late
back with our own money.
Senator Reid, of Prescott, explained that perfectly in a long speech in this House.
Senator McCormick, of Chicago, actually
said that the Chicago sewerage system xvas
t eindmrlfoswra
it wvas connot dsgemrlyfreeage;
structed as a link irom Cairo ta Grai ton, and
up the Illinois ta Itica, and ail that was
needed was the removal oi a few bars, dredging ta a depth af about two feet, and the
rernoval of four dams on the Illinois river
below Utica; then there ivould be an adequate
flowv ai water from Lake Michigan dowvn ta
the Mississippi. He actually added that the
present flow, 10,000 feet in dry weather, increased the water in the Mississippi by onethird. Needless ta say, it is more than double
the natural flow ai the Illinois river.
He also said that it would flot contravene
the treaty between the United States of
America and Canada in regard ta the Great
Lakes. That was tbe treaty ta whicha I
alluded when 1 made my speech, and about
whicb my right honourable friend said I was
under a misapprehension.
The report intimates that nine-fooýt navi-ation would cast only $5,000,000, and its
'maintenance 8152,550. It wauld be operated
ail the year round, and il would be worth
$100,000,000 yearly ta Chicago. Now, honourable' gentlemen, let us be candid. I believe
that aiter the Sanitary District of Chicago
and the State ai Illinois have spent 8130,000,000 on it the diversion will neyer be stopped,
and we might just as well give up as a bad
job the attempt ta obtain compensation for
the water that bas been diverted. But in the
future let us be careful about making contracts.
We bear so mucb about water-ýpower that it
rnay be wort-h while ta quate the opinion ai
a scientifie journal. Take every drop oi water
that faîls in the United States, between the
very top oi the Rockies and either the
Atlantic or the Pacifie ocean: if every drap
were caught, the entire quantity would not
generate nearly as much power as is generated
to-day by coal in -the United States.
There is another diversion tliat no one ever
talks about. The Cbicago river and the
Calumet river used ta bring water ta Lake
Michigan. No account bas ever been taken
oi the water that was there. Those rivers
were feeders ta Lake Michigan. Now bath the
Calumet and the Chicago are raceways, taking
water away from where it belongs.
I think the right honourable gentleman who
leads this Huse spoke somewhat lightly

MARCH 30, 1932
about the diversion. If those people are
allowed ta take a certain quantity of water,
wbat is ta prevent themn from. taking double
or treble that quantity and thus absolutely
spoiling navigation for ships in the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: I tbink I
should say, honourable gentlemen, that at no
stage of my remarks did I say that tbey
sbould be allowed ta take any quantity.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No. The right
honourable gentlemen is quite right; he did
not say they had any rigbt ta take any. But
I think be said they were taking only six
thousand and some odd feet. I thought I had
the hanaurable gentleman's speech here, but
I cannot find it.
Now, I have the figures relating ta Cbicaga's
water diversion as compared with the American
Falls. Chicago is demanding the rigbt ta
divert 10,000 cubic feet per second. This
would be just about equal ta the total amount
of water going over the American Falls at
Niagara Falls. If the 10,000 cubic feet per
second of water that Chicago wants ta dive.rt
went its normal way tbrougb the Niagara and
St. Lawrence rivers, the usable head of 300
fret at Niagara river and 190 feet in the St.
Lawrence river wauld make it possible ta
develop aTound 500,000 horse-power. This
refers, you will note, ta the usable head. The
difference between the level of Lake Ontario
and that of the. harbour of Montreal is 225
feet, but there must be a certain allowance
made in calculating the usable head. Onetenth of the flow is 1,000 feet; therefore, if
you add three zeros ta 490, -the result is
490,000 horse-power. I hope my confreres in
the engineering profession will nat -be annoyed
with me for giving this calculation away. The
total cames .pretty close ta the 500,00 horsepower claimed by Mr. Samuel S. Weir. At
any rate, it is near enough for aur purpose.
This would be a continuous power. It is five
times the continuous power that ean be
gotten out of Muscle Shoals, in the United
States, .of which we ahl have heard. The coal
equivalent would be 4,500,000 tans yearly.
On August 1, 1931, Hon. Gilbert Betitman,
Attorney-General for Ohio, ladged a pratest,
stating:
At the present rate of construction, instead of
finishing in the eight years allotted by the
Supreme Court, it will take Chicago over eigbty
years. This whally inadequate progress made
raises a seriaus daubt of Chicago's good faith
in carrying out the decree of the Supreme Court
of the United States.
On January 2, 192, a convention between
the United States and Great Britain looking
toward the preservation of Niagara Falls as a
41767-10

145

scenic spectacle was signed hy the American
Minister and the Canadian Premier, and in
May, 1929, this convention was ratified by
the Dominion Parliament and at once referred
to the Senate of the United States. This
convention provided for the installation by
the present power users, without expense to
the public, of remedial works to redistribute
water sa as to insure at ail seasons unbroken
crest hunes on both the American and the
Canadian Falls; additional diversion, for
power use, during the winter or non-tourist
season, from October 1 to March 31 each year,
througb existing surplus power plants at a
daily diversion rate not to exceed 10,000 cubie
feet per second in the Province of Ontario,
and 10,000 cubic feet per second in the United
States.
On February 18, 1931, the Committee on
Foreign Affairs of the United States Senate
rejected the treaty. What was the good of
this House and the other House passing the
treaty? In British countries, when the Government makes a treaty it stands or falîs by
that. But it is not the same on the other side.
They take it if it suits them, and if it does
flot suit thern they reject it. We had a
striking instance of that wben Mr. Woodrow
Wilson forced the League of Nations on other
countries. They wanted ta have the United
States in witb them, but when he came back
home did the United States ratify bis treaty?
There was the head of a state 'who was looked
upon ns having as much power as the greatest
crowned head that Europe ever saw. When
be came into a hall where deliberations were
in progress everybody would rise. We know
that he put bis signature on the League
Covenant, but was it ratified by bis country?
There is a warning. If I had anything to
say in the matter of a treaty, the other party
would sign it first. The case was just like
that of a man agreeing ta buy property and
then having to go to bis wife to see whether
she would take it or not. Sa the treaty was
not ratified.
Then in the completion of treaties it becornes necessary to provide doles for shippers.
To charge such tolîs as would make the proposed canal self-sustaining would not permit
of any saving to shippers. If taîls are nat
charged, then the saving ta the shipper becornes a direct dole paid by the taxpayer.
The Federal Farm Board, Washington, D.C.,
Circular No. 2, November, 1930, says:
The American farmer should not in the future
look ta, the export market to dispose of hie
surplus, because he cannot continue ta compete
successfully with other countries in the production of this crop, and production ehould be
gradually adjusted downward until we reach a
domestic consumption basis.

SENATE

James J. Hill, that wonderful railway man,
said the samne thing just about twenty-two or
twenty-three years ago. R1e said that within
twenty-five years the big elevators on the
Atlantic coast would be empty because the
United States would have to grow wheat for
their own use, and that the export would be
done away with.
I thank you, honourable senators, for the
very kind attention you have given me.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable
gentlemen, as the seconder of this motion I
shouild like to make a few remarks. 1 was not
present when the motion wvas discussed, but
I noticed in the newspapers the remarks that
my right honourable leader made in reply to
the speeches on the motion.
I think the
newspapers reported the right honourable
gentleiman most inaccuratelv, and left a wrong
impression of bis speech on the country. The
inpression I gathered froru the newspapers
wvas that it was no concern of ours, legally,
whether or not the City of Chicago made any
diversion of water froru Lake Michigan. The
right honourable gentleman said this:
There is no treaty stipulation of anv kind
hetw cen Canada and tie 1nitedl States8 touiching
speciflcally the Clieago diversion or any other
diversion.
With that 1 entirely agree. I know of no
treaty wbich touches specifically the Chicago
or any particular diversion. 1 think, the right
honourable gentlemian îneant exaci lY %vhat h,
saîd. for hc i-s acuuýistoined to îîsin- exact
language. But I contend that. while nu treatv
deals specificall ' with anx- piiticul.ir diversion,
there is a treaty which deals with every
diversion that affects the levels of the international waters.
The treaty of 1909, if it
deals with anything, deals with every diversion. That is the opinion of the Supreme
Court of the United States, as quoted by
the right hon ourable gentleman; and I think
that the language of the right honourable
gentleman shows that he is of the same
opinion. I amn speaking now only bûcanue
while uising preeise langige he lias apparently
allowed the country to derive an imprecise
idea of wbat he meant, and it is of great
importance that the statements made by
leaders of this Parliament should be such as
cannot bo twisted to the advantage of people
who are contesting our rights.
International law is simîilar to municipal
law in regard to questions of the kind we are
discussing. It is a principle of municipal law
that no man shaîl use his property so as to
injure his neighbour's.
On my own lot 1
may not make an excavation that will cause
Hion.

Mr. CASORAIN.

my neighbour's land to cave in. I am liable
in the courts if I do that. On the same
principle, international law requires that no
nation shaîl act in its own interest in such a
way as to injure its neighbour. In municipal
lawv that priinciple applies to streams: no man
may divert water fromn a strearu to such an
extent as to affect the use of the w'ater by
bis neighbours downstream.
Simiilarly, no
nation may divert water froru an international
waterway to such an extent as to affect in.îuriously the navigation of that waterway
by a neighbouring nation. The Americans
contend that Lake Michigan is not an international waterway.
For the purposes of
argument we might admit that it is not, but
if I am right in my understanding of international law the Americans have no right to
draw into Lake Michigan water that will not
naturally flow there, and thus to cause a
lowering of the levels of international waters.
The diversion at Chicago causes a great
quantity of wvater to leave Lake Michigan and
flow dlowxn the Illinois river.
That withdrawal of water froru Lake Michigan causes
a greater drain uipon the international waters
than wvould natiîrally take place, and constitutes a breach of international ]aw. B v
allowing it the Amiericans are doing us an
injustice. As observers of international law,
tbey are in honour bound to prevent the
diversion.
Further, the treaty of 1909 provides that no
diversions shiaîl be made from international
wvaters bLv eithier si(le without the sanction
of the International Joint Commission. Those
are the words of the United States Supreme
Court in its interpretation of the treaty, and
they are as plain as anything can be.
In seconding thîis motion I desire to find
out whether the American Government is
allowing a diversion which causes a lowvering
of international waters. Does the Aruerican
Governmnent dlaim that it bas a right to do
that, or that in so doing thiere is no breach
of anv treaty or no violation of intc-rnational
l aw ? I want to caîl attention to that point,
and I shouild like to learn what oui' Governruent knows about it.
AIl I want to add is this. Wý7hen I said that
an ar-rangement ruade between Canada and
the United States was flot a treaty, I forgot
for the moment-and it bas been drawn to
mv attention hy a distinguished member of
this House-that there is no power nor authori tY in the Canadian Government nor in the
Canadian Parliament to make any treaty with
the UTnited States. If we did make wbat purportecl to ho such a treaty, it would flot be
worth the paper on wvhieh it was written.

MAIRCH 30, 1932
Any treaty wit-h the United States must be
made by His Britannie Majesty. The British
North America Act specifically provides, in
section 132:
The Parlýiament and Government of Canada
shail have ail powers necessary or proper for
or any
performing the obligations of Canada Empire
Province thereof, as part of the British
towards foreig cutris arising under treaties
between the Empire and such foreign countries.
That is the power that is given to this Parliament under our written constitution-to
carry out treaties en.tered into by His Majesty
and confirmed by the British House of
Commons.
In modern practice ail treaties made for the
Empire are confirmed by the British House
of Gommons. The honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) shakes lis head. 1
rememrber reading a history of treaty-making
in the nineteenth century, written by a very
erudite member of the House of Gommons,
in which it was laid down that, although in
ancient times the Government made treaties,
under the modern practice-and practice is the
only thing that makes any law under the
British constitution, which is a constitution of
precedent-any treaty must be confirmed by
the House of Commons. If the modemn practice is to be adopted, then any treaty made
with the United States regarding these waters
must be confirmed by the House of Commons.
At least, I find no power given to us, and
no authority who bas ever asserted that t-his
country has the power to make treaties
independently of the Empire. This is very
fortunate for us. I consider that ail arrangements made between us and the United States
are mere conventions. 1 think that the City
of Ottawa could make a bargain with the
United States, or with anybody in the United
States, which would be just as binding as a
bargain made by this Parliament. The rights
of this Parliament are limited by the British
North Amnerica Act just as those of the City
of Ottawa are limited by the Municipal Act.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it had not been mny intention to
participate in this debate, because I feit that
there were -members in this Chamber who
possessed a greater technical knowledge of the
subject than I do. I would, however, draw
the attention of this Chamber to a telegram
that reached -the press of Canada on the 25th
of March, which 1 clipped from the Montreal
Gazette of that date. It reads:
Chicago, March 25.-The last link in a
$120,000,000 waterway te carry freîght f romn the
Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico is nearing
completion.
The United States army engineering corps
of -the Chicago district, in charge of the work,
41767-10&

147

prediets the project will be bujît by next
October 15, six months earlier than was
expected. An unusualldy mild winter is credited
with speeding up the work to, make earlier
completion possible.
When completed, the engineers pointed out,
the Illinois w.aterway will place thousands of
United States xnid-west shippers on a par with
eastern shippers so far as getting theiýr goods
to the Panama Canal je concerned. From Lake
Michigan barges widl travel down the Chicago
drainage canal to Lockport, from Lockport
through the waterway to Utica, Illinois, and
from Utica down the Illinois River to enter
the Mississippi at Grafton, Illinois.
A nine-foot channel thus wil1 be available
froin Chicago to New Orleans, where freight
can be loaded from the barges to ocean-going
vessels for distribution.
This refers, I presume, to the cornpletion of
the work which bas been under discussion in
this Chamýber.
What interests. me is this. I note that the
dccree of the United States Supreme Court,
dated April 21, 1930, provides, first:
On and after July 1, 1930, the abstraction
&hall net be in exces of an annual average of
6,500 cubie feet per second, in addition to
domestic pumpage.

I understood from the statement of my right
honouraýble friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
tha-t the semi-annual report of the Sanitary
District of Chicago, dated January 1, 1932,
indicated that the average diversion in the
year 1931 was 6,495 -second feet, thius corning
within the limits set by the Supreme Court
decree. I should like to know 'how mucli
water is aotually needed to maintain this ninefoot channel on which an expenditure of
$120.000,000 has been made. la it likely that
the decree dcclaring that on and after December 31, 1935, the abstraction shail nat exceed
an annual average of 5,000 cubic feet per
second -will be obeyed, or that after Diecember 31, 1938, the abstraction will flot be in
excess of an annual average of 1,500 cu'bic
feet per second, in addition to domestie
pumipage? If there is any doubt about the
State of Illinois or the City of Chicago obeying
this decree, thereby, perhaps, endangering this
nine-foot, channel, would it flot be advisable
for the Canadian Government to try to obtain
from the Washington authorities, in any agreement, convention or treaty which may be
entered into, a statement that the decree will
be obeyed? Canada has no direct communication with any State of the Union; it can
only take u.p a matter and discuss it with the
federal authorities. It seems to me that now
is the proper time to secure a statement from
the authorities at Washington that they will
see to it that this decree is obeyed.
My honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) thinks that there can be

148

SENATE

no treaty between Canada and the United
States, inasmuch as a treaty must be signed
by His Britannic Mai esty. I suppose there is
no one in this Chamber who will controvert
the statement that a treaty with any foreign
country must ho entered into by is Britannic
Majesty. But Canada carnies on negotiations
with the United States and cornes to an agreement; she then obtains credentials from His
Britannjc Mai esty, who delegates power to a
Canadian Minister to represent himi and sign
the treaty. It is His Britannic Majesty who
signs the treaty. Invariably treaties concerning the British Empire as represented by Great
Britain, the North of Ireland and the other
possessions, apart frorn the Dominions, which.
have their own entity, are signed by is Bnitannie Majesty through an accredited representative. There is no difficuity in the way
to prevent Canada fromn entering into treaty
neg-otiations with the United States and carrying them to, the point where the treaty is
signed by a duly appointed representative of
His Britannie Majesty. That has been dono
more than once in the last ten years, and it
wvill be donc again.
My honourable friend is under the impression that ail treaties signed by lis Britannic
Majesty niust be sanctioned by the British
Parliament. Although some treaties have been
sanctione(l by the H)use of Commons in Great
Britain, I do not think that has beon the general rule. I remember one such instance, the
Treaty of Peace, signed at Versailles, with
which my right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) is familiar. When the Prime
Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, presented that
treaty to the buse of Commons, he said that
there was no obligation on the part of His
Majesty to submit it, but as the treaty Ivas
of such very great importance he feit that an
exception should ho made.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Although
it bas always been stated that is Majesty
has the right te make treaties without submitting them f0 Parliament, is if not thle
modern practice, while reserving that righit
irî theory, te, submît ail treaties to the House
of Commons?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I cou]d not
answer that question off-hiand. Perhaps my
righit honourable friend can do so. I should
be inclined to answer in the negative.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH STAUNTON:

I under-

stood that that was the law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
scqators, I had intended t0 rise after the
address of the honourable seniator froma
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lvneýh-Statunton), even
though the pointed question of the henourHon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

able gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) had not been put. As the niind of
the House is now directed to that question,
I might give my own interpretation of the
practice that bas gýrown up over these years.
In Great Britain at ai events, admeet frorn

time immernorial, it bas heen the prerogative
of is Majesty to make treaties with f oreign
states, the execution of which is the right of
is Majesty alonc. So f ar as my recoliection
goos, the first treaty to be submitted te
Parliament, was the Treaty of Peace. On that
point I arn by ne means certain. I arn qite
certain, however, that since that occasion the
practice bas grown up, in Great Britain, of
submitting to the Huse of Commons ail
treaties of importance; indeed one might say
ail] treaties, bearing in mmnd that under our
modemn method certain conventions do net
quite reaoh the stature of treaties. I understand the praotice bas net been extended te
the point of subrnitting the ame treaties te
the House of Lords. I accernpany that statemenât by the subordinate one that even as yet
thpre has net been evolved a practice of submitting te the British Huse cf Commons
covenants of a certain class, not u.sually
callcd
treaties, though effective
between
Great Britain and other countries. So far
as I knew, if is the practice net te submit
them, nor even the more important covenants known as treaties. te the House cf Lords.
In Canada, undoubtodly, as the honounable
senatoT frorn Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStau-nton) says, it is one of the preregatives
cf His Mai esty, a constituent part of the
Parliament cf this country, te make and
exocuto ail treaties. H1e does se in relation te
Canada on the advice cf the Canadian Privy
Council, and authorizes bis signature through
a Canadian. For many years these treaties
have been submitted not only te the Hue
of Commons but te the Sonate; that is te
say, te both reprosentative branches cf Pa>rliament, tho third branch being
is Majesty
himself. This practico bas grown up over a
number cf yoars, and bas been confirmed in
recent years by a nosolution passed in th-3
Commons. I think if was passod aise in tbe
Sonate, theugh of this I arn net certain. That
rcsolu'tion puts into specific form the practice
that bas grown up, and virtnaliy makes it
ebligatory tha.t henceferth ail treaties that
bind Canada shahl first ho ratified by beth
bouses of Parliamont.
1 should liko te make a brief reference te
the remarks of the heneurable senator frem
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
He
inuuired wvhether the limitation p]aced upon
the diversion by the Supreme Court of the
United States would Ieave sufficient water fer

MARCH 30, 1932
the purpose of the nine-foot canal. I cannot
answer that, but in so far as the order is
effective the requirements of the canal would
nlot be relevant. I say in so far as the order
is effective, for the reason that at present
Canada bas no status in making it effective.
The Supreme Court has its own methods, but
Canada is not and cannot be at the bar of
that court. The order is there, and I know
of no way in which Canada would be placed
in a position to utilize the order as an effective instrument, unless the United States itself made the enforcement of the order a
part of its treaty obligations to this country.
T-hen the United States, irrespective of the
aspirations of indivîdual States, would have
j urisdiction complete and undisputed in the
premises, and Canada would have a contractual right internationally to caîl for the
complete execution of that decree. Undoubtedly it would be of very practical value
to this country to carry out, if possible, the
suggestion of the honourable senator, but I
ani almost tempted ta refer him to bis colleague to the right (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), who
has warned us in solemn tones this af.ternoon
that we must make no more treaties with the
United States. If bis injunction is to be
obeyed, of course we neyer can get into that
position with relation to the decree on the
Chicago diversion.
I wish to express gratitude to the honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton), who referred to the remarks
made by me the last time I spoke on this
subject. I did not read the newspaper reports.
I regret that they gave an incorrect account
of what I said. I did read the report in the
Debates of this House, and it was correct. I
am grateful for the opportunity to confirmn
those words as having the intent and meaning
interpreted by the honourable senator. Furthermore, I am in complete accord with bis
definition and exposition of international law,
and I arn unable to see how a country could
offer any valid reason for departure from the
principles which hie outlined. Later in bis
address, however, there was a statement with
which I feit I could not quite agree; but that
bas already been covered by my comment on
the remarks of the honourable senator from
De Lorimier.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable senators, with the permission of my seconder and
the leave of the House, I withdraw my
motion. My ob;ect was to bave a discussion
of this matter. "Fools rush in where angels
fear to tread." Now that honoura-ble mesnbers of the legal profession bave discussed
the ratification of treaties, may I add a further

149

opinion? The right honourable gentleman will
remembeT the Lausanne Treaty?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He will remember
that in another place the then Prime Minister
said hie would have nothing to do with it;
that he haed not been invited to take part in
,the affair. If the right honourable gentleman
will think a minute hie will remember.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not enlightened yet.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Just as a matter
of curiosity, I wrote to the Right Hon. Mr.
Lloyd George.
He is not

always a safe adviser.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Did hie reply?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the honourable
gentleman will hold his peace I shaîl tell
him. Mr. Lloyd George, in bis reply, gave
it as his opinion that when the King signed
the treaty it was completed, because His
Majesty acted on the advice of the Government of the day. Mr. Lloyd George said
aiso, that hie did not want to express an
opinion concerning colonial or dominion
matters, because that might look like interference, but bie suggested that if we in Canada did not think the King's signature was
final we could proceed to make a treaty of
peace with Turkey. Now here we are in the
terrible position that we do not know whether
we are at war with Turkey or not. If Mr.
King is right, we are at war with that country, and the poor Turks do not know anything
about it.
The motion was withdrawn.
DEPARTMENT 0F INSURANCE BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READINO-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second reading of Bill El, an Act respecting
the Department of Insurance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: While the right
honourable gentleman is on bis feet, can hie
inform the Senate whether hie has made any
progress in the dralting of the t-hird Bill, whieh
deals with Canadian insurance companies?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I am
very glad to say that we have made quite
satisfactory progress, and 1 hope to be able
ta introduce the third and last Bill in the
early part of next week, if not on Friday.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Would tbe right hionoura!ble leader of the House postpone this

150

SENATE

matter until to-morrow? I have not yet had
an opportunity of examining the new Insurance Bills.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the debate was adjourned.
THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
ANSWER TO INQUIRY
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen, I wish to refer to an inquiry of
which the honourable senator from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) gave notice shortly after
the opening of the House. I think the inquiry is out of order, as appertaining to a
committee, and will be out of order until the
committee reports. But I wish to waive the
point of order, and to oblige the honourable
senator still further by answering the questions now. The first question is:
1. Whether the Senate will so enlarge the
reference-I presume the question means whether the
leader of the Senate, or the Government he
represents, will recommend that the Senate
will so enlarge-whether the Senate will so enlarge the reference to the special committee of the Senate
appointed to consider the report of the special
conmittee of the House of Commons of the last
session, to investigate the Beauharnois Project,
in so far as said report is related to any honourable members of the Senate, for the purpose
of empowering the special committee of the
Senate to take and hear the, or any of the,
evidence of the Hon. Howard Ferguson in connection with or relating to a certain contract
made hetween the Hydro-Electric Commission
or the Government of the Province of Ontario
and the Beauharnois Company.
The question, honourable senators will note,
is apparently addressed to me, and asks me
what the Senate will do. I cannot assume
the responsibility of saying what the Senate
will do; but in so far as the Government
of which I am a member is concerned, I
answer the question as follows. It can only
be in the form of a recommendation or of
action in the Senate at the instance of the
Government.
1. Yes; if the committee reports it necessary to a complete inquiry as to any senators
affected, or in justice to any public man
whose honour is impugned in the course of
the evidence.
The second question is:
2. And if the said reference is so enlarged,
will the said special committee of the Senate
be empowered to make further investigations
into said ontract, and also investigate the
statements of the said Hon. Howard Ferguson?
2. Answered by No. 1.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

The third question is:
3. Did the chairman or any member of the
said committee of the Senate receive at any
time, directly or indirectly, any instruction,
request or communication from the Prime Minister of Canada asking for or suggesting that
the Hon. Howard Ferguson should be heard or
examined by or before the said committee?
3. The chairman of the committee advises
me that the answer is no.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: I move that
when the Senate adjourns to-day it stand adjourned until to-morrow at eight o'clock in
the evening.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I heard to-day that
the cheques for the payment of the Civil Service were required only for the l5th of April.
There is no likelihood of anything coming up
to the House. If there is no pressing business,
why should we not go home?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want to
answer the honourable gentleman with candour. There will be business, as is clear fron
the Order Paper and the adjournments made
to-day. So far as that is concerned, I would
not ask honourable senators to come back for
that alone, because one day's delay would not
do any injury; but I think it is importantand I know that honourable senators on all
hands will agree with mie-that with respect to

a special and urgent mcaure which has been
long delayed in the other House this Senate
would net care to be the cause of one hour's
further delay, but would want to be ready
to consider it immediately it is available for
us; and I do not know at what hour of what
day that Bill may be available.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill Fl, an Act respecting
Foreign Insurance Companies in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman whether persans
who are interested in these insurance Bills,
either for or against theni, wiii be heard when
the measures are hefore the Cammittee on
Banking and Commerce?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, the intention is that, inasrnuch as
the Bis have originateci ini this Bouse, the
Banking and Commerce Comnmittee of the
Senate shahl hear any parties who desire to be
heard in relation te the measures. In this
connection 1 express the hope that there wiii
not be very serious contention before the
committee, in view of the fact that in the
preparation of this Bill we have striven ta
get representations froin all parties conoerned.
Undoubtedly ail have been heard. It would
be too much to say that ail have been satisfieci, but, sa far as the several groups of conipanies are cancerneci, I arn happy indeed to
informn the House that I believe they are
substantiaily agreeci. There will be, however,
a number oýfamenciments submitted by myseif
before the comrnittee; amenciments which do
not go ta the root of the measure, but which
vie feel wiii improve the Bill by bringing it
more indisputably into conforniity with unI arn stili
doubteci Dominion jurisdiction.
not in a position ta say that the legai representatives of the two great provinces who
have taken a keen interest in the measures
are agreed that the Bis do flot in any way
transgress provincial jurisdiction, but I arn
now in a better position than I was twa
weeks ago ta, express the belief that their
doubts an the point are not as tharoughiy
fortifled as -they were, nor as likeiy ta succeed
'n theiT own mincis. 1 believe that the
measure is within aur powers, that it is not
likeiy ta be contested, andi that if it is contested it wiii successfuliy meet ail attack.
Are we ta

It wili, of course, have ta differentiate in certain respects as between companies with British and those with Dominion incorporation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wil! these BiLs
be taken up separately in the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, or dces the right
honourabie gentlemnan intend to suspend the
examination of the first two Bis so that the
third Bill may be brought before the committee andi ail three may be considereci together?
I suppose that certain general principles are
common to ail the Bis and might be debated
at the sanie tirne by those supporting or
opposing the measures.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 see the
point of the honourable senator. I 'think what
he has in mind is that any imsportant representations made to the committee may have
reference flot on.iy ta the Bi-I that is now
before us, but also to the BiL that is yet to
coume, and that consequently it 'night be weli
feor the com.miitee not -ta dispose cf this Bill
until the other -one ailso cornes before i.t. The
committee wiii have no difficuity in completing its consideration of -the first Bill, to which
second reading has already been given. I do
flot think there will be azny represenitation at
all as ta that. I shald, however, suggest to the
com.mittee that it give to those who desire to
ba 'heard an opportunity to make ropresenitatian-s in regard to both the present Bill and
the Bi-Il that is to corne.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does the terni

Right Bon. Mr. MEIIHýEN: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is a public
Bill?
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would it not be
proper to have the Bis go to C*ommittee of
the Whoie House first, and then send thern
to theComm:dttee on Ban-king a.nd Commerce?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot believe
that such has been the practice, or that it
would be good practice. We shall hear the
various opinions expressed before the Committee on Banking and Commerce, and then,
when the Bis return to the Bouse, they rnay
ha referred to the Committee of the Whçhe,
if it appears desirable, although that bas not
been the general practice in this Chamber.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD:

Honourabie gentlenow under considerof far-reaching sigenormous growth of

SENATE
the various classes of insurance and the
thousands of individuads and business concerns
they affect. The ramifications of insurance
extend into every household and business concern in the country, and without it the wheels
of industry would be stibled in a moment and
the domestice welfare of millions of people
would be seriously affected. As long as the
uncertainty of life and what is going to happen in the future endures, the business of
insurance in its varions classes will continue
to interest every man, woman and child in
the country, as well as every concern of
business.
In the carrying on of this gigantic business
which so affects the public generally, Governments have been obliged to take a hand by
way of supervision to prevent fraud and incompetency and to protect those who rely
upon insurance to implement contracts and
carry out plans for the future. The establishment of this supervision has apparently led
to legal confliets between Dominion and provincial authorities as to whether the Dominion
or the Province, or both, are the properly
constituted custodians of the responsibility
I have referred to.
To get a proper viewpoint of the question
now before us, it is necessary to go back
many years. The British North America Act
is the commencement of all things constitutional in Canada.
When the Fathers of
Confederation came to differentiate between
provincial and Dominion authority the matter
of insurance came up for consideration. When
that Act was being drafted, it was proposed
to give power to regulate insurance to the
central Government.
This proposal
was
defeated, presumably on the ground that
property and civil rights were being allocated
to the provinces. As a result no action was
taken and the subject of insurance is not
mentioned in the British North America Act.
Bothý provinces and Dominion proceeded to
exercise whatever jurisdiction they thought
they had, and Ontario established its Department of Insurance in 1879. Other provinces
followed later, and the Dominion Department
was establishied almost forthwith.
Had the framers of Confederation allocated
this business to one or other jurisdiction,
much trouble and conflict would have been
saved. The first clash was in 1881, as a result
of a lawsuit between private parties. Since
then the Governments have clashed and on
three occasions a Privy Council decision was
sought. The last decision was in 1931, and
perhaps it is only fair to say that on each
appeal the provinces were successful.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

As to the relative merits of provincial and
federal jurisdiction, I have no hesitation in
favouring a central authority vested in the
Dominion Government to cover the whole
Dominion. There are arguments, of course,
both ways. Provincial authorities claim the
law upheld them, and they will stick to their
provincial rights. If the principle of property
and civil rights is to endure, they claim they
should exercise control in all matters under
their jurisdiction, and not in some of them
only. Leading insurance men of the country
differ in their opinions. The General Manager of the Canada Life expressed his opinion
at the time the 1931 decision was given. As
reported in the Financial Post of October
31, 1931, it is in part as follows:
"We believe that it is much casier to operate
under one jurisdiction, but our experience in
the United States has also proved that it is
possible to operate successfully under a great
number of individual jurisdictions such as the
insurance commissioners in the United States,"
said A. N. Mitchell, General Manager of the
Canada Life Assurance Co.
Another opinion was expressed in the same
paper on the sane date by C. C. Ferguson,
General Manager of the Great West Life. It
is as follows:
This raises a very important question, namely,
wiether the peop'e of Canada prefer to have
their life insurance investmîents protected by

one central federal authority or whether they
would prefer to leave their case in the hands
of nine different provincial supervising units.

Attorney-General Price of Ontario justified
provincial

jurisdiction

by

referring

to

the

experience of the United States, when he said
in an interview in the Toronto Globe on
March 22, 1931:
In the United States this Government supervision has been exercised by the several States,
each of whicih has a Superintendent or Commissioner of Insurance.
Reciprocal agreements
between States have avoided most of the overlapping and duplication, so that most States use
the

same fornis of annuail

and other

returns,

co-operate in joint exaninations of conipanies,
and generally afford the insurance business
something in the nature of a "trial by jury."
This systeni has some obvious advantages for
all concerned. There is not. and never has been,
a Federal Department of Insurance in the
United States.
I believe a fair conclusion would be that
it would be far better to all concerned that a
federal central authority should be accorded
this jurisdiction, and if the legislation before
the House will accomplish that purpose to
the extent it proposes it should receive general support. But the great question is, Will
it? Will the legislation settle the question?Will the Provincial Governments, with three
Privy Council decisions at their belt, calmiy
give way to federal jurisdiction and be con-

MARCH 31, 1932
tent ta scrap their insurance departmnents, and
abandon the rights which have been secured
at the expense of years of wark, and enormous
sums in law casts, the litigatian resulting in
their favaur? They may do sa, but it does
not seem reasonable ta expeet.
The intention of the Bill under cbnsideration
is ta rectify, s0 far as the Government is
concerned, the deficiencies in the law as revealed in the variaus decisions of the Privy
Cauncil whereby the provinces were accorded
the rights they claiined, ta supervise and
contrai certain phases of insurance within the
provincial baundaries. The whale question is
sa invalved in Iaw that the average layman,
like myseif, will find difficulty in deciding
what it is ail about. There are certain features of the subject, however, that even a
layman can understand, and in seeking the
light we might first asic the question:
(a) Does the praposed Bill came in conflict
with the provincial authority in the light of
the various decisions of the Privy Council
which have gane in favour of the provinces?
Having answered that question, we might go
further and asic:
(b) In what way do the Dominion authorities propose ta get around such decisions
and maintain the supremacy of the Federal
Insurance Department?
As a preliminary ta consideration of the
proposed Bill, let us see what the leader of
the Government had ta say in intraducing it.
Bear in mmnd that the Bill is careful ta include anly ahien campanies, that is, comnpanies whose headquarters are autside of
Canada and the British Empire, and makes
no reference ta campanies arganized by provincial autharity. The right hanourable leader
gave us an indication of the stand the Government praposed ta take when hie said:
On the subject of alien companies, those
whose head office is in other lands, not Britisb,
we base aur jurisdiction upon the provision of
the British North America Act relating ta
aliens, a1so upan the provision relating te
bankruptcy and insohvency, and in part upon
the clause' relating to the regulation of trade
and commerce. In bankruptcy and insolvency
there is, of course, undoubted Dominion
authority under the terme of the Act; nor
eould there be any reason-able doubt of the
corollary that this authority extends so as ta
enable the Dominion Parliament ta define, in
relation ta any class of companies, what constitutes insolvency.
What the leader had in mmnd is further
empbasîzed by reference ta the Bill itself.
The preamble af the Bill is as follows-and
I invite the attention of honourable gentlemen
ta these words:
Whereas it bas been decided that the Parliament of Canada-

Note that what fallows is the carefully included phrase which appears in the decision
of the Privy Cauncil, and apparently it is
embodied in this law as suggested in that
decision.
-has jurisdiction by properly framed aegislation ta prohibit an insurance company incorporated by a foreign state from carrying on its
business in Canada without a licence, and
Whereas certain sections of The Insurance
Act, requiring foreign insurance companies ta
obtain a licence as a condition of carrying on
business in Canada, have been dechared, in view
of other provisions of the said Act, ta be not
properly framed as enactmnents within the hegislative competence of the Parliament of Canada,
and
Whereas it is coaitrary ta the public interest
that insurance companies ineorporated in foreign
states and irnincorporated associations and exchanges having their principal place of business
in foreign states, which are insovent or unable
ta discliarge their liabilities ta Canadian policyholders, shoald be permitted ta carry on the
business of insurance in Canada, and
Whereas certain of suob insurance compan-ies
and exchanges have become insolvent while
carryin on business in Canada, and tbe Canadian pol iclyhaiders thereof would have sustained
serious losses but for the provision in the then
existing legislation wbich required such comnpanies and exehanges ta deposit assets in Canada
as security for their liabilities in Canada, and
to make returns as ta their business and
financial standing, and ta submit ta inspection
by representatives of the Governmen.t, and
Wbereas it is desirable ta provide by a
system of registration, deposit of securities,
inspection and returns against Ides ta Canadian
policyblders by reason of such foreign coinpanies, associations or exchanges engaging in or
contînuing ta carry on business in Canada while
insolvent or unable ta diseharge their liabilities
ta suob policyliolders, and ta declare tbe conditions upon whicb sucb companies shahl be
deemed ta be insolvent and hiable ta be wound
up under the provisions of the Winding-Up Act.
Therefore. His Majesty, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate and House of
Conimons of Canada, enacts as follaws.
Bearing in mind the words of the right
hanourable leader, and at the saine time
reading the preaýmble af the Bill, we can conclude that the Goverument hcQpes ta avaid
oonflict with the provinces, as the Minister
intimated, by basing aur jurisdiction upon the
provision of the B.N.A. Act as regards
bankruptcy and insolvency, as well as trade
and commerce and the matter of aliens.
Now let us go a step further and consider
how well founded this position is in the light
of the hast decision of the Privy Council. We
must Temeinber there were several decisions
of the Privy Cauncil, whicb the Minister was
careful ta point out in introdueing the Bis
wben hie said:
On the suggestion ta produce the judgment of
the Privy Couneil delivered et the end of hast
year: wbile tbat judgment is of very great
importance, I do not tbink it would be well ta

SENATE

have it printed and distributed to the committee as itself reflective of the state of the
law at the present time. There are previous
judgients bearing on the sanie subject, some
of which. I aie compelled to say, are very hard
to reconcile with the 1.ast, and all of which are
just as authoritative as the last. There is no
superior voice in any decision because of date.
The decisions of 1916 and 1921 are of equal
importance. Consequently, if honourable gentleimen have an ambition to make of themselves
fine constitutional authorities, they will not be
able to tIo so by nerely perusing the last judgment; they will have to study many previous
oues, and they will have to try to draw from
the vhole of the collected verdicts something in
the nature of a consistent result. I do not say
it cannot be donc, but I do say it is very
difficult to do.
Puisuing the subject further, and having in
nmind the remarks of the right honourable
Minister, I have in my hands a copy of the
recent decision of the Privy Council as published in the Canadian Insurance Law Service
Bulletin at Toronto on November 2, 1931,
the judgment being given by Lord Dunedin.
In that decision he refers to the previous
judgient of 1916, and the following extract
fronm it:
To this question their Lordships' reply is that
in such a case it would he within the power of
the Parlianent of Canada-please

-by

note-

properly franed legislation-

-the words which are embodied in the preamble of this Bill-to impose such a restriction. It appears to
then that such a power is given by the heads
in section 91. which refer to the regulation of
trade and commerce and to aliens.
And also to the matter of bankruptcy, as
pointed out by the right honourable leader.
Here we have the inspiration for the Government's present Bill. It has brought down 'what
it considers to be "properly framed legislation"
-to use the words of the Privy Council decision-and it has based it on the power given
in section 91, which refers to the regulation
of trade and commerce, and aliens, and bankruptcy as well. Probably the idea, therefore,
is that. having followed that part of the
decision under the suggestion of the Privy
Council, the present Bill will stand good in any
conflict with the provinces later on.
There would appear to me, as a layman,
some doubt as to whether this will really
serve the purpose, according to the terms of
the decision.
The Privy Council itseif
raises the doubt in the last judgment, that
of 1931, where it gives consideration to the
extract I have just read from the 1916 judgment, and its comment on that extract is as
follows:
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

The case decided that a colourable use of the
Criminal Code could not serve to disguise the
real object of the legislation, viz., to dominate
the exercise of the business of insurance. And
in the saine way it was decided that to try
by a false definition to pray in aid section 95
of the British North America Act. which deals
with immigration, in order to control the business of insurance, was equally unavailing. What
bas got to bo considered is whether this is in
a true sense of the word alien legislation, and
that is what Lord Haldane meant by "properly
framed legislation."
Later on in the judgment the following statement is made:
But the sections here are not of that sort;
they do not deal with the position of an alien
as such; but under the guise of legislation as
to aliens they seek to intermeddle with the conduct of insurance business, a business which by
the first branch of the 1916 case bas been
declared to be exclusively subject to provincial
Their Lordships have, therefore. no
law.
hesitation in declaring that this is not "properly
framed" alien legislation.
And in ils concluding sentences it makes the
following reference:
Now as to the power of the Dominion Parliament to impose taxation there is no doubt. But
if the tax as imiposed is linked up with an
object which is illegal the tax for that purpose
iust fall. Section 16 clearly assumes that a
Dominion lience tus prosecute insurance bIsiiiess is a valid licence all over Canada and
carries with it the right to transact insurance
business. But it lias been already decided that
titis is not so: that a Dominion licence so far

It is really the
way.

I emphasize that last sentence. Now I ask
is the present Bill "really the sane old attempt
in another way"? If so, there is a probability
of further conflict with the provinces.
According to the Bill, a foreign company
will have to register with the Dominion
Department, take out a licence, get a certificate to do business, and deposit securities
with the Department to protect the assured.
This procedure is justified on the ground that

Dominion Parliament should extend to property and civil rights or be restricted in general
f0 matters affecting the whode of Canada. The
agreement was that each province should have
jurisdiction over property and civil rights. It
must be borne in mmid that insurance was
discussed and that it was specifically put under
the aufhorify of the provinces. I think the
present position is t.hat without an amendennt
to the British North Amerilca Act the provinces
cannot agree f0 transfer the control over insurance to the Dominion, and the Dominion
cannot pass legislation to govern the insurance
business.
So we are now to conisider, not
whefher wveshould have one legisiafive authorify over insurance instead of nine, but whether
we should have ten instead of nine. Everybody
agrees that the more authorities the sorrier, the
fewer the beffer.
The lafe8t judgmenf of the Privy Counicil
reviews and explains ail the previous decisions,
and dlcidces in favour of the provinces and
against~ the Dominion on ail the questions,
wvithout exception, that have heretofore been
raised. The Prisv Couincil is bound by this

same inîcrpretation of those decisions; iilil

It is also suggesfed in the judgment that
Parliament ma ' prescribe the conditions under
which aliens may enter and remnain in Canada.
\Ve may leg-isiafe that no alien shall come to
this country without a passport, or go from
place to plaee without a licence, or remnain here
unless hie reports f0, some designated officiai at
certain periods. And we have power to enact
thaf aliens shall not carry on business of any

power referred f0 cani be applied only in personamn. A federal licence, in so far as it

authorizes the opening of an insurance office,
is not worfh the paper it is written on.
Now, a Parliament should have respect for
the law and (the Privy Cou-ncil. I th-ink that
an endeavour f0 circumvenf, by hook or by
crook, the decision of our final court of appeal is net compatible with the dignity of the
Parliamenf of Canada. Their Lordships stated
in plain language thaf the Dominion legisialafion was in-sincere and improper, and a
prefence-"colourable" was the word used;
that in ifs eagerness to get control of the
insurance business, Parlýiament had inserted
in the Criminal Code certain clauses that are
colourable and not hinding on anyone; and
thaf the Dominion is not enfifled to take
away provincial rights, nor f0 burden the
people wifh another bureaucaey of red tape.
If, as I said before, we could do away with
the provincial insuraince deparfmerits and provincial confrol, then if would be a question
whefher if was in ftho public înferest f0 do
se; but îvhen aIl that we can do is f0 add
ano-ther deparfment to those alreidy exisfing
in this ovcr-governed country, I think if is
imnproper.
Now if is said that Parliament can ring iii
the Bankruptcy Acf. and this rerital says thaf
ir carn dw-clare xvhefher or not a man is insolvent. I disagree wif h that.
Under fie
]3ankrupfcv Acf if is for the courts to declare
îvhether ur n,,f a man is insolvent. Surely
wve are nof going to, take awav the jurisdictien of flhc courts in thaf mautter and confer
upon. some under-sfrapper in the Government
fthe right f0 say whefher or not one is insolvent. That is alfogether wrong. and fthe
whole Bankruptcy Acf is aimed againisf if.
The Bankrupf.cy Acf says that when certain
f hings happen an application shaîl he made
te the court, and fthe court may declare a
man hanknipf or solvent. If anybody thinks
thaf these insurance companies operafing in
this country, or any of fhem, are insoivent,
hc con go te the court. Cert.ainly, in my
humble opinion, it is quite wrong that hie
should have te go te a department, and thaf
t haf departmcnf should have the right te
declare whether or nef fthe companies are insolvenf.
The highest court in the Empire bas held
as follows, f0 quofe its own words:
It bas been already decided that this is not
se ; that a Domrinion licence so far as authorizing transactions of insurance business in a
province is concerned, is an idle piece of paper
conferring no rights which the party transacting
in accordance with provincial legisiation bas not
already got, if hie has eumplied with provincial

requirements. It is really the saine old attempt
in another way.

MARCH 31, 1932
To have the highest court in the Empire
reflect upon the Parliament of Canada in that
way is flot very fiattering. Surely Parliament
at least should stand to attention for the law,
and should not endeavour to circumvent it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, 1 should flot care to have this Bill
go to a vote on the second reading without
saying something anent the remarks of the
two honourable senators who have so incisively attacked the measure. My compliments are certainly due to the lay mind of
the senator from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird). I
compliment him on the success of his study
of law to date. Were it not that he is
eminently successful in other fields, I would
offer him the suggestion that he might pursue
this uine of endeavour further and make of
himself a distinguished ornament of the legal
The honourable senator from
profession.
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is of
course well known, and I am free to say that
he has seriously and effectively etudied this
question, as bas the honourable gentleman
from Regina. Both of them have got to the
kernel of the real issue, or about as close to
it as one can get, and I only lament the
fact that on a somewhat fine point they have
arrived at conclusions that differ fromn my
own.
A principle that we may just as well accept,
that we have to accept in this life, is that as
long as the reign of law prevails there must
be on ail great questions a line of division
between the right view and the wrong view.
In matters of jurisdiction as between the
federal and the provincial authorities that line
may be very fine, sometimes almost indiscerniýble, but it must be located. We have a
tribunal which is the court of last resort,
and we as parliamentarians ought to en~deavour to follow the findings of that tribunal
in ascertaining just where the line of division
lies.
The Bills that came before this House
previously had already been approved by the
Depart.ment of Justice, and very elaborate
arguments had been prepared ini that Department in support of the jurisdiction which
those Bills asserted. I came into this House
after the preparation of those Bisl had been
completed, and my attention was not drawn
to their provisions until there devolved upon
me, as leader of the Government ini this
House, the duty of introducing them. I then
made a study of the provisions of those
measures in the light of the devisions of the
Privy Couneil, being vastly assisted by the
memoranda of the Justice Department.
Having approached the subject from the same

157

standpoint as -the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton, and having been very much of hie
view before I ever saw the Bis, I was not
able to convince myseif that their provisions
could be defended, particularly in the faoe
of the last judgment of the Privy Council.
As a result of my study the matter was again
brought before the Administration, and authority was obtiained to have new measures
prepared which would be more definitely and
more clearly within the domain of the jurisdiction lef t with us.
I am not one of those who would contend
that we should seek out the very last area
that we can invade, and should arrogate jurisdiction to ourselves, for our own aggrandizement, at all costs. Much less should. I be ini
favour of any endeavour to, circumvent-to
use the word. of the honourable senator from
Hamilton-the judgment of the Privy Council.
Far below the dignity of this House would
it be to seek to circumvent a judgment of
the courts. I know that it is ini the mind of
the honourable senator from Hamilton, and
it may be in the minds of other senators too,
that that is just what we are doing. Perhaps
they wonder why it is that we are making an
attempt to pase insurance legislation in the
face of the sentence quoted. from the judgment by the senators who have just spoken. I
have spenýt a great deal of time on these
measures; I have been in consultation with
the legal representatives of Provincial Governments and of ail groups of insurance companies; I have heard from the lips of representatives of the provinces, but not, I think,
from other sources, the same arguments that
have been advanced by the honourable
senator; I have heard argued the reasons why
it is essential that we have an insiurance department and insurance supervision. Af ter it
al. I am convinced that we must have insurance legislation; that we could not, even
if we so desired, abandon the field; that if
we did, serious resuits would probably follow,
and that to do so would simply be an abnegation of responsibilities that we cannot avoid
and others cannot assume.
Honourable senators may be of the view
that I have taken upon myself a very considerable task in attempting to show that the
responsibility is ours, and that this Bill is
nothing more nor less than the discharge of
our responsibility ini relation to f oreiga companies. I cannot say that, had I been a
member of the Privy Counil-and anything
more inconceivable it would be hard to suggest-I would have given the hast judgment.
I cannot readily follow its reasoning in consonance with judgments previously rendered.

158

SENATE

Nevertheless it stands. WVe must accept it in
its setting among the several other judgrnents of the court, and must, as best we can,
roconcilc it with those other judgments.
Trhe honourable senator from Hamilton does
flot quote exactly tha pivotai judgment, or
rather the .iudgment which sets the standard
in insurance decisions. That this Parliament
bas jurisdiction as to aliens goes without saying. We have that jurisdiction, and we have
to exercise it. The responsibility rests on us.
It cannot ha on any other body. It suraly
neyer could ha argued that a province could
say that Chinesa migbt corne to Canada to
engage in a certain business within that provinca, or that Japanese might not. No one
would venture to think that such a matter
was within its powers. If it is not within the
powers of the province, it is within ours,
and we have to axarcise jurisdiction whether
wa wish to do so or flot. Jurisdiction in
alienage is ours. What the Privy Council says
is this: "You must not soeaxercise that jurisdiction as to make the real object of your
lagisiation the control of the business of insuranca." That is aIl. "If under the guise
of legislation cancerning aliens you anact
colourable lagisiation in which your real objeet
is te get into the business of insurance, which
is a ralationship batween a company and its
clients. wve wvill upset your so-called alien
legislation, because the business of insurance
cames within tha jurisdiction of the provincas. You must frame your alian lagislation
so that its only object is to cantrol alians; yeu
must not go ta the extent of interfering with
thair conduet of business, even if it is the
business of insurance." I shall not attempt
to repeat my interpretation of the verdict,
bacause I could net do it more to my own
satisfaction than it is done in the sentences
of the Haldana .iudgmant itsc If. 'Ne mnust not

bas a vary serieus responsibility.
Naw I pass ta anathar sphara, which undoubtcdly cames within the authority of the
Dominion, the sphera of bankruptcy and insolvency. It has been referrad ta by both the
honaurabla senator froma Regina (Hon. Mr.
Laird) and the honourale senator frorn
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton).
The
honourabla sanator from Hamilton said we
must net infer because wa hava jurisdiction
in bankruptcy and insolvency that we hava
jurisdliction in the matter of deflning bankruptey and insolvency.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Oh, no.
The right honaurable gentleman misuinderstands me. I say that we may de-fine it, *but
that wvamay net determine that a man comes
within the definitian. That is for the court.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable senator is wrong and wi]1 sea
the point in a moment.
Hon. Mr. LYNCII-STAUNTON: That i3
whmit 1 mneant ta say.
Pight Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I think that
iwhat the honourablo senatar said in his
spe-h. What hoe said, thon, is that the
juris<hîetion te define is a Dominion jurisdiction, but the only way the Dominion can
cxereise that jurisdiction is ta say what consfitutes insolvency, and it mnust ha left ta tha
courts ta decide whether insolvenc 'v is reached
or not . Again I take issue with the hanourable gentliman. We do net have ta say that
the Supreme Court of Ontario or the Supreme
Court of Canada shall decide. WVe cari
establish the Insurance Departmant as a court.
and say ta that Dapartmant, "Yau ara the
court ta decide." Sa long as xve are convinced that the jurisdiction is ours, then for
the purpose of this legislation the argu.mant
m-.closed. The jurisdictian in bankruptcy and
insolvancy is ours, and therafoe tha jurisdictien ta defina what constitutes bankruptcy
and inqolvency in any class ef casas is eurs
also. Thereafter thora may be a question
wvhether the regular courts shahl ha the
modiicii of interpretatian or net, but that the
authority is ours and net provincial is beyond
question. WVe hava exercised that authority
in the Wýinding-Up Act and the Bankruptcy
Act; wve hava declarad what shall canstitute
insolvency and what shail net; and a thousand
times more is it aur duty te exarcise authority
in the sphere of insurance companias, bacause
it is vary diflicuit ta tell whet'her or net an
insurance companly is in such a condition that

MARCH 31, 1932
it should be deemed solvent. That is a matter
of involved actuarial computation, and just
because it is a matter of involved actuarial
computation it is wise Vo have a specialized
department ruling in such cases. That is why
we have had an insurance department for
many years. Were we to abdicate our functions in this regard, if we could, and were the
provinces to assume Vhem, Vhey would do
what the hionourable senator says should noV
be done-they would have the matter decided by their insurance departments. Today, in the Province of Ontario, Mr. Foster
and bis department rule whether provincial
companies shaîl have a licence or flot. In so
doing they have actuaries computing whether
or noV such companies are to be deemed solvent for insurance purposes. Consequently,
once we assume, as we do, and as honourable
senators admit, that our jurisdiction extends
tc; the defining of insolvency and bankruptcy,
it is wise Vo have a special department for
the purpose of deciding in the matter. Therefore, because the responsibility in that sphere
is ours and cannot be evaded, it is our duty
to have an insurance department, and sa to
legislate in respect of bankruptey and insolvency as Vo determine that question
and adequately discharge that administrative
function. But, having determined that, we
must flot go on and transgress the line and
get into the conduct of the business of insurance, because such is a provincial responsibil-ity, even in relation Vo alien companies.
This carnies me to a point from. which I
could go farther into the argument, on the
subject of our jurisdiction in relation to trade
and commerce; but I will flot delay the House
now by'offering any observations on that score.
This legislation is animated, first, by a désire
to discharge responsibilities which we think we
cannot avoid, whieh provinces cannot assume,
and which, if abandoned by us, could only be
abandoned at great danger Vo the public of
this country. It is an effort, in the exercise
of our jurisdictian, to keep strictly within the
circle of our powers; an effort to keep away,
at all costs, from any invasion of the conduct of the business of insurance; an effort to
determine only the conditions on which aliens
shail be given licences to go into the business
of insurance, it being left to the provinces to
impose whatever regulations they desire with
respect to the conduct of that business. On
these principles this Bill ia founded, and. in
certain respects, where it appears to geV too
close to the border, or Vo transgress it, amendments will be offered in the committee. Any
clause of the Bill rho>uMl be defeated as to
which it cannot be shown that we are keeping
out of the jurisdiction into which we cannot

159

now assert our right to enter. But 1 th-ink that
ii honourable senators who have spoken will
give prolonged consideration to the question
they wiill not conclude that we can abandon
the field altogether. We cannot. There are
certain spheres that the provinces cannc,
cover.
Further, I think I can assure those honour.
able gentlemen that there is no disposition on
the part of the provinces-even those which
have introduced Biis on this subi ect-to say
that no jurisdiction is lef t to the Dominion.
There is rather a disposition to find ground
upon which they can stand, as distinguished
from. the ground on which we can stand, and
to avoid if possible further litigation on this
question. As I stated before, 1 have no
authority to assure the House that the provinces will refrain from'contesting the measure.
I had hoped to obtain that authority, and still
have hopes of obtaining it before we close the
discussion ini committee. But even though
that stage may flot be reached and the provincial authorîties may flot f eel that they can
give such an undertaking-perhaps it would
not be right of them to do so-I have far
greater hope that they will in their hearts feel
that we have made an honest effort to keep
withini the circle of our own powers, and that
they will not be disposed, unless forced, to
challenge the jurisdiction we here assume.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to ask a question?
It has heen stated, in the course of the debate,
that the Act defines bankruptcy or insolvency,
or creates a tribunal which may define bankruptcy or insolvency. Will my right honourable friend point out to me the provision
under which this may be declared by the
Minister or by the Superintendent? I have
looked throuRh the Act and cannot flnd anything to that effect.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There are
several clauses. 1 would sugirest that this be
left for the committee. I assure the honourable senator that I will, when in committee,
go very fully into the provisions which enable
the Department to declare when a company
is insolvent, and when not, and upon what
principles. It seems to me that that is the
sort of matter for the commîttee.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I do noV want to
enter into a controversy with my right honourable friend, but I have looked Vhrough the
Act, and the only section that seems to me
to c.ome near the creation of a -power to
define insolvency is section 54, and I fail to
see there any power conferred on the Minister or the Superintendent of Insurance to

160

SENATE

declare that an insurance company is bankrupt or insolvent. Ail that it providoe for is
that if the as.sets do flot exceed the liabiities
the certificate may be withdrawn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Look at
section 56.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that is flot
insolvency or bankruptcy. An insurance comnpany that has flot sufficient assets in Canada
to cover its liabilities may stili be quite
solvent. It may have sufficient assets in the
foreign country-the country from. which it
cornes. In so far as Canada is concerned, if
it is flot possessed of sufficient assets to meet
its liabilities, then the certificate is withdrawn;
but that does flot imply bankruptcy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator will hardly expeet these matters
to be arg-ued on the second reading, but will
hie permit me to suggest to him that it would
be equally unwvise to ask the Parliament of
Canada so to legisiate that a cornpany which
may have many millions, say in Russia, but
which bas only one dollar in Canada for one
hundred dollars of liability in Canada, mnust
still be deciared solvent?
Hon. M.r. BELCOURT:
I was not discussing that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The exercise
of jurisdiction on our part is unlimitoil. We

can say when it is insolvent for the purpose
of this country, and as long as we are legislating bona fide for that purpose it is for us
to say. In exercising our authority we can
say: "Your position in Canada must be s0
and so; otherwvise we shall de-ern you insolvent
and withdraw your licence."
Rigit. Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: For lack of
security.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHE'N: For iack of
securi ty.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understood that,
but 1 was not discussing it. I wanted to see
if there ivas in the Act any section defining
insoivency.

long debate, bas decided otherwise. The Bill
is a money bill and I think it would be inopportune, at least, even to discuss it at great
length here at the present time.
But may I be allowed to say that we have

the Senate in session should im.mediate and
urgent business be submitted to, us from the
other House. The other Huse bas net yet
reached the stage at which it can submit the
measure that is urgent, and in consequence
there is no business before us. When the
business will be before us I cannot say, nor,
on that point, can I get any information that
is dependable.
I was about to suggest that we xneet tomorrow-in that, I know, I should be enLirely in the bands of the bouse-but my
information is that, though this House had
agreed to, the measure, it would not be possible
to give it the Royal Assent then unless the
Commons also should meet to-merrow. Therefore I do not see very much value in making
the suggestion, and 1 merely move the adjeurnrnent of the Senate, knowing, of course,
that the resuit will be that we shall meet at
3 o'clock on Monday.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Is the right honourable
leader of the bouse aware that the bell in
the other Chamber is ringing at the present

BANKING AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE
NOTICE OF MOTION
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I give notice that on Monday next
I shall more that the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce have leave to sit
during the adjournment of the House.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: I should like to
call the attention of the right honourable
leader to the fact that the Banking and Commerce Committee has a large number of members and it may be difficult to keep many of
them here if the House is adjourned. I suggest that the Senate meet every day until the
committee has finished the pressing work that
it has to do. Then perhaps the Senate and
the committee could stand adjourned until
the House of Commons has concluded the
debate on the Budget, which may be brought
down on Tuesday next. Any honourable members who could not conveniently stay here for
the Senate sittings need not stay.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
had an opportunity of speaking to the honourable senator from Colchester since the last
development in the other House. It is anticipated that the Royal Assent will be given
about 4 o'clock on Monday next to the Bill
which we have just passed. I know of no
business sufficient to warrant me in inviting
the attendance of honourable members for
some days after that period, save such business
as is entrusted to the care of the Banking
and Commerce Committee. It has to consider some very important matters, and I feel
sure that large and probably various interests
will be represented before it on Wednesday
next, and that it will want the power to sit
during the remainder of the week, even
though the Senate may be adjourned. I do
not wish to make any definite commitment.
The honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will lead the House on
Monday next-I shall not be present on that

day-and I anticipate that he will then see
fit to move a substantial adjournment. But
it is important that the Committee on Banking and Commerce have leave to sit during
the week.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Another committee of some importance will be sitting next
week and I imagine that some of its members
would like to attend at the sittings of the
Banking and Commerce Committee also. I
am referring to a special committee, and I
leave the matter in the hands of its chairman.

OF

SPECIAL. COMMITTEE-MOTION

DROPPED
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS moved:
That the special committee appointed to
examine into the system of appointing judges
as at present existing, and to report upon the
necessity of taking some steps by which the
number of judges may be reduced, and the
system of appointments equalized, be authorized
to ait during the adjournment of the Senate.
He said: I may say, honourable members,
that the purpose in having a meeting is merely
to organize the committee. We are not seeking permission to hold any further sitting of
the committee during the adjournment of
the Senate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure
to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: No. I object to that.
The motion can be carried only by unanimous
consent. There is no particular hurry about
having this committee meet. An investigation
was to have been made into the number of
cases tried by judges, and we have not received information on that subject from the
Department of Justice. I fail to see why the
members of this committee should be kept

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There is no intention of asking honourable members to stay
here during the adj ournment. The committee
has had no meeting, and we want to get
organized, that is aIl. Therè will not be an
additional meeting of the committee during
the adjournment of the House.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: We could have the
organization meeting to-day, or on the day
the Senate resumes after the adj ourninent.

BANKING AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE
MOTION DROPPED

On the notice of motion:
By the Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:-

the week. I say it is not fair to give a notice
of motion of this kind and then drop it; it
should not be given if there is no intention of
proceeding with the matter. We who live at
a distance should receive a littie consideration. I for one object to the procedure that
bas heen followed in this instance. Let us
adopt some system whereby there will be less
uncertainty about the dates of sittings of a
committee. I have been in Parliament long
c'nough to understand that what is going to
happen cannot always be foretold, but we do
know that it is almost impossible during an
adjournment of the House to keep a comnmittee quorum together, except in the Divorce
Committee, and at times even it has had
difflculty in holding a quorum.
I hope that in future the honourable
leader will see that no rash statement is
made about sittings of a committee being
held when the Senate is adjourned. I am
sorry that when I made my statement on
Friday nîght no honourable member said a
word to aupport my stand.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable mcmbers, the honourable gentleman from Colchester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield) must have at
least the satisfaction of knowing that hie was
right. Those who disagreed with him find
now that they were wrong. They expected
that the Banking and Commerce Committee
could he convened on Wednesday, though, I
may say, the proposal to have it meet then
was contrary to the advice of the chairman
of the committee. Evidently the plan has not
succeeded, although the intention was good.
I hope that because an error was commîtted
the honourable senator from Colchester will
not insist upon the commission of another
one, namely, that the Sexiate be kept sîtting
several days for nothing. Last week we met
from day to day while waiting for a very
important measure to be presented, and it
was passed only on Friday evening. Now
that the pressing work has, been donc and
there is no reason why the Senate should continue eitting, I presume the honourable gentlema.n will not persist in his opposition to

SENATE
SEOOND READING

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN moved the second
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I suppose we shall be com-pelled to
break our rules again, as usuai, in order to put
this Bill through. It is true that present conditions are somewhat peculiar, but I am still
inclined, perhaps in an old-fashioned way, to
think that the rules of the Senate were made
for a purpose. In my opinion we ought to
endeavour, and the members of the other
Chamber should join us in the endeavour, to
make an arrangement whereby all legislation
that cornes before us will be recoived in time
to permit us to deal with it in an intelligent
way. such as would commend itself to the
public. The public 'think it very queer for
the Senate on request to abrogate ali its
rules and most of its functions when certain
bills are sent over to this House to be disposed of hurriedly, no matter what their importance. The Senate was established to fulfil a number of purposes, one of which is to
scrutinize carefully all legislation sent to it,
wherever it has originated, and whether it
lias been passed in another place or not. Our
rules are designed so that every member of
this House may have full opportunity, as
every member of the other House bas had,
to discuss legislation that is sent over to us
from that other House.
I have risen simply ta take advantage of
the opportunity to impress my views on honourable members. I believe that all senators
think as I do, on principle, and that if we
insisted on being treated as an Upper House
of Parliament there would soon be a great
improvement made with respect to the manner in which certain legislation is presented
to us.
Hon. Mr. M'cMEANS: Hear, hear.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I have to admit
that I think the right honourable leader on
the other side of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Gmham) is quite right in bis objection. He
has at different times poinited out the necessity of our observing the rules, whioh were
made for the punpose of permitting intelligent
and considered discussion on al measures that
corne before us. We all agree to that. I
would suggest, however, that, if my memory
serves me, we have made an exception of
Supply Bills-which, after ail, we can only
accept or reject-and have passed them time
and again without insisting on the usual notice
being given. For this reason I will ask my
honourable friend to bear with me on the
present occasion and allow this Bill to be
Hon.

Mr. STANFIELD.

givon the three readings at this sitting, as the
Doputy Governor General will be here at 4
o'clock for the purpose of giving the Royal
Assent.
This is a Supply Bill covering supplementary estimates of the year 1931-32, amounting
to $1,059,000. Of this sum $875,000 is for war
pensions, $83,000 for salaries and contingent
expenses of the Sonate and the House of
Commons, and the remainder for various
small items. Even if we wanted to discuss
this Bill, we should find very little material
for the purpose. I trust, therefore, that my
right honourabl.e friend's objection, which
would be well taken in regard to other
measures, will not be insisted upon in relation
to this Bill, and that ho will permit the Bill
ta go through at this sitting.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
HonourabIe
members, this is the first time, to my knowledge, that the Sonate has been asked to approve a Bill in such haste without some reason
being given. My honourable friend bas told
us that this Bill authorizes an expenditure of
about $1,250,000, to cover pensions, expenses
of the Sonate and of the House of Commons,
and some other items which I did not catch.
It is most extraordinary that we should be
asked to approve of the Bill on such short
notice. I repeat: I have never before heard
of a Bill of this kind being prosented to this
House with a demand for its approval within
fifteen minutes or half an hour unless some
very good reason was given for such action.
My honourable friend has entirely failed to
give any reason. We do not know why this
money must be voted and applied at the
present time. I should think there would
be no great need of haste in the payment of
these pensions or expenses. We are asked to
say yes or no to the Bill within a few minutes
of the time fixed for the Royal Assent.
Surely the provisions of the Bill do not have
to be applied immediately. There must be
plenty of time. I join in the protest of my
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) on general grounds, and I protest on
the additional and special ground that I have
indicated. I think that if ever there was
justification for a protest it is now.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: May I ask the
honourable gentleman who is leading the
House (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) whether there is
any great urgency in the matter of making
these various payments? On certain occasions
we have passed Supply Bills in order that
there might be no delay in the payment of
civil servants' salaries. A considerable proportion of the amount provided by this Bill is

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right Hon.
F. A. Anglin, acting as Deputy of the Governor General, would proceed to the Senate
Chamber this day at 4 p.m. for the purpose
of giving the Royal Assent to certain Bills.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

In the ipast the debate on the Budget has
generalHy lasted about two weeks. Adso it is
probable that next week there will be inîtroduced an Interim Supply Bill for one-sixth of
the year's requirements, or whatever proportion may be needed. My suggestion is that
our leader should see the leader of the
other House and try to arrange to have the
Supply Bih presented to us and the Royal
Assent given on the 12th, so that we might
then adjourn for another week. What other
business would there be for the Senate for the
rest of the week? Honourable members of this
Chamber do not want to sit when tihere is
nothing to do, and it is fairly clear that
committees are not desirous of meeting when
the Senate is adjourned. If such an arrangement were made, senators who live at a distance could go home and need not corne back

NEW WELLAND CANAL
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN inquired of the Goviernment.
1. What is the total cost of the new Welland
Canal to date without interest during construction?
2. What is the cost of the saine with interest
during construction?
3. How many tons of freight passed through
this canal during the last season of navigation?
4. How many tons eastward?
5. How niany tons westward?
6. How many tons of wheat passed during
that season?
7. How many tons of other grains?
8. How much money was spent for maintenance, repairs, labour, employees and engineers
by the Government during the year 19319
9. How much money must be raised by taxes
every year to meet the înterest on the total
eost of construction and operation?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The answer
to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is as
follows:
1. Total cost of thc Welland Ship Canal to,
March 31, 1932-$125,301,057.09.
2. As it is not possible to state how much
of this expenditure was provided by borrowing and how much fromn Consolidated Revenue
Fund, an exact interest charge cannot be set
'Up.

9. The money required for Welland Ship
Canal purposes bas been variously providedin part from taxation and in part fromn borrowings. The Dominion financial system being based upon Consolidated Revenue Fund,
and flot upon separate accounts. such expenditures as those required for Welland Ship
Canal purposes cannot be earmarked by any
particular taxes.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: I know we cannot
discuss an answer to an inquiry, but, with
the leave of the House, may I draw the attention of the right honourable leader to, the
fact that interest during construcition is given
in connection with nearly ail works? The
practice has been to compute the interest on
the total cost of the work for haif the period
of construction. The interest charge on the
new Welland Canal could easily be figured
by the officiais, -but I suppose they did not
want to give it.
With respect to the answer to the ninth
question, I think the officiais know what the
figures were for last year. If they do not, they
should.

SENATE
From the incident which is related by Senator
White on page 160 of the Debates of the Senate,
this relates ta a package of papers mailed at
the Ottawa Post Office to go down by the early
morning train, which was delivered at Senator
White's office adjacent to the Post Office in
Montreal, at half-past eleven the following
norning.
The service given -to this package was the
most efficient service that could possibly be
given. The first mail train after the mailing
of the parcel leaves Ottawa at 5.15 a.m. and
arrives in Montreal at 8 o'clock. The mail has
to be unloaded at the railway station and transported througlh the city of Montreal to the
Montreal Post Office. It reaches the Montreal
Post Office between 8.15 and 8.30. When it
reaches the Montreal Post Office it has to be
primarily sorted into districts and finally sorted
into letter carrier routes.
It is humanly impossible to have this mail
ready for deiivery before 9 o'clock to 9.15. At
that time the letter carriers have left on their
first delivery, so that delivery cannot be made
until flic second delivery. The second delivery
18 given in flic morning to business houses,
leaving the Montreal Post Office anywhere
between 10 and Il o'clock according to the
route; so that if this parcel was delivered at
Senator White's office at half-past eleven in the
mornng it was given the most expeditious treatment possible, and no delay of any kind took
place in the handling of this item.
Generally speaking, the Postal Service at
Montreal operates at a disadvantage. due to
the fact that the two main mail handling activities are in two separate buildings, whieh necessitates a great deal of transferring froin one office
to another. This condition will not be reiedied
until the new Postal Terminal in Montreal is
built.
I do not know who prepared the answer.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: If my right
honourable friend will allow me, I may say
that some years ago the postal service was very
much better than it is now. My complaint,
if I have one, is as to the matter of transfer.
There are several offices in Montreal, apparently, and this mail is transferred from one
office to another, very much to the inconvenience of the citizens who may be looking
for mail. It seems to me that if the mail
arrives in Montreal at eight o'clock in the
morning the system of delivery should surely
be a little more rapid than to take three or
four hours.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
members, I have a greater grievance than that
of my honourable friend (Hon. Smeaton
White), and all will admit that I have
suffered a greater loss through delay than
he could have suffered. I have an excellent
paper, run by my employees more than by
myself.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is why it is
good.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is mailed
to me once a day. I have not yet received
in Ottawa one of last week's papers.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Is the right honourable
gentleman sure it was issued?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope the
answer for my right honourable friend will
be as definite and crushing as the one I have
read. I do not see how it could be more
thoroughgoing. Division into districts must
take place first, and into letter carrier routes
next. The mail arrives in Montreal only at
eight.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I think that in larger
centres, where there is a great deal more
mail than in Montreal, this is donc in much
less time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that
the mail that arrives in Toronto at 7.30
in the morning is delivered in the afternoon

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
explain why I suggested that the Bill should
be given the second reading now. I am the
culprit, and I mnust ,plead guilty. I have been
in this House now for some thirty-four years,
and in my experience the general practice
has been to vote one-twplfth or one-sixth
of the supply without raising any objection,
inasmucli as the King's government must go
on; but we have always reserved our right
to discuss any question that might arise out
of the main Appropriation Bill when it came
before us. For eight years I had the task of
presenting Supply Bills to the House, and
when I suggested the second reading of the
present Bill I thought that the procedure
followed during those eight years would be
continued.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
members, may I inquire of the right honourable leader as to the accuracy of one or two
dispatches which have appeared in the press,
purporting to be accounts of interviews with,
or expressions of opinion by, the AttorneyGeneral of Ontario? One dispatch stated that
the Province of Ontario took exception to a
certain clause in one of the Bis, relating to
the taxation of foreign companies. Another
statement was that the Federal Goverement
would recede from its position in this respect,
the ol)vious inference being that it had admitted that such a clause would be contrary
to provincial rights.
The Bis
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

1 saw lately in Saturday Night the complaint that people in jail could get a charter.
Well, I do flot th'ink that it makes the slightest difference whether a man who applies for
a charter is in jail or ought to be. We are
flot responsible for the administration of the
Act; we are flot responsible for the dishionesty
that is perpetrated by promoters; but we are
responsihie for the inachin(ry whichi we provide. and if we have woven a parlour for

Let me go over the Act and make a fewv
suggestions uhich I have to offer. I have said
that in the beginning only onc class of stock
could bc issutd. and that was for money.
Now, under sections 54. 55 and 56, if the letters
patent do not direct what description of shares
niay bc issued, the rlirectors niay create and
issue stock of an\' description, with such restrictions, conditions and voting rights as they
choose. and may provide for the conversion
of preference qhares into common shares, or
of any clas.s of shares into any other class,
and may provide for the redemption of those
shares. Under an amendment made in 1930
tbev may issue no-par Égbares, $100 shares, or
five-cent shares-any kind of shares thcy
choose. Tbey may issue any number of
millions of share-s, and begin business with $500
cash. Wherc the char-ter does flot provide for
the creation of preferred or deferred stock the
directors may issue the stock as preferred or
deferred, and miay have as man 'v cla-ses of
preferred or (leferred shiares as thicy choose.
They may giv c or withhlold the righît to vote
on any shares. and mav prescribe wvhat class
of shares must bc held bv a person to qualify
as a director. I know of one famous case in
which four shares control the whole company.
Tbey may prescribe what class of shares shahl
vote; may vcst control of the companv in as
many shares as there are directors; may subdii ide shares-; mav issue no-par shares at any
price they choose, but must have a capital of
$500 before tbey can begin business.
Hon,

Mir.

LYNCR-STAUNTON.

Now, I suggest tha-t no companies sbould
have the right, to issue more than one class
of stock. We should get back to the first
principles of the law. That law was conccived
and woll thougbt out by Icgislators wbo had
the great experience of the past to guide them
and Nvho knew what tbey were about. There
is no justification for issuing more than one
class of shares. A great evil bas arisen from
the issuance of multitudes of shares of no
par value. Wben the Bill to legalize no-parvalue stock came before a Senate committee
I discussed the matter witb the late lamented
Sir J'unes Loughieed and persuaded himu to
tbrow it out. Afterwards, in the absence ofSic James and myseif, it wvas rointroduced

Indeed, in the United States they are in the
chartermonger business; they advertise that
they will give you ail sorts of charters at
various prices. In this respect they are somewvhat like Reno with the divorce business.
What has been the resuit? I read in this
morning's paper that the President of the
New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that
since the boom burst there had been a contraction or d-eflation of stocks in the United
States to the extent of 48 billion dollars.
If you take any stock list and look at the
quotations you will find that nine-tenths of
the issues listed on the stock exchanges in
Canada and the United States are selling at
their full intrinsic value, flot at a speculative
price. Ail that former expansion was mere
wind. I went down a list the other night and
found very few stocks offered at a price that
was inviting on the score of the dividend
possîbilities.
How many thousands and
thousands of financial wrecks are spread over
this country by reason of the splitting and
expans~ion of stocks! Not long ago a member
of the New York Stock Exchange, talkin-g
about a big company that has sent out shares
like coals through a scuttie, said it was a
"hydrant-headed" monster. We have a number of "hydrant-headed" monsters in Canada,
and I think it is time that we cut off some
of the water.
I am guing to make a cunsidered staternent.
That man is rash and imprudent who buys a
commercial securîty in Canada to-day. This
should not be so. When I huy a bond I
think I arn getting something that is secure
in good times or in bad, in calm or in stormy
'weather; I think I arn buying something that
is offered to me as a security and not as a
speculation. Everybody considers that a bond
is a security; no one looks upon it as a myth
or as a ghost of a security. People who invest
in bonds do so because they think they are
investing safely. I say, therefore, that ahl
legislation regarding securities should be of a
protectîve nature and should prevent the
issuing as a security of anything that is
palpably worthless as such.
Let us see what the statute does with
regard to securities. Section 84, which provides for the borrowing powers, says:
The direotors may . .. issue bonds, debenturee,
<lebenture stock or other securitiesin unlimited amounts. The Act calîs these
things securities. And it is provîded that the
directors may secure them by mortgage on
the shares, on the good-will, trade-marks,
licences or copyright of the company itself,
or of any other company. Under that section
there has been issued in this country as repre-

senting hundreds of millions of dollars stock
that is, and was at the time of issue, absolutely valueless. I do not mean to say that
those bonds or debentures-I will not caîl
them securities-will not be paid, but I say
there is behind them no security, and I accent
every syllable of that word.
I arn not going mucGk-raking, I amn not going
to exhibit some skeletons, but I will point out
what may be done. A company having nothing
rnay issue common stock and may pledge that
for $100,000,000, and with fine names on the
prospectus, the issue, if properly launched,
wîll go over. That company can then proceed
to issue any amount of debentures that it
chooses ahead of those stocks. For example,
a company that raised 330,000,000 on common
stock could issue ahead of that; stock debentures of the face value of $100 to the
extent of another $30,000,000, and the directors
might seil those debentures to themselves for
310, but the 8 per cent interest would be paid
on the par value. The company could issue
any amount of debentures, of any colour and
description, ahead of the securities. ls that
right? Is it right that Parliament should enable companies to do that?
onpanies can also put out a trust deed,
framed by theielves, to secure their mortgages. Now, 1 neyer knew a creditor to alýlow
his debtor or borrower to frame the niortgage.
I neyer knew a bank, when they put a form
before mie, to let mie fil!i it out -in my own
language. I say Parliament Éhouffd flot permit
the debtors to frame -the mortgage, because if
they go into default the creditors are helpless.
The trustee will flot act unless security for
bis costs is -put up. There are clauses in the
deed which tnay stand off creditors for ever.
In many instances the investors can do nothing
but form a bond-holers' protective socicty.
"What can you do about it?" as Boss Tweed
saî,d. Nothing.
I suggest that there should be a statutory
form of mortgage and .that no cornpany should
be allowed to issue securities except under
that form, which should carefuliy guard the
interests of lendere.
Another scheme that is used by some coinpaniea is an open m.ortgage. A cornpany of
which I amn an officer had a considerable
axnount of mortgage bonde of another coxnpany.
The bonds were excellent, secured, as snortgage
bonds should be. They paid six per cent
interest and were as safe as a church. After
a while money could. be got chea.p and the
directors of the cornpany that issued the bonde
asked us to acoept five per cent. We thought
that was good intereet st that time, but I
wanted to see the rnortgage. The oompany
had about $10,000,000 worth of property and

SENATE

the new mortgage was a $50,000,000 open mortgage. The company was presently to, issue
the amount of the old anortgage, but it had
the right to issue pari passu with the $10,000,000 Up to $50,000,000. There was a provision in the mortgage that the company could
issue only up to 75 per cent of the appraised
value of -the property, on the certificate of an
appraiser. As everyhbody knows, you can get
an appraiser to valuate anything at any figure
you desire. At the wish of the -company and
without my consent a mortgage could ho
extended to $50,000,000. We aIl kniow that if
a cornpany fails it is as doad as ditch water.
I said, "Gentlemen, the proposition is not
sufficiently inviting." I suibmit that our law
should iprovent the issuing of bonds under aib
open ýmortgago.
You know, the public doos not understand
theso tbings. I consider that I arn somewhat
of a company lawyer, and think that 1 know
a little about the Companies Act. I took one
of theso prospectuses, and spent days on it,
and I was nearly hooked after alI. I wvanted
to buy some of the bonds. Until 1 had gono
over the prospectus again and again I did
not realize that I was not getting a mortgage

his high place: one of the greatest narnes was
dragged in the mnud, and a peer was sent to
penitentiary for having issued a fraudulent
prospectus.
Yest.erday three great men in
Scotland wvere sent to jail by the inexorable
law of that country for having issued a fraudulent prospectus by which people were swindled
of millions of dollars. The Engliali judge in
charging the jury said that any prospectus calculated to deceive was fraudulent, and in that
the Court of Criminal Appeal upbeld him.
Wliat does our Act provide? It providýes
that a director issuing a prospectus is hiable
for misstatements or the putting forth of
staternents that he knows are untx-ue, or that
it is proved lie lias no reason to believe are
true. But there is no law against giving an
opinion, and I arn not aware tliat it lias been
lield in Canada that if a prospectus is calculated to deoeive it is per se fraudulent. So
those issuing prospectuses make no statements of fact; they put in tlie words, "it is
estimated," or tliey print a letter from, an
expert. Tlie law says tliat if tliey print a
letter frorn an expert, and you cannot prove
that tliey knew he lied, tliey are flot responsible. So they are as safe as a cliurcli. An
expert is defined as pretty nearly anybody
wvlo says lie knows about the company. I
will fot read the definition, whicli is tlie
loosest 1 ever &&w. Down at tlie bottom of
tlie prospectus, in illegible letters, the broker
puts tlie staternent, "We believe tliis to be
true, but we take no responsibility for the
statements." Tlie Court of Appeals in New
York lield tliat the issuers, no matter wliat
they put on tlie prospectuses to exculpate
tliemselves, were hiable, and I tliink tliat if
that decision ever cornes before one of our
courts it will receive very careful consideration. I suggest tliat every prospectus should
by law be confined to the statement of facts;
it sliould not bie allowed to contain opinions
or tlie estimates of experts.

different provinces?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If honourable gentlernen wi'll permit me, I will make
a suggestion. It is agreed on a&H
hands tliat
we sliould have only one Insurance Act. I
mnention tliat because it lias been discuased
here. It also is agreed on ah liands tliat we
sliould liave only one Companies Act. Now,
we cannot liave one Insurance Act, because
sucli an Act lia been held to be ultra vires,
and the Dominion Parliainen't fias no riglit,
though the provinces liave-at least the Privy
Council so says--to .pass a general Insurance
Act. My suggestion is this. One of the great
reasons wliy the provinces insist on issuing
charters and inoorporating companies is that
they reoeive fees for so doing. That is a great
indu-cernent to continue. They need the money.
My idea is that we shouild have a Dominion
Act, and bliat we sliould treat with the provinces and asic eacli of them. to endorse that
Act. Then tlie Provincial Secretary in every
province should be madle a sort of UnderSecretary of State and sliou'ld be allowed to
issue obarters, for whicli lis province would
keep the money. Thle charters would be prepared under tlie Dominion Act. In Vliat way
every provincial governiment in this country
couId -issue a Dominion charter. It sliould lie
easy enough to devise an Afot that would be
acceptable to the provinces, because they
woul-d liave the sole control. Tliey would send
copies of tlie charters and tlie returns to
Ottawa, but Vliey would have full control in
tlie matter of issuance and revocation, and
everything pertaining to Vhem, and they would
obtain tlie fees. Tliis would 'leave no reason
why tliey should be desirous of cluttering up
the cornpany law of tliis country with nine
different sets of statutes.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The Acts
in the United States and in the provinces

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What about

The

financial collapse was equally emphatic.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Because
they can issue these penny shares. I do not
attribute the financial collapse entirely to the
Companies Acts, but I say that they contributed greatly in a time of stress.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I was labouring under the impression that
I was the only person in this honourable House
who was out of date, but J take consolation in
finding that I have an associate in the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
LynchStaunton). To be serious, I think that
the honourable member loses sight of the fact
that within the last twenty-five or fifty years
conditions have entirely changed. The securities
theretofore were confined to real estate, but
in recent years all values have been mobilized.
As a consequence, the Companies Act has been
changed, and I think it has been changed on
proper lines. Possibly we might have been
more conservative if we had adopted the
practice which has been obtaining for many
years in 'the State of Massaohusetts. I am not
sure whether it still obtains, but I think it does.
Under the Massachusetts law-and this extends
back twenty-five years or more-no security
can be issued except with the approval of a
board, a very conservative board, which
determines the value at which the security
shall be issued. This provides a great protection for the public, and I am under the
impression that it would be more conservative to adopt that practice here.
I would invite the honourable member from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) to put
his ideas into such a shape that they might be
submitted to business men, in order that we
might sec how they would be received by thein.
I think that our law respecting companies has
been prepared and passed after consultation
with business men throughout the country, and
has received their endorsation.
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen,
I did not intend to say anything at all on this
subject, but perhaps I shall be permitted to
say a word or two. I want, first, to thank the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton for the
Hon. Mr.

DANDURAND.

historical sketch which he gave us of the
Companies Act from its inception; but I
disagree with practically everything he said
aftervards.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A poor lawyer,
but good historian.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I want to get into
closer touch with the honourable member from
Hamilton and find ou-t what he would propose
in the way of making a bond so secure and so
liquid that no matter how times changed I
could at any time get 8100 for a $100 bond. I
understand that is what he intimated could be
done.
The honourable gentleman insists that no
stock certificate should be issued without the
payment of $100 -cash for it. Erom a practical
standpoint I would ask him what he thinks
of a proposition of this kind. I know where
in Northern Ontario there is, or rather was, a
small gold mine.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Not a gold
brick?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In 1924 my friends
the honourable nember for Inkerman, proprietor of the Montreal Gazette (Hon.
Smeaton White) and the honourable senator
from Pembroke (Hon. G. V. White) went up
to Northern Ontario with me, and we found
up there a littile property turning out a small
quantity of gold. The man who owned the
whole of that little property had either discovered it or bought it from the discoverer for
very little. At that particular time there may
have been some reason for what my honourable
friend (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
suggests, that $100 in cash should be put up
for every $100 worth of stock, though I do not
admit even that. In 1924 that little mine had
a caýpitalization of $2,000,000, which looked high
at the ti.me, for the dollar shares were selling
for thirty cents a short time previously. Today, notwithstanding the depression, that stock
is selling at $28 and $29 a share. Last year
that mine paid about 250 per cent in dividends
on its capitalization. In fact, in the last quarter
of a year it paid 100 per cent, and it is still
going, and is worth more than the market price
at which its stock is selling to-day.
I understood my honourable friend to say
that after looking around he had come to
the conclusion that most of the stocks were
selling at fully what they were worth, or up
to their intrinsic value. He failed to find
any that were worth much more than what
they were selling for. I am sure that if my
honourable friend will just consider the one
little mining proposition which I have
mentioned-that is, the Lake Shore mine-

that is the trust agreement. Under a clause
in the trust agreement a certain proportion of
the hondholders of a company may get together and, if they so desire, take every dollar

first mortgage bonds that are nothing but
a common promise to pay and are only just
so good as the people who issued the bonds

municipality are good in so far as the
Dominion, province or municipality may be
good. Tbey are the only bonds now îssued
in Canada that are saf e for the investment
of trust funds, and in fact are the only really
saf e investment for anyone who desires absolute security.
So-called bond salesmen have been going
from house to house all over Canada, calling
on people who do not know what the word
"bond" means. They canvass farmer.5 who
are so busy at their own work that they

agree rather with what was said by my honourablri friend fromn Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Gordon) as to securities.
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
isenators, t.he House will hoar with mea for a
few moments, I hope, inasmuch as the subjeet-matter of the debate is in the forma of a
question, cailing upon the Government to
make an ané;wer. My first sentence will be a
recitation of thse answer w-hich is furnished
to me by -the Depcrtinent of the Secretary of
State:
A general revision of the Companies Act is
flot under considecation at thse present time.
If wouid not be very courte-ous of me to
stol) there; vet 1 have such an aýppreciation
of thse great importance of thse question, of its
far-reaching implications in ail sorts of difficuit fields, that I make no pretence of being
armed to-day to meet tIse speciai attack made
upon the Companies Act by the honourabie
senator fromn Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) .
The methods of modemn business are very
different, and necessarily so, from those which
preva.ikld in the much simpler times of the
reign of George I, when comipanies made their
appearance on the stage of life, and when the
statute referced to hy the honourabie senator
fromn Hamilton was deemed adlequaite to meet
the difficulties of thse hour. Business in this
mnachine agi[, flot onlv in this but in other

press 'an opinion on thatpoint, but I amr compelied to say that whether the honourable gentleman from Hamilton is in advance of my
own thoiught or whether he is behind, the distance betwveen us is great. I cannot follow
him in hýis reasoning, in the main features of
his contentions, though he made one or two
suggestions that I believe should be of value.
I cannot for a moment agree that in this day
we shouid restriet our company organization
to merely common stock companies. I do not
think such a systemn would fit in with the character of enterprise at 'this timne. If it did, one
would esspe.ct to find 'that type of instrument
in general use, not only here but in other
countries. But where is the country on the
face oyf the globe to-day which restricts its
company organization to .merely common stock
companies, which prevents the issue of preferred stockHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

I can tell

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was speaking of countries. Where is tIse country on the
face of the globe that enforces such restrictions? I venture to suggest that there is flot
one, in the oid worid or the new. And sureiy
aIl countries are flot wrong.
Sureiy there
would be one that would save Nineveh at
this time, if it couid be savedi by the purity
of a mccce common stock comt)any organization. Go to Engiand, France, Austria, Japan,
China-anywhere-and 1 venture to say it
will be found that thse intricacies of company
formation are .Iust as compiex as they are in
Canada. In the United States, perhaps, they
are more so than anywhere else, for the reason
that thse business structure has reached greater
proportions there than elsewhere. But it does
seemn essential that there should be this complexity, because, ficat of ail, of the intricacy
and immensity of modemn business, and because of tIse demanda of different classes of
investors for different types of securities.
Noir do I think that the provision for no-par
value stock is a retrograde stop at ail. I
nover wvas able to sec what peculiar sanctity
thece was to $100 par value any more than
to S10 par value.

Hon. Mc. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, I do
net think thece is.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or to $1 par
value. Then, why should any special figure
be selected anci deciared as thse par value of
ail stock? On the contcary, it always has
seemed to me, and stili does, that tIse very
fixing of a par value, instead of being an
element of security and piainness to the investor against deceit, is thse opposite. Stock

may be issued at $100 par value when as a
matter of fact it has nothing like that value,
and the mere statement of the nominal value
may have a tendency to mislead.
Honi. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Certainly it
is possible for a company to issue far too
much stock, but that applies just as well to
a company that has $100 par stock as to one
whose stock is of no par value. It may be
that the company to which the honourable
senator frorn Harnilton referred as feeling that
it had issued too rnany shares could have
issued too many if its shares had been $100
par value instead of no par value, as they are
-for I think I know the company to which he
refers. I believe it can be said that the
companies which to-day stand highest in the
matter of strength, and whose securities,
though pretty low in the market-because al
are low now-are sound and rank well in
revenue-bearing power and in stability, in
comparison with any in the world, are companies whose issues are no-par-value stock.
In a word, if there is any preference for the
one over the other, frorn the standpoint of
being fair with the investor and avoiding misleading him, I think the preference mnust be
given to the no-par-value stock.
The honourable senator from Hamilton
argues that Parliament, by enacting the Companies Act in its present form, merely provides
a bouse for the spider and forgets the flues.
He contends that we should have a different
Act. Parenthetically, may I implore him te,
frarne the measure he bas in mmnd, because in
concrete forma it would be not only a very
interesting production but a great contribution to the discussion, for we should then
know just what we were talking upon. He
says that the Act shouid permit in a prospectus the statement of nothing but facts.
He would make the inclusion of any opinion
illegal, even thougb the author of the opinion
were nanjed. Be also suggests that nothing
but common stock sbould be issued, of a
named par value-I presume, of $100; that
there should be no preferred stock; and that
there should be a provision for a uniform
mortgage or trust deed securing bonds. And
lie thinks that if these changes were made
they would go far towards preventing depressions and losses on stocks in the future.
I will deal for a moment with the suggestion as to prospectuses. Undoubtedly great
barmn is done by some prospectuses. Here, as
in every oCher sphere of human nctivity, the
ingenuity of man cornes into play, and is
exercised for the benefit of certain pcrsons
and sometimes greatly te, the disadvantage of
41767-12à

179

others. Occaeionally men wbo profit improperly by prospectuses do it in sucb a way that
it is very liard indeed for the law to follow
them. Now, the lionourable senator suggests
that prospectuses sbould contain nothing but
facts. But I think the investor will say: "I
arn entitled to more than that. I arn entitled
to the best opinion that I can get, or that you
can provide me with, as to what this company probably can do, and how it is going to
do it."
Bon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Rightly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Rigbtly, of
course; we have to presume that. Suppose
we follow the honourable senator's suggestion
and enact that a prospectus shaîl be made up
of nothing but facts. My first observation is,
as T have already stated, that I believe the
investor will say he has a right to more than
that. At the present time, if a prospectus
contains any misrepresentation of any kind as
to facts, or an expression of opinion amounting to fraud, the criminal law intervenes.
The honourable senator is not satisfied with
that. He says you must have no esimates
at ail; that to give an estimate, even if you
tell the name of the man on whose faith
the estimate is made, sbould be a contravention of the criminal law. I venture to,
say that if we Passed such a measure it would.
probably be declared that it was beyond our
power and that we were seeking by means
of criminal legislation to interfere with a
matter wit'hin the jurisdiction of the provinces.
You cannot make a crime of soinething within
the jurisdiction of the provinces simply for
the purpose of accomplishing an ulterior
purpose. 'If we were to lexislate that only
facts mizht be stated, and that an estimate
must not be given, and if we called sucli an
enactment criminal law, I shoudd not think
we were very secure before the Privy Council,
even in the matter of jurisdiotion. But supposinz we were: we are not the only authority
that can incorporate companies, and I venture
to say that we incorporate relatively few. Al
the nine provinces can incorporate companies,
and they do not have to follow the course
proposed, and I do not think they would.
What would 'be the result of imposing: this
restriction and Vhat restraint? The companies
would be incorporated not here, but in the
provinces, and instead of achieving something
better than we have, we should lose the
advantage already gained from the measure
of security now a.ssured under our daw. We
shou'ld have done what an honourable senator
referred ta the other day: we should he "like
the base Indian," wbo "threw a pearl away,
richer than all his tribe."

SENATE
Reference was made also to the desirability
of ensuring that the instrument held out to,
the public as a bond really is a bond, and of
ensuring that what is held out as a first mortgage bond really is a flrst mortgage bond.
This is the feature of the honourable gentileman's address that I think is especiaily worthy
of attention. There bas been of late years,
and especially of late months, far too greaýt a
disposition to play with the security of the
first mortgagce, to attenuate and impair the
priority of the first mortgagee by the intricate
provisions of a trust deed. W~e could very
reaoonably, I suppose, protect the public
against that so far as our own incorporations
go, but I do not know how far we 'could go
under the heading of criminal law in protecting
the 'public in respect of the incorporations of
the provinces. 1 do not think we could go
very far. But I should like to see something
donc-and undoubotedly it ýcan be justifiedte, enable the public te ledl that when they
secure a first ýcharge against something, it
really is wh'at it purports to be. If it is to
be decriibcd as a bond, it ougbt to be a bond
in rcality, and net merely a dcbenture or
promise te pay; and1 I am not at ail convinccd that under the head of the criminal
law wve cannot do something to sc that a
bond rcally is a bond, and that default on a
flrst mnortgage bond is something that will
enable the first rnortgagee to ýcome in and
commence foreclosure proceedings with some
hope of getting there through within a reasonable time.
But ag-ain I submit te, the honourable
senater from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) that, because of ouîr federal constitution, what he proposes is t.remendously
difficuit. Ail these precesses really come under
provincial law. We may hamper and restrain
the companies we incorporato. but xve shall
flot get verv far by doing it. Tbe only effective
remecly must come throughi the p)rovinces. In
sorne provinces substantial steps bave been
taken to achieve, not Ibis special resuit, as
to first mortgages. but a general result. The
Province of Ontario is to-day exercisin g supervision oveLr securit.ies, and, 1 tbiuk, a, very
usefiji supervision. Under wvhat xvas originally
called the Securitv Frauds Prevention Act,
now, I think, the Securities Art, it is provided first of ail that brokers-that is, thiese
investment bouses-sball be liccnscd; .secondly,
that salesmen shali be licensed, and that before issues are allowed to comne before the
public they miust be passed. Tbat is a very
serious responsihility. and onoe whieb only the
provinces can undertake. They are endeavouring to mieet the diffieulties that this great
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGEEN.

depression has ýbroughit to the surface by
efforts alonig tbese lines. May they have every
success. The field is tbeirs rather than ours.
Indeed, I question whether we can aecomplish
muciih, if anytbing, in the way of supervising
the issue of securities. The supervision of
securities and the protection of tbe public
rome undpr provincial jurisdiction, and, as I
have said, in one province at least, and
probahly in more, efforts are now being made
to control the situation.
This constitutes ali that I have to offer on
this subleet. except te express my appreciatien te tbe hcnourable senator from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunten) for having introdueed it. I know that tremendous suffering
has been entailed by stock sales that should
net have been-made. Vastly more has been
eaused by the reduction in values and the
cenditions xvhicb have everwhelmed the issue,
as they bave ail others, than because of the
issue having been wreng in the first place.
I do net think the conditien ef our Companies
Act is an appreciabie facter in the deprcssion
cf te-day, nor (do I think the condition of
the Companies Art of the United States, or
the Arts of thecir States, or those of the
different ceuintries of the world, hiave bcad any
considerable effeet. This great convulsion bias
its roots muchel fartbcr back and iîuuch deeper
down. 1 shouid ho slower 00ow than I shouli
have been txvo or thrc years3 ago te venture
te analyse the causes, test as I should ho
slowor t o say t.hat the stocks of te-dlay bave
a greater intrinsic value than thcy are chle
te commiand on the market. I am certain of
the fart that Wr should accomplish very little
in future bY modifications of the company
law, and that the econemie laws, which are
vast.er than the enartments; of any -parliarnent,
are at the reet of the depro..sion that we now
endure.
JLTDGES BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Heu. Mr. %IEIGHIEN mcx cd the
second reading of Bill 9, an Art to amend the
Jinlges Act.
The motion wasý agreed te, and the Bill
wvas read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN' COMMITTEE .AND REPORTED

On metion of Rig-ht Hon. Mr. Meiglion, the
Sonate went into Comniittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Bocubien in the Chair.
On section 1-trax elling allowanccs:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN-ýD: Can the right
honourable gentleman tell us whethor the
request for these amieedments bas comie from

181

APRIL 13, 1932
the judges or from the attorneys-general of the
provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
knowledge of any request from the attorneysgeneral. I am quite certain it is not froin the
judges. I think the request for this legislation
really originates in the Department of Justice.
The purpose of this legislation is to provide
for a more satisfactory supervision of the expenses of judges travelling outside of their
districts. In the Province of Quebec there is
a somewhat different provision from that
which is to apply in the other provinces, the
reason being that the judiciary in Quebec is
organized on a different basis. The first section provides that certain words shall be
struck out of the original clause, which appears
on the right-hand page of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The Court of Appeal
was abolished.
Previously
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
the accounts were certified by the Chief
Justice, but now, when judges make trips outside of their own jurisdiction, the accounts
must also be certified to by the AttorneyGeneral. The deletions provided for by the
first section of the Bill have the effect, as I
interpret them, of enabling the Department
to control the expenses, even when the judges
do not go beyond their own special jurisdiction.
Subsection 6, which is to be amended, reads
at present as follows:
6. In the Province of Quebec no travelling
allowances shall be granted to any judge
requested to sit in review, or attending any
court, except within the îimits of the district
to which he is assigned, held at any other place
than that at which he resides, unless it is
certified by the Chief Justice, or the judge
performing the duties of chief justice in the
district where the court is held, that the attendance was in his opinion neceseary.
In the Province of Quebec, apparently, the
judges are not given special assignments, as
they are in the other provinces. Therefore
the words "except within the limits of the
district to which he is assigned" are struck out.
It is my understanding that the second
amendment is applicable in every province, and that the Attorney-General of a
province must certify to the trip before the
Auditor-General will be justified in passing
the charge.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The title was agreed to.

On the preamble:
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: As far as districts are
concerned, there are districts to which certain
judges are assigned; for instance, Three
Rivers, Sherbrooke, and so forth. The main
point I wish to refer to is the approval of
the accounts. Upon looking over Hansard of
the House of Commons I see that a discussion
took place in that House between the exMinister of Justice and the present Minister
of Justice. I am not quite sure about the
rule as to reading Hansard, but if I am permitted, I will do so. The following discussion
took place on section 6:
Mr. Guthrie: The present section in the Bill
will be struck out and the following substituted
therefor:
1. Subsection 6 of section 21 of chapter 105
of the Revised Statutes of Canada is hereby
amended by striking out the words "requested
to sit in review or' in the second line of the
said subsection, and also by striking out the
words "except within the limits of the district
to which he is assigned" in the third and fourth
lines of the said subsection.
Mr. Lapointe: But unless we have the statute
before us, we cannot very well understand what
this means.
Mr. Guthrie: The subsection, if amended, will
read as follows:
6. In the Province of Quebec no travelling
allowances shall be granted to any judge attending any court held at any other place than that
at which he resides, unless it is certified by the
Chief Justice, or the judge performing the
duties of chief justice in-the district where the
court is held, that the attendance was in his
opinion necessary.
I do not see that section here. If my right
honourable friend will refer to page 1817 of the
House of Commons Hansard he will find it.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
section?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Section 6.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Subsection 6
of section 21?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman ask how that will read
as amended?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I say that, se it is
amended, the Chief Justice must certify instead of the Attorney-General.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. Subsection 6 of section 21 refers ontly to the
Province of Quebec, and apparently in that
province the Attorney-General does not come
in at all.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I have not heard it
read from the Bill.

182

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The way
it will read, after amendment, is this:
In the Province of Quebec no travelling
allowances shall be granted to any judge
attending any court held at any other place
than that at which lie resides, unless it is
certified by the Chief Justice, or the judge
performing the duties of chief justice in the
district where the court is held, that the attendance was in lis opinion necessary.
That will bu the law in the Province of Quebec
if this Bill passes.
The effect of the first
clause is very clear.
The second clause of the Bill adds to paragraph d of subsection 1 of section 21, ail of
which is quoted on the opposite page, the
words:
and unless the holding of such court is
approved by the Attorney-General of the
province.
Section 21 reads as follows:
21. There shall be paid for travelling allowances to eaci judge, whether of a superior or
county court, and to eadh local judge in
Admiiralty of the Exchequer Court, except as in
this section otherwise provided. in addition to
bis moving or transportation expenses the sui
of ten dollars for each day, including necessary
days of travel going and returning. during
whicli lie is attending as such judge in court
or chambers at any place other than that at
which lie is by law obliged to reside, if sucb
attendance bas been in any place whicli is a
city, otherwise he shall be paid the sues of six
dollars for eaci day lie lias so attended:
Provided thatNow, coming down to paragraph d:
(dl) no travelling allow.ances shall be granted
te a judge of a county court in respect of any
attendance at a place not within the county
or district for which the judge is appointed,
unless it appear te the satisfaction of the
Minister of Justice that the attendance was
duly authorized and necessary and unless the
holding of such court is approved by the
Attorney-General of the province.
It will be observed 'that that first amendment-and I admit I may not have explained
it rightly at first-is confined to the Province
of Quebec, and lias the effect of providing
that travelling allowances of judges in that
province going te attend court at any place
at which they do net reside must first be certified by the Chief Justice, or the judge performing such duties, before they can be
granted.
The second amendment bas this effect. The
law, as it stood, granted the judges $10 a day
for expenses during the time they were
attending court at some place other than
where they reside, if that other place was a
city, and $6 a day if it was net a city. It
went on to say that no travelling allowance
should be granted to a county court judge
attending at another place unless it appeared

BUREAU.

That is to say,

in the case of a county judge, he cannot get
the $10 if it is to a city, or $6 if it is somewhere else, when he goes away from the place
in which lie resides, unless the Chief Justice
and the Attorney-General as well certify that
the trip is necessary.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

DESTRUCTIVE INSECT AND PEST BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 18, an Act to amend
the Destructive Insect and Pest Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that the first two clauses contain the enact,
ment which will allow of a regulation to prevent the shipient beyond Canada's borders of
any insect, pest or disease destructive to
vegetation. The explanatory note says:
Section 1. The words "or the shipment
beyond her borders" are inserted in this section,
with a view to naking provision to prevent the
exportation of infested vegetables.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I see
that the Minister made the statement that
sections 1, 2 and 3 of the amending Bill are
intended to give us authority to control the
movement of agricultural produets infested
with any disease or insects. It amplifies the
power to control al such products. I presume
that the need of controlling their export is to
proteet the reputation of Canadian products.
Section 4 rather puzzled me at first, as it
seemed to be an attempt on the part of the
Dominion to legalize provincial statutes, which
of course we cannot do, generally speaking.
The section reads as follows:
4. Nothwithstanding the generality of the
terms of this Act, the foregoing provisions shall
be construed as extending only to such insects,
pests, or diseases destructive to vegetation, as
are dealt with, froin time te time, by the
Governor in Counci:1 by regulation, and nothing
herein contained shall he construed to prevent
the Legislaturre of any province from making
laws in relation to any such inseet, pest, or
disease not so deaIt with by the Governor in
Council, or to render repugnant to this Act any

183

APRIL 13, 1932
law made by the Legisiature of a province in
relation te any such insect, pest, or disease not
so deait with by the Governor in Council; but
the power of the Governor in Council shail
nevertheless be construed as ample frem time te
time te extend the application of this Act and
regulations made thereunder, te any inseet,
pest or disease aforesaid, notwithstanding the
existence of any provincial 1,aw relating thererto.
It struck me, and I know it would strike nny
honeurable senater, as an atte'mpt to recognize
that the province may legislate up to a certain
point in this matter, and impliedly te validate
such legislatien; whereas, speaking generally,
aur legisiatien must stand on its ewn constitutional feet as against provincial hegislation,
and neither one can help the other.
But the explanation given me is this, that
under section 95 of the B.N.A. Act concurrent
power is given te the Dominion and the province with respect to agriculture. Clause 4
is intended te make clear that where Parhiament or Ordier in Council has not dealt with
a particular pest or insect the province is free
te do se. It is said in the Justice Departmnent
that the explanatory note is mislea.ding. It is
because of the concurrent jurisdiction given b
the B.N.A. Act that this rather peculiar provision becomes appropriate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I dou'bt, that it is
a needed clause, because whatever deeision we
make would net fimit the legislation of the
province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot give
any information beyond what I have, 'but if the
bonouraible senator prefeas te leave the committee work until another day I quite readily
agree. The second reading might, well pass,
and I shall be ready te diseuss the matter more
intelligently when we corne te it again.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Has the sponsor of
this Bill any information from the Department
as te the reason for extending its powers and
controlling expert? In the sta-bute which this
Bià is amen.ding the Deipartment now has
power te control the movement, of such vegetables or vegetation within Canada. -We are
now esked te apçply it te, those, that are
eyported. Can the Department show any
instances that would call for extending this
power in the way pxinposed? We are n.ow expending a large amout of money in the administration of this Act, some $W5,000, I think,
and it anight be wise te ask how much more
expenditure this amendmnent would entail, as
well as getting the reaisens for interfering with
expert trade, as it might be termed.
Perhaps the right honourable gentleman
would get that information as weihl, if he bas
net got it, and the matter might be referred
te the Standiing Committee on Agricuilture and

Forestry, where we might hear the officiais
who are interested in the administration of the
Act.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGREN: I have no
objection to the Bill 'being se referred.
Manifestly, it is in the interest of this country
that vegetation affected with pests or parasites
be flot exported, to the detriýment of the
reputation of our prodiucts. That would seem
te me obvious, and I should suppose that there
were instances which showed that harm. had
been dene before the control was provided
for. But I cannet give the instances now.
If the honourable senator would like the Bill
referred te the Committee on Agriculture,
1 have no objection.
Hun. Mr. SINCLAIR: I quite agree with
the right honourable gentleman that it is
necessary, for the sake of our good name, not
to allow the expert of goods infested with
parasites. But such power bas also been used
in other countries, as well as Canada, as a
means of controlling imports and exports by
raising objection to goods on the pretext that
tbey were infested with parasites, when there
was no real ground of that kind at ail. I have
been taught to believe that the Senate of
Canada is a reviewing body, and 1 think we
are justifled in asking for information as to
why it is necessary to extend the Act in the
manner proposed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I quite agree.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND : We could perhaps take the second reading now and go
into commîttee to-morrow.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I shall
have the information in satisfactory form
then, or have the official here.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
wish to direct · he attention of the House
t
to an article that appeared in the Ottawa
Journal of last evening, under the heading,
"Committee to make report on facts onlyPredicted move will follow to oust two
Liberal Senators-Session highlight is expected soon," and reading as follows:
The political spotlight shortly will be occupied by the special committee of the Senate
when it reports on its findings as to the relation
of Senators Wilfrid Laurier McDougald, Andrew
Haydon, and Donat Raymond with the Beauharnois Power Corporation.
It is believed the committee will present
a fact-finding report, but will not make any
reeommendiations.
It is further believed in well informed
political circles that the findings by the special
committee will be such that as a result Senators
McDougald and Haydon wili lose their seats in
the Upper House.
Senator Raymond, it is said, will not be
placed in the same position as his two colleagnes.
The special commîittee has received the briefs
of the lawyers representing the three Liberal
senators and also the views of its own counsel.
Owing to the illness of Senator T. C. Chapais,
a veteran member of the Upper House, the
committee lias not been called together.
It is understood, however, that a special effort
1s being made

to have the committee's report

ready in a week or 10 days. It is expected
there will be a inority report from Liberal
inembers of the committee.
The rea-l fight in regard to Senators
MeDongald and Haydon will take place in the
Senate Chamber. Party lines will be revived
and hurried calls sent te all absentee senators.
It was reported to-day that feeling was
beginning to be stirred up so much that requests
for pairs were being refused.
Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen, Government leader
in the Upper House, will have the task of
asking for the expulsion of Senators McDougald
and Haydon.

The whole situation promises to be the highlight of the parliamentary session.
I was present at the last sitting of the special committee inquiring into the Beauharnois
matter, and it was decided then that when
the briefs of counsel were received they would
be considered in strict confidence and would
not be open to the inspection of other
senators or anyone else. That was the order
of the committee as stated by the chairman
at that time. So far as I know, that order
bas been strictly observed, for I have not had
an opportunity--and I may say I have not
sought one-of inspecting or reading the
briefs, and I know of no other senator who
bas. I can say further that members of the
committee have been very careful about the

APRIL 14, 193218
matter, Ïbecause whenever I have he-ard -the
subject mentioned in the presence of any one
of themn he has declix•ed to enter into any
conversation respecting it. It was with some
surprise, therefore, that I read this article ini
the Ottawa Journal, purporting to outtîne the
whole course of action that will be taken. As
an aid newspaper man, 1 quite reailize how
ambitious some reporters are, and it is to be
noted that somne of the statements in the
article are preceded by the words "It is believýed," "It is said," and so on. But there is
one statement which is made definitely, and
flot as a matter of belief or of gossip. It
says:
Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen, Government leader
in the Upper House, will have the task of
asking for the expulsion of Senators MeDougald
and Haydon.
Honourable senators, I beliève that an
article of this nature is not conducîve to the
good of this Chamber or of ourselves as
members of it. My purpose in reading the
item has been to ask for a statement by the
chairman of the committee and, if possible,
by the riglit honourable leader of the House,
as to their position and ideas with regard to
the matter in question.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I had not
read the article nor heard of it unitil this
moment. If I had, it would not have disturbed me much. I think it is merely an
instance of adventurous prognostication.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
GUARANTEE BILL, 1931, No. 2
SECOND READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 40, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to
authorize the guarantee by His Mal esty of
securities to be issued under the Canadian
National 'Railways Financing Act, 1931, No. 2.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the right
honourable gentleman tell us what expenditure
this Bill covers?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: The expenditure of $11,000,000, odd, for which the Canadian National Railways were authorized to
issuie bonds by the Bill previously passed by
this Parliament at the present oession. It
appears toa be the practice now-it was flot
in the good aid days--that there should. be a
Railway Bill first a.nd a Finance Bill afterwards. The Railway Bill is the one we have
already passed: it authorized- the railway ta
raise the money. In this case the Finance
Bill authorizes the Minister of Finance ta
guarantee the bonds ta raise the maney.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my right
honourable friend a statement that wouad
inform. us cd the liabilities this legisiation is
in-tended ta cover?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; that
information was given to the House when the
Railway Bill was adopted-the Bill which
authorized the railway to issue bonds to provide the xnoney. The details as ta why the
money was necessary anid how the total was
made up were then given. Ail this Bill does
is ta authorize the Minister of Finance ta
guarantee those bonds which the railway coinpany, by tbe previaus Bill, was authorized ta
issue.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is there any
real necessity for two bills?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. We
used ta, do that sort of thing, as the right
honourable member knows, by an item in the
estimates, but the craze for efficiency, I presume, is responsible for this method.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And the item
in the estimates enlarged the general expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund, whereas
the amount now provided appears simply as
a debit against the railway.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The aid
method was the samne in effect. It authorized
the expenditure by an estimate, and provided
that the, imount might be in the f arm of a
guarantee; and my honourable friend's friends
were very careful to adopt the guarantee
method, becau-se it made a better sbowing in
the figures of the national debt.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
I thought that
this policy was ta the saine effect.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is, toa.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Only it is
backecl up by a Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.

knewn disease. It bas surpassed in its fatalities
tbe white plague, tuberculosis. In support
et tbis statement I would refer bonourable
gentlemen te the remarks et Dr. Cotnam in
tbie House et Commons as repertcd in Revised
iHansard, 1930, page 687. Tbis was a partieularly able speech on the subject and is well
worth reading in ceunection with tbe resolutien under discussion.
Dr. Cotuam shows
deatbs trom tuberculosis te be on the decrease,
while cancer is on the increase. In 1928 the
deatbs in Canada for eacb 100,000 et population, trom tuberculosis were 66, tromn cancer
92. Dr. Ellis MacDonald, a fermer Canadian,
now Directer et Cancer Researcb in tbe University et Penesylvania, is my autbority for
the statement that in Great Britain, wbere
mortality statisties are good, there were 56,253 deatbs trom cancer in 1928. On tbis
basis. hie says, there are 150,000 a year who
die from cancer in tbe United States. Dr.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

Cotnam, in bis speech already referred to,
gives statisties showing deaths in Canada fromn
cancer in 1928 as 8,514. In Pennsylvania,
where good records are kept, the disease bas
increased, according te statistics, 62 per cent
in the ]ast twenty-five years. In the United
States, that is in the registered areas, it has
increased from 64 per 100,000 population in
1900 to 117 per 100,000 population in 1925,
an mecrease in twenty-flve years of 84 per
cent.

Now as to Canada, Dr. Peter McGibbon, in
his speech in tbe Huse of Commons as reported in Revised Hans'ard, 1930, page 692,
gives ie detail tbe statisties applicable to Ontario. In 1902 the deatbs from cancer in
Ontario wcre 54.8 to 100,000 of population;
in 1929 tbcy were 99 te 100.000 of population,
or an inecase jn the twenty-seven years of
80 per cent, about the samne as in the United
States. W/bile, no doubt, some of this inecase ean be attributed te more complote
statistics, tbere appears te be ne question
as to the rapid increase of this plague.
As te tbe effectiveness et radium, as a layman I was most impressed witbi tbe report ot
the Stockholm clinic that is tbe Swedish
Canon
Cody, wbo visited
bh'adquarters.
Europe last year as the Chairman of the
Ontarie Radium Commission, tells me tbat
Sweden is tbe most enligbtened country in
Europe in tbe use of radium. Tbe Stockholm
(uinie treats almost entirelv with radium. Over
a period of five years it treated 1,854 victims
ef cancer.
Cures varied from 24 per cent
te 68 per cent, depending on the location
of the disease. Tbe average cure wvas 36ý
per cent ef ahl cases.
To reduce it te tbe human equation, ]et us
see wbat a sufficient supply of radium means
in the savieg ef human ]ife from cancer alone,
net considering other uses that are being developed for this powerful agency.
Dr. MacDonald says that with 100 additional
grains of radium, if properly applied in skilled
hands, there will be saved each year in the
United States alone 30,000 of those now dying
trom cancer. This ratio applied te Canada
means tbat with a reasonable supply of radium
in expert bands we could save, of the 8,500
persons (a conservative estimate) now dying
every year from cancer, ne fewer than 1,700.
In tbree European clinies the record for five
years shows a saving trom the use of radium
ef one patient for every six who now die, or
16î per cent, which is net very much different
from Dr. MacDonald's figure of 20 per cent.
It is esfimated that there are five tiînes as
many people affected with cancer as die annually. W/bat a beacon of hope a supply of 20

APRIL 14, 1932

grains of radium would be to the 45,000 Canadians who are to-day suffering from this dread
disease.
The supply of radium is very limited. In
Europe there are said to be only 35 gramns
in use; New York City has 12-3; ini Philadeiphia there are 5.6 gramns. No cancer centre
in the world is said to have sufficient radium
except the Curie Institute in Paris, which has
12 gramns. The Memorial Hospital in New
York City has 8 grains, which they say is insufficient.

The amount of radium needed to-day in
Great Britain is said to be 40 gramns. The
minimum additional requirement in the
United States is 100 gramns. It is estimated
that wvith the requisite number of complete
cancer stations throughout the Republic, the
minnium reqijireinent would be 240 grains,
a proper supply 960 gramns.
A good supply for Canada would probably
be 30 to 40 grains, sufficient for four or ýfive
cancer centres. Our Department of Pensions
and Jlealth estimates that we have 5-54 gramns
in Canada to-day. It gives as its estimate of
the additional requirement, which it says is
very conservative, 16J grains. The Ontario
Radium Commission estimates Canadian requirements at 16 gramns. Radium is said to
retain its effectiveness for 1,700 years; sO
there is practically no depreciation. It, therefore, Tends itself to 99-year leasing or longtime payment, and at a reasonable price could
be easily financed.
With the great reduction in price which
would appear almost certain to resuit from
the proper development of our deposits in
Canada, a very much wider distribution of
radium can be effected.
The Ontario Radium Commission, and
Canon Cody in particular, were greatly impressed with the need for a thorough
educational programn to precede any wider distribution of radium and thus have it placed
only in expert hands. This they say is imperative if disastrous Tesuits are to be
:avoided. Canon Cody referred to the experience in England, where proper training
had not preceded the distribution of radium,
as unsatisfactory compared with the most
excellent resuits obtained from the use of
radium in Sweden, where it is ail in expert
hands.
The report of the Radium Commission
recently tabled in the Legisiature at Toronto
devotes several pages to the need of education
in this matter, and of restricting the use of
radium to skilled operators. Concluding, they
say, "Everywhere this fact was impressed on
the Commission."

187

The shortage of radium is apparently due
to one thing, and one thing only: the price.
The present price of the Belgian Trust, which
has prevailed for somne years, is $70,000 a
gram retail; wholesale-four grains or moreit is $50,000 a gram. This means that the
smallest wholesale purchase costs 3200,000.
The eight gramns said to be required for a
cancer centre mean an investment of 3400,000.
rrhesc prices are prohibitive.
Apparently
radium is available, as the Belgian Trust
are said to have recently been lendîng radium
to certain hospitals.
I think honourable gentlemen wilI be interested in an article on this subi ect which
appeared in the Industrial and Engineering
Chemistry Magazine of July, 1929. 1 will
read the concluding paragraphs only.
We are further informed that the plant of
the Union Minière du Haut Katanga in
Belgium, after having produced an amount of
radium rumoured at one hundred gramns in
excess of the market demand at the time, closed
and was not reopened for operations until the
stock of radium saîts on hand had heen taken
at the prices established by the company.
While the belief that the Belgian Congo contains great quantities of ore froin which radium
can be extracted and that these deposits are
now hidden in order to maintain high prices
may be erroneous, nevertheless it je known that
the one or two outside men who have been
permitted to visit the mines did s0 only after
making solemn promises to maintain secrecy.
We are informed hy one who visited the plant
in the early days that the cost at that timne
was not over five, thousand dollars per gram
of radium. While the ore then shipped was
probably richer than that which goes to the
plant to-day, it is nevertheless a simple matter

to concentrate uranium oxide ore to any richnese desired, water heing available as it le i
Katanga.

The article continues:
The manufacturers and producers of a luxury
may aek a price which. returns an unreasonable
profit and no one complains seriously, for we
cau dispense with luxuries. A hoarder of food
who endeavours to extract a fabulous profit for
a necessity, would be given no mercy. What
shahl be said then of a conlpany which, though

numbering among its stockholders citizens of
other lands, is nevertheless controlled by those
identified with a country which sought and
was given the help of the world, and which now
demnande the utmost the traffie will bear for a
material which to many toeans the difference
between life and death? It je not a pleasing
picture. There bas been no great outlay of time
and treasure involved in the location of a

deposit which. somne lucky circumstance placed
on Belgian-controlled territory, nor bas the coinpany been required to perform tedjous and
time-consuining research in the development of
a reduction method. Neither bas it been found
necessary to seek a market for a new product.
That a reasonable profit je deserved by those
who conduet commercial enterprises, whether
they manufacture medlicines or machinery, is

SENATE
accepted. It is when a life-giving element is
maintained artificially at a price which limits
its availability to suffering mankind that we
raise our voice in protest.
The Ontario Radium Commission met with
a cold reception in Belgium last year. They
saw nothing; the manufacture of radium was
a closed door to them. Quite different was
the experience in Czecho-Slovakia, where they
were shown everything. Unfortunately that
country produces only about 5 per cent of the
world's supply of radium.
Dr. Frank L. Hess, of the United States
Bureau of Mines, writing in 1930, states:
Particulars regarding the Belgian Congo
deposits owned by the Union Minière du Haut
Katanga are still heavily veiled in secrecy, and
no word of reserves or tenor of ore is allowed
to reaci the public. Governmental figures for
shipments of minerals from Belgian Congo incuide 944 (metrie) tons of uranium ore in 1929
and 1,296 (msetrie) tous in 1930.
A tabulation of the Belgium company sales
as taken from their annual reports, beginning
with 20 grams in 1923, when they started
operation, gives total production up to and
including 1930 of 270 grams. In 1931 they are
said to have produced about the same as in
1930, that is 60 grains. Czecho-Slovakia's produ.ction of about 31 grarus annually would
make the estimated world production last year
64 graimss.
So that honourable gentlemen may get a
proper perspective of radium production as a
mining business, permit me to state that the
total world 'production is estimated at between 550 to 600 grams, or about 1- poundsHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Yearly?

That is the
No.
Hon. Mr. McRAE:
total, since the beginning of radium production, up to 1928. The annual production being
estimated at 60 grams, the world produced
only two ounces of radium last year.
Radium is also used in luminous paint. A
considerable quantity was so consumed during
the W ar. As a result of this, it is estimated,
the amount of radium in the world to-day is
substantially less than 300 grams, or fiveeiglsths of one pound, about a teacupful.
Of the world production from the beginning
in 1898 up to 1928-thirty years-250 grams
were produced by the United States of
America, now out of the business; Belgium
produced 245 grams and Czecho-Slovakia
some 45 grams.
The rich pitch-blende deposits in Belgian
Congo are of recent discovery. Production
started in 1923. Belgium passed the United
States in 1929, after which production in the
United States ceased. Here is what Mr. C. L.
Parsons, who developed the Colorado deposits
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

in the United States, writing from Washington
on November 21, 1930, has to say about resuming manufacture in that country:
With ore oosting no more than it did fifteen
years ago, and it is to-day a drug on the market,
there is no reason why radium produced in such

quantities as you have in mind should cost, with
all charges of aiortization, more than $35,000
per grain, and in my opinion it could be produced for at least $5,000 less. This opinion is
based on experience....
If we could have any assurance of selling
radium we produced at $50,000 a gran, 1, with
certain associates, would be manufacturing
radium to-day commercially and making good
money on our investmsents at this price. The
trouble, you know. is that anyone going into
the radium business in this country and putting
the product on the market will be immedi.ately
undersold at any price down to $20,000 a gram,
and perhaps at $15.000 a gram, by the Belgian
company, whose costs, to the best of my information, are less than $10,000 a gram to-day.
The Hon. The SPEAKER: I would ask the
honourable senator to kindly suspend his remarks in order that we may receive the Right
Hon. the Deputy Governor, who is waiting to
give the Royal Assent.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

CONTROL OF RADIUM PROM
CANADIAN ORES
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF
COMMISSION

The Senate resumed consideration of the
motion of Hon. Mr. MeRae:
That in the opinion of this House the Government should declare its intention to control
the production and distribution of all radium
procured from Canadian ores; and to that end

APRIL 14, 1932
should immediately appoint a Canadian Radium
Commission to investigate and recommend to
the next session of Parliament the best methods
to adopt to give effect to such control.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
when I discontinued before the Royal Assent,
I had just completed reading a letter from
Mr. Parsons, the gentleman who developed
the Colorado deposits of radium. He said
that if anyone attempted to go into the
radium business in the United States lie would
be undersold by the Belgians, who are able to
produce at a cost of less than $10,000 a gram.
Mr. Parsons is well qualified to speak on this
subject.
The United States had to work with pitchblende ore running around 2 per cent, which
later is said to have dropped to about 1i per
cent. When America was profitably producing
radium from this low-grade ore the price was
around $110,000 per gram. Later, when the
Belgian Trust reduced the price to $70,000 per
gram, the Americans had to quit, as their ore
was of too low a grade. Belgian Congo ore
prior to 1929 was said to have averaged 40
per cent uranium oxide, twenty times richer
than the American deposits. As to the present
grade of Belgian Congo ore, I will read an
extract from the report of the Radium Subcommittee of Civil Research, London, 1929,
page 13:
Referring to the Belgian Congo radium
deposits, Monsieur Sengier, the Managing
Director, added that there was not an unlimited
amount of ore in view. Originally the ore was
3o rich that 10 tons would produce a gram of
radium. Now, less rich ore had to be used,
and about 30 or 40 tons of hand picked ore, as
shipped, were necessary to produce 1 gram.
Now I come to a more interesting part of my
story, dealing with the deposits that we have
in our own country. Until the discovery of
pitch-blende in the Great Bear Lake section
in our Northwest Territories, the Belgian
Congo stood alone in its unchallenged supremacy as a radium producer. There were no
competitors of the Belgian Trust, worthy of
Originally it took ten tons of
the name.
Belgian Congo ore running 40 per cent uranium
oxide to produce one gram. On this basis
United States 2 per cent ore would require
200 tons to produce a gram. It will therefore
be readily seen why the Americans had to go
out of business.
Let us see how the recent discovery of
pitch-blende in the Great Bear Lake district
compares with the Belgian Congo ore. Six
samples taken by Government engineers and
assayed by our Department of Mines show
ore running from 30½ per cent to 62 per cent
uranium oxide, with an average of 46-42
per cent uranium oxide, and the Government
engineer states that the higher grade samples
coming from below the water level indicate

189

higher percentages at depth. This is richer
than the original Belgian Congo deposits.
Professor Spence, of our Department of
Mines, reports as follows:
To date, the No. 2 vein has received the
greater attention and is at present the most
important. It will probably be made the site
of initial mining operations, whenever these
are started. Its importance is increased by the
fact that for part of its length it carries rich
silver ore associated with the pitch-blende.
From the west outcrop at water's edge, the vein
strikes up-hill to a maximum elevation of about
100 feet above the level of the lake. Some of
the richest pitch-blende found, both on the No.
1 and No. 2 veins, was taken out at the shore
outcrops, and the width of massive ore was
as great at these points as at any other. This
suggests the veins may improve both in size
and grade of ore with depth. The fact that
pitch-blende bas recently been found two miles
inland from La Bine Point, and on the strike
of the veins there, suggests that the vein-system
may have a very considerable persistence.
While the work done to date has, of course,
been very meagre, nevertheless three veins
have been explored, one of them for a
distance of 1,400 feet, and out-croppings along
the break have been located as far as two
miles farther on. A fourth vein is also in
evidence. Reports indicate that another pitchblende deposit is found some ten or twelve
miles farther south. As to the amount of
tonnage in sight, I read from the report of
Professor Spence:
While at present no estimate of actual available tonnage can be made, the No. 1 and No. 2
veins may be expected to yield several thousands
of tons at least of high-grade pitch-blende, as
well as a lesser amount of milling ore. Underground exploration upon their extension inland
and under the lake, as well as prospecting of
other known veins, will probably materially
increase these amounts. Beyond any question,
the pitch-blende deposits at La Bine Point constitute a very valuable source of radium.
Honourable gentlemen will not readily
appreciate what a few thousand tons of this
rch pitch-blende ore actually mean when
reduced to radium. Taking this pitch-blende
ore as averaging 40 per cent uranium oxide,
according to the Belgian reports, ten tons
would give one gram of radium. Six hundred
tons would, therefore, suffice to supply the
entire world production and sales for last
year. This means that twelve modern gondola railway cars of fifty tons capacity each
would carry the entire pitch-blende required
for last year's world production to the Canadian plant, wherever it may be established.
One single train of forty cars loaded with this
Great Bear Lake pitch-blende will produce, on
this basis, 200 grams of radium, or three and
one-half times the entire production in the
world last year; or the manufacture of one
carload of ore a day would give an annual
production of over 1,800 grams of radium-

190

SENATE

three times what the world has produced in
thirty years. and about thirty times the production of last year.
Regard being had to the imperative demand
for intensive educational work to precede a
wider distribution of radium, one train load
a year of Great Bear Lake pitch-blende will
produce more radium than the world will
require for some years to come.
I give these figures to show the absurdity
of considering the production of radium from
our pitch-blende ore as a mining industry.
Pitch-blende is a medicinal ore, required
chiefly for medicinal purposes. Not by the
greatest stretch of the imagination can it be
pictured as an industry which will employ
any considerable number of men, or be of
great commercial value to the country.
The silver deposits in this district are
phenomenal.
As pitch-blende is generally
associated with the silver ore, it is possible
that when mining is well under way more
pitch-blende will be produced in connection
with the mining of silver than the world
then requires, and consequently our Government may some day have to make provision
for conservation of surplus pitch-blende. He
would be a very foolish prospector who would
now go into the Great Bear Lake district in
search of more pitch-blende.
The Department of Mines estimates that
radium can be produced from Great Bear

Lake ore at $10,000 per gram, which will be
one-seventh of the Belgian retail price, and
one-fifth of their present wholesale price.
With pitch-blende running better 'than forty
per cent uranium oxide, it would take less
than ten tons to the gram. The sacked ore
at the mines would cost, say, $100 a ton. By
water freight--shipping the ore out in the
summer months as return cargo-it should be
poible to get this ore to Ottawa for less than
$100 a ton freight. These two items being
added together, the maximum cost to ilay
down in Ottawa the ten tons of raw product.
pitch-blende, required to produce one gra'm of
radium, would be $2,000.
Hon. Mr. CAýSGRAIN: Why bring it to
Ottawa?
Why net manufacture
on the
ground?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I am going te leave
that to this commission that I desire to have
appointed.
I am just bringing it close
home. The freight would be very much the
same across the country, whether the ore was
brought to Winnipeg or Ottawa. I am just
trying to draw a picture of having it brought
here.
The manufacture is a sliming process requiring net a very large plant investment. With
credit for the by-products, and with a reasonlion.

Mr. McRAE.

able output, it should be possible to produce
radium at little if any in excess of $5,000 a
gram. For a moment stop and think what
this would mean to humanity. Radium at
about one-fourteenth, or from seven to eight
per cent, of the present Belgian retail price.
Tîat is a possibility. The probability is a
reduction in the present Belgian wholesale
price of at least 80 per cent-to $10,000 a
gram, or less.
The Government might well consider reserving all pitehJblende frorm further stakings.
That would net interfere in the least with the
mineral development of the Northwest Territories.
As to claims already staked, it is agreed
the holders should be treated generously.
However, as the Government, through its
Radium Commission, must carry on the
necessary education, and regulate the distribution of radium so as to confine it to
qualified users, it will probably be found that
the Government will carry on the manufacture under the direction of the Department of
Mines-a verv efficient staff-or through the
agenry of some controlled private corporation,
or perhaps under the direction of a permanent
Canadian Radium Commission.
In this event the arbitrary price at the
mines, which, for my immediate calculations,
I put at $100 a ton-five -times the value of
the gold content of one ton of ore from the
Lake Shore Mines, one of the greatest gold
mines in -the world-Thould prove an equitable,
if not a too generous, allowance 'to the people
who have already staked claims. Of course,
this is vastly different from what we now hear
about the values. There are twenty -tons of
this ore now in Ottawa. It will probably
produce, if manufactured, two grams of
radium. They tallk about this shipment being
worth $100,000; that is the Belgian wholesale price of two grams of manufactured
radium. Surely we are net going to start
in on this basis in Canada. It is unthinkable
that we should allow the pitch-blende deposits
of the Great Bear Lake to be developed on a
basis which would enable Canadians to join
with the Belgians as exploiters of suffering
humanity.
In closing may I express the hope that I
have made out a case for action, and that
honourable gentlemen, after full discussion,
may sec fit to approve of this resolution, and
in so doing serve notice to the world that
we are determined to conserve and protect
this great inheritance of the Canadian people
for the service and wefare of mankind.
On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the debate
was adjourned.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honaurable
gentlemen, I have some information asked for
by the honourabie senator from Queen's

more satisfactorily given before the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. I therefore move that this order be discharged, and

the Petro]eum and Napbtha Inspection Act.
.He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
very3 technical Bill, but the effect of it is
sml.It appears that there is a quality of
petroleurn produced in the Red Sand district
of Alberta that is not of the weigbt required
by the Act as it stands, but so close to it
that it can be produced and used without

CROWN DEBTS BILL

PATENT BILL
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 4, an
Act to amend the Patent Act.
Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
Sections 1 to 5, inclusive, were agreed to.
On the preamble:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I had the responsibility of placing bef ore this Cbamber some years ago the revision
of the Patent Act, and at tbat time had to
examine into tbe workings of -the Department as to the application of the Act. Ahthough I have practised at the Bar for a
number of years, I hav e no technical knowledge of the practical effect of the Patent Act
as between itigants. I have, however,' read
the statement made by the Secretary of State
in tbe other bouse, where this Bi'll was referred to a speeial committee', and I desire
to say that, s0 f ar as my light enables mie
to speak, I think these amendments are improvements on the old Act.
The preamble was agreed to.
The tithe was agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendmcnt.

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 25, an Act respecting
debts due to the Crown.
Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, I shou.ld
put on record the explanation of this Bill.
It appears that, in contradistinction to the
law as between individuals or companies, the
State, if there is a debt owing to it. is not
authorized to set off that debt against one
owing by it, or against moneys payable by
it. This bas been the practice, but it has
been called in question, and the opinion bas
been given that there is no authority for it.
The Bill as originally introduced enabled this
to be done even in respect of a debt owing
to the Dominion by a province. That feature
has been eliminated. The Bill provides that
debts owing to, the Dominion by a corporation, a municipahity or an individual may be
set off against. amounts payable by the Crown
to that corporation, municipality or individual.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: Honourable gentlemen, in fdlowing the progress of this Bill
through the other üuse I noticed tbat, some
protests having corne from. the provinces, the
Bill was amended as indicated by the right
bonourable gentleman. I confess that if the
Bill had come here in its original form, I
would not have insisted upon the elimination
of the provinces from its provisions.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agrced to, and the Bill
was rcad tbe third time, and passed.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nor wou'ld I.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I might have
suggested that if a province notified the
Dominion that the dlaimn was one that it

intended to have settled by a board, or by
the Supreme Court, the set-off shouild not be
operative.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am in agreement with the honourable gentleman.
I
think the Bill would be better if the amendment had net been made; but as we have it
in its present form, it is probably well to
pass it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
OPIUM AND NARICOTIC DRUG BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND
READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 26, an Act to amend
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.
He sa-id: This Bill is somewhat important.
It appears that under the auspices of the
Leagie of Nations there was a 'conference of
fiftyv-c\en countries, at which Canada's delegates were Dr. Riddel, Canadian representative at Gecera, and Col. Sharman, Chief of
the Narcotie Division of the Department of
Pensions and National Headth. This conference took into consideration the control,
limitation and manufacture of narcotic drugs
and arrivod at decisions which necessitated
the adoption of certain legislation on the part
of the countries. It transpired that Canada
alrcady had in force nearly all the requirements that the conference deemed wise. The
principal thing still to be done, and to be
effectel by this Act, is to bring codeine under
the import and export licence system in so far
as its movement from one country to another
is concerned, and at the same time to 'preserve
its present complete freedom in Canada, under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. There are
also certain improvements in definitions, and
as well two minor changes, directdy necessitated by the work of the conference. One of
these changes is in section 8, and is designed
to permit retai,l druggists to sell without
prescriptions medicated preparations containing a specified small proportion of cannabis
sativa, as they are already authorized to do in
connection with similar medicated preparations
containing a small specified proportion of
opium or morphine. The other is a drafting
change in section 20 to remove an existing
misunder;tanding with regard to the disposal
of seized narcotics and paraphernalia for opium
smoking.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I have followed very closely the
work of the League of Nations on the control
of opium and other narcotics. In the three

Mr. DANDURAND.

years that Canada was a member of the
Council of the League I had the responsibility
of reporting to the Council on narcotics and
opium. I may say that the League is very
active in trying to cope with the universal
drug evil. My last action at the Council was
to move for the creation of a board of control,
composed of eight or nine members, for the
purpose of trying to keep track of the production, manufacture and distribution of
narcotics. I do not know what activ.ities have
been carried on during the last twelve months.
There is a very wide field in which to work,
and although the facts with regard to the distribution of morphine are somewhat discouraging and the trade is difficult te cope
with, the section of the League that is dealing
with opium and narcoties is endeavouring to
move towards practical ends. Observation is
being maintained over the countries of manufacture, and more and more courage has been
shown in pointedly denouncing some manufacturers. Some time ago I had in my hand
a report in which certain manufacturers who
had been illegally distributing noxious drugs
were denounced by name-the first time that
such a thing was ever donc. One of those
manufacturers was in Switzerland, another in
France, and I think the third was in either
Holland or Germany. Of course it is contended that the trade will never be restricted
or controlled until the nations agree to limit
their production.
An inquiry was held in
different countries, but at the last moment
China refused to allow the investigation to
be carried on within its borders. However,
the League of Nations is doing its level best
to reach satisfactory conclusions.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS moved that the
debate be adjourned until Tuesday, April 19.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I might explain that I have just been advised there must
first of alIl be a resolution adopting the provisions of the Geneva Convention.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

YUKON QUARTZ MINING BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 30, an Act to amend
the Yukon Quartz Mining Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
simple Bill. It appears that in the Territories

APRIL 14, 1932
quartz mining is administered under the
Dominion Lands Act, which. provides that
regulations may be made thereunder by Order
in Council; 'but in the Yukon quartz mining
is administered under the provisions of the
Yukon ýQuartz iMining Act. The regulations
under this Act are enibodjed in legisiation,
and consequentiy can be aitered oniy by
legislation. This situation is too rigid. At
the present time the value of ail metals except goid is excessively iow, so Iow as to be
aimost non-existent. Therefore the representation work required to be done by mining
companies or individuais simply cannot be
done, and a certain eiasticity wiii have to be
afforded to permit of fair dealing towards the
hoiders of minerai claims. The Bill provides
that regulations may be made, and it
empowers the Governor in Councii to grant
under certain circumnstances a moratorium in
connection with representation work and thus
avoid canceiiation of dlaims.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can the riglit
honourabie gentleman tell us what the words
"ýrepresenýtation work" mean?
ýRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a phrase
used in the departinent. It means the work
that is required to be done each year, and
the expenditures required to be made, by the
hoider of a minerai dlaim. I do not know
why it i.s caiied "representation work."
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. H. H. HO.RSEY moved the second
reýading *of Bill 31, an Act respecting certain
patents of Autographie Register Systezns,
Limited.
H1e said: Honourabie senators, the objeet
of this Bill, appiied for by Autographie
Register Systeras, Limited, is to repeal a
specia1 Act covering two patents, which speciai
Act Ibecame necessary because, through no
fauit of the company, these patents continued
in use for more than one year before they
were fiied. However, on the saine day that
the speciail Act was passed, the 4th -of June,
1921, the Patent Act was so amended as to
permit these patents to be issued ijder it,
and t-his was done. In order te avoid any confusion as to, which Act covers these patents,
the company is asking for the repeal of the
,speciai Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection to the second reading, although I
cannet pretend te have any knowledge of the

EXCISE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 27, an
Act to amend the Excise Act.
Hon. Mr. McLennan in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-recovery of penalties:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is not
new.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6-penalties belong to Crown:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has there been
any representation from the provinces in regard to the division of fines?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think not.

On section 7-when spirits may be entered

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
significance of that?

What is the

APRIL 15, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It merely
extends te retail druggists, registered, licensed
or authorized, the privilege that heretofore
bas accrued only te universities and scientific
research laboratories, of purchasing from distîllers, under regulations te be made by the
Minister, the goods te be used for the purposes mentioned. The explanation seems te
be sufficient. I cannot add te it. It sys:
The restriction on the sale of unmatured
spirits is intended to protect the public front
the sale of unmnatured spirits for beverage purposes, but freshly distilled spirits are as good as
matured spirite for the purposes for whicb they
are required by druggista and the existing
requirement of at least two, years' warehousing
increases of necessity the price te the consumer
of medicines, etc., without benefiting either the
druggist or the distiller.
The purpose is quite clear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To my knowledge, retail druggists have complained considerably of the price of liquors. Maybe it
covers that point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: As a matter
of fact, they have smuggled large quantities
of liquor into the country because, they complained, the price was too high. Perhaps this
Bil will meet the objection te some extent.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By enabling
themn te get it fromn other sources.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: ls smuggling stili going on?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think se.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The word is
eut of the dictionary now.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I should like to ask
the leader of the Gevernment whether "twe
years' warehousing" means two years in Canada. Or might it include twe years' warehousing in the country where the spirite are
manufactured, and from. which they are imported?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I think
se; se long as the evidence is complet 'e.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Se long as it
is matured.
Section 7 was agreed te.
Sections 8 and 9 were agreed to.
On section lO-removal of tobacco in bond:
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The section
governing the removal of tobacco in bond has
aiso, in the pst caused considerable irritation.
Will this repeal, without the substitution of
another clause, cure what was complained of
jy the importers of tobacco, I wonder.
41767-13à

195

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What was the
complaint?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The complaint

wvas that there were irregularities, and that it
was possible for one importer to secure benefits
that another could net get, depending sometimes on the size of the business of the importer. Ail the growers of tobacco, particularly in southwestern Ontario, complained
of the regulation which alIowed this removal.
If this amendment is jntended to cure what
they said was an evil, the change may be a
good one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It seems to
go far en-ough. I have riead ever the debate
-if it may be called that-on this subject in
the Commons, and the only reference to this
section is as follows:
Sections 4 to 13 agreed to.
Fairly adequate explanations were given of
some previous ýamendments, which already
have been scrutinized by this Cemmittee. I
should think, from. reading this clause as it
stood before, a.nd from the mere fact that it
is repealed without any substitution, the diffiCulty must certainly be removed. One naturally questions whether there is an adequate
safeguard now. The way it read before was
this:
No tobacco of any description when put up
in packages containing lesa than five pounds,
and ne cigare when put up in packages containing less than twenty-five cigare each, shall be
removed in bond from one warehouse to another,
wbether within the same or any other excise
division: Provided, however, that such tebacco

and cigare may be so removed under such regulations as may be made by the Minister when
such tebacco or cigare are intended for shipment as ship's stores.
Apparently only the Minister could make regulations permitting the removal for certain
purposes. Now the restraint is lifted, and, se
far as this Bill goes, there is nothing at ail te
prevent the removal.
Se there can be no
complaint on that score.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If I remember
correctly, the complaint was founded on the
exercise of authority by the Minister; flot
that it was exercised irregularly by him, but
that there was misrepresentation by those who
wished te have the goodIs removed for purPoses other than those named in the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Other than
for sbipment as ship's stores?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: For miy part, I think
I would wather heve tihe old regulation as i
was. I do net see the necessity for any persen
removing such a simati quan.tity.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There must
be a necessity, or those complaints would not
have arisen.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But I was just wondering, and I should like to know, what reason there is for it. If there is nothing very
urgent about the matter, I should be glad to
see it left over.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection at all. In fact, I think that when
bills come to this House with so little explanation, delay here might have a salutary
effect. I move that the Committee rise and
report progress.
Progress was reported.

NARCOTIC DRUG CONVENTION
RESOLUTION

OF APPROVAL

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that the follo.wing message had been
received from the House of Commons:
Resolved that a message be sent to the Senate
informing their honours that this House has
adopted a resolution approving the international
convention for limiting the manufacture and
regulating the distribution of narcotic drugs,
Geneva, July 13, 1931, signed on behalf of
Canada by the plenipotentiaries nained therein,
and requesting that their honours will unite
with this House in the approvail of the above
mentioned convention.
Hon.

Mr. GORDON.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators will remember that the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans)
moved the adjournment of the debate on the
second reading of a Bill dealing with the
subject-matter of the message which has just

transpired that while the resolution ratifying
the convention upon which the Bill was based
had passed the Commons, it had net been
transmitted to this House before the Bill was
transmitted, though it should have been.
Hence there was a miscarriage of the order
of our procedure.
Little explanation is needed of the motion
that I am about to make, other than that
already given in relation to the Bill. I have,
however, some fuller material bearing on the
contents of the convention-material which
has not, I think, been put on record in the
other House. As previously explained, this
convention was the last achievement in a
long progress of endeavour to curtail the
traffic in poisenous and deleterious drugs,
and was, I think I may say, the first of that
long series of efforts which sought te curtail
the traffic at its source, namedy, in the manufacture.
The convention goes into effect when signed
by twenty-five countries, of whom four must
be from the following: France, Germany,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, Turkey and
the United States of America. At present 44
of the 57 countries that participated have
executed the convention. The Senate of the
United States approved of the ratification on
the 31st of March, and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom has announced
its intention of ratifying the convention as
soon as the requisite amendment te the
Dangerous Drug Act has become law. Turkey
alone, of the number of states of whom four
are essential, has as yet not signed the convention. In case the signatures and the ratifications following signature are not in hand
in sufficient number by the 13th of July of
next year, the matter will have to be again
brought to the attention of the Council of
the League of Nations. Hence the importance
of Canada ratifying the convention as promptly as possible.
I wish to place on record a synopsis of the
purposes of the convention. It supplements
and develops all earlier efforts, especially
those that are embodied in the Hague Convention of the 23rd of January, 1912, and
the Geneva Convention of the 19th of February, 1925, to each of which this country is a
party. Its purposes are:

APRIL 19, 1932
(1) The transmission to a permanent central board by each signatory power of annual
advance estimates of its needs of all narcotic
drugs for medical and scientific purposes.
(2) The checking of such estimates by a
newly created international supervisory body,
which may require any further information or
details.
(3) The preparation by the supervisory
body of estimates for any countries which
have not submitted estimates.
(4) The transmission to governments of the
estimates mentioned above, together with an
account of any explanation given or required.
(5) Limitation of manufacture of narcotic
drugs to the amount required for medical and
scientific purposes.
(6) The checking by the permanent central
board of the import and export returns of
governments, which shall not permit exportation to any country after being notified by the
permanent central board that the country has
imported its estimated requirements.
(7) Prohibition of exports of more than five
kilograms of any narcotie drug to any country
not applying the import-certificate system
until after authorization has been obtained
from the permanent central board.
(8) The control of newly discovered narcotie drugs.
(9) Prohibition of manufacture of narcotic
drugs of no medical or scientific value.
(10) Control of codeine, which has been the
subject of long international disagreement.
Codeine is a derivative of opium.
(11) The control by governments of any
existing excess stocks.
(12) Prohibition of export of heroin, except
on responsibility of the government of the
importing country.
(13) Limitation of supplies of raw materials
in factories.
(14) Destruction of confiscated drugs, or
their conversion (under Government control)
into non-narcotic substances, or their use for
medical or scientific purposes by the Government or under its control, all confiscated
diacetylmorphine (heroin) to be destroyed or
converted.
(15) Labelling of containers of narcotic
drugs.
(16) Accounting for all narcotic drugs used
to manufacture preparations for which export
certificates are not required.
(17) Establishment by governments of central narcotics administrations.
of

(18) Transmission
annual reports and the exchange between
signatories of information regarding illicit
traffic, narcotics factories in operation and
laws and regulations of each signatory.

When it is recalled that nothing has proven
more difficult for organized civilization than
the curtailment of this fearful drug traffic, it
will be realized that we owe close attention
to and intelligent criticism of all efforts
designed to curtail still further the ravages
of the drug habit. It is estimated that we
now have in Canada 8,000 drug addicts. That
is less than one in a thousand, and the numbers are not increasing. At all events, the
best authorities, as submitted to me by the
Department of Health, are to the effect that
curtailment efforts of that department, which
have been assisted by the co-operation of the
provinces and municipalities, have been effective in preventing an extension of the habit.
It is believed, indeed, that the ravages have
been somewhat curtailed. The drugs covered
by the convention are not manufactured in
Canada, and when the convention is in
operation, if the strict control provided for
is actually made operative, then the importation into our country will be much more
easily regulated in the future than it could
be in the past.
I move:
Resolved that it is expedient that Parliament
do a.pprove of the international convention for
limiting the manufacture and regulating the
distribution of nareotic drugs, Geneva, July 13,
1931, signed on behalf of Canada by the
plenipotentiaries named therein, and that this
House do approve of the same.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
senators, I have not had before me the convention which has been submitted by my right
honourable friend for approval by the Senate.
A few days ago, when we were discussing a
Bill based upon this convention, I stated that
I had followed somewhat closely the work of
the League of Nations in curbing the drug
evil, but had no accurate knowledge of what
had been done during the last twelve months
or so. The convention which is now presented
reminds me that it has required a period of
years to bring certain countries to the point
where they have been able to agree to control
of the drug traffic, and there was a widespread complaint on the part of people who
were keeping in close touch with the production and manufacture of these drugs, against
the delay in seriously coping with the problem.
Of course, it was necessary to win the cordial
approval of the great powers at Geneva before
any worthwhile attempt at control could be
made. Everyone who is interested in restricting the drug îtraffic and the terrible evils that
arise from it was elated to hear of this convention, which indicated that at last there
would be co-operation in efforts at curtailment
from countries that have hitherto been some-

in transmitting those drugs from one country
to another. In Canada they have been very
active. The drugs corne generally by ocean,
the Pacifie or the Atlantic, and there is stili
a rather large quantity entcring our country,
but large seizures are occasionally made.

began. So at the present time, whlle there is
a great deal ta be thankful for, the enterprise
of our people creeps along instead of showing
its former vigorous and self-confident stride.
To put it in another way, al'ong aibout 1927
and 1928 we became f ully aware of the feast
that had been spread for us, as a result of
what Providence had donc for this country in
the way of naturai riches and what thc energy
of our f orebears had made availaIble, and we
sat down to a ibounteaus repast. The feast
began with decent conviviality, but later an
it ibecame a debauch, and for a long time
naw *we have been suffering from a "hangover" that is too unpleasant to dwell upon.
This has came about in Canada, it seems
to me, because the public have been caught
up and carried away by the valuations of the
exohanges and have not paid sufficient attention ta real values. There is only anc thing
certain about every stock excibange transaction, namely, that two brokers each get a
commission out of it. In the risc and faIl of
prices there is no increase or decrease in the
actual value of the thing rqpresented lby the
stock certificate; the real wealth ibehind it
remains the same whethcr the price is forty
or sixty, or whatever it rnay be.
When anc looks inta the situation one finds
that those who took on responsibility in a
financial way and have suffcred loss whcrc
thcy had hoped -for gain are in a condition,
flot of panic-we have nat arrived at paniebut of the most trenchant and penetrating
anxiety as to whcther they will be aible ta
their responsibilities ta their
dischargc
families, their businesses and their country.
For this reason it occurred to me that the
Senate Committee an Commerce and Trade
Relations, of which I have the honour ta be
chairman, imight be of use in the way of
crcating a sounder feeling 'by reasan af the
publicity which could be given ta flhc expert
information that it could seoure, which information, I amn convinced, wauld be satisfactory and encauraging. It is for this reason
that I have brought this matter ta the attention of the House and shaîl move the motion
that stands in my name.
I amn convinced that in essentials the
country is sound. The great mai arity of aur
people are at ýwark. Thcy believe in Canada.
There is evidence in one place or anather of
their surplus earnings. For example, take the
amaunt of prcmniums paid for life insurance,
and the fact that the deposits in aur savings
banks are increasing from month ta month
by millions of dollars. These are signs of
the real saundncss and wealth of this country.
Money is being put inta ultra-canservative

199

investments, so to speak, instead of being used
for the ordinary developinents to which it is
put in normal times. I do not think I arn
wrong in attributing part of the uneasiness of
to-day, flot to use a stronger term, to the
fact that the "over-the-counter buyer," as he
is called, the man 'who saves his rnoney, and
in periods of depression buys his two or
three shares, or whatever numJber it may be;
of sound stocks to put away, has almast
ceased to exist. 'In fact, I arn told that those
who are organized to deal with that man are
hunting 'for him.
Further, I would draýw the attention of the
House ta the evidence fram Great Britain.
The Englishman has always been characterized as slow on the 'uptake, but nobody 'has
being over-anxious or of
ever accused him oKf
getting panicky. Six months have elapsed
since Great Britain, over a week-end, .went off.
the gold standard. That was sa sudden and
sa startling and the people of the country
were sa unproparcd for i t hat the effeets
could not even be guesscd. The London
Observer, a paper of the first rank and of
the greatest weight in London, in its issue of
the 27th of March, *which. is the most recent
to hand, reports as follows:
Confidence in the future is the most marked
feature on the stock exehange to-day...
The gil-t-edged section and other high-class
investmnent stocks continue to be the principal
centre of thec business that is being done....
New issues of h-igh-ol'ass investment stocks
have been absorbing much attention recentiy.
Then there is an interesting list of bonds that
have been put on the London market. They
are almost exclusively Govcrnrent bonds.
The first bond mentioncd is that of the
Government of Mauritius. This bond, issued
on Janiuary 16 at a price of 98f, is 110w
106; IJganda, which. was issued on January
26 at 96, is now selling at 104; Central Electricity, which was issued an February 2 at
95, is naw 101; and sa on. Every item in
this list is selling at a large premium.
Then there is a reference ta the complaint
that too many issues are given to large subscribers, and that small investors in Great
Britain are not sufficiently cared for. This
paper realizes the importance of cultivating
this class of stable buyers.
To show that this recent dcvelopmcnt is nat
a flash in the pan, I read from an article in
to-night's paper. It says:
London again assumîng the raie of warld

When one considers trade and commerce at
this moment one naturally and inevitahly
must think of the coming Imperial Economic

200

SENATE

Conference and its great significance and importance to the English-speaking people of
the world. Yes, this is accurate. The United
States is almost as much interested as any of
the Dominions. Two men of high distinction
and wide experience, Mr. Winston Churchill
and Sir Josiah Stamp, have used all their force
and eloquence to impress upon the people of
Canada the importance of this conference.
But neither of them touched on the fact
that we are to be the hosts, and that the
way in which we handle matters coming up in
this connection will have a great deal to do
in establishing our prestige or otherwise; that
we shall be judged thereby, and that therefore
our temper, our competence and our knowledge, not only of obvious things, but of things
of the most extraordinary complexity, are of
the first importance. Interest in that conference is widespread throughout Canada. The
press bas referred constantly to the conference
and bas dilated upon the attitude of Canada
and what Canada is doing. The interest that
bas been evinced and the anxiety shown are
perfectly legitimate. They are signs that our
people fully realize the magnitude of this
most important event. It is, I believe, in
accordance with the feeling prevailing not
only in the Senate, but throughout the country, that I appeal to the leader of the Government in this House to give us at the earliest
possible moment the fullest information available, vithout detriment to public business,
as to what the Government is doing in the
way of preparing for this great event.
I now miake the motion of which I gave
notice.
Hon. D. E. RILEY: Honourable gentlemen, I am quite in accord with the remarks
of the honourable senator from Sydney (Hon.
Mr. MeLennan), particularly in regard to the
necessity of preparing to present Canada's
case properly at the coming Imperial Conference. Being a cattle man, I have in mind
our trade in live cattle with Great Britain.
As you al know, Great Britain to-day is the
only market for our surplus cattle, and so many
restrictions have been placed in the way of
that trade that they really amount to a tariff.
In the British live stock market, Ireland is
our principal competitor. That country ships
cattle under much more favourable regulations
than Canada does. I will read some of the
restrictions that apply to Canadian cattle as
compared with Irish cattle.
First, Canadian heifers must be slaughtered
at the port of landing; Irish heifers may b
licensed ont as "stores." There is still an
embargo on our female cattle.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

Second, Canadian bullocks may be licensed
out as "stores," but if put out in feed lots
they must remain for twenty-eight days.
Irish cattle, on the other hand, need be detained for only six days. So that you may
understand the importance of that provision,
it is necessary to say that our cattle on landing in Great Britain are feverish and more or
less bruised. If we could put those cattle
out in feed lots for ten days, until the fever
left them and they cooled off, the meat would
sell for much more than it does at present.
But if we put them out at all we must put
them out for twenty-eight days, and this involves an unnecessary expense. Irish cattle,
as I have said, are detained for only six days.
Third, it is a condition of Canadian shipping
that, in addition to the regudiar ship attendants,
a veterinary surgeon must be in attendance
on every shipment of over seventy-4five head
of cattle. That is another expense.
Fourth, the British regulations set out in
minute detail specifications covering steamships for Canadian cattle, and inelude stipulations as to heavy fittings, the tying of cattle,
and the allotment of four bullocks to the
pen. If the animals are light weight, five
may be tied in pens of a size suitable for four
large bullocks. To-day the markets demand
light animals, and the cost of transporting
them is so great that we cannot ship them
very profitably. On the other hand, Irish
cattle may be shipped in compartments accommodating twenty head, and they may be
untied. This is a vastly different proposition
from Canadian shipping, so far as the cost
of transportation is concerned. Under existing
transiportation conditions it is not practicable
for us to ship light weight cattle, which
command a better price. The carriage charges
on light weight cattle are all out of proportion. Some arrangement must be made
with steamship companies by which cattle
weighing from four hundred to eight hundred
pounds can be carried at a rate proportionate
to that on the heavy cattle. Because of lack
of suitable steamboat equipment, and the
present British regulation. Canadian producers find themselves unable to send out
young beef, which otherwise would pay them.
Fifth, in addition to these handicaps, under
an order in operation from November 1, 1927,
until April 1, 1929, and now revived, Canadian
cattle cannot be carried on the weather deck,
unless the deck is completely covered in to
the satisfaction of the Ministry.
It is admitted that there is a difference
between conditions affeeting the shipment of
cattle from the two countries, Ireland and

APRIL 19, 1932
Canada, but the extra costs imposed on the
Canadian business constitute an indirect tarif
and are altogether unreasonable as between
two Dominions. I understand that some of
the restrictions are not being enforced at
present; nevertheless they have not been
rescinded.
As proof that our cattle are favourably
looked upon by the Old Country trade, I
should like to read an article that appeared
in the Lethbridge Herald on the 13th of this
month. The article contains statements by
Mr. William R. Brown, of William Brown
Limited, of Manchester and Birkenhead, the
largest importers of Canadian calttle in Great
Britain. Early this month he made a tour
of the beef feeding area in Alberta, to sec
where the Canadian cattle that he handled
last year were raised and the manner in which
they were being treated. Last year Canada
exported to Great Britain 26,000 head of cattle,
and Mr. Brown's firm bought 14,000 of them.
Here is the article:
"We can take many thousand more of the
kind of cattle I saw to-day in feed lots in the
Lethbridge and Raymond districts," was the
statement made to the Herald by William R.
Brown, of William Brown, Ltd., of Manchester
and Birkenhead, largest importer of Canadian
2attle in the British Isles, following a trip
through the district on Tuesday with Wilbur
McKenzie, manager of the Southern Alberta
Co-op., selling agents for the Red Label Beef
Association, and John Wilson, who is supervising the feeding operations in the district.
Mr. Brown came to Canada to see where the
fine beef cattle his firm imported last year
came from, and of course Alberta is getting
the lion's share of his attention, with the
irrigated districts around Lethbridge receiving
a minute survey.
"Of 24,000 head of beef cattle imported last
year, our firm brought over 14,000 head. We
have been handling Canadian cattle for generations; we like them; we would like to be able
to get more like we saw to-day," said Mr.
Brown, wýho indicated that, instead of 24,000
head, he could dispose of 100,000 head if they
were of the smaller sizes, wel.l finished, and
if they came to the English market between
March 15 and July 15, at a time when Irish,
Scottish and other cattle fitted in the British
Isles are not coming to the market in numbers.
"Your cattle ship well, they dress out well,
and they find a ready sale. We like stuff that
is about 800 pounds live weight. The big stuff
that we used to import, three and four year
olds at 1,500 to 1,600 pounds, are not wanted
any more. We want young stuff. But we must
get them at a price which will allow us to
compete with the chilled beef from the Argentine. Our people like the fresh-kilted beef, and
pay very considerably more for it, but the
spread between the two brands must not be so
great as to drive them to using more chilled
products," said Mr. Brown.
So it is clear that the demand for our
cattle in Great Britain would be very greatly
increased if we could ship them there at

201

more reasonable rates and if some of the
restrictions that bear so heavily upon the
Canadian producer were removed. I think
that the Imperial Economie Conference
would be an opportune occasion for 'threshing out those restrictions that are unfair to
Canada, and for placing our position before
the members of the British Government who
will be present. I may say that the cattle
associations of Western Canada are preparing
a brief on this export question, and perhaps
that brief will be supported by the findings
of the committee of this House. I think that
if some action could be taken at the Imperial
Conference to improve cattle exporting conditions, a great benefit would be done to
Canadian agriculture. Agriculture is the basic
industry of this country and is the one that
will put Canada on the road to prosperity
again. And live stock is the backbone of
agriculture.
I have much pleasure in seconding the
motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, the substance of the motion contains
a reference to the preparations now under
way for the Imperial Conference, and the very
interesting speech of the mover indicated that
he, at least, would like some intimation as to
the nature of the organization that is making
ready for that great event. The topic is well
worthy of the excellent way in which it bas
been presented, and also of the speech of the
honourable senator from High River (Hon.
Mr. Riley), who is so admirably qualified by
experience for discussion of the special phase
of the subject that he undertook. I will see
that the attention of the chairman of the
organization is called to the remarks of the
honourable senator from High River, and I
am quite certain that the special plea that he
has made will be given every possible consideration. not only on the ;part of the committee which has the matter in hand, but on
the part of the Government when the time
comes for the conference itself. Great Britain,
the principal other party to the negotiations,
is a great importi:'g country, and that class
of her imports in which we feel we ought to
share more largely is agricultural produce.
Consequently, in the negotiations between the
two countries-and the same is true, but to a
lesser extent, with respect to the other
Dominions-the agricultural products of Canada should be paramount, because on them is
based our chief hope of participating more
extensively in the British market. We ought
to be ready to give all reasonable concessions
within our power in order to secure a larger
sale in Britain for the products of our farms.

SENATE
I am quite certain that cattle form a very
important part of those products, but I am
not sure that I can agree with the honourable senator from High River that they are
the most important of all. Perhaps one cannot measure the future wholly by the experience of the past, but such thinking as I
have been able to give to the subject convinces me that while in the search for a
market for our cattle and the attempt to have
all unnecessary restraints upon their transport
removed there is much to be hoped forso much that no attention and no preparation can be too thorough-yet there is still
more to be expected from another farm
product. I refer to the bacon product of this
Dominion. In bacon, as distinguished from
grain products, Canada lias normally very
little surplus. This is unfortunate. We are,
I understand, in a position to produce
cheaper and better bacon than any country
in the world, Denmark not excepted. We
produce about six million hogs a year for a
population of about ten millions, or normally
enough for our own consumption, the variation above and below domestie consumption
requirements being very small. I do net
know what the production in Great Britain
is now, but I read not long ago that in 1927
it reached only 3,880.000, or a little more than
half our figure, and that for a population
of about forty millions.
The British importations are from many
countries, chiefly Denmark and Poland, and
though Canada shared very largely in those
importations under the special conditions
created by the War, the market was unfortunately lost to this country by the
irregularity of the supply, both in quantity
and in quality. Conditions developed that
esulted in unusual profits in other lines, so
that this great staple line of industry on the
farm was lamentably allowed to deteriorate
and, as an export, to be almost wiped out.
But when we see that only a fraction of the
demands of the British market is supplied
by local producers-for the consumption
must be somewhere around 23,000,000 a year,
as against a home supply of about 4,000,000
-and
that the shortage is made good by
otier countries, we surely ought to strive
to bring about conditions under which we
shall have an opportunity, at least, of sharing in that great market on a preferential
basis as against foreign countries. If there
were no British market for surplus bacon
that we might produce over our own requirements, it would not be easy to see how very
great advantage could be obtained by either
preference or quota. But since we have no
surplus, or such a small one that it is far
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

less than sufficient to supply the demands of
that market, there is an opening, a prospect
for us to increase business by producing more
bacon; and, given a reasonable attitude on
each side, there ought to be results.
However, I am not seeking to diminish at
all the importance of the special phase
emphasized by the honourable senator from
High River. I merely want to insist that
live stock is not the whole of agriculture, nor
is it certain that it is the first agricultural
product in point of importance.
As to the organization which lias been set
ip te prepa.re for the conferences, I am not in
a position to speak in very great detail, but
I can say something. Under the supervision
of the Cabinet and the committee of the
Cabinet there are departmental committees at
work.
There are also inter-departmental
organizations, each under an appropriate head
and all co-ordinated under a single chairman.
These inter-departmental committees have
associated with them men of special knowledge entirely outside of official service, and
they deal with many phaseshave seen the
list and it certainly is long enough-of
Imperial and world trade, including tariffs,
transport,
currency,
exchange,
financial
arrangements and almost all those inter-allied
subjects that have to be thorouglhly understood before problems of inter-Imperial trade
can be intelligently dealt with.
There is also at work a committee whose
object it is to sec that delegations are properly met and taken care of. And there is a
very important organization whose function
it will be to see that the machinery operates,
that there is no impasse, that there is expedition in the attack upon and discharge of all
the problems with which the conference will
be faced.
Whiile it is impossible to exaggerate the
momentous nature of the event, it is easy to
misappreciate it. It is of great importance.
Canadians are looking forward to it with
enthusiasm and high hopes, and in this respect
our people are undoubtedly equalled, if not
excelled, by those of the Old Land and of the
other Dominions. The world is looking on.
Success is not only hoped for, but confidently
expected by each and all, and doubtless each
country hopes to obtain more and to give
less than what probably will be the ultimate
result. But, so far as one can observe, the
general spirit is the right one, the general
attitude is a fair one, and consequently we in
Canada, who sit around the centre of the
great event, may well harbour eager and confident hope that the results will not disappoint
us.

APRIL 19, 1932
I have great pleasure in supporting the motion, and trust that the labours of the committee will do something to correlate the
activities of ail, and especially to bring f0 the
attention of the responsible authorities such
representations as have been referred to in the
debate, and particularly those from agricultrlcomimunities as covered in the address
of the honourable senator who *has just sat
ýdown.

I do not say that this subject has been
antirely neglactad. Possibly the committea of
which the right honourable leader of the
House speaks is paying attention to this particular phase, and parhaps ha can give us soma
information on the point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will receive equal attention with the othar side.
The motion was agraed to.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Coulid the right
honourable gentleman tell the Senate when
ail the reciprocity treaties that have been
negotiated up to 1930 will have corne to an
end? I have a vague impression that they
were ail denounced within the time prescribed
in those treaties, but I do net know whether
they will ail have ended 'hy the middle of
this year. This may not be a question that
my right honourable friend is able to answar
off-hand.

OPIUM AND NARCOTIC DRUG BILL

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:- No, I am flot
able to aniswer as to the exact date of expiry
of each of the treaties; nor would I say that
ail of them are doomed to expire. Some of
them ought to ha; at least I used te think so.
But I will obtain the information the honourable senator asks for, and give it to the House
at an early date.
Hon. JOHN LEWIS: Honourable members,
we have heard a great deal about the possibility of the extension of markets in the
Old Country for our products, and that is
wail; but wa have heard very little about
what we are wii.ling to buy. N.ow, it
is obvious that if Australia, South Africa,
Canada and aIl the othar Domimion-s go
to that conifevence merely as a collection of seiling agents, without exipressing any willingness to boy, the confeïrecc will be a failura. 'Great Britain is cvidentiy expecting a great deal from tha anlargement of Dominion markets; so much so
that among the more enthusiastic advocates
of Imperial free trada thare is a hope that
in the course of tima the British Empire may
becoma entirely scîf-sufficient and Great Bnitain may have to depend very littIe on foraign
trade. That hope, I týhink, is cxaggerated, but
at ail avants it is quita reasonable for the
people in Great Britain to expect that in
return for any advantagas wc may obtain
in the British markets they should obtain
some corresponding advantages in our markets;
and wa have to reconcile oursalves to, the
idea that wa must giva a real prafarenca which
will resuit in the purchase of a larger quantity
of British goods in Canada.

CONTROL 0F RADIUM FROM
CANADIAN ORES
MOTION FOR. APPOINTMENT

0F COMMISSION

The Senate resumcd from April 14 the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Senator McRae:
That io the opinion of this House the Government should decla.re its intention to control the
production and distribution of ail radium procurad from Canadian ores; and te that end
should immediately appoint a Canadian Radium

SENATE
Commission to investigate and recommend at
the next session of Parliament the best methods
to adopt to give effect to such control.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
when the honourable member for Vancouver
introduced his motion, I was impressed with
the manner in which he gave the House the
information he had acquired in regard to
radium and its uses in the treatment of cancer.
I will continue the debate for a few moments
and extend the argument in favour of the
resolution.
It is truc that the statistics submitted from
various countries do vary, and one would
probably be inclined to think that we in Canada are most fortunate when we report that
only 90 persons in 100,000 die from cancer,
as compared with 145 persons in the state of
Denmark. I think that variation is largely
due to the more adequate facilities for diagnosis and the greater care taken in the registration of deaths in that country, in comparison with our own country. I think it will
bc found that cancer is fairly constant in aill
countries in its attack upon the human being.
Although a great deal of work has been
done of recent years to try to ascertain the
origin of cancer, a.nd thus discover a preventive
treatment, the etiology or causes are unknown.
We do know this, however, that a long period
of inflammatory irritation of tissue predisposes
to cancer, and that as people advance in
years they are more liable to the disease.
Furthermore. we know that the disease is
curable if it is recognized in the earlier stages,
and thalt if it is not recognized, or is neglected,
it becomes disseminated through the system
until it reaches a stage where it is not curable
by any treatment at present known to science.
The X-ray, which was discovered some years
ago, has become a very important therapeutic agent in the treatment not only of
cancer but of other di>eases. In the earlier
stages of our knowledge of cancer we were
dependent almost entirely upon cauterization
or operative surgery. Because of the nature
of the di-easc, its tendency to spread from
its original locaition to other organs through
the various blood channels and the lymphatics,
its treatment by surgery became so radical
in character that the operations were wide
and extensive, in some cases causing mutilation and loss of the functions of the organ
affected. Many people were so much in terror
of operations of that charac.ter that they preferred ta disguise their symptoms and hide
them. and their true condition became known
only as the growth advanced and became
incurable. It is hoped that by education, and
the use of radium and the X-ray, this fear
will be removed, and that many people,
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

through the knowledge that they will obtain.
will come earlier for treatment, and that
through the botter knowledge of our medical
and nursing professions they will be saved.
The physiological effect of radium was discovered, more or less accidentally, in 1898.
Professer Henri Becquerel was carrying a glass
vial of barium, a radioactive salt, from Paris
to London. After his arrival in London be
discovered that he had reccived a burn about
the size of the container, and that this hum
took a long time to heal. This incident and the
treatment of his condition were called to the
attention of scientists. This salt was tested
on other chronie skiA
diseases, and it was
reccognized that it had a physiological effect
on tissue. Fron that bas grown the use of
radium in the treatiaent of cancer and certain
skin diseases.
The countries of Europe were the first to
realize the importance of this agent in the
treatment of malignant conditions, and today you will find in those countries, under
the auspices of the government, centres or
institutes whosc activities are strictly confined to the treatment cf cancer. Probably
one of the muost outstanding institutes in
Europe is that at Stockholm, Sweden, which
is regarded as one of the first-class European
clinies. The records of that clinic, where they
use radium almost exclusively in their treatment, arc extremely interesting. They show
that in five thousand five hundred and some
odd cases which have been treated they have
had 38.5 .per cent of five-year cures. The
ternis "five-year cure" is an old one used by
the surgeon. The operative surgeon did not
claini a cure for his patient until a period of
five years had elapsed with no recurrence of
the disease. That seems to be the basis
adopted by our friends who are using radium.
It was only some six years ago that Great
Britain really became interested in the radium
treatment. Under the advisement cf the
Ministry of Health, a commission was
appointcd ta enquire into the treatment of
cancer in that country. That commission
recommuendcd that active measures should be
taken to facilitate treatment and the proper
control of the disease. In suipport of this report the Government set aside one hundred
thousand pounds, and the public subscribed
two hundred thousand pounds, and in 1929
a national radium trust and a radium commision were established by royal charter.
The trust committee was formed to take care
of the money collected from the public and
received from the Government, and to invest
it in radium. The commission was charged
with the responsibility of arranging for the

APRIL 19, 1932
custody of the radium secured by the trust,
and for its distribution among and use in the
centres of Great Britain. Under this commission some thirteen centres have been
established in the larger towns in England,
Scotland and Wales. In London there is not
only a treatment centre, 'but a post-graduate
school of radiotherapy, which assures a supply
of competent men for other centres.
In 1930 the commission made a report to
which, if I am permitted, I should like to
refer. There is a feeling aibroad that radium
is the sure cure for cancer. That has not been
the experience of the British commission. I
will just read what they have to say in that
regard:
Radium is not yet established as a "cure"

for cancer; while it holds out a good promise of

beneficial results, and certainly of alleviation of
suffering, it is at present a very dangerous
weapon and one which, unless used with the
greatest skill, care and precaution, may easily
be productive of more harm than good.
Further on, under the heading
True Position," the report says:

of "The

The true facts of the position, as known to
the commission, may lie summarized as follows.
It has been proved for many years that radium
has a powerful effect on various affections of
the skin, and that rodent ulcer and cancer of
the skin can usually be completely cured by its
use. During the last few years the technique
of radium therapy has been elaborated and
greatly improved by the use of radium needles,
or of "seeds" containing radium emanation
(radon), which are buried in the tissues in or
around the growth. Most of the work done in
this country so far has been directed .towards
the treatment of cancer of the womb, the lower
bowel, the breast, and the tongue and mouth
cavity. It can be stated definitely that in the
above-mentioned regions, as the result of long
and hard work, of many trials and errors, a
big step forward has been made.
Then again, as to the importance of early
treatment:
We must again emphasize the fact that the
treatment of cancer, if it is to be successful,
whether it takes the form of surgical excision,
the cautery, radium, or X-rays, must lie undertaken early, or before dissemination has
occurred; and it must be reiterated that an
essential part of the campaign against cancer
consists in the education and intelligent cooperation of the public so that eardy diagnosis
and prompt treatment may be secured.
I wibl not detain you muoh 'longer, but here
is a section which I think may be of insterest:
It is perhaps desirable at this point to deal
with two prevailent misconceptions. First, there
is no proof whatever that cancer is either
infectious or contagions.
Secondly, there is
no evidence that cancer is hereditary, except
in one rare form of cancer of the eye. These
fears, therefore, can both be dismissed.

Then again:
It cannot too strongly be emphasized that in
unskilled hands (i.e., in the hands of persons
not fully trained in the best standards of
technique), radium may be highly dangerous,
both to the patients and to the operator.
I read these extracts from the commission's
report because I think they are of great importance in our consideration of the radium
problem as applied to Canada and Canadian
.conditions. The commissioners have distinctly
set forth the advantages of radium as an agent
in the treatment of cancer; they have suggested that it must be in the hands of competent operators; and they have pointed out
thait, if we are to suoceed in combating this
disease with any degree of success, we must
have early diagnosis and an intelligent public
who will realize the importance of early recognition of the disease.
It has been found difficult, as the commission states in its report, to secure officials
who are properly qualified to carry on treatment with this agent. In Germany the Government permits classes of instruction in
certain specified institutions. The courses extend over a period of eighteen months, at the
end of which the student may take an examination, which is held under government
supervision, and the standard of which is very
high. If lie succeeds in passing this examination he then is permitted to take six months'
practical training in the use of radium and its
application in the treatment. At the end of
that period lie will receive a State diploma
showing that lie is qualified to practise. I
mention this only to show that the difficulty
of bringing about in Canada the conditions
that many of us would like to see is not
merely that of securing radium, but involves
the greater problem of securing a competent
personnel to handle that agent.
In the United States, where there are larger
centres of population and greater wealth than
we have, the work has progressed probably
more rapidly than it has in Canada. Two
commissions have been formed, one for the
control of cancer and the other for its treatment. The people of the United States find
themselves in very much the same position
that we are in: it is not competent for them
to have central government control, because
in that country matters pertaining to health
come within the jurisdiction of the various
states, as in this country they come within
the jurisdiction of the provinces. But they
have progressed, and in large centres in the
United States to-day you will find clinics for
the treatment of cancer, or bureaus where
treatment with radium and other agencies is
being carried on.

SENATE

If one studies the history of radium one
will realize that in practically a:1-1
countries the
Governmnent bas stood behind its use. This
may be due ta its excessive cost. As was
explaiined to us a week ago by the honourable
gentleman who introduced the resolution
(Hon. Mr. McRae), ane gram of radium,
vhich is only 15-4 grains in weight, would
cost $70,000 to-day. At one time it would
have cost $100,000. This may 'have been one
of the reasons why government aid was sought.
But I think the governments of Europe early
recognized (that if this product was to be used
as a therapeutic agent it must be used with the
greatest possible care, and you will' find in
eaÀch country regulations controlling its therapeutic use, and confining it ta those who are
competent. In Can-ada and in the United
States there bas been no such control up to
the present time. We have been fortunate,
I think, in the men who have invested their
money in quantities of radium; in each and
every case, I think, they must have taken a
course of instruction, for I know of no centre
-in Canada, at least-where there bas been
any serious accident resulting fron its use.
But I think we have arrived at the point
where, if we are ta progress in the use of this
agency, it wil. be necessary ta secure government assistance not only to obtain the radium
but to see that throughout the country centres
are established where it will be properly ron,
trolled and handled.
In his remarks a few days ago my honouraible friend (Hon. Mr. McRae) referred ta
the addresses delivered in the House of Commons in 1930. I remember them well. I happened to be Minister of Health at that time.
Those speeches were made with the desire af
inducing the Government of Canada ta establ'ish cancer centres throughout Canada, and
ta enter the field of supplying radium for
treatment. The Government took the position that this was a matter that came entirely
within the jurisdiction and contrai of the
provinces, and did not accede ta the request.
But if we review the history of the ipast few
years we shall find that in each and every
province the matter bas been given consideration by the Government; and in some cases,
more particularly, I think, in the less populous
provinces, by the medical profession. I think
that if I am permitted ta refer briefly to those
activities in the different provinces, I can
present an argument in favour of the resolution.
The British Columbia Medical Association
have had a committee studying the treatment
of cancer by radium therapy. More recently
a committee of medical men of the city of
Vancouver have been devoting their time ta

this problem, and two cancer clinies are now
being operated, one at St. Paul's Hospital,
Vancouver, and another at Jubilee Hospital,
Victoria. There are same 311 miligrams of
radium in the province, and I think it is all
privately owned. Ta satisfy the requirements.
there should be 2 grams.
The Alberta Medical Association appointed
a cancer committee last year, and the University Hospital, Edmonton, bas a radium
committee whieh bas given considerable time
ta the study of the cancer problem. In Alberta
there are some 333f milligrams of radium
available, and this also is privately owned.
The total quantity required in the province
is 2 grams.
In Saskatchewan the Government bas been
active and in 1930 created the Saskatchewan
Cancer Commission. In that year there were
within the province some 310 milligrams of
radium, as against 2 grams needed. I am
informed that the Government bas recently
purchased radium, and that clinies have been
established at Regina and Saskatoon.
Manitoba in 1930 passed an Act for the
establishment of a Cancer Relief Institute. I
believe that clinies are established in the
Winnipeg General Hospital and St. Boniface
Hospital.
The Government of Ontario a year or more
ago appointed a Cancer Commission under
the chairmanship of Canon Cody. This commission travelled ta important medical centres
in Europe, Great Britain and the United States,
and made extensive inquiries into the use of
radium. In their report, which recently was
tabled in the Legislature and will be available for public distribution, they recommend
that the Provincial Government should pro.ceed ta organize three radium centres, one
each in Toronto, London and Kingston, and
that these should be operated in conjunction
with, or close to, medical universities. After
reading the report, and from information that
I have secured elsewhere, I gather the intention is ta proceed more or less along the lines
that have been followed in Europe. Proximity
ta the medical universities would make available to the radium centres the services of
professional men, and at the same time medical students would be able ta take advantage
of special opportunities for study in the cancer
clinies.
The Province of Quebec is far in advance
of all the other provinces.
The Radium

APRIL 19, 1932
of $66,000 has been invested in apparatus
alone, and the technical staff has been inoreased. In the Province of Que-bec there
are 2,223 milligrams of radium available for
use, and the total needed is 3 grams. This
is the only province that has seriously tackled
the problein of treating cancer by radium, or
of the use of radium as a therapeutic agent.
The Maritime Provinces have done very
little. In the three of them there are about
325 milligrams of radium in use, all privately
owned, as far as I know. PaIstients suffering
from cancer are treated in the general hospitals. The requirements of those provinces,
under a systei of government aid and support, would be from 2j to 3 grains.
I should like to refer briefly to one of the
many initeresting parts of the address delivered by the honourable gentleman froin
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) on Thursday
last. He pointed out that radium, which is
largely used as a therapeutic agent, has a very
long life; that iit can be .used over sixteen hundred years without any appreciable
deterioration; that one gram is sufficient for
a cancer centre, and 16J to 20 grams would be
enough for the requirements of the medical
profession all over Canada; and that sufficient
radium could be produced in a short time
to supply the requirements of the medical
profession throughout the world. Dealing with
the discovery of the pitch-blende ores in the
Great Bear Lake section of our Northwest
Territories, that part of our country which.
will probably remain under the jurisdiction of
the Dominion Government, he suggested that
it would be well that the Governinent shouki
reserve the radium deposits in this area and
make them available to humanity, for the
treatment of one of the most serious diseases
with which we have to deal.
I am in accord with the suggestion of my
honourable friend. I assume that his statement with regard to costs is correct-that a
gram of radium can be produced in Canada
for $10,000, as against the price of $50,000 or
more that is being asked by the Belgian syndicate. If we can produce at that comparatively low cost, then, I think, the Canadian
Government has an opportunity of conferring
a great boon upon humanity, and particularly upon those unfortunates who year after
year are battling patiently with cancer. I am
in favour of placing the production of radium
in charge of a comRnission, but I should prefer
a departmental committee, formed of competent officials fron the Department of
Mines, the Department 'of Health and the
National Research Council, or else a coinbined commission and departiental commit-

207

tee. Such a body, under Government instructions, could be responsible for extracting
sufficient ore to supply the provinces of Canada with all the radium required for therapeutic purposes, without charge, provided the
provinces showed that they had arranged for
the safe custody of the radium and for its
use by competent persons only.
I should also be in favour of the extraction
and distribution of a further amounit of
radium, sufficient to supply the needs of Great
Britain and the other Dominions, and indeed
of the whole world, at a price sufficient only
to cover the cost of production and distribution. Of course, if we offered to supply other
countries we should require the saine assurance as to custody and use from them as
from the provinces, so that there would be
no abuses in connection with the administration of radium as a therapeutic agent. By
acting in this manner Canada would undoubtedly make a great contribution to the
welfare of mankind, but it would not be a
greater contribution than that made by Lister,
or Pasteur, or, in our own time, by Banting.
I have much pleasure in supporting the
resolution. I trust that it will receive the
endorsement of this honourable body and
that the Government will see fit to give it
favourable consideration and develop some
plan whereby this wonderful therapeutic agent
that we possess may be made available to the
people not only of Canada and Great Britain,
but of the whole world.

CONTROL OF RADIUM FROM
CANADIAN ORES
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Senator McRae:
That in the opinion of this House the Government should declare its intention to control the
production and distribution of all radium
procured from Canadian ores; and to that end
should immediately appoint a Canadian Radium
Commission to investigate and recommend at
the next session of Parliament the best methods
to adopt to give effect to such control.
Hon. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
senators, I desire first of all to congratulate
the honourable member from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) upon the very able, instructive
and important address ho delivered in this
House a few days ago. The radium question is of great national importance. Perhaps there is no more interesting story than
that of the scientific research that resulted
in the discovery of radium through the efforts
of Madame Curie and her husband in 1896,
after a study of radium compound. At first
the only known source of supply of pitchblende ore, from which radium is derived,
was in Austria. It requires one ton of the
richest pitch-blende ore to produce one gram
Hon. Mr. McNIEANS.

of radium, which is present in the proportion
of only one to several million parts of other
metals. In 1904 the cost of one gram of
radium was $100,000. We naturally ask why
the stuff is so expensive. Well, for one thing,
five tons of carnotite ore have to be treated
in order to extract one gram of radium. For
every gram of radium to be extracted it is
necessary to use many tons of chemical, to
heat the carnotite, one thousand tons of distilled water and one thousand tons of coal,
or its equivalent in electrical energy. This
gives us some idea of why the expense of producing even one gram of radium is so great.
In 1913 pitch-blende was discovered in the
Belgian Congo, Africa. This ore contained
a very high radium content as compared with
the carnotite ore of Colorado or the pitchblende of Austria. With the coming of the
War research was largly discontinued, but after
the War it was resumed. The pitch-blende
of the Belgian Congo contained about four
times as much radium as the carnotite of
Colorado. The ore had to be carried sixteen
hundred miles to the sea, and thence to
Belgium; and about six months must elapse
from the time the ore is mined before even a
small quantity of radium can be produced.
Even in the richest uranium compound only
one part of radium is present to two or three
million parts ni other substances.
According to the Nineteenth Century Review there were probably few scientists living
in 1895 who would have dared to predict that
the last five years of the nineteenth century
would bring forth discoveries of such farreaching importance that they would strike at
the very foundation of scientific belief. The
discovery of the X-ray in 1895, by Professor
Roentgen, revealed a new type of radiation,
though its place in the spectrum was not
fixed for another eighteen years. The discovery of Professor Roentgen was a direct
incentive to Henri Becquerel to try to find
out whether any substance in a state of
nature would give out anything like the
X-ray. Becquerel began a series of investigations into the uranium compound. In 1896
he made the amazing discovery that uranium
itself emits some rays like the X-ray. This
discovery was followed in 1899 by the discovery
of Pirofessor and Madame Curie of two new
substances, one of which was radium. Radium
is a metal, and has been prepared in a puire
metallic state by Madame Curie.
For many years the production of radium
was small, being restricted mainly to that of
a few physical and chemical laboratories. With
increasing demands, however, mainly due to
its therapeutic use, the production of radium
on a larger scale was undertaken. The first

What bas been accomplished in the cases
I have cited should urge us to make a really
formidable attack on cancer, which to-day is
the greatest menace to our national health.
In all those diseases I have mentioned,
medical science was able to get at the cause.
We found the causes of diphtheria, typhoid
fever, malaria and yellow fever; and once
the cause of a disease was discovered it was
much casier to find a cure. But so far as
cancer is concerned, I think I can state that
we do not know its cause. Perhasps other
honourable members can give further information on that point.
A great surgeon bas said that ten cents'
worth of radium may do a million dollars'
worth of damage. I think it is well established that radium is a substance that should
be employed by men of good training and
experience, and it should be applied in
sufficient quantities to do the work. It does
seem, from my research during the last few
days, that it is quite possible to do a great
deal of damage by radium if we do not
understand the quantity and the kind to use.
It might be said that up to the year 1930
there were two consequences of the high price
of radium. As I said a little while ago, the
selling price of radium was, at first, about

$100,000 a gram.

I am not sure what the

present price is, but J have heard of figures
as high as $70,000 and as low as $12,000. One
result of the high cost is that the people of
rich countries have a better chance of getting
radium treatment than have those in poorer

supply, even the richest countries are not
able to get enough radium for their requiremonts. Professor R. B. Moore, Chief Chemist of
tho United States Bureau of Mines,hasmade
a statement which is so serious that I hesitate
to repeat it. This eminent man has said that
more than half of the available radium supply
is used for illuminating the faces of signs,
locks and watches, to the end that some
people may be able to read a sign or see
what time it is without the aid of a light at
night. Somce honourable members may have
noticed not long ago a press dispatch recording the death of five or six girls who had
worked in a factory where radium was applied
to 'the faces of clocks and watches. The girls
had died from poisoning, brought about in
a way that I cannot explain. They may have
been using brushes and wetting them in their
mouths.
It is very important to note that although
the term "radium burn" is often used, radium
should not be looked upon as a cautery.
There is, I think, an impression among the
Ifon.

Mr.

SCHAFFNER.

laity that radium acts as a cautery and burns
cancer, thus protecting the surrounding tissue,
but I think there is no authority for that
theory. On the contrary, in attempting to
effect a cure, anything approaching a burn
should be avoided. I have in mind an instance in this city-and I know of a number
of others-in which radium was applied to
cancer and caused a burn almost as serious
as the grovth it was desired to cure. Býroadly
speaking, it may be said tiat in using radium
treatments there are two things that obviously
sho'uld be avoided, over-dosage and underdosage. If an over-dose is given to tissues
there is likely to be a development of necrosis,
which is an exceedingly difficult condition to
deal with. On the other hand, if parts of
the malignant growth are under-dosed, there
may be some temporary benefit, but the
growth eventually w:ill become active again.
I think that even the laiîty can appreciate bow
important it is that radium should be handled
only by qualified persons.
In Great Britain a big scheme of radium
research was initiated by the Medical Research Council immediately after the War.
Radium w'as put at the disposal of the Council
by the Government and was lent to various
institutes in the British Isles. The Council's
published reports summarize the results that
have been obtained from year to year, and
they give additional proof that radium, when
carefully administered, can be an extremely
useful agent in the treatment of cancer. The
opinion expressed in the report for the year
1928 is that radium should be looked upon
at present as an agent for the treatment of
localized cancer, and that the more limited
the region affected, the more chance there is
of success. This view is exemplified in the
treatment of cancer of the womb. If a cancerous growth b so limited in extent as to
be called operable, then it is most probable
that in proper hands it can be entirely eradicated by means of radium. The Council
decided-and I think few will doubt their
wisdom-to concentrate the greater part of
their radium supply in medical centres thoughout the United Kingdom where medical
schools exist. This plan will not only result
in a concentration for purposes of treatment,
but will facilitate the instruction of the rising
generation of medical practitioners in radium
therapy.
The law of supply and demand is as truc
for radium as for other commodities. I have
already stated the three main countries where
until very recently radium has been mined
on an important scale, namely Czecho-Slovakia,
the United States of America and the Belgian

APRIL 20, 1932
Congo. The United States, on account of
the low grade of its carnotite deposits, is unable to compete successfully as a source of
supply with the Belgian Congo, which has
such large deposits of pitch-blende ores.
Czecho-Slovakia continues to be a producer.
It is worth while mentioning that the price
of Belgian radium is graded according to the
wealth of the country that makes the purchase. Britain pays more than her continental
neighbours, and America pays more than
Britain. There is enough radium in the earth
for the world's needs, if it can be paid for.
By the year 1914 some progress had been
made in radium therapy. During the War
years, however, there was a set-back, but the
last decade has been a period of great activity and development. France is the home
of radium therapy, and this is due in no small
part to the systematic research that has been
carried out in the Institut du Radium in Paris,
organized by Professor Régaud. The definite
advances that have been made in the past
are ground for the belief that radium may be
looked upon as a means whereby certain
localized cancer growths .can be removed as
surely as, and generally with less danger than,
by surgery. Surgery was until very recently,
and probably it still is in some quarters,
considered the only means for curing a cancer. As a result of my little experienceand I do not pretend to be an authorityI have concluded that generally it is necessary to have a. combination of surgery and
radium in order to attack cancers successfully.
One of the most important developments in
the last five or six years has been the recognition of the significance of the time factor.
It is certain that the effect of radiation upon

method is to insert a number of small tubes
containing only a milligram or two and allow
them to remain for a week or ten days, and
so great has been the improvement in results
through this method that radium combined
with surgery is to-day looked upon as the
most suitable treatment for cancer of the
tongue and buccal cavity.
41767-14à

An exceedingly important characteristie of
radium is that it does its good work and
remains in effect unspent, ready to do more.
True, it is very expensive and difficult to
obtain, but tubes or needles of radium may
be inserted in the breast, or tubes may be
used on the tongue, in the uterus or in other
parts of the body, and remain unspent. That
is to say, the same radium may be used over
and over again almost indefinitely.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: For how long?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Do you mean
how many times?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: For how many years?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I am not sure
how many years, but as I understand the
word "unspent" it means that radium cannot
be used up.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I have read that it is
effective for 1,700 years.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Well, that would
be no good to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We shall all be
dead before that.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am not interested in the latter half of the period.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: The present technique of radium treatment for cancer of the
breast may require that forty needles be
buried around the breast for five days.
Evidently we must have more radium, and
we must have it as soon as possible.
Radium is now an acknowledged agent in the
treatment of localized cancer, and every year
new methods are being devised for dealing
with the more inaccessible varieties of growth,
for example in the stomach, the esophagus,
the brain, and se on.
It is unthinkable that Great Britain cannot
really afford the radium it requires, but the
administration of any quantity, say a gram
per million of population, calls for a good deal
of consideration in medical economics. The
question is asked whether the present moment
is the time for starting radium centres where
treatment, research and the teaching of
therapy can be carried out. Would it be
better te supplement the resources of centres
in Great Britain, or any other countries which
have already earned a certain reputation, or
te aim at putting the technique of radium
therapy into the hands of the general practitioners of the country? I know many
physicians who keep a supply of radium and
carry it around with them when necessary, but
I believe the general opinion in the medical
profession to-day is that the best way of

212

SENATE

coping with cancer is through the establishment of centres for radium treatment, for it
is felt to be almost impossible for the general
practitioner to become really efficient in the
knowledge and application of radium. I have
tried to stress the fact that it is possible to
use radium to the great disadvantage of a
patient. A medical student goes to medical
school for only four or five years; he bas
many other things to occupy his attention;
and I am of the opinion that, however much
ability he may have, be cannot gain the
necessary knowledge and experience to enable
him to use radium to the best advantage of
the patient or of the public at large.
Cancers generally show themselves in human
beings who have reached the age of forty-five
years, and they usually take the form of a
tumour, increasing in size. It is sometimes
said that a tumour destroys its own centres
as it grows. That bas not been my experience; whether or not that has been the experience of any other physician in this House
I do not know. However. it is said that it
destroys its own centres as it grows, the result
being that it assumes the appearance of an
ulcer. The growth of cancer is progressive,
sometimes slow and sometimes rapid.
Its
spontaneous cure by the muere defensive power
of organism is extraordinarily rare, if, indeed,
such a thing happens at all.
Are the ravages of cancer increasing? I
showed in the beginning of my remarks how
medical science and research had been able
to find cures for numerous diseases that at
one time were deadly. This is not so with
regard te cancer. In France, according to
statistics, cancer caused 70 deaths per 100,000
inhabitants in 1906, 82 in 1918, and 88 in 1921.
I judge that the rate is now over 100 per
100,000. From this you will see that there
bas been a gradual increase in the number
of deaths from cancer, while, on the other
hand, the number of deaths from tuberculosis,
malaria or diphtheria is decreasing. Let us
hope that the futuire will produce important
curative, chemical land biological discoveries
that will help in the fight against cancer, and
let us realize the importance of encouraging
activitv in tihis direction.
The principal kinds of cancer which are
frequently cured by X-ray treatment are those
of the epidermie tissues--those occurring on
the skin or the orifices of the skin, such as
the mouth, and the neck of the womb. In
competent hands, and in properly equipped
establishments, cancer can be successfully
treated. provided, of course, that it bas not
been allowed to go to far and is not attended

Mr. SCHAFFNER.

with complications which interfere with the
treatment. Cures are said to be effected more
frequently and with fewer drawbacks by rays,
especially radium, than by surgery. As I said
a while ago, that contention is disputed.
Personally I favour surgery and radium conbined.
In European countries and in the United
States the commonest form of the disease is
cancer of the stomach, which constitutes about
forty per cent of the total; next comes cancer
of the breast, fourteen per cent, cancer of the
intestines, eleven per cent, and cancer of the
throat, nine per cent.
Whether the control and use of radium can
be left to private charity, to financial interests, or to anyone other than the responsible authorities of the state, should be decided at once. One wonders what will happen
in the future; whether the richest countries
in the world will not try to buy all the radium
that can be found, and whether in the interests of their own citizens, radium-producing
countries will not have to control exportaIn France the Government provides

radium for use at fifteen national centres.
This is a sound principle.
The treatment of cancer by X-rays and
radium bas made great progress during the
past ten or twelve years, and it seems likely
There is

reason te believe that experimental radiophysiology will provide us with a new biological knowledge, new ways of utilizing the
rays, more powerful electrical apparatus and
X-ray generators, and larger quantities of
radium, by which we may be able to cure
many varieties of cancer and at more advanced stages of the disease.
I can conceive of no higher objective for
the Government of this country than the
elimination of this scourge, and I think the
federal and provincial governments and departments of health should co-operate to that
end. If the Federal Department of Health
bas any function at all, surely this is a field
in which it should exercise it.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Honourable members,
I understand that there is to be a very important committee meeting this afternoon,
and I therefore chcerfully abide by the wish
of the right honourable leader of the House,
and move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

DUPLICATION IN CANADIAN RAILWAY
SERVICES
MOTION AND DISCUSSION

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will move:
1. That in the judgment of the Senate, in
order to give immediate relief by eliminating
some duplication in the service of the Canadian
Railways, pending action by the commission
presently investigating the Canadian railways,
a committee composed of an equal number of
present officials from the Canadian Pacific and
the Canadian National Railways, be formed,
and elect an umpire. Failing to agree in their
choice, the Supreme Court of Canada shahl
appoint this umpire.

2. That a copy of the Order in Council
appointing the present gentlemen investigating
our railway problem be deposited on the Table
of the Senate.
3. That he will call attention to railway conditions in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I shall not
take up much time on this subject. I *may
say that 'my motion was suggested to me by
a letter that I saw in one of the papers; I
think it was the Montreal 'Gazette. It does
not seem likely that the report of the Railway Commission will be presented in time to
be dealt with at this session, which, according
to all indications, may not last much longer.
In the meantime the duplication in railway
services is going on and is costing thousands
and thousands of dollars. Both the large railway companies are running trains to and from
the same cities, through practically the same
territory, although there are not nearly enough
passengers to fill the trains of one company
alone. I do not know whether an expression
of opinion by the Senate would have any
influence towards eliminating this unnecessary duplication. I would remind honourable
members that there would be no expense connected with the appointment of a committee
such as I suggest, because all the members
would be salaried employees of the railways.

SENATE
The only item of cost would be the remuneration given to the umpire. Best results would
bo acconplished if the two railways could
agree upon an umpire, for they probably
would select a railroad man who would know
how to deal with the situation.
The Railway Board should have attended
to this matter a long time ago. I do not
want to take up the time of the House in
saying what I think about the Railway Board,
but I want to point out that for some six
months not one member of it was a lawyer
who had ever practised before a court of justice in this country. Judge McKeown and Col.
Thomas Vien, both of whom had resigned,
were lawy ers, and were very efficient conmîissioners. I know that Col. Vien was
particularly efficient. He took a great deal of
interest in the work of the Board and was an
influential iember. The remaining members
of the Board, who had never practised law,
rendered a judgment, which has been before
the Privy Council in England. One of the
commissioners, who I an told is a farmer,
although he calls himself a merchant-I
suppose, because he has sold grain-actually
dilated to the exent of three closely typewritten ,foolscap pages on the argument that
the Privy Council was wrong. Arnong the new
appointees there is no lawyer from the Province of Qucbec, although there is, I understand, a notary public. Well, I cannot throw
any stones at the Government for that, be-ause the Government of dear Sir Wilfrid
Laurier appointed the Hon. Michel Esdras
Bernier, who was a notary. But he did net
take very much part in the discussion of the
legal matters that came before the Board.
The subject-matter of this motion is not
my own idea; I do not claim any credit for
it, having read it in the Montreal Gazette;
but the proposal is very simple, and its adoption would, I believe, immediately solve some
of the problem involved in the duplication of
railway services. That is all I have to say.
I therefore propose the motion, seconded by
the honourable senator from Saint John (Hon.
Mr. Foster), who, I understand, would like
to move the adjournment of the debate.

BEAUHARNOIS COMMITTEE'S REPORT

Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, as I desire to take advantage of this
motion to make some extended remarks on
the diversion of the grain trade of Canada
through American ports, I would ask the leave
of the House to adjourn the debate until
Tuesday next.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I may say that the
special committee referred to has had two
sittings to-day, and has adjourned to meet at
10.30 to-morrow morning, and I think the
majority of the members are eager to expedite
the business as much as they can.

The debate was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

INQUIRY
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I would ask the right
honourable leader of the House when we may
expect the report of the Beauharnois Committee. This committee has been sitting for
more than two months, the evidence was all
in two or three weeks ago, and the country
and the House are very eager to know when
the report will be laid before the House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: More authoritative information could come from the conmittee than from me. I do net know. I see
news from the other House that its work is
to be finished in a week's time. If such is
the case-and from the source of the information one deems it authoritative, for the conclusion depends more on the Opposition than
on the Government- I do net think we have
much more time to spend.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
members, I agree with what the right honourable gentleman said the other day, when he
intinated that the House of Commons could
net adjourn the Senate. I would suggest that
we ought to stay here until we conclude our
business in an orderly way. I am opposed
to the House of Commons rushing us in the
last day or two. I do not say I have been
innocent all my life, but I have a different
viewpoint since I began te sit on committees
of the Senate and te hear discussions in this
House, where members do net make speeches
unless they have something to say. If the
Commons make fast progress they will be
doing what they have not been doing for the
last two weeks.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I would call the attention of the right honourable member who has
just taken his seat to the fact that if we are
delayed it will be because of this committee
that has taken two months to do its work,
and has net completed it yet.

say is that my honourable friend is not on

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. V. WHITE moved the second reading of Bill 32, an Act respecting the Ottawa
and New York Railway Company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen, this is a Bill from the Commons,
I am quite sure from memory. I have had
representations made against the Bill, but the
last of the data filed I have not yet had time
to read. However, I make no objection to
the passing of the measure, without going
farther than that, for the present, on the
principle; the. understanding being that it
will go to the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONTROL OF RADIUM FROM
CANADIAN ORES
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Senator McRae:
That in the opinion of this House the Government should declare its intention to control the
production and distribution of all radium procured from Canadian ores; and to that end
should immediately appoint a Canadian Radium
Commission to investigate and recommend at
the next session of Parliament the best methods
to adop.t to give effect to such control.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
before the honourable member from Essex
(Hon. Mr. Lacasse) proceeds with his speech
I wish to offer an explanation. When the
honourable member from Boissevain (Hon.
Mr. Schaffner) was speaking yesterday he
referred to the durability of radium, and I
interposed a question, "For how many years
could it be used?" He intimated that he
thought it could be used indefinitely. I then
remarked that I had read that this metal
would retain its properties for about 1,700
years, and the laughter and comment with
which my innocent statement was received
led me to think that several members
supposed I was making a joke. I was not.
I read in a magazineHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We all read it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If the honourable
gentleman will just. maintain peace for a
monent, I shall have finished. I read in a
magazine, British or American-I forget which
-a few years ago, that some medical or
scientific school had made a calculation showing that this particular commodity would
retain its properties for about that number of

years. When the Senate adjourned I took
the opportunity of meeting one of the medical
men of this House, and he told me that I
was correct in making that statement. I
believe the object of the writer of that article
I read was to show that even if only a small
amount of this commodity were obtained
every year, or even every decade, because
of the length of time it lasts, there would be
a sufficient supply in the world in a reasonable
time.

Why does not
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
the honourable gentleman adjourn the debate,
or wait until the other member finishes, if
he is going to make a speech?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I merely wish to add
that in the remark I made yesterday I had
no intention of making a joke, and I had a
fair basis for my statement.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable gentlemen,
when I adjourned the debate yesterday my intention was not to make a long speech now,
and discuss at length a subject which has
already been thoroughly dealt with by the
three able and well-informed speakers who
have preceded me. I was just wanting to
emphasize a few of the points already touched
upon by my honourable friends, and to draw
the general conclusions which, to my mind,
this debate seems to inspire.
The honourable senator who introduced this
resolution on the formation of a Radium
Commission (Hon. Mr. McRae) centered his
remarks mostly around the producing and
marketing of the precious metal.
The honourable gentleman who followed him
(Hon. Mr. King), a member of the profession,
made a very comprehensive exposé of the distribution of radium, its scientific application,
and its use as a therapeutie agent to alleviate
and sometimes to cure a limited number of
diseases.
Then the honourable senator from Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) gave us interesting statistics, pointing out that the effect of
the administration of radium is, so far, not
as reliable and conclusive as most people believe.
Now, honourable members, I do not wish

to be wearisome, I repeat, either by holding
or attempting to hold a clinie for this honourable House, most of whose members have
serenely passed the age for taking up a new
university course, or by unduly repeating what
has already been said on the subject. I simply
want to place myself on record as being in
favour of this resolution asking for the
appointment of a Canadian Radium Commission, provided such a move-

SENATE
(1) will not be a step towards nationalization of mining development and exploitation;
(2) will not affect in any way, shape or
form the rights and prerogatives of the various
provinces of Canada;
(3) shall be directed mainly towards controlling exclusively the supply and distribution
of radium according to a Dominion-wide and
uniform plan, regulating, as time goes on, its
exportation, and directing as much as possible
of it towards medical centers, thereby helping
the suffering of mankind rather than satisfying the demand of industry.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable gentlemen, we have heard during this debate almost
exclusively from members of the medical profession. I think that, with the exception of
the sponsor of the resolution, no one outside
of that profession has spoken; therefore the
discussion has been very largely confined to
the disease of cancer. It is not my intention
to touch upon that, needless to say. The only
sentiment I could express in regard to that
disease and the treatment of it by radium, is
that it is our hope and prayer that those men
who are devoting their lives to research in
order to discover what radium may be able
to do with cancer may be given grace and
power to make more use of radium, and
greater use as time goes on.
I want to say a few words about the economic side of the question. We know that in
the last few years there has been an inclination in many countries, particularly in Canada, to pass everything over to the central
government. We know that the Government
of Canada, to say nothing of the provincial
governments, is overloaded with anxieties and
worries, with great deficits and great financial
problems, which it must solve some way in
order to bring us out of the present situation.
I have no doubt that time will bring about a
solution of many of these great questions, but
meanwhile I do net think that problems involving what may be very large amounts of
money should be thrown indiscriminately into
the hands of the Federal Government or of
any other government.
I will just touch for a very few moments
on this question as I see it. The honourable
gentleman from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) has spoken at some length of the expenses involved and the savings that might
be effected in developing such a pitch-blende
deposit as we have on the shores of Great
Bear Lake. Amongst other things he said
that this pitch-blende should be brought down
in its raw state, at the rate of about $100 a
ton for freight. I have before me a report of
Hon.

Mr. LACASSE.

Mr. Spence, of the Department of Mines, who
wrote a very excellent brochure on the occurrences of pitch-blende and silver ores at
Great Bear Lake. He says:
At the present

value of radium, ore could

easily meet the cost of shipment to rail, $400
per ton.
That is the shipment to rail alone.
Improved transportation facilities, however,
will have to be provided if serious production

1s to be attained.

I mention that merely to show how far we
are from getting anything exact as to the cost
of the development of this great body of
pitch-blende.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
said also that those who hold the claims, or
developments, or semi-developments, up there,
should be treated generously, and towards the
end of his address he gave what I took to be
his idea of generous treatment of the holders
of those claims when he said that the twenty
tons of pitch-blende now in Ottawa are valued
at $100,000. I may say that there are some
seven hundred claims staked in the Great
Bear district. I do net know how many of
those claims have been developed, or how far
the development has gone-the information
is all laid out in a report from the Mines
Branch, which can be obtained by any honourable members who are interested-but if
the twenty tons that we have down here are
valued. even though in a generous way, at
$100,000, what value is to be placed on these
seven hundred claims?
Taking into consideration the fact that these mines have very
heavy deposits of silver, I have calculated that
a value of $5,000 or $10,000 a claim might be
very reasonable in the eyes of the would-be
purchaser; but perhaps the value would be
many times as great in the eyes of the owners.
If you figure that up for seven hundred
claims, the initial expenditure of the Government in taking over these claims, even without being generous, would run to many millions of dollars, and even before we began to
produce or ship radium the scheme would be
handicapped by the enormous overhead of
many millions of dollars, to say nothing of
the cost of production.
On the question of the cost of production
the honourable senator has told us that, taking into consideration the by-products and
their value, we should be able to produce
radium at about $5,000 a gram. If I remember correctly, the honourable senator from
Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) stated yesterday that it takes one thousand tons of
coal to produce a gram of radium. If I
am wrong in that he will correct me. It

APRIL 21, 1932
.would seem to me, therefore, that we have

right there a cost of $5,000. Without doubt,
the very rich silver deposits in the pitchblende would go a very long way towards
helping to pay the other expenses that might
be involved.
I believe that the resolution of the honourable senator fromn Vancouver goes too far, in
asking this House to express the opinion
that the Government should declare its intention to control the production and distribution of ail radium procured from CanaThat means, I suppose-I
dian sources.
cannot take any other meaning from it, but
I stand open to correction-that the Government would at once declare its intention
of taking over and controlling these pitchblende deposits. If the honourable senator
had worded his resolution, "That in the
opinion of this House the Government should
appoint a Canadian Radium Commission to
investigate, and to recommend at the next
session of Parliament the best methods," etc.,
everyone could very easily agree; but for this
House to go on record as declaring that the
Government should at once throw itself into
this immense development is, I think, going
too far. If such a very important undertaking
as the procuring of this wonderful commodity
were a matter of only a few hundred thousand
dollars, or even a million dollars, one would
not, perhaps, abject; but I believe that if it
would run into many millions of dollars, as
undoubtedly it would, we should be satisfied
to declare that we are favourable to the
appointment of a commission to investigate
the matter, and should not be too hasty in
asking to have the whole undertaking saddled
on the shoulders of the Government.
Hon. C. MacARTHUIR: Honourable members, from the time the honourable member
from Vancouver (Hon. -Mr. MeRae) commenced to speak on this resolution until now,
my interest in this amazing discovery has
I first became
been steadily increasing.
acquainted with the treatment of cancer by
radium some years ago, since which time I
have closely followed the developments that
have taken place. Perhaps this is because
in my younger days, some thirty-five years
ago, I had a great ambition to study medicine
and to become a physician, or, perhaps, a
wonderful surgeon. However, economic conditions intervened, and I went to the college
of hard knocks instead, and eventually took
up business as my vocation.
Yesterday, while listening to the honourable
senator from Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner),
tiTue turned backwards in its flight, and as I
looked at some of my colleagues opposite,
and to my right and lef t, and noticed them in

217

the arms of Morpheus, I too succumbed, and
I had a dream. During my Iast conscious
moments I heard the honourable senator fromn
Boissevain speaking about typhoid foyer,
diphtheria and malaria. I was waiting for
him to came to, periostitis, in which I arn
particularly interested, but he refrai'ned. In
my dream I thought I was a practising physician in attendance at a medical convention,
where, they were holding a clinic, and I was
waiting to hear of the apptication of this
wonderful treatment to periostitis.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is it?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHIJR:
An infection,
followed by inflammation of the bone.
To my mind the medical profession is perhaps the most honourable profession in the
world to-day. It bas great opportuities for
he'lping mankind and doing good. In settlements where the population is sparse the
family physician is not only the medical
adviser of everybody, but frequently the
counsellor and friend. This, parhaps, is one
reason why doctors make such formidable
opponents at elections.
I was th.inking along somewhat similar linee
with the honourable member for Leeds (Hon.
M-r. Hardy), who spoke of the optiimism
obtaining in regard to the relatively low price
of radium as announced by the honourable
senator from Vancouver, and I was struck by
the fact that the cost of coal would ho a
major factor in the cost of radium. It also
occurred to me that while the cost of a
thousand gallons of distilled water would be
practically neýgligible, one hundred tons of
chemical would cost a good deal of money.
Taking $10,000 as possibly the minimum cost
of a gram of radium in other countries, I
should think that in this country, with the
expenditure on labour, equipment and coal, or
its equivalent in other units, to say nothing of
overheaýd expenses-for chemists are not lowsalaried men-a cost of $5,000 a grame would
be pretty low.
The honourable member from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacasse), a member 0f the medical profession, bas dealt with the legisiative side of
this question. To my mind we are entirely
losing sight of one feature. Why should we
attempt, to bail out a polluted stream? In
my opinion we should endeavour to ge.t at
the source. In the United States there is an
organization with soine two thousand members, and having branches in every state,
before which papers are presented and lectures
given, and through which, by means of the
radio and otherwise, there is disseminated a
knowledge of preventive measures. I do not
know whether or flot there is a similar

218

SENATE

organization in Canada. To my mind there
should be. for it would help greatly in preventing this dread disease. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. I
think we may be concentrating too much on
the cure alone. I have heard one honourable
gentleman go so far as to remark that the
discovery of a very successful cure might have
a tendency to make people careless.
In my opinion the governments, provincial
as well as federal, should interest themselves
in an organization that would encourage
scientific and medical research. We all know
of the wonderful results of the discovery
by Pasteur in the treatment of rabies, and in
the field of bacteriology; we are all aware
of the discovery of Insulin by Banting, and
of the anti-septic treatment introduced by
Lister. Those men have been honoured, as
they should be, but to my mind the scientist
who can discover the cause of cancer will
go down in history as the greatest benefactor
in centuries of the human race. And once
the caiuse of the disease is discovered a remedy
should soon be found.
I noticed a few discrepancies in the remarks of the proviens speakers in regard to
the length of the effective life of radium, but,
as was pointed ont in reply to the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes),
the variations will not make much difference
to the present generation or some generations
to come.
'I understand that radium xvas discovered
in 1896 by Madame Curie and her husband,
assisted by the chemist Debierne, whose work
has not, perhaps, received the recognition that
it deserved. We find that .cancer research
bas been going on since 1850. From 1850
to 1860 it was carried on by noted scientists
according to Virchow's theory of cellular pathology. Then, in 1880, arose the rival theory
of Cohnheim. I believe that the discoveries
of the earlier period are the basis of the research work that is being carried on to-day.
It is somewhat remarkable that the discovery of the X-ray by Professor Roentgen in
1895 should have been followed so closely
by the discovery of radium. In many respects
they have a similar effect. It is remarkable
also that during thirty years only one and
one-quarter pounds of radium have been produced in the whole world. It was known
only in the forrn of a salt until 1910, when it
was discovered in metallic form by Madame
Curie, assisted by Debierne. To give you
some idea of the remarkable energy of this
metal, I may say that when it comes into
contact with paper, it burns it; it also decomposes water, and oxidizes rapidly when exposed
to the air. An idea of the colossal number
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR.

of atoms that compose a gram of radium may
be gained from the statement that despite the
destruction of 37,000 millions of atoms per
second, through disintegration, the actual loss
of radium is about 0.04 per cent a year.
On the whole, I have much sympathy with
the resolution that bas been .presented, but in
part I agrce with the honourable senator from
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). Of one thing I
am certain-that all honourable members
unite in the hope that the ravages of cancer
may be eliminated in the near future, as other
dread diseases have been eradicated in the
past.
Hon. T. J. BOURQUE: Honourable senators,
as a medical man I am sure I am voicing the
sentiment of my professional colleagues when
I say that we appreciate very highly the
complimentary remarks made by the last
speaker in regard to the medical profession.
I am sure that he is sincere in what he tas
said. I should not like to think for a moment
that he would express such sentiments just
because he happened at the present time to
be under the care of a medical man.
I had not intended adding to the elaborate
and comprehensive addresses of the previous
speakers on this resolution, but owing to the
importance of the subject, I may be permitted to say a word of two.
Let me congratulate my honourable friend
from Vancouver upon having so ably brought
to the attention of this honourable House and
the people of Canada the importance and the
value of radium. He and the honourable members who spoke after him on the subject have
made very clear to 'us the business side of
radium and the way in which this valuable
substance is used for the relief of humanity.
It is admitted that the treatment of cancer
by radium is a method second to none in
bringing about favourable results; yet we all
know that in this respect it is still in its
infancy.
When we think of what medical science was
less than half a century ago, we realize the
phenomenal jprogress it has made. No one
is able to appreciate this so well as the medical
practitioner. I graduated in medicine fortythree years ago, and since that time have
observetd many wonderfu improvements in the
methods of applying relief to sufferers.
If the curative 'qualities of radium -have not
yet been fully discovered, the explanation is
probably to be found in the excessive price
that has been set upon it. I have in my practice
met with many cases of cancer that could have
been treated successfully by the application of
radium, but the expense was so great that the
patients couli not afford to take the treatment.

219

APRIL 21, 1932
There is at times a tendency for governing
bodies to atta;chlittile importance to resolutions
of this nature, but I feel that this one will
not be treated lightly. We know that we have
in the Bear Lake district fairly large deiposits
of pitch-blende, frorn which radium is obtained.
It is certainly of paramount importance that
Canada should see that more radium is made
available, and that it shou'ld thus give scientists
fuller opportunity for experimenting and learnin-, more about its heailing powers. If thcïse
derposits can be devetloped and controlled by
the Government, and if radium can be obtained
in sufficient quantity to bring about a big
reduction in priýce, the day may corne when ail
over this -country every cancer patient, however
poor, vvill be able to receive radium treatment
at the hands of specially qualified medical men,
and thus to take advantage of benefits that
now are available to only a comparatively
small number of affli.oted people.
In conclusion, let me emphasize that I arn
entireily in accord with the Tesolution before us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I do not wish
to have the motion carried at the present
tirne. if honourable members do not object
to my saying so. It would put the Senate on
record as calling upon the Governrnent to
adopt a rather radical and very responsible
line of policy.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My own feelings are not very far apart, if they differ at ahl,
from those expressed hy the honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). I would not
ask the House to vote down the resolution,
unless it were found impossible to amend it.
I should like to adjourn the debate myself,
if no other senator wishes to do so , in the
hope that when the subject cornes up again
I may be able to state more explicitly what
the attitude of the Government is towards the
motion.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meigben,
the debate was adjourned.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: There is other
business that could be taken up to-day, but
if honourable members are agreeable, I should
like the House to adj ourn now. I asked the
honourable senator from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) not to proceed with one of hais
motions, and he agreed. The reason for this
is that the Bankiýng and Commerce Committee,
which is composed of a large number of members of the House, is exceedingly busy with
a very important measure, on whicha it is
desirous of doing some work this afternoon.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

THE BEAUHARNOIS

PROJECT

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. TANNER presented the fourth
report of the Special Cornmittee of the Senate
appointed for the purpose of taking into
consideration the report of a Special Committee of the House of Commons, of the last
session thereof, to investigate the Beauharnoîs
Power Projeet, in so far as said report relates
tu any honourable members of the Senate; and
rnoved that this fourth report be taken into
consideration on Wednesday next.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, the report is very long and would
take most of the afternoon to read. As it
will be printed, I do not see any value in
having it read now. 0f course, it may be read
if any honourable senators wish it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: When will it be ready
f or distribution?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Are we sure
now that this report will he printed and
distributed before Wednesday?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Oh yes, certainly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow,
the Clerk says.
Rîght Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I mean a considerable time bef ore Wednesday. As amatter
of fact, it is a very important report. It is
voluminous, and when we corne to discuss it
we prohably shahl find that it and its lineal
successors will prove very vital to the future
rights of members of the Senate. I think the
humhlest member of this House ought t.o have
full opportunity to read and re-read the report
before it is open for discussion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I cannot give
notice formally, but for the information of
the House I should say that there probably
will be several amendments moved, one of
which rnay be that the report be referred back
t-o the committee and evidjence taken to
discover or establish the customary relationship between parties and campaign funds. I
cannot say more until the report is diecussed.
My reason for rising le to make sure that the
report will be printed and distributed-and
the committee owes it to, the House to have
this done-not just a short time before the

220

SENATE

senators get here next Wednesday, but in
sufficient time to enable them to read and
re-read the contents.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should like to assure
the right honourable gentleman that the printing of the report and of all the documents in
relation thereto is being speeded up. It is
probable that the printed report will be available to-night. There will be no delay whatever
in supplying honourable members of this
House with copies of everything.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps the honourable gentleman could give us the conclusions.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honouraible senators, may I ask the chairman of the committee whether the evening press will have
this report in full?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do net know.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
handed to the press yet?

Has

it been

Hon. Mr. TANNER: What harm iwould be
done, anyway?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think I should
say a word before the motion is put. Certainly it would be most inappropriate so to
hasten the consideration of the report as to
prejudice the opportunity of honourable menbers to peruse it with care. I should not want
to be a party to a proceeding of that kind. At
the same time, the intimation given by the
right honourable senator opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) is that we had better get
started soon or we may be here all summer.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We might be
worse employed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, the right
honourable gentleman can speak for himself
as to that. I know he edits a fine paper.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: At long range.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would
appear to nie that if the report is printed
and distributed to-morrow morning-and I
am assured by the Clerk of the House that it
will be distribut-ed here to-morrow morning-there should be sufficient time between then
a.nd Wednesday afternoon for honourable
members to familiarize themselves with the
documents. But if there is a strong feeling
that longer time is necessary I should not
want to insist on objecting to an extension.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think that
would be perfectly satisfactory.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS moved the second
reading of Bill Ul, an Act to incorporate the
W. S. Newton Company.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Bill?

What is this

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I have just looked through the Bill,
and it is not clear to me why this company
should come and ask for a special Bill of
incorporation, or why the application should
not be made under the Companies Act, in the
same way that others are.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I think there is one
little feature that perhaps would not be
covered by the Companies Act. This firm has
been carrying on business as trustees, assignees in insolvency, and receivers, for some
ycars. It sometimes happens that a trust
company which has the administration of
the estates of deceased persons goes into
liquidation, and that this firm is appointed
administrator of the company. Under this
Bill it asks for power to carry on the administration of the estates of the deceased persons.
In any event, the Bill will be referred to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, and
if there is anything wrong with it, it can be
threshed out there.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As to the
explanation of the honourable senator, if the
special purpose of the Bill is to enable this
company to become the executor of estates
now being administered by a trust company
whieh has gone or may go into liquidation,
the only remark I would make is that this

APRIL 22, 1932
Yarliament lias no power to authorize it to act
as sucli executor. It could lie authorized only
by the Legislature. This being so, the only
extra power asked for would lie beyond our
jurisdiction. I have no objection to the Bill
receiving the second reading, but I hope the
cornrittee will take this point into account.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
ADJOURNMENT 0F THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN rnoved:

UTNEMPLOYMENT AND COLONIZATION
DISCUSSION

Hon. G. LACASSE rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That lie will draw tlie attention of the Governmient to tlie importance of a return-to-tlieland miovement as a measure to alleviate sucli
conditions as are prevailing in Canada to-day.
H1e said: Honourable senators, in view of
my constant-and, I believe, successful--endeavour, ever since I have liad the honour

221

of sitting in this Chamber, to condense rnY
remarks as much as possible and to be brief,
I feel quite at ease in soliciting your patient
attention this time and asking you to bear
with me a littie longer than usual. Furthermore, I arn fully convinced that the subject
I arn about to treat, because of its great
importance and timeliness, invites your rnost
serious consideration.
I know rny voice does not carry the
authority that many other members of this
House possess, but I have waited in vain,
throughout the course of this session, to hear
fromn them sorne pronouncement of interest
with reference to the distressing problemn of
unemployment, which threatens more and
more the social structure and the economie
if e of Canada. However, it rnay lie quite
proper'that a man who resides in a district
which is one of the rnost affected, and wlio
every day cornes into contact with the miseries
of the people in the practice of bis profession,
should be the spokesman, so to say, of the
poor and unfortunate citizens who are now
having the worst time of their lives in keeping
soul and body together.
In 1930 our troubles were only beginning
and unemployrnent was, comparatively speaking, within re-asonable lirnits. An erninent
speaker, then travelling frorn one end of the
country to the other, said repeatedly frorn
rnany platforms and with all the empliasis at
his comrnand: "Conditions like these should
not exist ia Canada."
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: And lie was riglit.
The people of Canada listened to the forcefui plea of that political leader and lie was
returned to, power with a good working
mai ority. H1e was given a free hand. and proceeded immediately to redeem one of his rnost
important promises, namely, to end unernployment in a very short tirne. Nearly two
years have elapsed. and conditions are worse
to-day than they ever were. It is estirnated
that instead of approxirnately 75,000 idle persons there are well over 3N0,000 who are witheut work and without bread at present.
May I be permitted here to quote frorn
another honourable gentlemnan, who, became
Minister of Labour in the new administration
Speaking in this
(Hon. Mr. Robertson)?
Chamber a few months before the last election, lie referred to the so-called state of
starvation then exîsting in, the city of Montreal and to Lord Atholstan's soup-kitdhens,
and he pathetically asked himself:
-w hat is wrong, and why the conditions are
as they are in this young country, with its still
untapped natural resourees, with its virile population. and with the opportunity it would afford

222

SENATE

for every person to be enployed and happy if
proper policies, so far as governmental activities
are concerned, were in existence. . . .
and so on and so forth.
Are not the natural resources of Canada still
untapped? Has this vast Canadian country
shrunk from its 358,162,190 acres of possible
farmland since 1930? Not that I know of.
Still, listen to what the newly-elected Mayor
of Montreal, Hon. F. Rinfret, M.P., was saying in another place a week or so ago:
The difficulty is that we must find not only
thousands but millions of dollars to look after
the overcrowded army of unemployed. I am
speaking now of my few weeks' experience in
office in Montreal. The situation in that city
-and I an afraid it is similar in many other
cities-is perfectly appalling and is much more
disquieting than J thought it could be before
my election to the mayoralty. Every day, in
the City Hall, we have armies of unemployed
cominng to us, men in the most destitute condition, men who have not worked for a number
of months, men who cannot pay their rents,
men who have ne mooney left.
The condition
bas becomte worse for titis reason, that some
ittonthts ago everybody had a little money left,
or a friend or relatives who eould ielp them,
or soeîe pieces of furniture that they could sell.

To-day all these snall resources have been
exhaustel. and if the situation does not immediately inprove the armiy of unemployed will
be greater next fall than it bas been in the
past. . . .
And just a few days ago His Worship, speaking at a banquet at the Club Saint-Denis,
Montreal, repeated the same thing in another
form, saying:
Public-spirited confidence must be lent the
new administration so that it nay battle
successfully against problems which remain the
iost serious in the history of Motreal.
From what I have just read, and from what
I happen to know personally, I feel justified
in saying that present conditions, as regards
untniployment, are almost desperate. One is
inelined to repeat what a famous French
journalist, Louis Veuillot, wrote about a
century ago: "The world bas reached a point
where it must perish or revive"-without any
further

delay.

We

are

facing

a

deadlock.

The inuferturers and merchants say to the
working men: "Buy our goods and we will
give you work and moner." The workmen
reply: "Give us steady work and fair wages

and we will bu' y-our goods." The vicious
circle is complote. and appears to be absoluteilv unbreakable.
Nevertholess, and in
spite of it all, I do believe that the Gordian
knot can be loosened if we take the proper
means to do it. Let us finish where we should
have begun: let us turn to the land.
"Agricslture."
sa a great French economist,
"with the help of some few sister crafts
whose object is similarly the exploitation of
Hon. Mr. LACASSF

the natural resources of land, air and water,
is sufficient to give a nation a good measure
of permanent prosperity." If this principle
be true when applied to other nations, it
should work out well in a country like Canada, which still lias over thirty-five million
acres of arable land in two alone of ber nine
provinces. I conclude, therefore, that a systematic back-to-the-land movement is the only
solution of our problems at this stage of the
crisis: first, because it is socially and economically sound; and secondly, because all
the other means have been tried and have
failed to effect a permanent cure.
When a person is weak and anaemic, and
when his vital organs are threatened by the
complications which usually accompany or
follow the primary disease, the etedical attendant prescribes life in the open and a prolonged sojourn in the country. Let us do
the same in this case and send the overflow
of the population which is crowding the slums
and back lances of our cities, to where life is
healthier for mind, soul and body. We shall
thereby adjust the abnormal distribution of
our rural and urban elements-indeed, Canada, where agriculture is recognized as the
basic industry, bas only 40 per cent of her
total population on the farm-and pursue more
peacefully our national ideals, save our human
capital and man-power, croate domestie
markets for our own industries, boost the
business of our transportation systems and
eventually bring back prosperity to our shores.
"The land is the real and only capital, because it is the most stable, the most immovable and the nost durable: it is the
anchor of salvation," says a respected authority. " Industry is the aeroplane which flies
proudly above the elouds till it crashes to the
ground; agriculture is the plough, which
humsblv digs its furrow, but never collapses,"
says another.
I said a moment ago that all the remedies so
far used to alleviate our present ills have acted
more or less as mild anodynes, to the extent
of creating a craving for more; and it is true.
The first move of the Government at the
sp e-ial session of 1930 was to vote twenty
nilîlions of dollars for relief work and public
undertakings. The money was spent, Provinoial Governments and municipalities were
oetlrtdned with additional taxes and debentire debts, and relief was just temporary.
Tariff modifications towards higier protection
were thon resorted to, with the same unsatisfactor results. Again in the session of 1931
ry
cn anltitious progran of public construction
was lauInched, to the exent of the spending of
a huge suie of money, and no permanent cure
was effectetd. Thousands of people are still

APRIL 26, 1932
hungry, and the public treasury is almost exhausted. The next step will be direct relief,
which is the dole system under a different
name. But a new ray of hope has pierced
through the clouds of our broken illusions:
the Imperial Conference. What will be the
outcome of it? Nobody knows. Suppose that,
in spite of the good and sincere intentions of
the delegates, it meets with utter failure, what
then? Would the Government, in such a case,
embark upon a desperate policy af intensive
immigration? I hope not. But the Acting
Minister of Immigration has recently shown
inclinations that are quite alarming: he has
yielded to the pressure of the Ontario Government, which is inviting five hundred young
immigrants from England to come into
Canada, in spite of the fact that thousands of
young Canadians are idle and depending on
public charity for a living.
If the rules of this House would permit
me to fully speak my mind, I would diagnose
the case of those who are just now talking
immigration as a case of insanity complex; and
I feel that I am in splendid company in
expressing such a view. Let me refer to a
letter published in the Montreal Gazette of
March 5, 1932, and written by the Right
Reverend John C. Farthing, Bishop of Montreal. As I believe that every member in
this House reads the excellent paper published
by my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Smeaton White), I will beg leave to put the
letter on Hansard without reading it.
Young Immigrants Placed On Altar-Government's Proposal to Bring in 500 Boys Condemned by Bishop-To Save Organizations-Wreckage of Immigration Societies FearedWretched Pight of Hundreds of Youths
Depicted.
Strong protest against the Federal Government's action in authorizing the bringing to
Canada of 500 English boys "to be offered as
sacrifices to keep together immigration organizations of various kinds," is embodied in a
letter addressed to the Government recently
by the Rt. Rev. John C. Farthing, Bishop of
Montreal.
Hundreds of such boys already fill breadines in many a Canadian city, the Bishop
points out in a statement to The Gazette. He
enjoins ail Canadians to unite and enter an
emphatic protest against what he ternis "a most
unwise and unjust action, and one which under
existing circumstances will do a great wrong to
defenceless lads.
Signed "John Montreal," the communication is
as follows:
"Ah item appeared in a Montreal paper statthe
ing that the Federal Government and with
Gevernment of Ontario had arranged
certain organizations to bring 200 boys between
14 and 18 years of age into Canada during the
I wrote to both the
immigration season.
Federaal Government and the Government of
the Province of Ontario, and I learned that
the Government had authorized 500 boys to be
brought into Canada during the present season,

and that these boys are to be placed on farme,
chiefly in Ontario, and that the organizations
bringing them here are to be responsible for
them. I have strongly protested to both Governments against any boys being brought to
Canada this year.
"When one has seen hundreds of these boys
in the bread line in Montreal during the past
year, when one knows that a good number of
them have been sent back to England te their
own families by the generosity of private
citizens, to say nothing of those who have been
deported by the Government; and when one
sees now a large number of these boys are
depending upon public charity, one feels indignant indeed that 500 more should be brought
out to share the fate of those who have corne
in the last few years. No doubt some of the
boys brought out have been comfortable on
farms, but there is no doubt either that many
of those who have been brought out have left
the farms in the West and in Ontario, and
even corne in Quebec, and that they have been
drifting from place to place, depending upon
the charity of the people. I cannot imagine
a worse moral influence to which a boy could
be subjected than to lead the life of a tramp,
stealing rides on the railways from place to
place, having no home, no one to be responsible
for him, often-times falling in with the worst
elements of our community.
"One is thankful for the efforts which are
made in many cities to try te help these boys.
If there are situations for 500 boys from the
Old Country, why not give those places to our
own Canadian boys and those Old Country boys
who are out of employment here now? Why
bring 500 boys between 14 and 18 years of age
to face the conditions in Canada as they exist
to-day? Many of thern will gravitate into our
larger cities and share the experiences of those
drifters who have passed through during the
past two or three years.
"It seems to me criminal to bring these boys
out. I am told that it is necessary to bring
them in order to avoid the danger of various
immigration organizations becoming disbanded.
These boys are then to be offered as sacrifices
to keep together immigration organizations of
various kinds. Suredy it would be better to
disband every organization rather than keep
then together at the expense of 500 Old
Country lads. There will be no difficulty in
re-organizing immigration societies when the
country revives and the time comes to encourage immigration; I appeal te Canadians of ail
classes to unite and enter an emphatic protest
against what seerms to me to be a most unwise
and unjust action. and one which under existing
circumstances will do a great wrong to defenceless lads."
Let me now, before concluding, set at rest
the unwarranted fears of certain timid souls,
and endeavour to deal, in a few words, with
the objections which are raised here and there
against a well-organized and Dominion-wide
back-to-the-land movement.
Some will argue that such schemes have
been undertaken in the past and met with
very disappointing results; for instance the
Kapuskasing venture. I have not the time to
discuss all the possible causes of that Northern Ontario fiasco, but it may be that the
men sent there to colonize were lacking either

SENATE
the will or the ability to do it. At any rate
a practically similar plan was carried out by
the Quebec Government in the region of Lac
St. Jean, and met with complete success. Six
thousand families were established there in
the course of a few months, and Premier
Taschereau was convinced, from then on,
that "a back-to-the-land movement is the
only remedy."
Others will say that colonization is too
expensive an experiment for times like these.
Will those friends pretend that the spending
of seventy million dollars per year to feed
idle people indefinitely is more economical?
Then it might be objected that the farmers'
plight is bad enough as it is, without more
producers being added to their ranks. In reply
to that, I will say that the one who goes on the
land just now does not expect to become a
millionaire in a fortnight, but at least he can
produce enough to make a living, and in due
course of time he will net only cease being a
publie charge on the community, but give back
to society, in the form of products, taxes and
new markets for industry, more than what
society is giving him to-day.
There are other objections of a less serious
nature, but I have not time to diseuss them.
Let me remind the Government, thougb, that
among the principal recognized motives that
lead to colonization are the two following ones:
discontent, caused by political or economic conditions, and religion. And J do say, in all
frankness, that on the one hand there is plenty
of discontent in the country to-day; and on
the other, the blood that runs in the veins of
young Canada to-day is the same generous
sap that fed the colony at its origin. Englishspeaking historians of authority, nanely, Parkrnan and Bancroft, have paid the tribute of
their admiration to the religious ideals and
patriotic devotion of the early settlers of North
Amierica.
Now I want to b fair, and mention, in passing, the earnest efforts of certain provinces in
connection witi land development. I am not
unaware that Quebec and Ontario, particularly,
bave already grasped the importance of the
problem. They have grantd all kinds of
gratuities to the brave pioneers of the North;
they have surveyed the land, built new roads,
erected schools, given premiums. and even
supplied unorganized districts with medical
assistance and school facilities on wheels.
I wish to make a short mention here, also,
of the commendable efforts of some municipalitics, namely, Ottawa and Hawkesbury, towards
transforming their vacant lots into gardens.
The reviving of the old war-gardens of a
decade and a half ago, not only on vacant
lots, but also in unoccupied subdivided lands

in the suburban areas of our large cities,
should form a part of this back-to-the-land
movement.
But it seems to me that the federal authorities should more deliberately and more earnestly come to the rescue and co-operate with
all the provinces, and create a permanent
body of public-spirited, unselfish, experienced
and politically independent men-call it a
Land Settlement Commission if you wishthat would deal with all the phases of this
vast problem in a practical, intelligent, nonpartisan and diligent manner.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I want to
apologize for having taken so much of your
time. I know that other questions of great
importance will soon invite the careful consideration of this House; but it matters little
to the poor fellow who is walking the street
and wearing out the soles of his shoes, looking
for a job that never comes, and who does not
know where bis next bite will come from-it
matters little to him whether Mr. So-and-So
will remain a member of the Senate or not.
It does interest him, however, to know how
long his family will be deprived of its legitimate share of suînshine and comfort in this
proud Canada of ours. I shall therefore not
desist from preaching the gospel of the land
until I sec in every city or town of any size
Governiment booths where all those unfortunate mon who through no fault of their
own have been made human wrecks, and
dumped on the wayside like discarded tools,
will be invited to enlist for work in the woods
or on the farci, provided they are fit, sound
and willing.
After all, if we in Canada do deliberately
believe that it is impracticable, and that it
costs too much, to develop and exploit the
large expanses of vacant land which Providence bas been so good as to favour us with,
let us be practical and let us turn into ready
cash those dead assets. Let us enter into an
international agreecment and sell those lands
to the highest bidder. Perhaps the Mikado
or the Great Ruler of Italy would be interested
in such an offer, as much as Uncle Sam was
when he bought Alaska from Russia and
Louisiana from France.
Any Canadian father who stands up and
with the faith, love and devotion of a truc

also bears in mîîind that the land of his forefathers will be the land of his sons and

SENATE

I saw the other day a statement made by
an official employed in taking single men from
the cities out to the farms. He was asked:
"How do you keep them tlhere?" He replied:
"Well, when I leave the farm I always shut
the gate after me." That is about as far as
any policy goes in keeping people on the
farm. This problem requires something deeper
than the making of broad statemente about
solving difficulties by placing people on the
farm. We have to find markets to make it
profitable to a man to live on the farm, and
we have to improve farm life.
Perhaps it is not out of place for me to
remark, with reference to the railway agreements that were in existence when I was
Minister of Immigration, and as to which
considerable has been said, that no families
nor individuals were ever brought from Europe
under an agreement that did not provide that
they should be placed upon farms and should
not become a burden on the cities. I know,
and J think every honourable senator in this
House knows, how that scheme failed, and
why. The difficulty of keeping people on
farms was almost insurmountable, and I am
afraid it is just as grcat a problem to-day.
As I said before, could I see any other solution for unemployment than to place people
on the land, I would not support a movement
such as this, because I know something of the
difficulties surrounding it.
No family or no single individual ever
came from the continent of Europe under an
immigration plan except to go directly upon
a farm. So something bas been donc in the
past to place people on the land. We had
a 3,000 Families Scheme for placing British
immigrants on the land.
The immigrants
were selected with care and received help
of all kinds towards making a start, but I
am very sorry to say that only a very small
percentage of them made good in the end.
These are not pleasant things to contemplate,
but they must be taken into consideration
in any back-to-the-land scheme.
The back-to-the-land movement may be
preferable to unemployment, but it is rather
noticeable that those who have been most
enthusiastic about it have been men without
agricultural experience. I say this in all kindness, and without any intention of being sarcastic. The people in the city of Winnipeg
who have been doing the most talking about
returning people to the land have been the
ministers, the doctors and the lawyers. I beg
their pardon if I have said anything that
seems to be rude. I do not blame those
people for talking as they do, for they believe
that they have the solution of the problem,
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

but they are not as well able to appreciate the
difficulties as are persons acquainted with
agriculture.
If I understand the scheme that has been
proposed-and what I have to say applies
more particularly to the West-it is to provide
a family with a house on a small plot of land
consisting of a few acres, where they will grow
their own vegetables; or, under a more
ambitious plan, to place them on a larger
acreage, furnish them with a cow, chickens, and
a pig or two. But the cow will want pasture
and winter feed, and the chickens and pigs
will require feed and shelter, and these things
cost money.
I saw in the Citizen the other day a letter
in which an indignant householder, I think,
in Ottawa, said that he did not understand
what the farmers were complaining about;
that they were getting twenty-five cents for
two dozen of eggs, and they got them for
nothing. That is the kind of ideas some of
our city people have about farming. I do
net blame them, because they do not know
any better; but there is the trouble.
Even if the people do go back to the land
they will have plenty of difficulties unless
the land has been cultivated for at least a
year. I do net know much about the soil in
Eastern Canada, but in Western Canada you
cannot start a garden on the prairie without a
great deal of labour. It has to be cultivated
and ploughed, and perhaps cropped once or
twice, before it is suitable for garden purposes,
and a man who does not know anything about
that kind of work will not succeed. Whatever
plan is followed, food will have to be provided
for the family. This will cost money-perhaps
much more money than is anticipated at the
But, with all the difficulties,
present time.
perhaps it would be better to try such a plan
than to have men loafing away the summer
months in idleness.
I think something might be done in the way
of collective farming. This is net Communism.
If you send out inexperienced men and start
them on small plots, nine out of ten wili1 fail.
Those who have no acquaintance with agriculture will net raise very much during the
coming summer, and more than likely none of
them will succeed in raising a very good crop
the first year. I have thought that if, instead
of men being sent out individually, a large
acreage could be found not far from a cityI have Winnipeg in mind more particularlythe land could be subdivided into plots; the
people would live close together, and an experienced agriculturist of good executive ability
could be put in charge for the coming summer

APRIL 26, 1932
to instruct these people and make them acquainted with agriculture and the growing of
crops. Whatever plan is adopted, it will be
difficuilt enough, but in view of the serious
situation that we are in at the present time,
I think the question is worthy of consideration.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The honourable gentleman should have tried that when he was Minister.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The difficulties were not
so acute at that time as they are now. I had
enough disappointments when I was Minister
without trying anything more. If I had not
been Minister, and had not spent nearly four
years trying to place people on farms, I might
speak with greater freedom than I do now.
Sometimes when we know more we say less,
and perhaps we speak with greater effect. However, I believe this plan is worth trying. I do
not believe in letting men rust out in idleness
in the cities, losing their manhood and their
independence. I would rather see some plan
like this adopted than let things drift.
A little more than a year ago I had occasion
to speak at Virden, Manitoba. Everyone was
very optimistic; .prosperity was just around
the corner, and everyone seemed to think that
everything was all right. I ventured to be a
little more .pessimistic, and made the statement that a year from that day conditions
would not be any better-that perhaps they
would be worse; and I -was cold-,shouldered by
everybody. But I know who is right to-day.
We are not going to have prosperity immediately. W'here is it coming from? The price
of materials has sunk so low that we are not
likely to have prosperity for some time. Considering conditions in Western Canada, I say
again that the problem is not so much one of
getting people back to the land as of getting
the people on the land to stay there.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: We have had a good
ram.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I received a letter from
home this morning, and I was delighted to
know that they had had a day and a hall of
rain. I made out my income tax return
recently, and I do not think it .would be out
of place for me to say that my operations last
year cost me $1,956-and I have been credited
with being a good farmer. It may be said
that I do my farming at long range. That is
true not only of me, but of hundreds or thousands of others.
What is the use of shutting our eyes to the
facts? We have a great country, great
natural resources. No better people exist than
the people in Western Canada, and I believe
41787-15à

227

that everything will come out right. But
conditions will never right themselves, of their
own accord, simply because we believe that
some morning we shall wake up and find
prosperity. We shall be prosperous again only
if we take the means and find the opportunity
to become prosperous.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, I should like to discuss the resolution
from a little different standpoint from that
taken by the honourable senator from Essex
(Hon. Mr. Lacasse), though with relation to
the unemployment problems in this country.
I think there is too general a tendency to look
upon the unemployment situation as temporary, something that will clear up once there
is a revival in business conditions. For my
own part, I think that that view is wrong.
While an industrial revival would relieve unemployment to some extent, we are going to
have unemployed people among us for many
years to come, because of some conditions to
which I should like to refer. In rising to speak
on this question I have the hope that the
Government may see fit to investigate the
unemployment situation from an angle that
I shall suggest.
We know that the mechanization of industry
has developed rapidly. I doubt very much
that that development will cease after the return of better times. As long as it continues
men and women will be thrown out of work
in various branches of industry and will have
to seek occupations in other avenues. Nor is
there a brighter prospect for that type of
labour called rough labour, which has been
employed in the construction of railways and
of public works in the municipalities, the
provinces and throughout the Dominion.
Public works have been carried on so extensively during the past two years, as relief
measures, that it seems to me there will be a
comparatively small number of them for some
years to come. For example, the municipalities have constructed waterworks, sewage
systems, and roadways, and the provinces have
built highways and utilized rough labour on
various undertakings to an extent to which
these things would not have been done but for
the desire to provide relief. What opportunities
will there be for that type of labour in the
near future?
Then we must consider the fact that our
cities and towns have been largely overbuilt
with apartment houses, hotels and office
buildings, so that for some years there are
likely to be vacant premises in many of our
larger centres. That indicates much less
activity in the building trade than we have
been accustomed to. I do not want to paint

228

SENATE

too dark a picture; I simply desire to state the
situation as it appears to me at present, and
to give some consideration to the possibilities
and probabilities of the future.
I suggest that there should be a study of
the unemployed of the country. Such a
study could be very easily carried on in every
province through the employment offices
where men come in to register for work. Why
should these men net be asked to fill out a
questionnaire, so that there may be a record
of their lives, indicating where and at what
they had worked in the first place, and any
changes of employment or place of residence
up to the time they were thrown out of
work?
If we attempt to solve the situation by a
back-to-the-land policy, then we should be
careful to place on the land only those who
have had some experience in farming. In
my judgment it would be very foolish to
try to make farmers out of people who had
always previously lived in cities or towns. But
there may be in Canada thousands of men
who at one time worked on farms, who later
drifted into the cities, where they obtained
employmeont in factories or stores, and who
now have nothing to do. If it is possible to
make contact with a large number of those
men, we may put into operation a back-tothe-land movement that may help to relieve
the unemployment problems.
I very much doubt that a back-to-the-land
policy would go far towards relieving the
general situation throughout the country. The
prosent condition of farming in Canada is such
that there is net a very strong appeal for anyone to go back to the land. But it has occurred to me that much good might be done
by encouraging men who have had experience
in agriculture te take up small plots of land,
sufficient to provide themselves and their
fanilies with food. I know of a number of
cases where men who are earning a little
money on jobs of various kinds are able to
support their families by aiso cultivating small
plots of land on the borders of cities. But
these men know how to make the most out of
the land, for they have had farming exper:ence. Now, this seems to me a plan that
should be encouraged, and serious consideration should be given to the question whether
it can be extended throughout the country.
It bas the advantage of not destroving the
independence of the men who are benefited by
it.
I think the Government, or some department, or possibly a committee of this House,
might very well investigate the entire unemployment problem from all its angles. We
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

must realize that unemployment will be with
us to a very considerable extent after the
present stressful times have disappeared. This
is a conclusion that I have reached after
thinking over the matter for some time, and
I feel that we ought te attempt to find some
nieans of relieving conditions with which we
shall have to contend for many years.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, the times through which we
are passing are exceedingly stressful. Their
unexampled difficulty and their equally unexampled universality indicate that the causes
are deep-seated and more or less permanent,
and that consequently the remedies are very
far-reaching and difficult to apply. I have no
very great optimism that much can be accomplished toward reviving conditions by proceeding along the line of the resolution, but that
does net at all lead to the conclusion that the
resolution is net worth wbile or that some
application of its principles would not be
beneficial.
I was very delighted to hear again, in this
connection, the voice of the honourable
senator from Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke). It
carried me back to more youthful times. I
could net help but think of a period somewhat more than a decade ago, of the prices
prevailing then for farin products and of the
generally rather happy conditions under which
agriculture, in common with other industries,
was conducted at that time. And I recall well
that that was the very period when he headed
a powerful delegation in protest against the
tines, and the hard conditions under which
they lived. I Iwell remember also the word
pictures of the Utopias, and of the Eldorados
of agricultural prosperity, towards which his
party were to lead the people of this country.
I have a recollection of not only the paths
that were te be travelled, but the leaders
who were to bring us to the promised land.
And especially I recall his own leader of that
day looking across at the rest of us, in the
old, discarded parties, begging us to get behind
hin that he might lead us te the uplands, where
the air was pure and sweet. But I can only
look across now and in spirit shake the hand
of the honourable member from Brandon and
congratulate him that he has lived through
to this time, when the whole universe would
rejoice if only the happy conditions against
which he protested could be restored.
The back-to-the-land movement and the
arguments in its support are, of course, not
strange

ears.

APRIL 26, 1932
able senator 'from Brandon or the honourable
senator whose very practical address has just
concluded. Farming, in the ývery best of
times, is flot an easy occupation and it is flot
one that leads to great wealth. At this time
it is among the most difficuit ways in which
anyone can undertake to make a living.
Sometimes when commodity values faîl the
incidence applies to the more primary products
first and reaches the secondary products later.
However that rnay be, the faîl that we have
experienced covers the wJ.ole range of products that are raised, and it is so pronounced
and exmphatic that it has put out of balance
the relationship between debtor and creditor
the -world over. That something must be
applied to that situation before anything in
the way of a general alleviation can be haped
for, seemns to me apparent. And we must look
first towards a reconstruction of international
debts, and secondly towards such an improved and more elastic currency system as
will tend, flot to restore the same relationship
between different .products as has al*ways
existed, for that is impossible, but to give
something in the nature of stability to the
general average of ail comm-odity values.
By the .very light of reason this can be brought
about, and it is an indictment against the
brains of our race that we have been slow in
doing something to approximate it. There is
no fundamentai reason why the level of the
average or aggregate of commodity values of
the world should vary drastically from. year to
year. It should be more or less stationary,
allowing for such variation between the values
of different articles as the law ad demand and
supply rnay compel.
But these are big things and beyond the
ccope of the resolution. In. the meantime it is
quite clear that we must address ourselves to
local conditions. We are on*iy one nation and
we cannot do anything of a 'major characeter,
towards a betterment of world conditions, save
in co-operation with other nations. But we
can ap-piy local remedies, local alleviations,
and it seemis to me that the principle of the
rescoiution is one. The honourable senator froma
Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) will recail that in
the Department of Immigration, under the
present Minister, considerabie bas been done
along the uine of this back-to-the-land movement. The Min.ister has succeeded in bringing back to the country, to plots usually more
or less smail, -but not always emall, a rather
large number of families--relativeiy few, of
course, 'in pro~portion, to the total of unempîoyed, but nevertheless a worthwhiîe nuinher
-and the resuits, as far as I have been able
to Jearn from studying them, have been satisfactory; and they have been valuabde flot only

229

in themselves, but also as demonstrating what
can be acconaplished in this way. I will go
furthcr and say that the Government has under
consideration at the present time an extension
of that poiicy, an extension which probably
can be niade more safely and more hopefully
because of the experience that we have had
under the Minister of Immigration. The basis
of that extension is a co-operative contribution
system, particilpated in by the municipalities,
the provinces and the federal Administration.
But the numbers that we can hope to, have
taken. care of along this line are not reilativeiy
large; possibiy we might look forward to
benefiting some 5,000 or 10,000 familles, or
even more. This number, however, is large
enough to make the sc'heme worth while.
It surely is well, even though the prices of
farm products are 10w, that men for whom no
work can be found, because of the period in
which we are living, shoukI at Jeast be able to
turn their hands to occupations that do not
require very great study or experience, in
order that they may produce enough, not for
sale, but for the feeding of themnseives and their
families. This is the priniciple behind the
back-to-the-land movement as n-ow in effect,
and it is the principlo behind any exten.-:on
which we may be able to make. I amn personally glad that the fionourable senator from
Essex has brought the subject to our attention.
We could not occupy our time better than in
discussing it. I arn in hapes that before
another year passes round we shahl be able to
show the honourable gentleman results in the
way of the practîcal application of bis doctrine
that will be gratifying not on-ly to him, but to
the en-tire House.

Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, you were good enough to grant me the
privilege of moving the adlournment of the
debate on this motion which is now before us
for consideration. I must say that I arn not
altogether in favour of the motion, more
particularly the first clause as it stands. Neyertheless, I became the seconder of the motion
in ord-er that I might take advantage of the
opportunity presented by the motion to discuss a matter which 1 consider of very considerable importance, narnely, the general
situation with regard to the railways. I wish
also to present to the mürmbers of this buse
and to the GoveTnmcnt a situation which exists
at present wvith regard to the diversion of a
considerable quantity of 'Canada's produets,
more particulaTly grain. and to suggest such
mensures as would appear to be advisable so
that that diversion should be changed from
the route now taken, down the Great Lakes
and through American connections to Arnerican
ports. This freight should bc handled over
the ýCanadian railways, thereby giving traffic
to our railways, which need it very badly at
present, and down through our ports, whiých
have been eciuipped to handie the business,
and on which x'ast arnounts of mon-ey have
been spent and are stili being spent. We should
thereby handie n muoh larger quantity than
that which under present circurnstances we
receive.
While other opportuuities for presenting our
views on this important question of the railways, îvhich is before us to-day, rnay have
heen available by reason. of certain legislation
that has been brought before this House for
consideration at different times, more especially financial buis empowering the Government to borrow certain arnounts of inoney
from tirne to time to take care of the deflcits
of the Canadian National Railways, and for
equipment and other purposes, yet there did
not appear to be very much inclination on the
part of honourable members, including myseif,
to criticize those measures unduly or discuss at
any great Iength the problema of our railway
business. Probahly the ideas of other honourable members were like mine, and it was hoped
that conditions would change to the extent
and degree that the arnount.s a.sked for would

elimlinatcd îvith the return. of botter -conditions, and that the balance might be on the
right side. But, unfortunatcly, up to the present we have not seen that situation corne to
pass. Instead, we see growing deficits on the
opcration of otîr railwvays, running ail the way
pcrhaps frorn S.500,000 or $600.000 per week up
to $800,000 or $900l.000 per week. I noticed in
the pr'ess this morning the report that the
gross earnmngs of the railways in Canada for
the we.ek ending April 21 reached a larger
amount than usual. In the case of the Canadian National Railways the decrease in the
revenue for the week ending April 21, as comnsjarcd witb the revenue for the corresponding
period of la.4t year, arnounted to sornething
more than 8800,00,
wvhile in connection with
he Can'adian Pacifie llailway it was over
$700000. So, instcad of those rcquests for increa.scd borrowing powcrs hein-, reduced, the
pco.spect is that they will be increased in the
r.car future, for the reason I have statcd.
This situation, honourable gentlemen, togethcr with the large amount of money required froin time to time, must impress us
with the faut that the subjeet is one that in
importance, froin the financial point of view,
is far above any other matter that has heen
broîîght to the attention of the members during this session.
I noticed in flhe press flie other day that the
Minister of Railxays-a very thoughtful man,
I arn sure, and one who lias had considerable
cxperien"e in connection with the publie affairs
of this country-made the scatement to a
Conservative association. I think, before
which he ivas speaking in Toronto last
ixethat the Canadien National Railways
was the grcatest problem that the country had
to-day. In faut, I think the opinion is generally expressed that unless some measures of
a comprehiensive character in the way of relief, or suggestions along some comprehensive
hunes, are brought forward, the taxation, which
is growing and becoming a considerable
burden on the taxpayers of this country,
must u'each v'ery much larger proportions than
it dues to-day, in order to take care of the
railway deficit.
I do not think, therefore. that any of us
e.eed make any apology for bringing to tlue
attention of this House and the country generally the situation as I see it. which I shail
describe to the members of this House in my
plain way.
0f course, somne ivilI say that we ffeed not
have very much fear; that. we are borrowing
the money we require from time to time, and
tlîat things w'ill right themselves in due course.

APRIL 26, 1932
I have heard it stated that prosperity is
around the cornier, but I think the street rumning towards that corner is much longer than
any of us anticipated, and I have not yet
heard many people say that they have met
that gentleman named Prosperity; nor are
they likely tai meet him for the present, at ahl
events, or ta namne the street on which hie is
likely ta be f ound.
I spent the week-end in ana of the large
cities of Can-ada, and I met a financial friend
of mine there. Naturally, on the tapies of the
day, I inquired of him what hie thought in
regard ta the near future of the financial situation. Hie said taome, "Well, at the present tinie
we are experiencing a 'slump' in the depression." That is as far as hae would go in making any forecast of what the immediate future
might bring f orth.
True it is, honourable senators, that a commission has been appointed ta go thoroughly
into this very important question. That commission is composed of very prominent and
capable men versed in the business of the
country, some of them. railway experts, who,
I have no doubt, 'will be able in due time
ta bring forward some panacea, or something that will aid in th3 solving of this probhem. I think there is :omnewli:it of a disappointment in the country at large that,
owing ta the continued depression which. is
surrounding us, the commission is flot going
to report during the present session of Parliament. I arn nat offering any eriticîsmn in that
regard, because, as 1 think we aîl appreciate,
the question that is baf are this commission,
which has been appointed an the suggestion,
I think, of Sir Henry Thornton himself, is a
problemn with many angles which must be
takenl into consideration in order that there
may be a report of such a character that the
people of the country may place considerable
confidence in it. The cammissioners can be
very readily excused, and no criticismn should
be offered for the delay in bringing down their
report, which it is hoped will contain certain
suggestions that may bring about somne
remedy; but, for the reasons which. I have
stated, I think that aven though that report
may be delayed, and aven though the commission may be taking those matters into consideration at the present time, no harm can
be * done in discussing this question frankly
and freely.
At one time, in a moment of weakness, I
purchasad a contralling interest in a small
railway, and when I took charge of the affairs
of that road I found that the saima aid principles which people must apply ta their personal

211

affairs, if they are to, be successful, applied
to that railway, just as they would toi
those large projects that we are discussing,
which are uppermost in the minds of the
people of Canada ta-day, and as they would
apply to any business proposition. I found
that at the end of evary week 1 was confronted with the unpleasant necessity of meeting the pay-roll, that every six months the
interest on the bonds came due, and that
fromn time to time other expenses had to be
met.
1 also acquired some inside information
with regard to the making of freight rates
and the mystery which sometimes surrounds
the railway's application for and the granting
of certain rates. Experience taught me that
you could increase your rates beyond what
the traffie could fairly beur, and that if you
did so you might, as it were, kili the goose
that laid the golden egg. Therefore I think
that very careful conEfiderat.ion should be
given to any suggestions, such as I have
noticed in several newsjapers, for an increase
in rates in Canada under the present business
conditions.
I also learned, in the operation of that
smali unît of railway, that where there was no
water competitian you could charge the saine
rate for moving goods a certain distance as
you could charge for moving the samne coinmodities twice that distance where water
competition prevaîled.
In discussing this matter it is not my intention to go into the ramifications of the capital
structures of the two railways, aven if I could
do so. -It is too much like a Chinese puzzle.
as it were, for the ordinary layman to undertake. W'e do know, however, that we are
called upon fromn time to time ta vote large
sums of money, more particularly for the
Canadian National Railways. Last year
there was a vote of some 86M,000,000, if I
remember correctly, ta make up the deflcieney
between the revenue of the railway and the
cost of operating it and meeting the mnterest
on the debentures outstanding. At the end
of the year there was found to be a shortage
of some $11,000,000, and Parliament at this
session has approved a Bill supplementing
the 868,000,000. I presume that when the
Railway Committee sitting in another place
finishes its labours wa shahl be asked ta paso
further legislation confarring authority to
borrow money.
We know that the liabilities of the Canadian National Railways to-day amount toi
a sumn of about $2,600,000,000. Boiled down
ta something concrete, thay are as follows:

232

A total of. ........

$2,640,000,000

Fromn this total there must be subtracted the
amount of S405,000,000, which is aecounted for
as the cost of the Canadian Government Railways, that is, the old Intereolonial and the
Prince Edward Island Railway, which were
constructed under the Confedieration agreement,
and I think about two hundred million dollars
for that part wvhich is known as the Transcontinental Railway. extending from Moncton to
Winnipeg. Subtracting the .S405,000,000, we find
owing by the Canadian National Railways the
respectable sum of about $2,200,000,000. The
size of this amount is something that an ordinary mortal cannot comprehend.
Then we corne to the Canadian Pacifie Railway. In the statement which recently came
into the hands of some of us we find that at
the date of the last statement the liabilities
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway amounted, in
round figures, to the sumn of $1,000,000,000.
Such amounts are so large that it is almost
impossible for one to conceive them; but somebody, soinewhere in Canada or another part
of the world, is interested in every dollar of
these colossal amounts. Every Canadian citizen
has a share in the Canadian National Railways,
having acquired it at various times and in
divers ways, but he certainly possesses no certificate of ownership; he doca flot own any
parchment with a red seal designating part
ownership in tint railway.
The people of
Canada are still buying it, but on the instal-

ment plan, to the extent of about $1,000,000
a week, or, calculated on the basis of a family
of five. at the rate of fifty cents per week
for each family in the country.
In the case of the Canadian Pacifie Raîlway
the statement reeeived shows that fifty per
cent of the common stock of the company is
owned by the Canadian people, about thirty
per cent by the people of Great Britain and
other countries apart froni the United States,
and about twenty per cent by the people of
the United States. Ordinary stock issued by
that company, according to the statement,
amounts to about S335,000,000, preferred stock
to $137.000,000, and debenture stock to
$300,000,000-a total of $772,000,000. In some
cases the stock of the Canadian Pacific Railway wvas acquired in early days and has been
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

handed down from. generation to generation,
sometimes in large amounts, sometimes in
small ones, in the belief that it would provide
income for future generations. We now find
that owing to existing conditions, and other
reasons which have been stated, including too
much competition, the dividend lias been cut
in haîf; and if conditions continue as they are,
I fear the total elimination of dividend payments.
Therefore I say, honourable gentlemen, that
the Canadian people are interested in the success of both these railways, and that the
success of -each of these great properties is
equally important. In my opinion neither one
should be operated in any way that is detrimental to the other, but under present conditions both should be operated in such a way
as to produce the largest amount of gross
revenue for the two roads at the minimum
cost of operation, either as joint or separate
units.
I wonder. whether fgures like these will
impress the people of Canada or whether the
wise words of the Minister of Railways, uttered
within the past month, that our present
financial structure will be endangered if the
present situation continues, will arouse the
Canadian people to a realization of the serieusness of this problem. Or will some sort of
special tax become necessary, as lias been
suggested by someone, or doubling the income
tax and ear-marking it for railways, so that
without resort to further borrowing the
deficits of the railways may be paid in real
money instead of by book-keeping entries, as
et present? I do flot imagine that any feeble
words of mine will arouse anyone to the need
of giving support to the railways rather than
to other modes of transportation; or to the
necessity of shipping our goods over Canadian
railways and through Canadian ports; or to
supporting sympàthetically the curtailment of
trains, as lias been found necessary from time
to tinie, or other operating reforms that may
be proposed. I am convinued, howex er, that
our peuple must miake up their minds to
accomnmodate the railways, for a time at least,
instead of expecting the railways to accommodate themn, as they have been doing in
the pat.
There is no denying that there bas been
some extravagance practised in connection
with the operation of these railways, but it
lias not always been due, in my opinion, to
the management. Sometimes the demands of
the people have made necessary expenditures
which are now criticized. There linas been an
era of palatial passenger equipment, new
stations, uptown ticket offices, big rents, costly
displays advertising world cruises, for those

APRIL 26, 1932
with depleted incomes and the unemployed
to gaze upon. These things, I say, have flot
always been the fault of the railway management. Apparently, in the years which have
just gone by, everyone expected the railways
to pay for their properties higher rents than
anyone else paid, and it seems as though on
every hand the standard of values surrounding
the railway business generally had been on a
highcr plane than that existing in a general
mercantile business.
On the other hand, I do flot think too
mucli criticism should be directed against the
railway managements. As we travel around
the country we hear criticism. We hear it in
our legislative halls. It seems to be a popular thing to-day to hammer the managements
of our railways for extravagance. Taking
into account the demands of the people, and
considering ahl the circumstances, we should
be tolerant towards the managements of those
two great systems. We have heard criticism
in this House and elsewhere of the hotels
which have been erected throughout Canada
by the railway companies. Whule, perhaps,
in the erection of those hotels there miglit
have been a littie better distribution, or an
avoidance of duplication, I think it is well
that we should bear in mind the fact that
if those hotels had not been erected by the
railways they probably would not have been
erected at ahl. We should remember also
that they have done a very great deal to
encourage the tourist trafflc, which is of sucli
benefit to the people of Canada at the
present time. The two greatest sources of
wealth in Canada to-day are the grain trade
and the tourist traffle. I noticed a statement
issued the other day by the United States
Commerce Department to the effect that
during 1931 almost five million motor cars
crossed into, Canada from the United States,
and that the wealth lef t in Canada as a result

amounted to $188,000,000.

Therefore, honour-

able gentlemen, you can see that the hotels
have aided very materially in inducing American tourists to travel in Canada, and that
the building of those hotels lias brought considerable wealth to this country. It is a question, therefore, whether or not, in the long
run, the money spent in erecting these hotels
has flot been well iiivested.
Jn my humble opinion, based upon what I
have observed, the railways of Canada have
been efficiently and effectively managed.
Taking it ahl in all, and considering the
enormous expenditures that have been made,
I have neyer heard any charge that money lias
been inisa.ppropriated.
Mr. Beatty, the head of the Canadian
Pacific Railway, is, I amn sure you will agree,
a mnan in who-m the people of Canada have

233

every confidence.
We feel that lie will
eventually bring lis great task to a successfui conclusion. On the otlier liand, I am convinced in my own mi, and I give expression
to it in this publie place, that Sir Henry
Tliorntonl i.s entitled to considerable praise for
the mnanner in which he lias brouglit together
that great mass of twisted steel, that conglomeration of railways that existed in Canada
prior to their absorption into what I regard
as one cd the greatest railway systems in the
world to-day.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
honourable gentleman give us the year in
which the Act was .passed that brouglit tliem
ail together?
Hlon. Mr. FOSTER: I have not tliat information.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It was a year
and a haîf hefore Sir Henry Thornton came.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: 1 arn quite prepared
to give to anyone wlio lias managed the
railways at any time since tliey were brought
together, every credit for what lias been
accomplished. I have no desire to single out
Sir Henry Tliornton, the present manager of
the Canadian National Railways.
I think that these gentlemen, Mr. Beatty
and Sir Henry Tliornton, wlio are mainly responsible for the conduct of these railways, are
to a considerable extent the victims of circu.mstances. We certainly have too mucli railroad in Canada, but I do not think that
those gentlemen can be lield responsible for
that to any great degree. During the course
of the railway age the people demanded railways and 'pressed their demands upon the
Government. It would appear that during
that age every community tliought that in
order' to be successful or to become
prosperous it hiad to have railway communication. Conditions in the railway world have
chaniged, as tliey have in other dorms of business activity. First of ail, tliere is the
economic situation and the world depression.
Tariff walls have 'been erected which have
ýdamned the stream of international trade.
There lias been a change of conditions in the
lumber trade, and in the pulp and paper
business, which were great sources of revenue.
These things, and the diversion of a large
amount~ of Canadian business througli
American ports, have resulted in a great
decrease in railway earnings. These factors
and others, which have brouglit about the
situation that at present exists, were well dealt
wjth in an editorial in the Montreal Gazette
of, I think, January 3. As this is the second
time this paper has been mentioncd to-day,

SENATE

it is apparent that we all look to it for information. This paper in an editorial hit the
nail on the head, and presented the situation
fairly. It said:
A Point Well Taken At Halifax
The Maritime Transportation Commission and
the Halifax Board of Trade, in their joint
representation to the Royal Commission on
Transportation, have performed at least one
important service by their action. In stressing
the national need to divert certain Canadian
freight traffic presently going abroad through
United States ports from that route, and to
develop .ail-Canadian shipping, directing as
much of it as practicable through eastern
ports, these two boards bring out a point
whici has alniost been lost sight of in the
discussion of Canada's transportation problems.
It is that the Federal Governnent. as regards
the railways, has been extraordinarily persistent
in creating and increasing conpetition with the
The significance of the
country's railways.
position is made plain in the concluding paragraph of the Maritimes' brief, just presented
at Halifax.
The railways, it is pointed ont, are exposed
to a great deal of water competition on the
Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system, wvhere it is
calculated that freigit noved is subsidized indirectly to the extent of $2 a ton. Hence the
railways are not only forced to Imeet the conpetition, but througi taxation they contribute
to the subsidizing of waterways. They are
confronted with the samue handicap in two ways
the waterways and, througli auto-truîcks,
-on
on the highways. Inconsistency on the part of
the Federal Government in encouraging waterways competition with its own railway lines
and the Canadian Pacifie Railway as freight
carriers should be apparent, yet the Government is bent, or bas been bent, upon further
perpetrating the inconsistency, contrary to all
needs, by enlarging on a colossal and costly
scale an artificial waterways system. Representations of the -Maritime Transportation
Commission and the Halifax Board of Trade
now before the Royal Commission on Transportation should result in this phase of the
Canadian railway problem receiving more consideration than hitherto it bas had.
If the railways bave fallen down in any
way, in my opinion it has been in their failure
to recognize the growth of the motor bus and
the motor truck system of transportation. The
provincial governments that provide the right
of way for this second system of transportation are receiving at the present time a very
considerable amount in taxes from the railways, and they should be keenly interested in
seeing te it, when this difficult problem is up
for consideration, that the railways get at
least an even break.
The immensity of the growth of the motor
bus business has been reflected in the passenger earnings of the railways of this country
for the past ten years. I find on looking into
the matter that in 1920 there were 51,000,000
passengers carried on the Canadian railways.
That number dwindled down to some 35,000,000
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

in 1930. Se frem 1920 ýto 1930, during a iperiod
of considerable prosperity, the passenger traffic
on Canadian railways has decreased about
thirty per cent. This decrease is largely due
to the automobile and to the motor bus business, and has taken place in spite of the extraordinary inducements held out to the people
of Canada to travel on the rai.lways, which
furnished palatial equipment, put on faster
trains and gave a more frequent service. But
they failed to stem the 'tide of decrease in
travel by rail.
Now, honourable gentlemen. there are many
angles of this situation which could be discussed. What is the answer to the problem?
I would not, in my position, presume to give
it. We have heard of a policy the principle
of which is a good one, namely, "AmalgamaI am sure
tion never; co-operation ever."
that if conditions were different we could all
agree with that idea. But who et the present
time wants the Canadian National Railways
with their liabilitios, amounting to $2,000000,000, or who wants the Canadian Pacific Railway with all that would be involved? As I
view it, the bringing together of the balance
sheets of these two systems under any proposed amalgamation would be next to impossible without a very large scaling down of
amounts. On the other hand, "co-operation"
does not always seem to be able to co-operate.
Amalgamation of management has been proposed. Any such suggestion as that would
probably be opposed in various parts of the
country, for political considerations in connection with these things are always with us,
and such a step would undoubtedly be regarded
as leading towards a future amalgamation of
those two roads. I believe, nevertheless, that
something along this line might be brought
about in a 'moderate degree-amalgamation of
management, in so far as it would relate to
the management of traffic movement, with a
view to co-ordination, based upon a policy
that would have for its object the movement
of all traffic from its point of origin to its
destination by the shortest and cheapest route,
irrespective of the line on which sueh traffic
originated. We know there is traffic moved
700 miles over one line, whereas by the joint
use of both lines it eould reach its destination
by being moved 400 miles; and there is other
traffle moved over one line of railway for 400
miles when by an arrangement between the
two roads it could reach its destination by
being transferred to the line on which it did
not originate, after a movement of only 200
miles. It can readily be seen that thousands
of tons of freight are moved unnecessarily
long distances at a very large waste of money,

APRIL 26, 1932
Let me give an illustration. A carload of
freight originates on one line of railway, by
which, in order ta reach its destination, it has
ta be hauled 400 miles. If after being carried
by that line for 100 miles it is transferred ta
another line, at a junction point, the total
distance is reduced by hai-f. Suppose the
rate is 20 cents per 100 pounds. Each railway receives 10 cents per 100 pounds; whereas
if the freight were moved by the roundabout
route for 400 miles the railway uipon which
it originated would get 10 cents per 100
pounds for the first 100 miles, but would haul
the frcight the remaining 300 miles for only
10 cents per 100 pounds, or three and onethird cents per 100 pounds per 100 miles,
making an average rate received of only 5
cents per 100 miles. Under the co-operative
plan each line wauld make a profit, but under
competitive aperatian the originating line
would make little or perhaps no profit on the
long haul, and h.oth uines would be prevented
fram jaining in a profitable transaction.
Now, honourable senatars, I desire ta refer
to another question which has been discussed
in I he pre'ss upon numerous occasions, namely,
the diver-sion of a large proportion of Canada's
grain crop ta American Atlantic ports. In
that connectian. may I quate a statement
recently made by the United States Department of Agriculture? Discussing the shipment
of Canadian wheat, the report says that a
considerable quantity of Canadian wheat and
flour is shipped through the north Atlantic
ports of the United States, and that for the
past six years an average of 49 per cent of
Canada's total exports of wheat and flour sa
benefited. United States railroads, grain elevators and shipping- agencies. Surely such a
statement is enaugh to make us, in railway
language, stop, look and listen.
When I see sa many of aur railway men
being daily laid off, car repairing plants idlç,
railway equipment standing unused on the
sidings, longshoremen at aur ports out of
wark, and the wheat experts of Saint John
drap ta a minimum of 3,000,000 bushels during the past winter-and perhaps I can dlaim
somne knowledge of the situation at Saint
John, after having occupied the position of
chairman af the Harbaur Commission there
for at least a short time-I do not think I
need affer any apology for emphasizing the
necessity of making some special effort ta
keep at least the produce of Canada, the
result of Canadian labour, in Canadian channels, and ta ship it through Canadian parts.
I realize this is not a new question, nor is it
ane that can be easily solved in the present
special circumstances.

235

I do not intend ta go inta an historical
discussion of this matter, but, coming as I
do from the Maritime Provinces, I must draw
attention ta the fact that the Confederation
agreement with the Maritimes is not being
lived up ta at the present time. In section 66
of the London agreement, upon which the
British North America Act wvas founded and
out of which the union of the provinces
emerged, it was declared:
The communication with the North-western
Territory and the impravements rcquired for
the development of the trade of the great west
with the seaboard, are regarded by this conference as subjects of the highest importance to
the Confederation.
The people of the Maritimes were naturally
disappointed at the results that followed the
construction of the Intercolonial Railroad
tinder that agreement. Later the National
Transcontinental Railway was built at a cost
of mare than $200,000,000 ta provide a route
from the West ta the Atlantic seaboard.
Under the statute authorizing its construction
it was declared that the rates over that railway should not at any time be greater than
those through United States ports. The use
of this line has been destroyed and the statute
violated by the development of the Great
Lakes route with its American connections.
The fact that the Canadian ahl-rail route
was not being developed ta the extent it
should be was brought ta, the attention of
this hanourable Hause in 1922, and a special
committee was appointed ta inquire into the
causes of the diversion ta United States seaparts of Canadian western grain for export.
The conclusions arrived at were as follows:
Your committee feel that it is their duty
ta report that they recommend that the petition
of the Quebec Board of Trade, as stated in the
Memorial of that Board ta the Railway Commission, dated February 3, 1921, be granted,
and that the Goverament be advised:
(1) To cause rates ta be granted upan expert
grain over the Canadian National Railways ta
Quebec, Montreal, Halifax, Saint John and
Vancouver, such as would develop trade through
the above parts.
Following that, an Order ini Council was
passed by the Dominion Government on
January 7, 1926, directing the Board of Railway Commissioners:
Especially ta inquire into, the causes of Canadian grain and other praducts being routed or
diverted. ta other than Canadian parts, and ta
take such effective action under the Railway
Aýct, 1919, as the Board of Railway Commissianers for Canada may deemn necessary ta ensure,
as far as possible, the routing of Canadian grain
and other products through Canadian ports.

SENATE

236

Under this Order in Council the Board of
Railway Commissioners ordered that the rate
on grain from Port Arthur and Fort William to Quebec be reduced from 341 cents per
100 pounds to 18.34 cents. There it stopped,
and the ports of Saint John and Halifax were
deprived, and still are being deprived, of
any advantage from the movement of grain
over the Transcontinental Railway, by reason
of the decision-and it was not a unanimous
decision-of the Railway Board.
As honourable members know, the outlet
for the Canadian grain crop moving east is
at Fort William and Port Arthur, and from
there the movement is by three routes: lake
and canal, lake and rail, and aIl rail. But a
large quantity of grain moves from Fort
William bv water to Buffalo and thence by
rail to New York, while a considerable
quantity also moves by water te Georgian
Bay, thence by rail to the seaboard, to both
Canadian and United States ports. The rates
for those movements are as follows:

Per 100 lbs.
Lakze rate to Buffalo.. ..........
Rail rate. Buffalo to New York..
Total.. ................
Lake rate to Georgian Bay.. .....
Rail rate. Saint John and Halifax..
Total..

.....................

ets.

15-17
18-77
3.60

But notice the difference in the rail rate
from Fort William te Saint John and Halifax:
Per 100 lbs.
ets.
All-rail rate. Fort William to Saint
John and Halifax.. .. .. .. .. .35.50
One can readily understand why with an
ail-rail rate of 35.50 cents as against 18.77
cents by water and rail, very little traffic
moves by all-rail.
As I have pointed out. the Railway Board
granted a rate of 18.34 cents te Quebec, but
a majority of the Board refused the application of Halifax for a rate of an additional
one cent per 100 pounds. In other words, the
Board refused a request that the all-rail rate
from Fort William to Saint John and Halifax
be made 19.34 cents and equalized with the
water and rail rate nowr prevailing of 18.77
cents to New York, as well as with the water
and rail rate to Saint John and Halifax. This
matter is now before the Governor in Council
on appeal, and a memorial has been presented bearing the signatures. I understand, of
certain senators from the Eastern provinces
and of a number of members of the House of
Commons. I do trust that the Governiment
will give due consideration to the fact set
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

forth in a very comprehensive memorial. Perhaps some honourable member will place the
contents of that memorial on Hansard in connection with the present discussion or at a
later time.
Is it to be wondered at, honourable senators,
that the eastern ports of Canada are asking
for some remedy for the existing conditions?
In the first seven months of the 1931-1932
crop year Canadian wheat exports to the
United Kingdom were:
Bushels
11.028.272
Via Canadian Atlantic ports..
.. 37,258,371
Via United States ports..
Naturally some objections have been raised
to the granting of an equalized all-rail rate
on grain over the Transcontinental Railway
from Fort William and Port Arthur to Quebec,
and to the request for a differential of one
cent additional to the Maritime Provinces.
These objections have been put forward by
both railways. My opinion, which I think
is shared by many people, is that nothing
should be done to injure the Canadian Pacifie
Railway with relation to the movement of
traffic over its own line from Georgian Bay
to the port of Saint John. That railway was
built at a time when there was not so much
consideration given to the matter of grade.
The Transcontinental was constructed at a
later period and has a four-tenths of one per
cent grade, going east; it was built for the
specific purpose of handling the grain traffic.
None of us would advocate, or attempt to
bring about, anything detrimental to one railway as compared with the other, but surely
there must be some way in which this question can be adjusted satisfactorily between the
two railways.
It has been argued at considerable length
before the Railway Board and other bodies
that the proposed change in rate would disturb
the existing basis of rates as between Fort
William on the one hand and Duluth on the
oiher. The fear is also expressed that United
States railways would retaliate. I cannot see
wrhy -they should. The proposed rate from
Fort Willia.m to Halifax and Saint John of
19.34 cents per 100 pounds would not be any
less than the lake and rail rate to New York
and other American ports. We should simply
be taking the traffic from lake boats and carrying it aIl rail to our Canadian ports. I say,
let the American railways retaliate if they will.
A desperate case, such as the need of more
traffic for our railways, needs a desperate
remedy.
Down in the Maritime Provinces we know
what hostile action by the United States means.
They kept out our cattle, our sheep, our
potatoes and our fish, and now we observe from

APRIL 26, 1932
newspaper dispatches that there is a movement on foot to increase the duties on rough
lumber to $3 a thousand, and on dressed iumber
to $5. When it is considered that in the
Maritime Provinces we are mainly producers
from natural resources of our country, it can
be seen that such tariff action by the United
States -places us in an unfortunate position.
Owing to the long rail haul to the Canadian
centres of population, where the large manufacturing interests are established, we find that
we are handicapped seriously and our economie
condition is getting to be a very unenviable
one.
Surely we could find a way to keep that
which belongs to us on our own rails, and in
our own channels, and ship it through our own
ports. The statement is made in some quarters
that such a proposal as this, put forward by
the Halifax Board of Trade and the Transportation Commission of the Maritime Provinces, cannot be carried out-that there are
certain objections in the way, which cannot
be overcome. I know that the way of the
reformer is always a hard one, but we have
solved other difficulties, some of them just as
apparently insolvable as this one.
After the British preferential tariff was introduced in Canada-I think it was in 1897there was an agitation carried on, particularly
in the Maritime Provinces, to have the preference made applicable only ta goods that
were imported into this country through
Canadian ports. This proposal was discussed
for many years, during which time it was
contended by public speakers and in the press
that if the proposal were adopted it would
result in retaliation by the United States. But
the honourable gentleman from Cumberland
(Hon. Mr. Logan) kept hammering at the
matter for many years, while he was a member
in another place, and in the end the objective
was accom.plished. The result has been of
great benefit to the ports of Canada, and we
have seen no retaliation by the United States.
When the British West Indies Treaty was
brought into being, a few years ago, I happened to be the chairman of the Harbour
Commission of the city of Saint John. That
agreement provided for a preference in connection with the importation of fruits. In
that connection the honourable member from
Cumberland (Hon. Mr. Logan) was very
active, and much credit is due to him for
his energy in bringing about that trade agreement. The ink on that treaty was hardly
dry, and the signatures were hardly put to
it, before a representative of the United Fruit
Company, accompanied by one of the traffic
managers of the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
came to Saint John and interviewed us in

regard to accommodation for the United Fruit
Company to make their terminal at that
Canadian port. Prior to that time the United
Fruit Company had handled and controlled a
very large proportion of fruits of many
varieties which found their way into Canada.
In talking to the representative of the United
Fruit Company I found that there were
4,000,000 bunches of bananas consumed in
Canada every year, which meant a larger per
capita consumption of bananas in Canada than
in the United States. We made arrangements
to give the United Fruit Company accommodation in the port of Saint John, and since
that treaty was brought into force, which
provided for a preferential rate on bananas,
or the elimination of the duty on bananas
coming into Canada, there can be seen at
the port of Saint John carloads and trainloads of bananas being moved from that port
over the Canadiari Pacific Railway for distribution in Canada.
You will thus see, honourabIe gentlemen,
that while objections are recorded against these
reforms, we can sometimes accomplish much
if we take strong measures, and adjust them
as seems fair and right.
I saw the other day a statement in regard
to the construction of additional grain elevator
accommodation at Albany, which, as you
know, is the head of tidewater in the State of
New York. I think its capacity is to be
2,200,000 bushels. It was reported that certain
Canadian interests intended to lease that
elevator and operate it when it was constructed. That report as to operation was
denied later in a newspaper interview. However, it demonstrates to us, as Canadian
people, that the tendency is to construct works
of a character which will tend further to a
diversion of Canadian traffic through the
Great Lakes, through the American connections at Buffalo, and along the American
border of the Great Lakes.
Thus preparations for a further diversion of
our trade go on, and the question is whether
we ;n Canada will continue to provide aids to
navigation, and are prepared to deepen our
canals, and at the same time starve our railways of traffic.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I see that I
have already taken up the attention of this
House for too long a period. I understand,
and know full well, that the members of this
House are not very popular when they make
long speeches; nevertheless, I feel that this
discussion is in the interest of the Canadian
people, the railways of Canada, the port
workers, the coal miners, and all those connected with transportation. In my opinion

SENATE
too much time cannot be spent in this discussion, not only with regard to the railways,
but also with regard to the diversion of traffic,
particularly as it affects the ports of the
Maritime Provinces.
This question was at one time referred to
the Railway Commission of Canada in order
that they should make a thorough investigation as to whether or not a larger amount of
Canadian traffic might be moved over Canadian territory. In a judgment handed down
the Railway Commission gave a short, condensed statement of the situation regarding
the export of Canadian grain by Canadian
Atlantic ports. I do not intend to read all
the recommendations, but I wish to draw
attention to section 7, which says:
(7) The all-rail rates from the prairies to the
seaboard are maintained at a level that excludes
the grain traffic fion the railways an therefore
excludes it from the Cana<lian Atlantic ports
beyond Montreal, which must depend upon railway service to share in that traffic.
No. 13 says:
(13) By uîsing the rail haul from the prairies
to the St. Lawirence ports in suiimer a ndl to
the Maritime ports in winter, the railways
would eain the mîoncy that is now paid to
United States vessels and railways; Canadian
prolucers woul b in reaih of the w orld's
markets throughout the year; the rush and
congestion that now occurs in the fall season
would be avoided; the producer would save paying for winter storage until lie desired to sell;
the railways could give continuous emiploynient
to their operating men, and while their profit
on the haul per bushel would be less. their gross
earnings would be greater and probably their
net profit as well.
No. 14 says-and listen to this:
(14) Of the 4ý million tons of grain which
left Canada at Fort William in the past crop
season to be carried overseas through United
States seaports. Canadian railways had hauled
it an average distance of over 800 miles. United
States carriers earned over 15 million dollars in
taking it froîn Fort William to the seaboard.
hauled
The question is-Can the railways w hich
the grain to Fort Williani afford to haul it 950
miles further for that animoit of mîoney? If
not. Canada lias several hundred million dollars'
worth of railways on iand that are not fulfilling
the purpose for which they were built. But
if they can. and do, Canada, the greatest export
producer of the comiodity in greatest and nost
assured worl demand. will have a leverage in
wor]d trade that sbould be of immense benefit
to the country as a whole, as well as to the
seaports, railways and farmers inimediately
concerned.
Honourable gentlemen, these are not words
of mine; they are the words of men who
made a thorough study of the questions involved, and, after obtaining much information,
placed their views upon the records of the
Railway Commission of Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

Let me suggest to the right honourable
leader of the Government that some plan or
scheme be worked out-let it be what it may;
let us call it the hard-times measure, if we
wish-such a measure as will ensure the
salvaging of this business for Canadian railways, and Canadian labour, who badly need
it.
I am sure, honourable gentlemen, we all
were pleased to notice in the press yesterday
that a heavy rainfall had occurred in Western Canada, and that a large crop of grain is
probable if conditions continue as they are at
present. Let us pray that the harvest may
be large and bountiful, and that the farmers
of this country may reccive a goord price "or

quantity of that grain find its way down

New York. Boston and Portland? Or will
a "Canada First" policy, whieh is so popular
with our Canadian people at the present time,
lie put into effect and more of this comimodity
than usual move through Canadian channels
to Canadian ports?
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourable gentlemen,
I am not going to take up much of the time of
this House, as I intend to move the adjournment of this debate; but before I do so I
should like to refer to the report of Sir
Alexander Gibb on the possibility of Halifax
as a grain port. The general impression has
gone abroad that Sir Alexander Gibb held
out no hope for Halifax. That was not true.
I have had the opportunity of reading his
report. In Sir Alexander Gibb's reference to
Halifax there is no reason for despair. He
does point out certain difficulties which should
be overcome. When I resume this debate I
shall refer more particularly to those difficulties.
In the meantime, I think, certain things
should be done to assist in this diversion of
trade to Halifax and Saint John. First, I
submit that the rates on the Canadian National Railways from Winnipeg to Maritime
ports should be materially reduced; if necessary, even down to cost, or below cost. If it
is wise for the Dominion of Canada ta provide
moncy for the despatch of coal from the Maritimes to Central Canada, would it not be
equally wise for the Government to pay a
percentage of the freight on wheat shipped
out of Canada through Canadian ports? This
line of railway, built many years ago, which
I supported in the House of Commons, and

APRIL 26, 1932
on which I made a very long speech, as I
remember, was intended primarily ta provide
means for shipping goode from, Canada
through Canadian ports. There is no question
about that. I will fot go into the subject now.
That plan should be carried out, if necessary,
at a loss to this country, in order that we
may build up, or help ta build up, this Eastand-West sentiment. It would mean the payment of large amounts of money to the railway men of Canada, besides what would be
spent in Hlalifax and Saint John, and in the
coal mines of Nova Scotia. The honourable
member for Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) has
just referred ta the fact that $15,000,000 was
*spent in the United States in transporting
a certain quantity of grain. This only shows
,lhe possibility of what should be done in
Canada.
Secondly, I beg ta suggest that we should
lease the elevator facilities at Hlalifax to a
private grain coinpany or grain pool at a
very reasonable rentai for a term of years.
There would then be an incentive ta the
shipper of grain to use that port.* There
was very littie grain exported through Vancouver so long as the Oovernment operated
the elevators, but since the elevators have
been leased to, grain companies the exports
from that port have grown enormously.
Sir Alexander ýGibb ini his report says:
In the meantime, the possibility of closer
identification of private interests with the
Halifax grain route should be further explored,
and the possibility should also he considered of
transferring thýe operation of the elevator ta
grain interests in a position ta bring in grain,
or ta the railways. Any such arrangement
should be for a trial period only, on terma
that wou]d allow revision, if the system does not
prove satisfactary.
'Seventy-five ta ninety per cent of the wheat
passing through Vancouver elevators is the
property of elevator companies.
Thirdly, I beg ta recommend that when
the Imperial Conference meets in Ottawa the
British Government should be urged ta confine the British preference on grain ta that
wbich is shipped out through Canadian ports.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Logan, the debate
was adjourned.,
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved concurrence in
the Fourth Report of the Special Committee
appointed for the purpose of taking into consideration the report of a Special Committee
of the House of Commons, of the last session
thereof, to investigate the Beauharnois Power
Project, in so far as said report relates to any
honourable members of the Senate.
Hon. P. POIRIER: Honourable members
of the Senate, before this matter is taken up,
I beg leave, by way of privilege, to make
a pertinent statement. The rumor is circulating in Ottawa. and afar, and it bas come to
my hearing, that we are making this investigation at the command of someone outside the
Senate, and that even the verdict that we are
about to render-for we are now sitting in a
judicial capacity-is dictated to us. I state
most emphatically, and honourable members
sitting on both sides of the Chamber will
confirm my statement, that no political body,
nor any individual, bas ever dictated to us or
attempted to do so. The committee we have
appointed, like the wife of Caesar, is above
suspicion. Its integrity is more impenetrable
to undue influences than granite, and its
honesty of purpose is like adamant. The
Senate would not tolerate for one moment,
from whomsoever it might come, any
attempt at dictation. We have the good name
of this honourable House to uphold, and we
will uphold it. We have also its independence
to assert and maintain, and to that also we
will attend. Honourable members, this is a
domestic affair which we are able, nay, are
determined to clear up in strict justice to the
Senate, and in a spirit of equity to all parties
concerned.
Hon. J. MURDOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I am quite sure we all wish that what
the honourable gentleman has just stated were
the real facts of this case, but I should like
to know how that squares up with a statement
that I understood was made in another place
some weeks ago, in which it was indicated
that the highly respected and distinguished
leader on the other side of the House was
placed there for the purpose of making three
vacancies in the Senate.

Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: There is no motion
before the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion bas
been put.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators
have heard from our very highly respected.
and distinguished -friend (Hon. Mr. Poirier)
a statement that does not line up at all with
my understanding, which I 'believe to be right,
and I feel quite sure that there are many other
members on this side of the House who hold
the same views that I do. The assertion was
made, so we are told-and I think the records
will speak for themselves-that our highly
respected and distinguished friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was placed in the
position of leader of the Senate-where we
are glad to sec him-for the express purpose
of making three vacancies on this side of the
House. Now let us have the facts.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: No such statement was
ever made.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right, then, let
us get the record, and let it speak for itself.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Produce it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, it is most unfortunate that anything
in the way of recrimination on this or any
other subject should arise now. This is distinctly out of order, being a reference to
statements alleged ta have been made in the
other Chamber this session. It is for the purpose of declaring such a reference out of order
that our rule exists.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, I must confess that I was entertaining
a very sincere hope that this most important
matter wouild be considered by this honourable House in a dispassionate manner. I
am sorry to observe so early in these proceedings such a display of heat, so unusual
in this Chamber. I can assure my honourable friend who has just spoken (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) that there is no such heat on this
side of the House. I can assure him that so
far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we are performing a duty that is most
painful ta every one of us, a duty that we
would gladly avoid, one that we did not court,

APRIL 27, 1932
one for which we are nlot responsible in any
way. But that duty having corne to us, and
corne to honourable gentlemen oppositeHon. Mr. MURDOCK:

From whorn?

Hon. Mr. TANNER: That duty having
corne to this House, not rnerely to one side
or the other, I want to say, honourable members, that I feel we had a riglit to expect that
every honourable senator would be jealous of
the honour and integrity of this House, and,
instead of injecting heat and partisan feeling
sO early into the proceedings, would be ready
to wait and deal with this as we aire accus-.
tomed to deal with ail matters in the Senate,
in a cool, dispassionate and reasonable way.
1 have said that so far as I arn concernedand I arn sure I speak for every honourable
member on this side of the House-there is
no malice, and we should be glad indeed if
this matter had never corne before us. Who
brought it to us? If there is entanglement
or trouble for honourable members of this
House, who created that trouble? Did any
honourable member on this side of the House, or
any of rny honourable friends opposite, create
it? The men themselves are responsible for it.
I want honourable members not to forget this
salient and underlying fact, that the honourable gentlemen who are in these difficulties are themselves the men who created
the difficulties. And is it to be said of us
as members of the Senate of Canada that
when such problerns corne before us, and
when the honour of this Flouse is at stake,
we shall either shirk our responsibility or
divide on party lines? I confess that I ain
amazed ta think that honourable members
opposite who are experienced in public affaire
would pursue such a course. They are men
who have spent rnany years in publie life, and
arnongst thern are nurnbered honourable
members who have taken high place in the
State, who have been members of the King's
Privy-Council for Canada. Surely the honour
and integrity of the Senate of Canada will
appeal to men of that stature in public life.
If men who have held those high positions are
neot moved by sucli an appeal, then I arn
sorry indeed for the condition of this Flouse.
3
We had the honour of having on our coinrnittee three honourable senators who are
members of the King's Privy 'Council for
Canada. We have some in this House who
are even higher-who are members of the
King's Privy Council for Great Britain. Will
any honourable member suggest that in the
Mother Country a matter like this would
flot be dealt with quickly, and without the
injection of partisanship? I venture to sày

241

that it would be disposed of in as many
hours as it lias taken us days to deal with it.
When I carne here this afternoon I had
intended saying that I carne not to make a
partisan speech, but to diseuse in a cool and
dispassionate manner the matters of the report, hoping that I should be appealing te
the cool, unbiased and fair judgment of every
honourable member of this House.
I said a moment ago that we are not
responsible for this affair. How is it here?
It is not one for which the political party
to which I belong is responsible. It originated
in the Flouse of Commons at the instance, not
of a Conservative, but of an independent
member who represents a Western constituency; and when lie laid his charges before the
Flouse of Commons the Government and the
Opposition unitedly decided that in the interest of the whole country the matter should
be investigated. So this matter did not
originate in one party or the other, but came
about as I have just rnentioned. After being
carefully and fully investigated and considered by the Bouse of Commons, it was
subrnitted ta our Flouse. There was no direct
proceeding in the Flouse of Commons against
any honourable member of this Flouse, but
in the course of the investigation it transpired
that certain honourable members of this
Flouse were related ta circumstances and
events whieh suggested that the Senate should
take cognizance of the rnatters and deal with
thern. Accordingly the report of the cornmittee of the Commrons carne ta us.
Shail we deal with it, or are we ta take
refuge behind partisan feelings and prejudices?
Are we ta deal with it in the spirit of true
Canadians holding high positions in this
country, responsible ta the people for the
integrity and honour of Parliarnent, or are we
ta skulk behind political differences and say,
"Oh, it is a party matter"'? It is my sincere
hope, and I now renew the expression of that
hope, that honourable members will not adopt
any partisan attitude, but will take the whole
subjeet into their fair and honest consideratien. If there is wrong, let us say that there
is wrong. If there is nothing wrong, and if
honourable members can show us that there
is nothing wrong, every honourable member
on this side of the Flouse will, I arn sure,
Join with thern, and will be glad ta corne ta
such a conclusion.
Now, honourable members, I desire, in a
few prelirninary rernarks, ta caîl your attention ta this fact, that all the circurnstances
with which, we have ta deal in this matter
arise out of, or circle around, one cf the

say, "AIl we have te do is te go te a departmental effical-we do net have te, go te
Parliament," tbey ferget the fact that the
autherity and the poer reside je Parliameet.
What we say in Parliament, in the Senate, in
the lieuse cf Cemmens, settles aIl such
matters.
If there were any deubt as te the accuracy
cf this contention, the situation existing teday would furnish conclusive preof.
Many
things were donc by a cabinet and by departmental officiaIs in cennection with the Beauharnois prejeet, but when a member cf the
House cf Cemmons steed up in bis place and
said, "I ivant te knew îvbat has been dene,
and I want Parliament, in the exercise cf its
right, te diseharge its duty in safeguarding
the public interest," Parliament at once teck
actien. Every mac who has business with a
cabinet or departmental efficial should bear
in mind the fact that everything that is said
and donc may the next day or at any future
finie become a subi ct cf discussion and
actien in either Heuse cf the Parliament of
Canada.
Every memiber of this beneurable Houseand it is a bigh henour te be a inember-or
cf the lieuse cf Cemmons, is a trustee of the
country's interest, and as such is personally
respensible. We cane-ct dive.st ourselves cf
tbat rcsponsibility except in one way, and
that is by sending in our resignations. Se
long as we remain here, se long as we go on
administering the affairs cf the country, we-

APRIL 27, 1932
that is, every man or wornan wbo is a member
of tbe Senate or the flouse of Commonsmust regard ourselves as trustees holding the
power and authority to which I have alluded,
bound in duty and honour to protect, saf eguard and prornote the interest of the people
of this country, and each of us is bound te
sce te it that he neyer allows bis own personal interest in any manner, shape -or forrn
to cause him te deviate fromn the path of duty
which undoubtedly lies before him as a public
trustee and administrator of the country.
HonourEable members cannet avoid this responsibility. We corne into this flouse voluntarily; inany cf us corne very gladly. Ne
one is taken by the throat and dragged in.
The moment we step through that door we
are net the same men that we were before.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is true,
quite likely.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Before we came te
this flouse we were plain citizens, free te engage in enter-prises here and there, but the
minute we crossed the threshold of either
Heuse of Parliarnent we took upon our
shoulders responsibilities that we did net have
before, and amrnng thern is the responsibility
of seeing te it that the high honour and the
standard of integrity cf this Chamber are
neyer sullied or degraded. If we do net want
te live up te that standard we have a very
easy alternative. We carne in voluntarily and
we can go eut voluntarily; ne hand will stay
Us.
Now, henouraible memibers, I want te call
attention briefly te a f ew facts in regard te
this Beauharnois project, as it is called. The
facts, of course, are set eut in the report
before the bouse. I want te remind honourable members that wben the project was
initiated it carne into being througb what are
called syndicates, that is, unincorperated associations of premoters. The first syndicate was
forrned in 1927, the second syndicate a year or
se afterwaTds, and a year or more later there
was incorporated what is known as the Beauharnois Power Corporation, Lirnited, with a
nurnber-I do net know just hew rnanyof subsidiary cempanies.
Some honourable members may ask why
these syndicates were forrned. Let us leok at
the flrst one. It was cemposed of 5,000 secalled part interests, or units, valued at $100
each. The rnoney, I presurne, was f eund by
the subscribers, the members of the syndicate.
Well, it happened that twe honourable rnembers cf this House became interested, oe
directly and the other indirectly, in the shares
of that first syndicate. One was a subscriber
for 800 part interests, or, units, and anether
41767-16à

243

became the owner of 800 part interests, or
units. But the full price of $100 per part
interest was flot paid by these honourable
gentlemen; instead they a-cquired the units
at $37.50 each. Mr. Sweezey and one or two
other persons were favoured with units at
that price.
After the business had proceeded a while
that syndicate was dissolved and each member
was given twice as .many units in the second
syndicate. For instance, the man who had
800 units in t.he first syndicate found himself
the owner of 1,600 units in the second, and
had the option of subscribing for 1,600 more
units at $100 a unit in the second syndicate.
The increase fromn 800 to 1,600 units apparently occurred overnight. I suppose this
is what is called high finance. It rnay be
justifiable and defensible where people are
dealing with private interests, but honourable
senators will remember that this shuffiing of
syndicates related to one of the greatest of
our public assets, the St. Lawrence river, its
waterways and its potential treasure-house of
electrie power.
As 1 bave already said, atter this doublingup of units in the second syndicate the Beauharnois Power Corporation, Lirnited, was
formed. What happened then? In 1929, when
it was organized, there was passed at a meeting a resolution to issue bonds to the publie,
if you please; $W0,000,000 worth of bonds to
a guilelesa and confiding public. Out of that
$W0,000,000 there were to go, first, into the
pockets of the Dominion Securities Corporation and Newman, Sweezey and Company,
who I presumne are called underwriters, 83,000,000 worth of bonds. The next slice to come
out of those proceeds, wben the public had
furnished the money, was 84,750,000, which
was to be handed over to the subscribers of
the first and second syndicates. Out of that
$4,750,000, it is on record in the report before
this flouse to-day, those subscribers in the
syndicates, before the concern had made one
dollar or had earned one five-cent pieoe by
actual operatýion, were permitted to put into
their pockets the tidy little profit in cash of
$2,189,000. If that was flot a gold mine, at
least we should have to go a long way to
discover anything to parallel it for the quick
making of profits. We were told before the
cemmittee that this is a usual thing on St.
James Street.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE; Or in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn net geing to say
a word against St. James Street or Wall Street.
1 presumne tbey carry on their business in
their own way. A great many of us know

214

SENATE

to our sorrow that they do carry on business
in that way. As a friend of mine in Nova
Scotia expressed it, when we think we are in
on the ground floor we find that St. James
Street has put somebody down in the cellar,
with prior rights over the bonds and securities
that St. James Street has handed out to us
and we have bought in good faith. What I
want to say about that remark is this: it may
be all very well in St. James Street, but the
Senate of Canada is not St. James Street.
God help this country if we are going to consider that what mav be justified in St. James
Street can be applied and justified in the
Senate of Canada. If that is so, there can be
little hope for the survival of the Senate.
There may be hope for the survival of St.
James Street.
Now, of this 82,189,000, one honourable
member of this House put into his pocket
in cash $445,475 and walked away with 108,000
class A shares of the Beauharnois Power
Corporation, Limited. That cash profit was
not out of the earnings of a company, but out
of the proceeds of the bonds, bonds which had
been floated in this country and which, perhaps, honourable members of this House
sought, believing them to be good securities
without any water in them.
Another honourable member of this House
walked off with $529,600 of cash profit and
10,040 class A shares. Here was all this profit,
springing up from the ground, as it were,
without any effort on the part of these gentlemen, and without any effort on the part of
the corporation. Talk about your shell and
pea games, honourable members! The shell
and pea game is a baby enterprise in comparison with the syndicate performances of
the Beauharnois Power Corporation.
I reminded you a few moments ago,honourable members, that this matter came down to
us from the House of Commons, and I am
saying what every honourable member of this
House knows, when I repeat that it came
before the House of Commons on the motion
of an independent member, and that a committee composed of men of the three political
persuasions in that House heard the evidence
and adjudicated upon it; and it is a fact
beyond controversy that the report of the
committee of the House of Commons which
came to us was adopted unanimously by that
:ommittee. It went into the House of Comanons and was considered and discussed by a
few honourable members of that House.
Hon. Mr. KING: May I interrupt the hon3urable gentleman? I think his statement is
not correct. Exception was taken to that
report by one member of the committee.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: My honourable friend
must remember that we have to discuss these
things. I quite realize that it is not usual,
but we were directed by the Senate to consider a report of the House of Commons, and
we did consider it, and we are required by
this Senate to report upon it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I explain,
please?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Tanner) does not understand.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My honourable friend did not understand the remark of
the honourable member from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King). He was calling attention
to the fact, as he remembered it, that exception was taken to the report by at least one
member of the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Will the
honourable gentleman tell me where it appears?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not know
anything about it.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
The official record
is in the hands of the right honourable
leader of the House. The official minutes of the
committee show positively that there was no
division or no vote in the committee on the
report. I know that in the House one honourable member of the committee did say something of that sort. That is correct. But the
record is against him. At any rate, the report
went to the House of Commons. What happened there? Without a division the report
was adopted. I know that Hansard says it
was "Carried on division," but we are all
familiar enough with the proceedings of
Parliament to know that when there is a
serious division there is always a vote. There
was no vote taken in the House of Commons
on the report of the committee. To sum up,
I merely point out to honourable members of
this House that the report came to us last
year with the unanimous endorsation of the
people's representatives in the House of Commons.
In corroboration of this I am going to call
attention to some remarks made on that occasion by the leader of the Liberal Party 'n
Canada. I take it for granted that the leader
of t.he Liberal Pa'ty, who to-day is the same
man, speaks with authority. I presume that
when he deals with a matter of this kind he
speaks for his supporters inside Parliament
and outside of Parliament; therefore I am
going to remind honourable members of what
that honourable gentleman said publicly in
regard to the report in question.

APRIL 27, 1932
This is one paragraph of his address:
If mistakes have been made in accepting
fands which never should have been accepted
in a political campaigi it has been a very
serious error in judgment, but this error has
grown out of the fact that things have been
dione in the heat of campaign possibly through
a feeling of desperation brought about by the
competition with which the party was faced
which would never have been thought of or
dreamed of at any other time. I do not say
that to mitigate what has been done; I do not
initigate it in the least, but there is a reason
ifor everything and that I submit was the
reason in this case.
Again he said:
After al it is an unfortunate fact with regard
to most things in human life, that no matter
how good the cause may be, no matter how true
and honourable and honest the great body of
men and women are who are supporting a cause,
every now and then something happens which is
not creditable. and the party as a whole, or the
group as a whole, have to suffer as a consequence.
Again he speaks:
Individual members of the Liberal Party
may have done what they should not have
done, but the whole party is not thereby disgraced. The party is not disgraced, but it is
in the valley of humiliation. I tell the people
of this country to-day that as its leader I feel
humiliated and I know my following feel
humiliated. I have told them so in caucus,
that we are in the valley of humiliation.
I am reading these extracts, not for the purpose of reproaching honourable members of
this House or anybody else, but in order to
bring back to the minds of honourable senators the conditions that existed when the
report was presented to the House of Commons and came down to us. That was an
echo of public sentiment. Never mind about
the humiliation. That is the confession of the
leader of a great party that things had been
done which should not have been done by
public men.
The report came to us and we considered it.
We appointed a small committee to discuss
what had better be done with it. I happened
to be a member of that committee. We were
all impressed with the seriousness, the gravity
of the situation, and we brought in a written
suggestion which was placed in the hands of
the then leader of the House, and on the first
day of August that memorandum was put
into the records of the Senate. I have a
copy of it in my hand.
The Senate proceeded to the consideration of
the communication from the Honourable the
Speaker of the House of Commons, to the
Honourable the Speaker of the Senate, transmitting the Fourth Report of the Select
Committee of the House of Commons, appointed
to investigate the- Beauharnois Power Project.
The Honourable Senator Willoughby, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Dandurand, moved
that-

Whereas on the 31st day of July of this year,
the House of Commons adopted the Final Report,
dated July 28, 1931, of a Special Committee
appointed by it to investigate the Beauharnois
Power Project:
andWhereas a copy of the said Report has, by
order of the House of Commons, been transmitted to the Senate for its information:
andWhereas this Honourable House has been
deeply perturbed by the condemnation levelled
by the said Report against certain Senators
and is keenly conscious of its duty to act in
the matter, fully and without delay:
andWhereas imminent prorogation precludes
immediate action by the Senate, as it is the
constitutional right of a Senator to be heard
by his colleagues in his own defence before any
punitive or other action be taken:
andWhereas the constitution does not permit of
effective penalties being applied to the Senators
implicated should they fail to justify themselves,
as under the British North America Act a member of the Senate may be disqualified from
sitting in Parliament only upon one of the
following grounds:(a) lack of property qualifications;
(b) failure to reside in the Province which
lie represents;
(c) bankruptcy;
(d) conviction of treason, felony or any
infamous crime.
Therefore be it resolved that in the opinion
of this House:
(1) A Speciai Committee of the Senate
should be appointed within the first week of
the next Session of Parliament to deal with
the conduct and actions of the Senators above
referred to, as set out in the said Report;
(2) The Parliament of Canada, at its next
Session, should so amend the Independence of
Parliament Act as to provide effective penalties
against any member who may be found guilty
of dishonourable conduct.
The question being put on the said motion,
it was-

Resolved in the affirmative.
There was moved by the honourable leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby),
seconded by the honourable leader on the
other side of the House (fon. Mr. Dandurand), and carried by the unanimous vote
of the honourable members of this House, a
resolution which bears on its face an acceptance of the condemnation in the report of the
House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
condemnation?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Accepting the
No, not at all.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The document is
there to speak for itself. I am not reading
anything into it that is not there.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: My right honourable

he likes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

We object to

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I may be right, he
may be wrong; he may be wrong, I may be
right.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. .Mr. TANNER: But I call my hon.
ourable friend's attention to this pertinent
and conclusive fact, that the second clause of
this resolution declares that there should be
an amendment to the law to prevent any such
dishonourable conduct, which is an absolute
admission that in the judgment of this House
there had been dishonourable conduct.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

My honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend forgets that last session the honourable
gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique) and myself moved a resolution to
amend our rules so as to render more difficult
any interference in Government matters by
members of this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is another subject altogether. I am now dealing with this
resolution.
My honourable friends cannot
draw attention away from this by referring
to the other unfortunate circumstance, which
they palliated when they should not have
done so. This, as I say, is a positive admission on the part of this House. I hope this
honourable House is not going to repudiate
what it did only a year ago. It is a positive
admission, a confession that such conduct as
was referred te in the House of Commons
report called for an amendment of the law to
prevent the repetition of such conduct by any
member of cither this House or the other.
Now it may be said, and probably will be
said-I have heard it-that before that resolution was passed in this House we had only
a couple of days to consider it. Of course, if
we were only people in the primary schools
we might make that excuse; but honourable
members who sit in these seats have been
long in public life, they are full of knowledge
of public affairs, they know how to deal with
matters of this kind quickly and effectually.
In this Senate we have to work ra.pidly. We
rather boast of our ability to work much more
rapidly and in a short time much more
effectually than honourable members of the
other House. Everybody knew about the cirHon. Mr. TANNER.

cumstances. When the matter came to us we
knew all about it, and our judgment was
formed before that resolution was passed; so,
in my opinion, it is no argument to say that
we were hastened. We did not have to wait,
because the mind of every member was evidently made up before the resolution was
adopted.
That resolution has been followed by the
action taken at this session. When the Senate
met this year the intention cf the resolution
of last ycar was immediately put into action.
A special committee of the Senate was
appointed. I need not read the official references. By special and unanimous vote in this
Chamber the report of the House of Commons
committee was referred to our special committee, which met as stated in the report now
hefore us. The evAenee adduced before the
House of Commons was considered, other
wilnesses were called before the special committee of the Senate, counsel were heard on
behalf of the honourable members of the
Senate who were named in the House of
Commons report, and at the conclusion of the
matter, as shown by the report now before
us for consideration, our committee came to
the conclusion that the findings of the House
of Commons were justified and that the evidence adduced before the Commons and before
the special committee of the Senate fully
supported those findings.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
unanrmous.

It

was not

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Of course, I am aware
that the special committee of the Senate was
not unanimous in this regard, but it is net
for me, in presenting the report, to mention
that fact. I understand that by constitutional
usage I am net quite in order even in mentioning it. It is the fact, nevertheless, and I
presume it will be fully disclosed to this
House before the proceedings are ended.
Now, I am not going -to take up time this
afternoon in rehearsing the whole of the proeeedings upon which this report is based, but
I am going te look, as briefly as I can, at the
answers which have been made by the respective senators.
First iwe have the answer of Senator McDougald set out at page 140 of the proceedings of the Senate special committee. His
answer is also set out more at length, but
substantially in the same terms, in the brief
which was handed in by his counsel, and which
is published. I am going to deal briefly with
those answers. I take first the reply made
by Senator McDougald in relation to the
Sterling Industrial Corporation. One of his
statements-I have gathered them together-

247

APRIL 27, 1932
is that the Sterling application was dormant
until 1928. The other-I amn summarizing itis that when, in 1928, the report of what is
called the National Advisory Coiumittee was
handed in to the Government, lie gave
no further consideration to the Sterling Industrial Corporation; hie had dismissed it
fromn his mind. The third -point lie raises is
that hie was in En-gland when the sale of the
Sterling Industrial Corporation to the Beauharnois Corporation was concluded.
Now I will deal flrst, and very briefly, with
the last point. These are his words:
Trhe sale of the Sterling Company, which was
effected on the 18th of December, 1928, was
concluded when I was in England, though it
had preiiously been considered.
I ask myseif, why does Senator McDougald
introduýce that statement into these proceed;ngs--that lie wa.s in Eng-land? What is the
object of it? Does lie desire us to think that
it was done behind his back? That hie did not
know? That hie had nothing to do with it?
That is the onýly idea that cornes to me.
The fact of the matter is that on the
evidence of Senator McDougald himsef, on
the evidence of Mr. Sweezey, on the evidence
of Mr. Henry, Senator .McDougald settled the
terms of the sale of the Sterling Industrial
Corporation to the Beauharnois Corporation,
arranged that the 2,000 part interests of Beauharnois were to be given for the Sterling Industrial Corporation, and then, having settled ail those ýmatters, turned them over to his
representative Mr. Ebbs, Senator Haydon's
partner, who with other officers or em.ployees
in the Haydon office was in charge of the
Sterling Corporation, and left it to themn to
prepare the documents and close the deal. I
say that a statement giving this Bouse to
understand that the deal was cýlosed when
Senator McDougald was in England is not a
candid statement. Be closed the deal, left it
in the bands of his subordinates, and then went
to England.
With regard to this Sterling Ind-ustrial Corporation being dormant, I want to state some
facts very briefly. In justice ta Senator MeDougald I would remind the Bouse that when,
in 1923, lie first went into that enterprise
with Mr. Henry lie was not a member of the
Senate of Canada. HIe did not become a member of the Senate until June of 1926, aithougli
lie says himself that hie was nearly a senator in
1925, having been called, but, owing ta
the dissolution of Parliament, not yet
having been sworn in in this Bouse. He was
then holding a high position in the service of
the country: lie was Chairman of the Board of
Harbour C-ommi.ssioners of Montreal. Be
cngaged Mr. R. A. C. Henry, who was also in

the service of the country, holding a very
higli and responsible position in the Canadian
National Railways. He made a bargain with
Mr. Henry in 1923 that Mr. Henry shou.ld
carry on investigations looking ta the develop'ment of power on the St. Lawrence river, and
that lie, Dr. M-cDougald, would supply rnoney
to the extent of $10,000.
In 1924, after consultation, tbey conicluded
ta incorporate the Sterling Industrial Corporation, and in July of that, year, through the
services of Senator Baydon's firm, that coinpany was incorporated and was officered by
the em.ployees in the offices of Senator Haydon's firm, Mr. Henry or Dr. McDougald not
appearing in the directorate at ail.
Right Hon.
practice.

Mr. GRAHAM:

The usual

Hon. Mr. TANNER: In the samne year,
1924, in July, applications were filed with the
Department of Railways and Canais and the
Departmnent of Public Works for the diversion
of 30,000 cubic feet per second of water for
development of power in the Soulanges district. The report points out this fact--and
there la no question about the correctness 0f
lt-mn regard to the Soulanges section:
'Tt is apparent that the Soulanges section thus
presents an opportunity for hydro-electrie
de%,eloprnent almost if not quite unique on the
face of the globe. Tt is one of the greatest
national resources in Canada, and in its
natural state of great potential value.
That is where Dr. McDougald and Mr.
Benry, a public official of this country, filed
private claims, for their own personal advantage, against this great natural resource of
Senator McDougald, in bis
the country.

are the facts? He was supplying the money.
Henry was doing the work. Dr. McDougald
-until 1926, afterwards Senator McDougald
-did not need ta bother bis head about the
matter, because that very competent man,
Henry, was carrying on the investigation. But
Senator McDougald knew ahI the turne that

248

SENATE

withstanding what Senator McDougald bas
said, it is clear from the evidence of Mr.
Henry and the ovidence of Senator McDougald
that Mr. Henry ail through the period from
1924 until 1928 was in constant communication with Senator McDougald when he became a senator, or with Dr. McDougald hofore he becamo a senator. in regard to the
Sterling Industrial Corporation; that Henry
informed him of the moves and inquiries he
was making and the negotiations he wa" carrying on, and that Senator McDougald was
consulted. If I cared to take up the time I
could give the Bouse the pages which show
conclusively that he knew everything that
Henry was doing.
If he desired that he should flot be complicated with the Sterling Industrial Corporation
while ho was discharging his responsible duties
as a member of the National Advisory Committee, whîch had to take into consideration
the national and the international aspects of
the St. Lawrence river, why did Senator
McDougald not withdraw himsolf entirely
from the Sterling Industrial Corporation?
Why did ho not cease to hold, what ho
himsýelf admitted 'ho had aIl the time--a
beneficial ownership in it? Be did no
such thing. While Henry was doing the
work, from 1924 to 1928, who wvas supplying the money for carrying it on? Dr. MeDougald-Senator McDougald. Be had given
Henry a eredit of $10,0O0. Did ho withdraw
that credit? He nover withdrew it. Therefore the assertion that ho forgot it, that ho
dismissed it from his mi, cannot ho accopted.
If any honourable member of this Bouse desired to cut himself clear of any entanglement
of that kind bis course would ho simple. In
this case all that was necessary was a transfor
of Sonator McDougald's whole boneficial interest over to Henry, or the sale of it to some
other person. He retained his interest, and when
the National Advisory Committee had made
its report aIl ho had to do was to stretch out
bis hand, grasp the prior dlaims and mako his
money out of them. But ho has told the
committee-and I do not intend to state anything that is not on the record hefore the
Bouse-that ho dismissod the mattor from bis
mind bocause the National Advisory Committee
had reported in favour of the development of
the north side of'the river, whereas the Sterling
Industrial Corporation was looking to the development of the south sida of the river.
Now, the members of the National Advisory
Committee made a majority report and a
dissenting report.
Right Bon. Mr. GRAHAM: They could do
that.
Bfon. Mr. TANNER.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Senator McDougald
concurred in the majority report; two members
of the Committee, Mr. Beaudry Leman and
Mr. Adelardl Turgeon, dissented. The majority
report was made on January 11, 1928, and laid
hefore Parliament on April 17, 1928. I want to

caîl the attention of honourable members to
the fact that this report advised Parliament
and the Government not to proceed with the
devolopmont of the St. Lawrence river, as a

public undertaking, at that timo. The reason
they gave for making that recommendation
was that the financial condition of the country,
with the heavy war debts, railway obligations,
and so on, wero such as to make it unwise, in
their opinion, to proceed with the work. So
the members of the Board who wroto the
mai ority report said to the Goverament,
"Although wo recommend the devolopment of
the north side of the river, don't go ahead
with it aow, because the country cannot afford
the expenditure." But immediately below
that they said-I am paraphrasing; any
honourable member can road the report for
himsolf: "We advise you that the developmont of the Quebec section, of that part of
the river within the houndaries of the Province of Quehec, should be proceoded with;
and we advise you further that it can bc,
proceeded with and ivill not cost the country
a dollar, because after a little time is allowed
it will ho found that there are private interests
wvho ivill undertake that dcvelopmcnt if you
lot them have the electrie power." Thero was
the situation. Yet Senator McDougald said
ho forgot about Sterling because the mai ority
of the Advi.sory Committee said the development should 'ho on the north sido of the river.
But the ýmajori.ty also said: "Don't go on with
the north side at all. Don't make a movo.
You have not the monov." And thon they
said: "Get along with this Quebec section.
Turn it over to private interests. We know
them; we can put our hands on them-we
can point them out to you. Lot thema take
the profit out of the power developmeat in
the Quehec section, and they will build you
the canal for nothing."
Thoro was not very much in that to scare
Senator McDougald, with his Sterling Industrial Corporation, out of the race. In fact
it did not scaro hiim. Be stayed right there
and held on to the Sterling Industrial Corporation. WThat do we find him doing next?
We flnd him jumping into the Beauharnois
Corporation itself. In May ho buys mbt the
Beaîîharnois 'Corporation, which is concerned
with the whole flow of the river, so that if
the development is proceeded with there is
neither north nor south side to worry about.

APRIL 27, 1932
Once bie lands himself inside the confines of
the Beauharnois Corporation hie looks around
and says to lis partner, Mr. Henry, "This is
a good time to realize on those prior dlaims
we put in in 1924 for the Sterling Industrial
Corporation." They put their heads together
and they agreed that 850000-translated, s0
Mr. Henry says, into 2,000 part interests in
the Beauharnois Corporation-would be a fair
price for the Sterling Industrial Corporation
and its prior rights, which Senator McDougald
would have us believe were of no value at ail
a little while before that. He says hie had
forgotten about them. As a matter of fact,
hie had put the stupendous suin of about
$3,500 into the Sterling Industrial Corporation,
while Mr. Henry had spent about $5,000 and
done a lot of work. When they came to
assess the value of the Sterling they concluded
it was worth 2,000 part interests in the Beauharnois. Mr. Sweezey agreed to that valuation, because he wanted Senator McDougald
in the Beauharnois Corporation. For that
thing which Senator McDougald. says had no
particular value hie and Mr. R. A. C. Henry
picked up 830,000 in cash and 80,000 class A
shares of the Beauharnois Corporation; or
$150,000 and 40,000 class A shares went to,
each of them for something that Senator
McDougald says hie dismissed altogether from
his mind in the early part of 1928.
It is singular how tenacious hie was. We
find that he saw to it that the whole 2,000
part interests were put in bis own name or
the naine of lis nominee, Mr. Ebbs. Mr.
Henry did flot get an acknowlcdgment of
his share ini the Corporation until hie was
going to the hospital in August, 1029. On
the lst of that month hie said, "I think
you had better give me something to show
that I arn entitled to, haîf of those 2,000
shares." On that date, for the first tume,
Senator McDougald acknowledged in writing that Mr. Henry owned one-haîf of the
$300,000 and the 80,000 shares.
Now, honourable senators, I have stated
the simple, unassailable facts, leaving out
a lot of details, as set out in the evidence
that is before the House. May 1 add that
when Senat-or McDougald was in the Sterling Industrial Corporation and in May
acquired an interest in the Beauharnois
Corporation, hae had a double chance. He
had then secured his position. Beauharnois
waa hascd on ownership of the power hy the'
province, while Sterling was based on ownership of power by the Dominion. Whatever
came or whatever went, hae was in an unassailable position, for hie was certain to
have an interest in any development that
took place in the river by private interests.

Hon. Mr. FORXE: But hie neyer got the

Hon. Mr. TANNER: What Order in

Hon. Mr. FORKE:
For the Sterling

Hon. Mr. TANNER: It did not need to
be passed. Why should hie have an Order
in Council passed when hie got 8300,000?
That is what hie was after. When my honourable friend was a member of the Government there certainly were enough Orders in
Council passed giving away rights to the
natural resources of this country, Orders in
Council which my honourable friend cannot
justify and of which he should be ashamed
to-day.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Now I just want
to point out the attitude that Senator MeDougald took in regard to the sale of the
Sterling Industrial Corporation, keeping in
mind the small value that hie had placed on
it for a considerable period of tîme. May
I read froni a statement made by Senator
McDougald in this House on July 16, 1931,
as reported at page 435 of the Debates:
Evidence bas bopn made in connection with
the sale of the assets of the Sterddng Company
with the apparent purpose of showing that
Senator McDougald made undue profits in the
mnatter, to the detriment of the Beauharnois
Company.
Mr. Sweezey, on behaîf of the
Beauharnois Conmpany, was the buyer and
agreed te the price suggested by Mr. Henry
for reasons which hie considered good and
sufficient; and as a niatter of faet Mr. Sweezey
t;howed good judgnit in purchasing sucb assets,
as bie t hereby acquired for bis company:
(1) Mr. Henry's tecbnica] engineering knewledge and experience; (2) Senator McDougald's
assistance as a person able te furnish capital

(3) particularly

SENATE

Hon. Mr. TANNER: So there was no question about the thing in the end. Senator
McDougaid must have regarded this as a
valuabie asset ail flie time. And I point out
to honourabie members that according to the
statement I have read Senator McDougaid
ivas seiiing for bis own benefit and the benefit
of R. A. C. Henry the engineering skill of a
public officiai, and to my mind that xvas not
decent on the part of the sonator, that public
officiai being in a high position, well paid
by this couutry. That officiai, while still in
the service of the country, was taken into
partnership, and worked on the side in partThen
nership, with Senator McDougaid.
Senator McDougald turned around and cooliy
sold to the Beauharnois Corporation that
engineering skill which beiongod to the countrv.
committee Senator
i3efore the Seate
McDougald took exception to the findings of
the House of Commons committee in referonce to his speech of April 19, 1928, in tliis

of privilege and objccted to statenments that

There is the definite distinction. The Globe
said, "You are in Beaubarnois." The Mail
said, "Yen are intercsted in power schemnes
whicli wenld develop by private interests the
power of the river."~
Senator Mel)nigald, as I say, rose to a
qucstion of privilege. He denied absoiutoly
that hoe xas se intcrested in the Beauharnois
Corporation, and thien. in reference to the
Mail's imputation about power schomes, ho
made tîjis statement:

wbule it is true that the initial transaction was
on the lSth of May, 1928, it; was only on the
2nd of October, 1928, that I appointed my
own personal nominee, Mr. John Ebbs, to repiesent me in the muatter. Further, it shoud
be rcniernbered that 1 was speaking in 1931 of
t vents m-hich had taken place over three years
hefore. and that there was no possible reason
for me to deceive the Senate as regards these
dates. Nothing occurred between the l8th of
Alay, 1928. and the 2nd of October, 1928, to
affect tht' matter in any way.
That is his answer. The committee did not
regard that as a sufficient answer. I su'bmit
to honourable mem'bers that it is no answer.
He speaks of "the initial transaction." What
initial transaction? The final transaction
took place on the lSth of May; it was no
initial transaction.
The initial transactions
look place some time earlier than the l8th of
May, for Mr. Sifton was in communication
with Senator McDougald early in March, at
the end of Mardi, on the lSth of April, and
su.bsequently in April. That *was the initial
period. The 18th of May was the date when
the eontract was signed and sealed, the money
was paid and the deal was closed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No. He still
owed $144,000.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is the evidence.
My right honourable friend shakes bis head.
He cannot shake the evidence out of the
printed page.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not have
to.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There it is. It was
the lSth of May when the money was put
down in Victory bonds. So Senator McDougald says, and so bis representative says.
A little while ago, in speaking about the
Sterling Industrial Corporation, I read that
he said the sale was closed when he was in
England. The evidence shows that it was
closed when he was here, and that he was the
man who closed it. On another date in 1931
he told the Senate that it was the end of May
when he bought the Sifton interests. One
minute it is the 18th of May, another minute
it is in October of 1928. Now, if Senator
McDougald were an innocent man, unacquainted with business affairs, not a 'man
trained in big business, a man of wide esperience, I could understand his being a little hazy
about the handing over of the W4,000; but I
should think that the ,payment of that amount
in Victory bonds would im.press itself upon
bis memory far more than would the formai
matter of having Mr. Moyer transfer those
shares Vo the name of Mr. Ebbs. That is alI
that tuok place in Octdber. When those sharesl
which Mr. Moyer had 'been holding
for Mr.
Sifton were turned over to Mr. Ebbs, he

251

became the trustee for Senator McDougald. So
again I su'bmit with all confidence that the
evidence is conclusive that Senator MeDougald must have known that he had closed
the deal on the 18th of May, and that when
he made the statement in the Senate that he
became the owner only in Octo.ber of 1928 he
was noV disclosing the whole truth.
The next answer that we find in the statement submitted by Senator McDougald relates to the proceedings of the special cornmittee of the Senate appointed in 1928 Vo consider the development of the St. Lawrence
river for the purpose of navigation and the
development of power. 1 want Vo place on
record the order of reference of that comnmittee, which wva appointed on April 20,
1928. In passing I may say that I have some
knowledge of that committee, having had the
honour of presiding over it. This is the order
of reference:
That a special commrittee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into and report fromn time
to time on the matter of the development and
improvenient of the St. Lawrence River for the
purposes of navigation and production of electrie cuirrent and power and matters incidentai
to such objecta; and that the committee be
empowered to send for persorns, papers and
records, to examine witnesses under oath if
deemned necessaryetc. That committee went to, work, and I
believe its members were very well satisfied
that tbey had gathered together a great deal
of useful information on both aspects of the
reference. Senator McDougald, in his answer,
complains very bitterly of the findings of
the House of Commons committee in relation
Vo bis conduct as a member of the special
committee Vo which I have referred, and in
the matter of bis bringing bis partncr, Mr.
Henry, before that committee Vo give
evidence.
That special committee of the Senate held
meetings i May and June. On the 29th of
May, Senator McDougald, who was a member
of the committec, appeared before the cornmittee with two witnesses, the Manager and
the Assistant Manager of the Port of Montreal. He made an address Vo the committee,
which will be found on page 138 of the committee's proceedings.
He told the special
committee tihat -the National Advisory Committee had recommended the development of
the Quebec section, and he endeavoured Vo
întpress upon our committee the faet thaï; the
development of the Quebec section should be
carried on, and that it could be carried on.
To use bis own words:
First, there will be no cost teo the Federal
Government; the International Section wili be
built bs- the UTnited States Gýovernment, and
the National Section at the expense of power.

SENATE
Then, on page 140, he impressed this stili
further, in these words:
T. Nant yoiu to note that specially. because
the Advimzry Board feit that power and navigation shoiild flot he divorced.
Honourable momrbers will find, if they study
Senaitor McDougald's evidence, that he wvent
so far as to say before our committee the
other day, that he had flot read the order of
reference and did flot think this committee
of 1928 had anything to do with the dovelopment of electric power; that ho thought it wvas
appointed only *to consider navigation. The
order of reference shows that he was wrong,
and it is assuming a good deal to think that
an intelligent man like Senator McDougald,
who sat aý1a member of the committee, had
nover road the order of referenco. Howevor,
there are lis own words, spokon to that special
commitîce, in which hoe stressed the very
malter of power. 1 weIl romember the time
when hc spoke those words.
How is it possible for him bo come at this
lime and say, "Oh, that 1928 commitîce had
nothing to do except to consider navigation,"
when he himself, as shown by what I have
just read, stressed the development of power
and argued to the committoe that the Quoboc
section could ho dex eloped for power purposes without the cost of a dollar to the
country?
The crucial point of the whole business at
Ibis stage is that he brought Mr. Henry, who
wa. thon bis partnor in the Sterling Industriel
Corporation. and part owner, and put him
on the stand and subjected him to questions
wbich had boon prepared in writ-ing. The
trend of those questions was this: to have
Mr. Henry prove that it would be a profitable undertaking, a wise national undertaking
and a wi.se business undertaking, to proceed
quickly with the development of the St.
Lawrence river for navigation and power purposes. H1e had by his National Advisory Commiltee report shut off the question of the
public undertalcing by the Government, and
on the other side he had told the Governnient, "Got along and get the Quebec section
done by private interests." Thon he brought
Mr. Henry, bis partner, before the committee
of 1928 to prove that it would be a good tbing

vince Parliament-for this thing had to come
to Parliament-and to convince Ibis Senale
that it would ho a good thing for Parliament
to endorse the proposition wbdcb ho and Mr.
Henry were ready to carry out for their own
private gain. In other words-Il arn not exaggerating a bit-they were there before that
committee 10 promote liheir private interests.
There is no other conclusion. H1e did this
without dýisclos3ing the fact that hie was
inlerested in power dovelopment and in corporations which were seoking to make money
out of that power devolopment, and which
did make money in ils initial stages, as I
pointed out a litle while ago-the vory substantial profit of $2,189,000 cash, of which ho
got $445,000.
And ho flnds fault with tho flouse of Commons for consuring hirn for doing that. Suppose thero were twenty-five members of this
Sonate interestod in that matter. Suppose
every membor of that committee had been
a shareholder in Beauharnois, or a shareholder
in the Sterling Industrial Corporation. What
a pretty mockery that would ho of the bonour
and dignity of the Senate of Canada! What
a fine performance that would ho to report to
the people of ýCanada! If one member could
hold such shares, twenty-fivo could do it with
as much justification as one. If one cen undertake beforo committees and before the Sonate
to promoto bis own private edventages, and
so direct public undortakings that hundreds
of thousands of dollars, or millions, will pour
into bis pockets, what a fine spectacle the
Sonate of Canada avili ho! As I said a
moment ago, if one can do it, who, will deny
the right of every honourable member of this
flouse to make what money ho can out of
such gambles or speculations in the great
natural resources of Ibis country?

Senator McDougald sat on Ihat committee.
Hie called bis witnesses in order to promoto bis
and their private business, and ho disclosed
nothing, cither to the committee or 10 the
Sonate. Wben ho was asked before the flouse
of Gommons if ho did flot lhink thet ho should
have disclosed bis intorest, bis answer was,
"It was none of their business." None of their
business! WeIl, honourable members, I am
bound to say that as chairman of that committee I knew nothing about bis interost until

APRIL 27, 1932
the disclosures of last year, but I certainly
should have been astounded if I had known.
I arn sure every honourable member on that
committee would have been amazed to learn
that this gentleman, Senator McDougald, and
Mr. Henry, who we thought were busy promoting the public interest, were endeavouring
te prornote their own private interests.
I arn satisfied that the conclusions of the
House of Commons committee in regard to
the matter are fully and cornpletely justified
by the facts disclosed in the evidence.
There is in the answer of Senator McDougald another statement, which I do not
need to dwell upon, namely, lis statement
that lie put dollar for dollar into the second
syndicate. It is true lie was not in the first
syndicate; that is, lie was not known to be
in the first syndicate; bis narne did not appear
on the list; but lie purcliased the Sifton shares,
which were lield by Mr. Moyer for Mr. Sifton,
and lie had the benefit of the preference price
of $37.50, wliereas ahl except tliree others had
to pay $100, So, whule lie was not in the first
syndicate, he got ail the advantages which
would have followed if lie had been an actual
subscriber in the llrst syndicate.
Now I corne to lis answer in regard to the
Sifton interests. He resents the statement in
the report that there was an insolvable
mystery; and here again we observe him. in
that slipshod language of his. I arn reading
fromn his statement in the evidence before
this cornrittee, page 143. He says that lie
agreed to buy on the lSth. Now, why does
he say that? As a business man why cannot
he lie exact and say, "I bouglit on the l8th"?for that is the fact. Then lie says tliere was
no insolvable mystery. The wliole thing was
full of rnystery. There were 800 shares, or
part inter ests, standing in the name of L. Clare
Moyer in the first syndicate. Mr. Moyer
says that lie was holding them for Winfield
B. Sifton, who died in June, 1928. Mr. Moyer
says that he was taken to New York by Mr.
Sifton in the latter part of Mardli, 1928; that
Mr. Su ton gave hlm $15,000 in tliousanddollar Dominion notes, and that that money
was placed in Mr. Moyer's name ini the Bank
of Nova Scotia agency on Wall Street. Then
Mr. Moyer wrote a cheque againxst that in his
own name; subscribed for those 800 units,
and wrote a cheque to pay for thern. Mr.
Sifton, he says, did not want to be known
in the matter at all. Later, on the l7th of
May, Mr. Moyer got another 815,000 in sorne
rnysterious way. It came to him in the f orm
of a bank draft; he did nlot know who sent it.
He put that into, the Wall Street bauli too;
then he drew another cheque in hie own narne
and paid the other $15,000. That is, they

253

had to pay 330,000 for the 800 units. Then
there were the 1,600 additional units which.
subscribers to the first units had the right to
subscribe for at $100 each, and on May 23
Mr. Moyer got another bank draft frorn somebody and put that into the Standard Bank
at Ottawa; then he issued lis own cheque to
pay the first instalment on the 1,600 new
shares. Senator McDougald says that on the
lSth of May he bought and paid for those
shares; that is, five days before the last payment was made by Moyer; in fact, the sarne
day that Mr. Moyer issued his cheque for the
second instalment of the first 800 shares.
It is no wonder that people say: "Why al
this secrecy? Why lug Moyer away over to
New York and shove $15,000 in bank notes
into bis hands? Sornebody wanted to be
covered up; somebody was resolved there
should be no trace. And why those bank
drafts if the thing was ail straight and above
board?"
Senator McDougaid decides to buy on the
l8th of May. He says to Mr. Moyer: "You
hold these shares. I don't want to be known
in this thing at ail. I don't want anybody to
know that I arn huying the Sifton interests,
or that I arn interested in Beauharnois." And
he gives two reasons: one is that lie did not
want any of his friends to know, for fear they
rnightHon. Mr. CQPP: Will .ry honourable friend
pardon me? Did 1 understand hirn to say
that Senator McDougald told Mr. Moyer
that?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Told hirn what?
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable gentleman quoted something a moment ago to the
effect that Senator McDougald had said to
Moyer that he was to hold those shares for a
certain time. I draw my honourable friend's
attention to the fact that lie is mistaken.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It may lie a mistake
in names, but the fact is that Sifton told
Moyer to hold those shares until Senator
McDougald notified him.
Hon. Mr. COPP: My honourable friend
said Senator McDougald said that. It was
Mïr. Sifton.
But Sif ton told
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
Senator McDougald of the conversation between himself and Moyer. Senator McDougald
knew that Moyer was holding them-he must
have known. As 1 said a moment ago, they
remained in the name of Mr. Moyer. Senator
McDougald. gave two reasons. He said, "This
was a gamble; I considered it a gambie."

Again he said, "I did flot wvnnt any of my
friends to know that I was in that, because
they might put their money in, and I (lid flot
want thorm to lose anytbing." Now, he canflot say it was a gamble-that is, if the record
is righ t-because in this Hotise on the 2Oth
of May, 1931, he made the statement xvhich
I gave to this buse a few moments ago. He
said:
1 niaY sZ1Y at once that up to that time-that is, up to April, when he made bis previous
statement in the Sonateuip to that tirne 1 had been invited on rnany
oCC-asions to l)Ocoin a inember of the syndicate,
but had always doclined. After that datethat is, after April 18, 1928-1 was askod again. and had the who]e project
inesetigdto(l frorn every angle.
When I was
satisfied that it n as a proper projeet for mie
ns a nieniber of this Senate, as a business man.
and as n citizen of Canada. to tako a financial
interest in, I agreod to (Io 50.
The inevitabie presumption is that before
he purchascd from Mr. Sifton he had ail that
snquiry nmade, and that hie knew ho 'vas flot
going into a gamblo, but 'sas going into a
sure thing; and if accidents had flot happened,
and Mr. Gardiner had flot made a noise in
the House of Commons, it likoly would have
been a sure thing.
Then hie says his second ground is, "I did
not 'sant my fricnds to know." The nnswer
te that is plain and conclusive. This syndicate membership 'sas net listod on the Stock
Exehiange;
it 'sas net being handled by
brokers; it 'sas a private association launched
by Mr. Sweezey and his committoe of management. The publie knew nothing about it.
If the senator liad gone in and bought tbose
shares they would have been entered in the
syndicate books, he ceuld have given bis
cheque, and the publie would flot have known,
unloss ho told them, because it was exactly
like the private business of any firm that is
doing business in this country.
Se bis answer is ineffective in both respects.
Then there is the further point about this
mysterious affair, namely, that 'shen Senator
McDougald was giving bis evidence before
the committee of the bouse of Commons and
was asked how much money he paid on tho
lSth of May, 1928, te Sifton, hie said $30,0M0.
He was asked:
Q. Hoil, did yon pay it?-A. It 'sas paid in
victory bonds.
Q. Did you pay tIse $16.000. the first instalment on the ailditioxial 1.600 shares?-A. No.
Q. Wh 'v didn't youi?-A. 1 wns flot prepared
to tal:o on tIret cemmiitinent at that tirne.
And ho reitorated that evidence before the
bouse of Commons committee. What does
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

ho say 'shon he comes bofore the Sonate
committee? He says, "I paid 84600 in Vietory bonds on the lSth of May." Now, it is
a question of ceodibility between Senator
McDougald and Senator McDougald.

gave bis evidence before the House of Cotamons committee he distinctly and positively
said that alI he paid was $30,000 in Victory

commitment for $16,000; that be subsequently
did take it an, but he did nat make the
subscript ion; that Moyer subscribed for the
additional 816,000 and subsequently the
senatar provided the money. I arn painting
out these things simpiy ta show how unreliable-that may sound like a harsh word
ta use, but it is supported by the evidencehow unreliable the evidence of Senator MeDougald in these matters is. And I ask hon.ourable members, how can tbey accept bis
statements against other evidence, which supports the findings against him?

before the comrnittee. We were flot called
upon to sit in judgment upan the three senators under the Independence of Parliament
Act; aur duty was simply ta ascertain whether
the findings of the House of Commons carnmittee were faunded upon evidence. It was
not for us ta decide whether these gentlemen
violated any law, and we have flot s0 decided. That matter is wholly for the Senate,
ini the consideration of the circumstances after
this report is deait with.
I have endeavoured ta present ail the
grounds of defence, as they may he called,
contained in the statements made by Senator
McDougaid before the Senate cammittee, as
weii as those contained in the brief filed with
the committee by bis counisel.
At 6 o'clock the Senate taok recess.

The cornmittee came ta the conclusion, and
I say rightly sa, that whoiiy unnecessary
secrecy and mystery surrounded that transaction. I do flot want ta, make any suggestions,
but I arn satisfied that not one-haîf of the
history of that transaction has been related.
It rnay le that we should be greatly surprised
if the dead were alive and we knew just
wlere that history would lead us. Furthermore, there is a very strong presumptian-though for the support of this repart no such
presumption is needed-that Sifton neyer
owned those shares at ahl; that he was simply
a ga-between dealing with Sweezey and some
unknown persan. Sweezey was anxious ta,
get into the syndicateRight Han. Mr. GRAHAM: SweezeY?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Siftan was afixiaus.
But it is clear to me that Sweezey neyer taok
tbose shares on for himsefRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Do you mean
Sif ton? It wouid be a crime if Senator MeDougaid made that mistake.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -that Sifton neyer
took themn on for himself, but le took them
on for sorne undisciosed principal, and that
they eventually feli inta the lands of Senator
MeDougald.
The statements made by Senator McDougaid are the whole case presented ta this
House in answer ta the evidence upan which
the committees of the Senate and the House
of Commans came ta the conclusions which
are stated in the report now before us. The
only other matter by way of answer is contained in the argument of counsei, ta the
effeet that Senatar MeDougald committed
no offence against the Independence of Parliament Act. I do nat need ta deai with
that question at ail, because it did nat corne

The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Han. Mr. TANNER: Hanourable members, I arn prapasing now, for a littie whiie,
ta take up the case of Senator Haydon.
Two principal matters cancerning him came
before the committee, one in relation ta,
retaining fees, and the other reiating ta
campaign funds. I may say at once that I
arn not one who is under the impression that
electians are won without the use of some
money. In fact, I know that in these days
a good deal of money is needed at election
time, because there are many expenditures
af a legitimate character that have to be
met. Probably the competition between
political parties has increased these expenditures unduly. But there are campaign funds
and campaign funds. Away hack in the
seventies the people revoited and compeiled
a Government of this country ta resiga because it had received for campaign purposes
an amount that, compared with the sums
referred ta to-day, was a mere bagatelleAnd the
Right Han. Mr. GRAHAM:
Government was put back at the first opportunity.
Hon. Mr. TANNER :-and another Government was eiected in its place. I arn referring
ta what is commonly known as the Pacifie
Raiiway ScandaI, in which samething like
$250,000 of campaign funds, I believe, was
invaived. It was the Government of John
A. Macdonald that was farced ta resign,
and when the electian came on shortiy afterwards a Liberal Governmnent under Alexander Mackenzie was returned with a tremendaus rnajarity. I mention that merely
ta show what the people, sametimes, at any
rate, think about the matter of campaigfl

zôÔU

SENATE

funds. The crux of the matter on that
occasion wvas flot, the amount of money given,
but the charge made against the Government
that its friends had received the money on
the understanding that the people who furnishcd it would bie given a contract t.o build
the railway.
In the case before us the amount involved,
according to the admission of Senator Haydon,
was between S700,000 and 8800,000; the -report
of the House of Commons puts it at about
$.500,000. If bonourable members examine the
evidence given by Senator Haydon before the
Sen-ate committee they will see that he fixes
the amount at between S700,000 and $800,000
-and be ought to know. As I sec the matter,
the crux of the situation is this. H1e knew al
about the, Beauharnois Corporation and the
syndicates. He had been in close association
with them from 1928 onwards. He knew Mr.
Swcezey; ho knew Mr. Sweezey's associates.
H1e was the trusted frieod of the Government
then in power. The leader of that Government, as honourable members know, speaks
of him in the highest terms. On July 30, 1931,
the leader of that Government made this
statement:
I speak iii the preseace of members of mny
party who were miembers iii the 1art session
of the last Parlianient. I wish to tell this
H-ouse what 1 said to, them whlen I spokze in
caucus in the spring of 1930.
1 had asked
Senator JIaydon why it w-as that, (lespite the
fact that we w-ere labouring niglit and day in
this Parliaient to make our policies kuown,
%vo could flot get a leaflet published which we
(ouid distribute among the electorate. We had
the Dunning budget ivhich we were bringing in
and, w-e wanted to have the electors acquainted
with the details of that budget and the policies
that underlay it.
I sulimit to bonourable members that that
statement of Premier King is the key to the
whole situation.
Senator Haydon, was bis
close friend, bis close political ally; lie was
the organizer of the party, and was known
to have looked after such matters as are
referred to in that paragrapli. That was not
a direct command, but it was a very trenchant indirect command to Senator Haydon
to sec what could bie done in reference to
campaign funds. Then we find the sequel:
the money was procured. It came from Mr.
Sweezey, Senator Haydon ays, and Mr.

Sweezey says he contributed it.
Now, Senator Haydon knew
Sveezey
the one
was the
creator
Senator
flot get

that

Mr.

wa.s the Beaubarnois syndicate--that
represented the other. Mr. Swe-ezey
bead and front, the organizer, the
of the Beauharnois enterprise, and
Haydon in ýhis evidence says, "I did
any money from the Beauharnois

Hlon. Mr. TANNER.

Company, I got it from Mr. .Sweezey." Well,
whatever is to be said about Senator Haydon
in that regard, he is flot quite as innocent or
quite as void of knowledge as he would bave
us believe. 11e must bave known that Mr.
Sweezey represented, or was acting for, the
Beaubarnois syndicate.
It is impossible to
beýlieve that he could bave bad any otber understanding, and there is no question that lie
knew very well, when Mr. Sweezey gave him
the money, tbat be was receiving the money
of the Beaubarnois syndicate or the Beauharnois Company.

I point out to bonourable members that if
one reads the evidence of Senator Haydon,
as found on page 192 of the printed report,
one cannot belp coming to tbe conclusion
that the story there related by Senator Haydun is a must, improbable one. I mention that
liccause I think we bave a rigbt to take in-to
account bis credibulity as a witness. Upon
reading that evidence one would inevitaihly
come to the conclusion that one day, or on
.cevera-l days, Mr. Sweezey walked in upon
Scoator Haydon, and, witbout saying anytbing, planked ýdown on bis desk a certain
quantity of Victory bonds--maybe $50,000,
$100,000 or $200,000; that notbing was said
to bim by Senator Haydon, and he walked out
agaîn. That is a fair résumé of the evidence
given by Senator Haydon. 11e says that
notbing wvas said, and tbat there was no undertaking nor promise-no favours were asked
and none promised.
Is that reasonable? Is it common sense?

Hlere is Mr. Sweezey, witb a great undertaking on bis banda--a $75,000,000 proposition
-depending on the Govcrnment of tbe day,

I will flot say for favours, but for action. In
1930 the project was not nearly con.cluded. An
Order in Coun-cil bad been obtained in Mardi,
1929, but tbat Order in Council was sibject
to, a great mnany conditions. The Beauharnois
Company looked forward to, using the wbole
flow of the river. It bad only a third, so far
as the Dominion Government was concerned
-- 0,000 cubic feet of water iper second. It bad
4
an application at Que.bec for 30,000 cubic ýfeet
more. It would bave to come to Ottawa for
approval and confirmation of that, and, as I
say, there were many more -conditions tbat it
bad to fulfil. Mr. Sweezey, wise mnan in bis

day, in respect to bis undertaking, wanted to
make friends of tbe mammon of unrighteousness; so he walked in and, as; Senator Haydon
says, lie put down bis money, and walked out;
came back again and put down more money
and walked out; and neyer asked for anything.
Now, honourabie gentlemen, that is too mueh
to ask us to believe unless there was a very

257

APRIL 27, 1932
cogent previous understanding and the whole
thing was staged. Perhaps it was that way.
Honourable members who have looked over
the report now before the House may have
noticed the reference to certain matters that
were unsettled. Here are a f ew of them,
which appear on page xvi of the House of
Commons report. There is a complaint that
the work which had been carried on by the
Beauharnois syndicate was not in accordance
with the plans referred to in the Order in
Couneil P.C. 422, in three important matters;
that the remedial works shown on the original
plan were not approved either by Order in
Council or by the Minister; that the Hungry
Bay dyke had been breached and a substitute
feeder for the old St. Louis feeder had been
dug on the south side of the proposed canal
by the syndicate, and that this was done
wholly without governmental authority. Certain important questions had been raised as
to the Government's authority under the
Navigable Waters Protection Act to pass the
Order in Council P.C. 422; as to whether
powers given by the Act to the Government
could be delegated to a Minister or to any
one; as to whether the Government could
approve of plans to be submitted after the
Order in Council was passed; and as to
whether the Government could approve of
plans after the work had been done, or partly
done. It is pointed out that the work of
construction by the syndicate was proceeding
on plans which had not received the approval
of the Government or the Minister of Publie
Works; that the application to the Government by the syndicate of July 29, 1929, for
a conveyance to it of 9,064 feet of the Hungry
Bay dyke, opposite lands of the syndicate,
was unsettled and pending before the Government; that there was ambiguity in the
Order in Council P.C. 422, which should be
corrected; that the plans did not provide for
control of water at the entrance to the proposed canal, and that there should be such
control.
All these matters-important matters-were
pending at the time of the inquiry in 1931.
They were pending at the time of the elections of 1930, and we can imagine conclusive
reasons why Mr. Sweezey might feel it incumbent upon him to have the Government
of the day friendly towards his undertaking.
Senator Haydon had been indirectly commissioned to see to it that election funds should
be provided; and we find Senator Haydon
and Mr. Sweezey coming together to the tune
of between $700,000 and $800,000, part of
which went to Senator Raymond for the
elections in the Province of Quebec.

I want to point out that Mr. Sweezey tells
a very different story. He says that those
honourable members of the Senate went to
him and told him that they were the men
to whom he was to pay election funds. Mr.
Sweezey says, further, that they demanded
the money from him. He uses the word
"demand."
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is the word he
uses; I am not putting any word into his
mouth. Then he says that he continued to
pay. He did not pay up all at once. He
paid part to Senator Raymond directly; he
paid the larger part of it to Senator Haydon.
He says that he continued to pay until he
had no more, and then he stopped.
The question in regard to these campaign
funds, as I see it, and as I have said already,
is not whether a political party should have
money for carrying on elections. That is
legitimate enough under certain circumstances.
The question is whether or not it is fitting
for an honourable member of this Senate or
of Parliament, knowing the position of a
corporation like the Beauharnois, to place himself under obligations by accepting from it
political funds. No matter whether anything
is said or not, the political party that receives
money under such circumstances undoubtedly
feels itself under obligations to the corporation
that makes the contribution.
Now I want to take up the other aspect
of the matter in respect to Senator Haydon;
that is, the question whether certain amounts
that were agreed upon, that Mr. Sweezey
says were to be paid to the law firm of which
Senator Haydon was a member-then McGiverin, Haydon and Ebbs-whether those
moneys were to be paid on the understanding
by Senator Haydon's firm that they were to
be contingent on the passing of an Order in
Council by the Dominion Government in
approval of the Beauharnois syndicate's application filed on January 17, 1928.
The syndicate had acquired the ownership
of what is known as the Beauharnois Light,
Heat and Power Corporation, which was incorporated in 1902 under an Act passed by
the Quebec Legislature. When, in 1927, Mr.
Sweezey organized his first syndicate, he purchased from the Roberts, owners of the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Corporation,
all the shares of that company, and the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Corporation
became part and parcel of the Beauhamois
project as we understand it. The Beauharnois
Light, Heat and Power Corporation obtained

SENATE

a lease of hydraulic power in the Quebec section of the St. Lawrence river freim the Government of Quebec on June 23, 1928. That
lease enured to what we eall the Beauharnois
pro.ject. It gave it ail the Quebec Province
rights in regard f0 power development, with
]eave to divert 40.000 cubic feet per second
of the water of the river. But it wvas subject
f0 a condition that approval of that ]ease, in
so far as navigation wvas concerned, should be
obtained from the Dominion Government
witbin one year from June 23, 1928. So the
situation wvas this, in the late part of 1928:
Mr, Sweezey and bis associates in the Beauharnois syndicate had until June, 1929, to
obtain approval by the Dominion Government
of thieir proposition. They had their application in, as I say, in January of 1928,
asking the Dominion Govcrnment f0 approve
of thoir site and plans and of the diversion
of 40,000 cubic feet of water per second.
In the late part of 1928 Mr. Sweezey found
himself facing a great armny of opponents.
composed of groups of capitalists and others.
TIc bad a bitter fight on bis hands and he was
iii the position that if bie did not obtain the
Dominion Government's approval his whole
enterprise would fail f0 theo ground, ail bis
efforts would prove f0 have heen in vain and
thcre wvould be, s0 far as he was concerned,
no Beauharnois project af ail. Mr. Sweezey's
evidence in this regard is very plain and
cogent. He points out that powerf ni interests
xxere fighfing.
In bis evidence beforo the
House of Commons committee he said:
We could flot start before wýe got approval
at Ottawa.
..
ut mhat I couýd neyer flnd
oizt. If was the hardesf tlîing to flnd out what
the difficulty was. 1 mlet nobody who couid
giî'e nie anyfhing defini te on it.
We have in corroboration of Mr. Sweezey a
statement by Mr. Geoffrion, at page 28 of the
evidence given before the Senate committee.
He poinfed out that the Canada Steamships,
among others, was flghting.
Mr. Griffith,
Sccretary of the Beauhaýrnois Syndicate, points
out, af page 75 of the evidence, the steady and
consistent propaganda against the enferprise.
Senator McDougald stated before the Senafe
committee, as reported at page 125 of the evidence, that there was opposition to the enterprise fromn every quarter. So there is abundant proof of the two facts, that the whole
life of the Beaubarnois projeet depended absolutely on approval by th-e Dominion Government of the application filed in January, 1928,
and that Mr. Sweezey and his associates were
faced with the bitterest fight on the part
of opponents who wanted to defeat him and
destroy the Beauharnois projeet.
Hron. Mr. TANNEL

Mr. Sweezey employed a number of lawyers.
Mr. Geoffrion, an eminent counsel of the Provinîce of Quebec and one of the best known
lawyers in the Dominion, was handling the
proposition for the syndicate. We have his
statement of account for services dyone in Quebec, for getting the charter am'ended and
necessary Orders in Council put through down
there. Also we have bis statement of account
for services at Otfawa, when he came here to
help to get the Order in Council from the
Dominion Government. In bis evidence he
f old us that he was atfending to the legal work.
But Mr. Sweezey did not need lawyers, hocause there was no legal work to be done
until bis proposition was set up and wvas ready
fo go to work. If the Order in Council had
not been passed the proposition would bave
gone f0 dust and ashos.
Mr. Sweezev told us what ho wanted. HIe
said ho wanted men of influence witb the
Government of the day, not lawyers. And
ho is corroborated by other witnesses. Mr.
Griffith, Secretary of the Syndicate, informed
us that ho wvas instructed f0 ernploy lawyers.
Wbat for? Not for legal work, but fo get
wbat wvo caîl P.C. 422-that is the Order in
Council about which we heard so mucbpassed and approved by tbe Dominion Govcrnment. In Ottawa ho cmployed Colonel
Thonpson's law flrm, and a whole arnw of
other lawyers, including Mr. Greene, Mri.
Pugsley, and Mr. Moyer. But tbey were not
employed for legal work. According to the
evidence of Mr. Griffith, definite and positive,
the objeet was to work up a favourable
atmosphere in Oftawa. Take the statement of
account by Colonel Thompson's firm. It itemize, interviews witb Senator So-and-so, with
Mr. So-and-so, Member of Parliament, witrh
Honourable So-and-so, Cabinet Minister, with
a score of people, ail for the purpose, as Mr.
Griffith says, of croating a favourable atmosphere; that is to say, of letting the Government know that friends of the Government
were in favour of the granting of the Beauharnois syndics te's request. Mr. Griffith was
asked how many lawvers ho wvas authorized
f0 employ. fis answer was that ho was fold
f0 employ as many as wouid ho useful for
the purpose.
Mr. Griffith made another aspect of the
matter very clear. Hie was asked for the
termis upon which these counsel wore cmpioyed, and ho said, in substance-I am stating
if in substance correcfly; the evidence is before honourable members-that ail persons
connected with the enterprise, engineers,
financial mon, lawyers-he specified themn ail,
nof by name but by ciasses--were employed
upon the one basis, namely that, in effect,

APRIL 27, 1932
"If we succeeded in getting our enterprise
tbrough, their fees and emoluments would be
larger than if we failed." That was a very
reasonable proposition, because the syndicate
at that stage did flot bave a very full exchequer, but if the syndicate were set on its
feet, if the Dominion Government approved
of the application, then it would be prepared
for business and prepared to pay the men
whom it employed more liberal fees than it
otherwîse would.
Now, it happens that Senator Haydon is a
lawyer. He was associated, as bonourable
members know, with the late Mr. McGiverin,
and witb Mr. Ebhs. It was a weIl known
fact-there was no secret about it-that Senator Haydon was one of the most influential
mon in the Liboral Party. The Prime Minister of the late Govornment paid high tribute
to him, and spoko of him as one of the closest,
if flot the closest, of bis political and personal
friends and allies. And it is a fact known of
ail men that by his tremendous sacrifices of
time Senator Haydon had earned the riglit
to be regarded as one of the chief and most
influential counsellors of that Government.
So it was flot at ail surprising, when Mr.
Sweezey and bis associates wore looking for
men who could influence the Government,
who could persuade the Govornment to listen
favourably to an application, that thoy should
turn in the day of their distross-f or they
had only a few months within which to work
before ail would be lost-to so eminent and
so influontial a man as Senator Haydon.
Sonator McDougald cornes into the limeliglit in this connection, and we can sce a
reason why he should. Be was tremendously
interested in baving that Order in Council
passod at that time. The contract that was
signed for the sale of the Sterling Industrial
Corporation containod a stipulation that he
and Mr. Henry were to be givon those 2,000
part interosts in the Beaubarnois Syndicale
only if tbis vory Order in Council were passed
by the Dominion Government. So lie was in
precisely the same precarious and uncortain
position with regard to bis pet company, the
Sterling Industrial Corporation, that Mr.
Sweezey was in with regard to the Beauharnois projeet.
OJne wlio is flot acquainted with these
interesting proceedings would ordinarily ex-.
peet tbat if Mr. Swoozey wanted to, employ
Senator Haydon and bis firm for legal work
lie would walk down to Senator Haydon'e
office and make bis own arrangements. I
have had a little bit of experience in legal
work and I tbink I may safely appeal to, the
knowledge of honourable gentlemen of the
41767-17àj

259

legal profession when 1 say that usually, at
any rate, it is the professional man wbo fixes
his own fees, or that at least the fees are
docided upon by bim and bis client. But,
curiously enougli, according to the evidence of
Senator Haydon himself, it was flot lie wbo
suggested the 350,000 retainer. Nor was it bis
partner, Mr. McGiverin, nor Mr. Sweezey. It
was Senator McDougald wbo suggested $50,000
as a proper retainer for the firm, in December,
1928. 1 was puzzlcd to understand why be
sbould have intervened, until 1 saw the
motive. Be is an astute politician too. He
wvas on very friendly terms with the Government of the day. Be had been bonoured by
an appointment as head of the Barbour Board
of Montreal. Ho had been honoured also by
appointment to that very important organization, the National Advisory Committee. Be
was a very diligent supporter of the Government. And lie was mucli interested in getting
the Order in Council passed. So he joined
forces, as I see it, witb Mr. Sweezey; tbf'y
went down to the Baydon office and Senator
McDougald suggested 850,00.
Senator Haydon says, "We were satisfied
witb that." Mr. Sweozey says that after
some argument about the figure of $30,000
the sum of $50,000 was insistod on, but it
was undorstood tbat the firm would got that
$50,000 only if the Order in Council went
through. Senator Baydon denies that. So
we bave, as 1 say, to look at the probability,
which I bave endeavoured to, point out to
honourable members, that Mr. Sweezey bad
no more need for Senator Haydon's firm to
do legal work at that stage tban lie bad for
work Io be done by a man on the Pacifie
coast, but lie had great need for Senator
Baydon as a politician. Mr. Sweezey's story
is reasonable. It is borne out and corroborated
by the evidence of Mr. Griffith; it is borne
out also by the circumastances. And the committee came to the conclusion, I suggest, that
Mr. 'Swcezey's story was correct and that
Senator Haydon~s story was not correct.
There is more than tha~t in substantiation
of Mr. Sweezey's story. It is said by counsel
for Senator Haydon that Mr. Sweezey modified bis statement, but an examination of the
evidence shows that be did flot witbdraw bis
statement in that regard. There was some
little confusion in *bis mind about the furtber
retainers wbicb this firm was to receive in
addition, to the &50,000, namely,
an
additional $15,000 a year for three years. Mr.
Sweezey had a, great number of matters to
carry in bis mind and it was only natural that
lie was not very clear with regard to the exact
dates when the additional retainers of $15,000

SENATE
a year were te start. On that littie difficulty
counsel for Senator Haydon has built up a
case. But it bas no foundation in fact. The
truth is that the two retainers were arranged
-the $50.000, and the $15.000 a year for three
years; and, as shown in the evidence given
befere the House of Cemmons committee by
Mr. Ebbs, the partner of Senator Haydon,
their firrn received up to December 17, 1929,
$59,357.24; up to December 31, 1930, $17,206.19
more, and up te May 31, $9,600 more. The
total figure up te a shert tirne before 'he
inquiry ef the Heuse of Cemmons committýýe
was $86,164.43, and more money wvas te feliow
under the agreement for 815,000 a year fer
tbree years. Now, as I saty, Mr. Sweezey did
net need a lawyer at that time; he needed an
influential pelitical friend of the Gevernrnent,
and he feund him in Senater Haydon.
Thiere is this further fac 'k Senator Haydon's
firin's file of correspendence and that kind of
thing was befere the comrnittee. It is Exhiibit

littie werk done hy the Hayden firmn. The
reai work was dene by th(! firni of Meredith,
Heiden, Heward and Hoiden, of Mentreai,
who are eininent ceunsel, and by J. F. Lash,
of Terento, aise an eminent ceuinsel. That
file, which tells the stery of the work in the
office, indicates that the principal thing that
\vas being denc at Ottawa was the filing of
papers and attending te what, in the legal profession, we eaul agency work-tbe sinall business. A big firin did the big werk-drew up
the contracts with the trust cernpany, the
agreements sent te Ottawa, the business f erras,
and all that sort ef thing-, fer the erganization
of the company in August, 1929. The firrn
in Ottawa loeked after tiýe filing of papers.
As 1 say, it did the srnall werk. It is impossible te tbink that it couid ever have been
entitied, in conscience, te receive such a tremendeus ameunt of monev fer se littie legal
work.
Take fer exampie the statement of account
by Colonel Thempson's firrn, of the city of
Ottawa. That firrm gave nearly twe years
ef work te an endeavour te get the Order in
Councul through; it bas pages and pages of
acceunts, amounting in ail te S6,000. It did
as much work as the Hayden firm did, and

Hon. Mr. TANNER.

As 1 remarked a f ew moments ago, the
Geoffrion firrn is one of the biggest iaw firms
in Canada. We have copies of its statements

Oh, oh.

APRIL 27, 1932
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -but I think it is
only justice to the committee. I point out
to honourable members who are smiling about
it, that ail they have to do is read the
evidence. Furthermore, I want to tell them
that out of deference to Senator Haydon some
of his offensive staternents were eliminated
from the evidence; for instance, when he
called counsel "a damned fool" several tirnes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I was there,
and I did not hear tbat.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: A man wbo can cali
counSel a darned fool is not a.iways very siok.
Now, honourable members, I want to corne
f0 one other point. Counsel for Senator
Haydon has made a great deal of play on
the question of this $W0,000, as to wben it was
paid and the conditions of payment. This
money was paid. The cheque is dated October
17, 1929. Counsel for Senator Haydon would
have us believe that there really was no
agreemnent previous f0 that date. I should
like to point out just what Senator Haydon
bimself said on that point. At page 243 of
the evidence hie was asked:
Who suggested $50,000?
Senator Haydon's answer to that was:
I think it wvas suggested-as f ar as I know
personally it was suggested by Senator
MceDotugald. As far as what Mr. MeGiverin
did, 1 think,--I don't know-I know that if
w'as his view, MeGix erin's view, but what they
did among themselves, talking and so on when
I was absent, I sirnply don't know.
He was then asked:
So that before that amount was paid, in
concert -,ith yourself, Senator McDougald and
Mr. McGiverin. this amount of $50,000 was
arrived at as being a fair amount for the
services rendered; how long before it was
actually paid?
Senator Haydon's answer was:
Oh, perhaps a year.
Then hie was asked:
IPerhaps a year before?
And he answered:
A nuniber of months.
That, I submit, is conclusive corroboration of Mr. Sweezey's evidence that the agreement for the contingent $50,000, as Mr.
Sweezey says, was made about the auturn,
O'ctober or thereaibouts, of 1M2, and tba~t the
arnoun-t was paid in full after the Oi'der ini
Couneil was passed-on Ocbober 17, 1929. In
the meantime, 'as the s counts of the firm show
-we have thernm as exhibits lu this sneiter-the
flrm was in receipt of $7,500, 87,500, 87,500,
87,500-four payments, at least, coming in
regularly to the firm; and affer the conditions
of the $50.000 retainer had been fully coin-

261

plied with the cheque was issued, by the Marquette Corporation, I believe, and handed
over, and it is in evidence as one of the
exhibits in this case.
Counsel for Senator Haydon, as honourable
members wiIl observe, endeavours to raise
confusion between payments by the Beauharnois Corporation and payments by the Marquette Corporation. Well, we know that the
Marquette Corporation is part and parcel of
the Beauharnois Corporation-it is a subsidiary
-and the answer to counsel in that respect
was given by Mr. Ebbs, the partner of
Senator Haydon, in bis evidence before the
House of Commons committee, when, at page
721, hie said:
It ail came from, the marne people as far as
we are concerned.
That disposes conclusively of the objection of
counsel for Senator Haydon on that point.
There are sme other points, with whieh
I do not intend to take u.p very rnuch tirne.
Counsel for Senator Haydon talked about the
precarious life which a member cf the Senate
would have to Iead if hie were not allowed to
engage in business that mîght bring hirn up
against the Govern-ment. As 1 have already
pointed out, the man who cornes into the
Senate cornes in under limitations, and if he
does nof like those limitations if is within his
own choice to remain or not t 'o rernain; but
so long as hie does remain he rnust be bound
hy the honour and dignity and integrity of the
Senate.
Then counsel refers to several witnesses who
gave evidence in regard to the hearing before
the Governor lu Council in Ottawa in January
of 192, and he says that there i8 no evidence
t0 show that Senator Haydon took part in
that hearing. I submit that there is no
cogency in that argument. Mr. Geoffrion
and others appeared for the syndicate before
the Governor in Council. It was unnecessarýr
for Senator Haydon f0 appear. His farne andl
influence were sufficient. The mere fact that
Senator Haydon was on the sie of the Beauharnois project would carry its own influence.
If would have been rather remarkahle that hie
should appear. The very fact that hie was
known to be on the side of the Beauharnois
project would 'be sufficient to bring potent
influences to bear on the Governent of the
day.
Now, honourable members, I arn not going
f0 dwell any further on this subject, except
to say that Senator Haydon discredited hirnself in regard to this matter. He admits, his
partner admifs, fhey ail admit, that up f0 the
timp when this retainer was arranged no legal
work had been done in bis firm's office for the
Beauharnois Syndicaýte. ThLs was a new re-

262

SENATE

tainer, and the work started after the retainer
was arranged. Senator Haydon, on being
asked about that, said in his evidence that
it was a dlean-up. Thon he said it was for
work donc and to ho done. How could there
be a dlean-up when there was no work donc
up to that date? How could there be any
deûan-up when this time, Cetober, 1928, was the
first tirne the firm w-as retained? How could
it be pay for work done, as well as to bo done,
whien ne work hiad been done? I point out
that x-ery patent fact te show how loosely
Senator Haydon gave his evidence, and how
that looseness cf ex-idenco certainly corroborates the frank statement of Mr. Sweezey.
Yeu must remembor, henourable mombers,
that w-e are dealing- with a legal mind, net an
untrained mind, and we expiet more, and have
a right te experet more, exactitude in regard te
those facts from a legal mind than we should
oxpeet frem Mr. Sweezoy.
Helnourable members, I think that I have
given sufficient reasons te justify our cernmittc in ceming te the conclusions ýthat they
reached in reference te Senater Hayden, as
well as in reference te Scoator McDeugald.
I xvant te say just a very few werds in
reference te Senator Raymond. It is quite
clear that 've have te distinguish between
Scnater Raymond and the other henourablo
niesnbers of this H{ou
îýe. His (Iealinig with the
Beauh.irnois Syndicate represen-ted, I belie e,
an invcstnicnt by- a citizen. He sold eut, te
Mr. Jones and anether gentlenr, w-ho bough-t
2,000 z'baîes fromn him, and he w-as fontunaite
enough te clean up a very largo sum of
menev. The committee feit that in ail fairness they could net link hirn up with the
proceedings in the samo manner as Sonator
Hayden and &enator McDoiîgald were linked
up. The cernmittee, in regard te the campaigil
funds matter, saw that he handled a considorable sum of meney. They feit that he should
have explained matters more fully than he
did, but they gave him the bonefit of the
doubt, wvhich I think they were justified in
doing.
I think this report is justified in overy
respect, and is the fairest and most just
statement that could be made.

-Now,

honourablo members, I have net set

down anything that I do net bolievo te be
warranted by the ovidence before us; and I arn
conx-inced that the findings in the report now
befere the Senate are well founded in fact.
1 say te you that the eyes of the people are
rnvetod on the Senato of Canada. There is
undoubtedly wîdespread concern in regard te
the issue before this House. The people are
net expectÎmg us te b:e unfair or unjust tc, any
honourable m1embor, but they are expocting of
us that we shall maintain unsulliod the honour
and integrity of this important brancha of the
Parliament of the -country. If we fail we may
regard ourselves as instruments for the undoing
of the Senato.
This branch of Parliament is chargeil with
woightfy rezsponsiýbilities and duties. It is
intondeil te be the voice of mature and
unbiased judgment in the aifairs of the country,
and the faithful trustee of the na-tion's intorest;
and it is elementary te say that these duties
and responsibilities can nex-er he satisfactorily
fulfilîrd unless the Senate holds undiminish-led
the respect and confidence of the people.
A pcrson who is called te mcmbeî-ship în

the country; and ho must know, elso ho is
net fit fer the honour, that this is net thep)lace in w-hich mon shnuld at their own xviJi

Mr. Svvvezov explained that bis suie reason
for making a contingent arrangement wvas that
he cuufld pay only if the company came into
existence, as it would bo difficuit to tax the
few membors of the syndicate. Ris statoment
in this connection mav be founid at page 728
of the procedings of the House of Communs
comiiitec and piage 55 of the procoedings of
tlie St nate comiiittee. At page 658 of the
Commuins commit t.t. report lie is quotod as
saying that at tlie time in question he owed
large Mtinis to tlic bank.
Senator Havdon snears Chat ho had nothing
to dIo with the Ordor in Coujncil. That is
shiown at page 192 of the proceodings of the
Sonate cunimittee. In this ho is corroboratod
by Mr. Ebbs. at page 71. Senator Haydon
dlaimis that the foc of 850,000 paid on the

things, the incorporation of Beaubiarnois Power

The roference to this is at page 243 of the

made the agreement is dead and no detailed
account is furnishcd. Th'e late Mr. McGiverin
stood bigh in the community and was a Privy
Couneillor. Legal focs are high wvhen tbey
are for important niatters. In this case large
sums were involved, apparently. How can
we appraise the services that were rendered,
in the absence of complaints by the parties
concerned? T ho agreement with Mr. Sweezey,
uinder which the $50,000 wvas to bo paid, wvas
mado, nut b' Sens tor Haytion, but by bis
law firm partuer. and ho denie-d baving bad
any knowledge of any contingent question.
As to Senator MoDougald, I followed closely
the long examination to which ho was subjected, and I was satisfied with the way in
which ho answered every question.
With regard to Senator Raymond, I have
nu besitation in approving entireiy the brief
submittetl on bis behiaif by bis counsel, Mr.
Thomas Vien, K.C., which appoars in No. 13
of the proceedings of the Sonate committee,
at pages 320 anti following, and in which his
wvhole conduet is entirely vindicated.
The speciai committee of the Sonate was
servedi by eminent counsel, but I confess
that at times 1 received the impression tbat;
they over-stepped their professionai duty in
tlealing with mnembers of the Sonate. I think
this is espeeially truc as regards the brief
that tbey preparod for the comm-it.teeo.
If
publie mon in gtneral wore to ho treatted
,as Senator Raymond is treated by counsel for
-the cominittee, any mani having a senso of
bis dignity wouild be discouraged fromn takzing
any part in public affairs. The nature of the
treatment is aggravated by the fact Chat it
is in violation of the instructions given by
the committee to counsel and accepted by
them at tbe outset of the proceedings.

matter of faot, the people of Canada-I mean
the subscribers ta the Beauharnois bonds-have paid bis expenses of the investigation.
Mr. Starr, wbo represented hîm before the
House of Commons committee, cbarged a fee
of some $7,500. This was paid by the Beauharnois Company. His expenses at the hotel
here were some $450, and these also were
paid by the campany. I do not think *he
bas any complaint about the manner in whieh
be bas been treated by the cammittee of
either House.
Tbe buse of Commons committee made
a unanimous report. I think it was stated by
an honourable gentleman tbat the report was
not unanimous. The records, hawever, show
that it was. Furthermore, it was passed by
the House of Commans without a dissenting
vote. It was brougbt down here and we had
to follow it up ini some way. At first there
was a resolution passed that fia senator shauld
be condemned without a hearing. Then a
special committee was f ormed so tbat every
opportunity should be given to the three
honourable gentlemen concerned ta put in
any defence or to make any explanation they
desirpd with regard to the very serjous
cbarges that were made against them before
the House of Commons committee.
After the very exhaustive statement that
bas been made by the chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Tanner) I do not know
that I can add very mucli. There is fia
question about the evidence; it is not disputed in any particular, with the exception
of one or twa little points of fia significance.
Wbat mare can be said? There is fia doubt
about the fact that Senator McDaugald was
interested in the development of power on
the St. Lawrence river prior ta the year 1924,
that he put forth every passible effort ta
contral it, that he even had the Deputy
Minister of Railways and CanaIs recammend
that cantral aver this power, in which lie
ivas ta make a great profit, should be given
by tbe Dominion Government.
Honourable members have heard a great deal
about the Sterling Industrial Corporation. That
was a company which neyer did anytbing and
neyer made a mave ta do anything. It lay
dormant from 1924 ta 1928. Now I ask,
if any other honourable memnber, -or any other
persan at ail, had been at the head of that
company, would the Beauharnois Company
bave paid the sum of M30,000 in cash and
80,000 shares for its interest? I submit it is

265

beyond dispute tbat the influence of Senator
McDougald with the Goverfiment of the day
placed him in such a position that he could
farce the Beauharnais Company ta pay the
8300,000 and the 80,000 shares, each of which
had a market value of $17. Does anyone for
a moment suppose that any other person than
Senator McDougald could have done such a
thing? He was the favourite friend, tbe
favourite child, of the Prime Minister. First
he was appainted ta the National Advisory
Comnittee, then ta the Harbour Commission
of Montreal, and then to the Senate of
Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Ta the Harbour Commission first.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Well, he got thase
three appaintments. Probably there were fia
better appointments in the country. The third
appaintment was ta this Hause. I suppose
he was sent here ta reform it, but I do flot
know.
One of the features of tbis transation ta
which. I think there is the greatest abjection is
the fact that tbe su-m of 827,000,000 was
taken from the people of Canada for Beauharnais bonds. That money was subscribed by
people who could not afford ta lase. it; perhaps by the widow and the orphans. That
is a worn-out expression, I know, but there
is some truth ta it in this case. Those bonds
were sold for 8100 and tbey bave fallen ta
$29. The interest bas not been paid. Was it
not more than cruel-I say cruel-ta 'take
tbat money from people wbo could flot affard
ta lose it, and put a large portion of it inta
tbe pockets of a certain few, who also took ail
the stock? Wbat can be said in defence of
that?"
We kn-ow very well that Senator MeDougald was a warm friend of the late Prime
Minister. They went together an a trip ta
Bermuda, and the Prime Minister's hotel bill
was paid, fiat by Senator MeDougald, but by
the Beauharnois Company.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Pardon me; it was.
The voucher was filed and I can show it ta
you. Tbe voucher is from the Beau-harnois
Com-pan.y and shows that a cheque was issued
for the expenses of Senatar McDaugaid. and
the Rîght Hon. Mackenzie King, and that the
cheque was paid. Senator Mcflougald says a
mistake was made by him in giving information ta his book-keeper when the expense aecaunt was sent in. I do not know what may
be thought about that, but the incident shows
beyond contradiction that Senaitor Mcflougald
was9 a close and warmn friend of Right Hon.

Not oniy did Senator MeDougald, put into
bis own pocket an immense sum of money

bonds, but hie took stock as weii. He also
took two of the five so-cailed management
shares. Those five shareis give to their owners

For ten years the ordinary shareboiders, the

was buying it for someone else. I see no
mystery about it. In any event, àt does flot
niake any différence so far as this report is
concerned.
Therýe is no use in my going into a long
discussion of the evidence, which bas heen
so carefully and clearly placed hefore this
House by the chairman of the committee. I
should like, however, to point out just one
thing. I hold in my hand a pamphlet issued
by the National Popu-lar Government League
of America. This pamphlet is called "Canada's Teapot Dome and Its Arnerican Parallels." It consists of sorne f orty-six pages, and
contains the evidence given before the House
of Commons committee. It was distributed
throughout the United States, in the House
of Representatives and the Senate. and in
the various state legislatures. Its purpose is
to bring before the people of the United
States some idea of wbat lias happened in
regard to this matter in Canada, and it warns
the people of that country that if they are
not watchful the same thing will happen to
them. I mention this because I believe that
this matter is not going to be confined within
the walls of Ihis Chamber, but wiil spread ail
over the American continent and wherever
the English language is spoken.
Surély it
must not be said that members of this House,
wlio occupy a position of trust, can use their
influence and their money for the purpose of
grabbing one of the greatest resources in
Arnerica. Surely it must not lie said that
they can use their dinfluence with the Government, and that for subscribing buge sums
of money to carnpaign funds in order to retain that Government in power they are absolutely certain to obtain something in return. That surely is bribery, and a crime,
and nothing else. That $700,000 was put up
for one purpose, and one purpose onfly, namely,
to ensure the return to power of the Government of the day, so that the Order in Council
would bc passed and these pirates would becorne possessed of Canada's greatest asset.
I arn sure 1 cannot say anything more that
will influence any lionourahle member of this
House. My lionourable friends will remember,
liowever, that during the last campaign there
was a great outcry by the then Prime Minister of the country for the reform of the
Senate. With my own ears I have heard him
say that Providence was going to help hirn,
that the members on this side would die off,
and that when lie got sufficient members on
tlie other side lie would be able to reform this
House. Well, when three members of the
Senate, or at least two, are cliarged witli one
of the greatest offences ever charged in the
history of tlie Senate of Canada, I do not see
that bis reform lias gone very far. Perliaps

267

the Senate does need a littie reforming, but
I believe that the reform will corne from
within the Senate itself, and 'that it can lie
brouglit about only if lionourable members
deal with matters of this kind in a nonpartisan way and show the people of Canada
that they are alive to their responsibilities.
Hon. Mr. MURD-OCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Iarn glad that the
lionourable gentleman says, "Hear, hear," because if any honourable gentleman needs reforming more than lie does, I do not know
wlio it is.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I said, "Hear,
liear ' to the remark about being non-partisan,
and I may tell tlie lionourable gentleman
tliat lie lias not; yet lieard tlie last word from
me.
Hon Mr. McMEANS: I arn afraid tlie
honourable gentleman's remarks will show
that lie bas not mucli idea of the responsibilities of bis position.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wjll tell the
honourable gentleman something later.
Hon. Mr. McMEANSý': I want to say just
one more tliing before sitting down. Tliis
matter lias exercised the minds of the people
of Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacifie,
and frorn tlie forty-ninth parallel to the
shores of Hudson Bay. To-morrow, or the
day after, the radio will convey to everyone
in tlie country the news of what action the
Senate lias taken in one of the gravest
moments in its history. Ex-en if I occupied
a seat on the other side of the House, I
should be x-ery son-y indeed to think that
partisan feelings would induce me to vote
to whitewash tliese lionourable members, and
I say to bonourable gentlemen opposite that
in tliis respect tliey liave my greatest
sympatliy.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I beg leave
to, move the adjournment of tlie debate.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn not
going to object if the riglit lionourable gentleman is very desirous of adjourning the debate.
I had hoped, however, tliat we could go on a
little longer.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We bave liad
several liours of discussion, some of whicli I
neyer dreamed would take place, and I think
it is but fair to lionourable members wlio
bave spoken that I sliould bave an opportunity of looking over the evidence. I subrmit
that tbey bave not stuck to it, as I hope to
do.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJEOT
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Tanner for the adoption of the Fourth Report
of the Special Committee of the Senate appointed, for the purpose of taking into consideration the report of a special committee
of the House of Commons, of the last session
thereof, to investigate the Beauharnois Power
Project, in so far as it relates to any honourable members of the Senate.
Right Hon. GFO. P. GRAHAM. Honourable memibers, I have no apologies to offer
on rising to make a few qassual observations
on the question before the House, and I trust
that when I sit down I shall be in the samne
position. 1 wish, in the first place, to explain
to friends of the minority on the committee
wby there was no minority report, as many
expected there would be, so that they may
know that this is really the first opportunity
that the minority has had to state its views in
the House and place thema on record.
I had thought, noit being a very close observer of the rules, that a minority report was
admissible.
I was conv.inced by the coinmittee that this was ýnot correct; that no
statement similar to the one the minority
prepared could be placed on the Table when
the report was presented. Further, althorugh
the minority could ixot sign this report, no
indication could be given with the report, or
on the saine day that the report was made,
that it was not unanimous.
I wish to place on record now, so that the
public may understand our position in this
respect, the objection filed and flow appearing
in the minutes of the committee against the
adoption of this report:
[n Reference to the Report of the Senate
Committee Re Beauhýarnois Enquiry
We find ourselves unable to agree with the
findings of the majority of the committee, which
in our opinion are largely based on suspicion
andi against the corroborated evidence of the
honourable senators named in said reference,
and said findings are not warranted by the
evidence adduced at said enquiry.
We have every reason to believe thýat our
colleague, the Hon. Senator Béique, who is
unable to be present to-day, is in full agreement
and would acquiesce in saine.
(Signed) Geo. P. Grahami,
C. W. Robinson,
A. B. Oopp.

1 might add that the senator himslf (Honi.
MT-. Béique) in this House has announced his
acquiescence in this statement.
Now, honourable gentlemen, the report that
has been presented is not, to my mind, according to the evidence adduced. Before 1 go
into that question I want to cal! the attention of the House to my antipathy to the
machination known as inv.estigating coinmittees.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Louder!

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Machination!
There may have been a time when they were
useful, and some of them may be useful. You
know there are different kinds of investigations. Some are useful and of special benefit
to Government or Parliament in arriving at
decisions. Others are set up through committees for the purpose of relieving a Government of responsibility; they are a kind of
buffer. Then there are those that seem to, me
to ha intended, in large part, to give good
positions for a f ew weeks or months to hgal
men; and this purpose neyer fails. An investigation into the conduet of a member of
the House, to my mind, should not take place
except on a charge made by some other member of the House. These investigations allow
memibers of either Houas to ha treated as a
man in the dock foi~ some crime would not
be treated; I mean as to the rights and privileges of members so charged. These investigations allow a trial of a member of the House
-a trial, I say-to take place without any
other member of the House taking the responsibility of putting him to that inconvenience and to the publicity which accompanies
it. I express again the opiniion that it is not
a courageous way to pursue a member of
cither -House. Some niember, believing a
colleague to be guilty, should rise in his place
and manfully make a charge, and take the
responsibility.
You may say, "This is not a charge; this is
not a trial; this is an investigation." Yes,
I have heard that argued; in fact that was
stated by counsel for what I cal! the prosecution. But is it true? Was there in either of
thiose committees anything by which the difference could be discerned between a man on
trial and a man under investigation? The
on-ly difference is that a man in such investigations is being tried at large, without
any person taking responsibility in the matter,
and the accused has none of the privileges
allowed to a man in the dock for any crime.
This is not a crîticismn of counsel at aIl.
It is, to my mind, a criticism of the principle
of allowing any of our colleagues in either

SENATE

270

House to be investigated, with all the paraphernalia of a court, but without any person
standing up in his place and taking the
responsibility.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman just long enough to
sayHon. Mr. ROBINSON: Keep your boots
on.
enough to say
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: -long
that this investigation by a committee was
demanded by the honourable gentleman from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. McDougald) as a trial
by his peers? Consequently it was not in any
way thrust upon him. He sought it, asked for
it, and demanded it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I shall come
to that. The Senate coimittee heard evidence,
but the evidence and findings of another committee were thrust upon it by this House, for
consideration. So it was not really an investbecause the committee
iga tion by his 1peers,
was compelled to consider the evidence and
even the findings of another committee, which
findings, I have no hositation in saying, were
made against the ethics that have always
exi.sted in regard to the relations between
the two Houses, against the practice, and, I
think I am safe in saying, against the statute.
I have a little fault to find with the majority of our committee. It is not that the witnesses were trea.ted unfairly, or anything of
that kind. The majority report of the conmitte' is not a report of a Senate committee
per se, but is in the shape of a charactergiving to the report of the House of Conmons. Read it and see. In other words, the
committee of the Senate adopted the illegitimate offspring of a committee that had no
business to make a finding, and it gave that
report a character by calling it a report of the
Senate committee. If you read the findings of
our committee you will observe that the evi-

dence before the House of Commons,which we
did not hear, is quoted more freely than the
evidence which we did hear, and that the
report, -instead of saying, "We find so and
so aecording to the evidence," says, "We find
that the findings of the Commons committee
were iustified.*' I say that in reality the Commons committee did not have any findings,
and had no right to have any findings; and
if you ask me what has been donc to dim the
dignity of the Senate, I say that nothing has
happened in this Heuse in years which has
marred the dignity of the Upper House-to
put it mildly-as much as these reports.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Now I want to
express another opinion. Honourable gentlemen m'ay not agree with ýit. I -am afraid that
they will disagree with several things that I
say.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Never.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
ably, I think.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Not reason-

Oh, nu.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A great deal
has been said about the importance of this
committee of investigation. I will use the
words of the late Sir Sam Hughes in expressing my view. Any of you who were in the
House of Commons at the time will remember
that when Sir Sam Hughes oaime back from
overseas and found us debating other matters
he made a speech. In two or three words I
shall quote the essence of what he said,
namely: "In comparison with what is taking
place at the front, and in view of our responsibility, what we are engaging in in this House
to-day is mere piffe." I want to say that in
my humble judgment the spending of a couple
of months in committee by men who think
they are capable of giving advice on the great
problems before us, or the taking up of the
time of this House in hunting down two or
thne of our colleagues, is, in comparison with
the great problems that we have to face and
that will come before the Imperial Conference
in a few weeks, mere piffe.
Some Hon SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I want to say
further, honourable senators, that the adoption
or the fathering of this illegitimate offspring
of the Commons committee establishes the
most dangerous precedent affecting the authority and dignity of the two Houses of Parliament that bas been established since I entered this Chamber. The Senate committee
has approved of the conduct of the House of
Commons committee in censuring members
of this House. In the report of our own committee the finding of the House of Commons
committee, which I say is illegal and out of
decency as between the two Houses, bas been
given a character. A precedent is established
which makes unsafe the position as senator
of any of you men opposite, any of you men
on this side of the House, or even of the
good woman of the House. Something may
arise in the House of Commons, and without
any charge being made an investigation may
take place, and one of you may be named,
and we may be obliged to consider the finding of the House of Commons committee. If

APRIL 28, 1932
it should corne here we may be obliged, in
order to keep harmony, to confirmn that finding instead of presenting one of our own. I
say again that no man or no wornan in this
11iouse is safe. We should have repudiated
that finding of the House of Commons, if
not the evidence, and made a finding of our
own to maintain our self-respect and dignity
and stand by the rights and privileges of this
House in the face of an attempt-maybe flot
intended, but real just the same-ýto drag
down the dignity of the Senate and to make
this House subservient to the Lower House.
Now 1 corne to the remarks of rny honourable friend the chairman (Hon. Mr. Tanner).
I arn not going to follow hlm in his legal and
illegal arguments, but I arn going to discuss
the situation in rny own way. You know, I
was a littie disappointed in my honourable
friend from Pictou. I was delighted with his
announced conversion from. partyism. I would
not have believed it if any person but himself
had said it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 was delighted
with hirn, and was prepared to admit frankly
that bis presentation of the case was ableone of the ablest, perhaps, of ail the able
speeches we bear in this Huse.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will the
honourable gentleman permit me to ask a
question?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM- Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The honourable gentleman bas now made a very impressive argument on the dignity of the Senate.
Djd be raise that argument before the comrnittee?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I did.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And more than
I raised it-though we are not supposed to
diseuss that, for it is private conversationand one member of the majority of the committee was the strongest in the view that
something ought to be .said to "thump"ý-I
think that was tbe word he used-the Commons committee for usurpin-g our rights. That
does not appear in the report; but I ar n ot
objecting.
I was in the rnidst of a consideration of my
honourable friend frorn Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) and bis announoed departure from,
partisanship. As I was saying a moment ago,
when I was interrupted, I was delighted with
that announced conversion and was getting ail
ready to send to the oldest paper in Ontario

271

a cut of rny honourable friend with the
announcement that, as the High Commissioner would say, neyer since the tirne of
Saul of Tarsus had there been a more notable
conversion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But the honourable gentleman spoiled it on me, and I had to
destroy the correspondence and the articles
and throw the cut into the waste-paperbasket.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I shall refer
later on to the way in which he .spoiled it.
Now I arn going to take up the case of
Senator McDougald. 1 want to make this
statement, and I want honourable gentlemen,
as 1 know they wiIl, to verify it for thernselves: that the only way in whîch a case can
be made out against our colleague Senator
M-cDougald is to believe that he perjured himself-I put it in 'bold language-to believe
that his evidence was not reliable, and from
the unreliability of bis evidence (which has
flot been sbown, for it is in most cases corroborated) to draw the deduction that he is
guilty of things of which, under -oath, be said
he was not guilty. Do honourable gentlemen
think that either our colleague or ourselves
should be sub.jected to that. kind of argument
upon the evidence? Th-at is an opinion, but
there is nu evidence to support it. I have
an idea, perhaps a perverted one, that it is
my duty and your duty to protect all our
colleagues, and not aIl but tb.ree; that it is
our duty to give our colleagues who are
charged with offences at least as fair treatment
as would .be accorded to a man charged with
'a crime, and give them the benefit of the
doubt. Is there any benefit of a doult in any
of the findings a-bout any of our colleagues?
I ssy 'again, and I want to emphasize it, that
I feel that it is as mucli my duty-and you
will pardon me for saying that I 'believe it is
as much your duty-to protect the good
names of our colleagues. unless they are
shown by absolute ýproof to be unworthy,
as it is to protect the dignity of the rest of us.
In order to show how some of these matters
were approached, and in what frame of mind
they were approached, 1 arn going to ask honourable memb«es to go with me to the
National Advisory Committee first. Do not
confuse this National Advisory Comrnittee
with the Joint Engineering Board. This was
an Advisory Committee appointed by the
Government, and I w-ill tell you furtber, in

case you have forgotten, it was recommended
by myself-sornething that ought to give a
standing te the men on it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

It was

Canadian Governrment as to the benefit or

sneered at it, and the Senate committee
swallowed the sneer, hook, line and sinker.
Certified copy of a Report of the Committee
of the Privy Council approved by His
Excellency the Governor General on the
7th May, 1924.-P.C. 779.
The Committee of the Privy Council have
had before them a Report, d'ated 7th May,
1924, from the Secretary of State for External

Affairs, subnitting that the question of
improving the navigation on the St. Lawrence
Waterway so as to provide access to the Great
Lakes for maritime commerce, is one of considerable difficulty and complication, and its
right decision may be of the highest possible
importance to Canada. The project necessarily
involves collaboration with the United States
of America and the expenditure of very large

of the problem in all its aspects, financial,
economic, technical and international, is not
only justified but essential. The International
Joint Commission bas held hearings on the
subjeet in both Canada and the United States,
and has submitted a most elaborate and valuable report; the engineering problems involved
have already been the subject of enquiry and
report by an international board of engineers,
and are to be further investigated by another
such board; other technical connected questions
are in course of being studied by an interdepartmental committee.
The Minister is of the opinion that it
would be in the public interest to constitute a

National Advisory Committee to consider
generally whether or not the project would,
if coempleted, be beneficial te Canada, whether
the benefits which might accrue and the
pecuniary returns, direct or indirect, which
may be anticipated from it are such as to
if any,
counterbalance its disadvantages,
whether Your Excellency should indicate a
readiness to enter into discussions with the
United States of America looking towards the
negotiation of a treaty for the carrying out
of the necessary work, and what should be
the character of the stipulations which any
such treaty should contain.
The Minister accordingly recommends that a
National Advisory Committee be constituted
for the purpose aforesaid, the Honourable
George Perry Graham. Minister of Railways
and Canals, to be Chairman thereof, and the
following to be its members:
Right

Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

Thomas Ahearn, Ottawa.
Honourable Walter Edward Foster, Saint
John, N.B.
Beaudry Leman, B.Sc., C.E., Montreal, P.Q.
Edward D. Martin, Winnipeg, Man.
Dr. Wilfrid Laurier McDougald, Montreal,
P.Q.
Honourable Sir Clifford Sifton, K.C.M.G.,
K.C., Toronto, Ont.
Major-General John Williarn Stewart, C.B.,
C.M.G., Vancouver, B.C.
Honourable Adelard Turgeon, C.M.G., C.B.O.,
Quebec, P.Q
The Committee concur in the foregoing
recommendation and submit the same for
approval.
The appointment of Dr. McDougald has
been criticized. I want to say that Dr.
McDougald was appointed on behalf of
Montreal and Montreal Harbour. That is why
he got the appointment. Montreal was conplaining, or fearing, that the harbour there
would be injured, that among other things the
depth of water might be interfered with, and
I considered-and the Government approvedthat the chairman of the Harbour Board was
the proper person to appoint te represent the
Harbour and the City. Will any person
disagree with that? No.
Now, I desire not only to give a character
to the Advisory Committee, but to point out
the way in which this matter was approached
in the report. I am going to read the naines
again. As each narme is read I am going to
ask honourable members, on both sides of the
House, who come from the same locality as
the member of the committee, to say if they
think a mistake was made. In referring to
Senator McDougaild the report said-I am not
quoting it word for word-that he was
appointed te this committee which was conposed of Right Hon. G. P. Graham, Sir Clifford
Sifton, and some other gentlemen interested in
water-power. Why refer to the matter in that
sneering way? The report goes on, at great
pains, to narne the stenographers who formed
the provisional board of the Sterling Industrial Company, but it omits the narnes of
many of the men who were members of one
of the biggest organizations that this country
has ever had. This is not part of the evidence,
any more than many of the statements made
by my honourable friend yesterday were in
the evidence. I have put ry own interpretation
upon this part of the report, and honourable
members may accept my interpretation or not.
It means that this committee to which Senator
McDougald was appointed was composed of
the old gang, Graham and Sifton, who did not
amount to much, and of others who were not
competent to judge of this great question,
because they were interested in water-power.
That is the impression that would be left on
the public.

APRIL 28, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
clear about what the right honourable gentleman is referring to. Where is tihe reference in
those termis to that cornmittee,? In what
document is it?
It will lie
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
found in our own report.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
seen it yet.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think it is
there. It is not in the language that I have
j ust used. I was interpreting it, and I think
that my interpretation would lie that of
ninety per cent of the lionourable mýembers of
this House. But I blieve that -report was
flot accurate. I wiil put it strongly: I believe
it was not truc. I do not believe that al
those men were interested in power scbemes.
1 do flot believe my honourable friend from
Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) was interested
in power scliemes. My lionourable friend
tells me he was not. Consequently that statement was untrue.
Now I am going to read the names, and I
ask bonourable members, no matter on whicb
side of the House they are, if tihey have any
objection to the name of a man who comes
from their part of tbe country, to place it on
record.
Thomas Abearn, Ottawa. Is there a member of this House wlio would say that for a
committee of this kind there is an abler man
in the country than Tom Abearn? Is there?
Not one. Mr. Ahearn is passed unanimously.
I want to get the approval of botb sides of the
House for this comimittee, which bas been
sneered at, and concerning which an untruthfui statement lias been put into the report.
Hon. Walter Edward Foster, Saint John,
New Brunswick. Does any honourable member from New Brunswick not think that
Senator Foster, witli bis experience, would be
a good man on a committee like that?
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: He is all riglit.

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Absolutely.
Montreal does not; objeet, and Montreal
knows Beaudry Leman.

Any objections?- None.
Hon. Sir Clifford Sifton, K.C.M.G., K.C,
Toronto. If any bonourable gentleman, no
matter how bitter a Tory or how greatly lie
disagreed with Sir Clifford Sifton, wanted to
make a success of a projeet, lie would lie

Some Hon. SENATORS:
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is unanimous. Then honourable members have

Hon. Mr. TANNER: My riglit honourable friend omitted to state that Mr. Leman

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Certainly, as
any sensible men would, if they felt that way.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My riglit honourable 'friend was not going to mention that

And you need sug-

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 have tried to
show the attitude of mind in which the mnatter
of these appointments Ivas approached. 1 think
Dr. McDougald îvas jn good company, and
that he wýas an acquisition to the committee.
Now, my honourable friend is gettieg on
delicate ground when he says I did not mention that there were two members dissýenting
from the report of that committec. Did hie
mention it? They were among the also-rans.
They were not mentioned. Nobody was mentioned by name except Dr. McDougald-who
is being charged, 1 say, witb doing something
unhecemieg a senator-and Grabam and
Sifton.
The majority on our committee forgot something cisc, something that is personal to myself. They 6aid that Graham was chairman,
That is truc, but they fergot to say, in justice
to Graham, that for menths hefore the report

If Dr. McDougaid
had forgotten anytbing like that, his forgetfulness would have been put dýown as alimost
a crime on his part. Yet, this commiiittec of
the Senate. trying te, cast aspersions on the
Advisory Committce, treated one of its ow'n
members in that way.
I think I have convinced the Huse, as

Mr. GRAHAM.

The Advisory Committce, aftcr I rctircd, did
net have mucb time te do that. Se 1 quictly
urged that we sbould have a committcc
formed in the Sonate. May I say here that
I believe Sonate committees have ne superier

inteiligently flnding eut such information.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Exoepting this one.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This one was
intelligent, but net fair.
I was very
desirous of our having a cernmittee of that
kind. I discusscd the proposai with severai
members and they scemed te be unanimously
of the opinion that sucb a committee wouid
be a good thing. And it was a good thing.
One wouid imagine, if one went by, reports.
that my fricnd Dr. McDougald wvas head,

comrnittcee fermefi, but he was ne more cager
tban anybody cisc te have tbat commit tee

net a very high compliment te say that

APRIL 28, 1932
honourable members of this House should
not have anything to do with the business
life of the country. I cannot condemn Senator McDougald for the part hie took, simply
because he had some stock in Beauharnois.
I now pass on to the Sterling Industrial
Corporation. My honourable friend from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) will see that I arn
flot following his speech closely, but hie will
also see that I amrn ot shirking anything.
What was the Sterling Industrial Corporation? It was a corporation formed at the
instance of Dr. McDougald before he was a
senator. In order to make it appear as a onehorse affair, the names of the stenographers
and others who were appointed provisional
directors are published in full. I ask honourable gentlemen of the legal profession if it
is not the practice to appoint stenographers
as provisional directors when a company is
beîng formed? Is there anything wrong about
it? Perhaps some of us from the country
do not quite understand it, but I appeal to
legal gentlemen as to whether it is not the
custom, when a company is being formed,
to put in as provisional directors, for the
purpose of getting a charter, the namnes of
employees in your own offices, and to remove
them when the company is fully formed. Is
that the practice or is it not?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is. Then
what particular odïum attaches to the formation of the Sterling Industrial CorporatÀon
in the samne way? None. The charter was
obtained before Dr. McDougald was a senator.
He cannot be condemned for obtaining the
charter, can he? No. But it seems that some
people have condemned him for carrying out
the terms of the charter and for seiling to
Beauharnois.
Some honourable gentlemen have attacked
Senator McDougald because the Sterling Company had only a nuisance value. Let me refer
to the speech made by my honourable friend
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) yesterday.
He pictured Senator McDougald as almost ahlpowerful with the then Prime Minister. It
was alleged that the senator's influence did
this, that and the other thing. lI Senator
McDougald had had one-tenth the influence
that niy honourable friend said he had, then
the Sterling Company would have been worth
more than the Beauharnois, because he could
have got anything hie wanted. But that was
not the case. Senator McDougald, or some
other person, applied to a department of the
Government for approval of a certain plan,
but that approval was neyer obtained. That
rather goes to prove that my honourable
friend over-stated the influence that Senator
McDougald had.
41767-18àj

Senator MeDougald retaîned bis interest in
the Sterling Company, which lay dormant for
a considerable time. Suddenly he, or bis
associate Henry, wished to do somiething about
it. Neither of them thought that Senator
McDougald was all-powerful. If hie had been,
they would have been in on the ground floor
and could have done what they liked. As to
Mr. R. A. C. Henry, the gentleman associated
with Senator McDougald, I will say, without
any fear of contradiction, that Mr. Henry is
one of the biggeet men of his profession on
this continent. Mr. Swe.'zey w s anxious to
get aIl competition out of tYe way. He
wanted to have a clear field. You ask why?
Just for the samne reasori that you would
have desired it. This was his pet scheme,
there were several persons or interests intervenlng, and Mr. Sweezey wished to keep them
out. I must confess that Mr. Sweezey,
who was a ve-ry wealthy young man, had
somne distorted ideas as to what money
could do, or possibly what political influence
could do. But that is not the fauit of Dr.
McDougald. Dr. McDougald and Mr. Henry
went to a great deal of trouble in making
an investigation, Mr. Henry, as I say. teing a
great engineer. He spent a great deal of
time. Dr. MeDougald paid him his expenses.
I think hie agreed to give him $10,0O0, but I
do not think that much money was expended.
Mr. Henry went to Dr. MeDougald with the
scheme. It was not Senator McDougald's
scheme at ail in the flxst place; it was the
engineer Henry's. He was asked by Dr. MeDougald to look over the territory, and he
did. He interested some capitalists in the
city of New York, including Dillon Reid.
Nobody will sneer at that flrm of financiers.
They sent a man over just to see what Henry
was trying to do. The rlevelopment of power
on the St. Lawrence river had long been a
hobby of his.
The time came when., as I have said, Mr.
Sweezey was trying to get ail other interests
out of his way. I think hie was too sanguine
or too ambitious in his aspirations. They
would perhaps have been realized more easily
in some other way. Mr. Sweezey, considering this his baby, bis industrial infant, conceived the idea that in order to get the best
man at bis disposai he ought to get R. A. C.
Henry. Henry, rather than Dr. MeDougald,
was the man who, as Sweezey thought, was
standing between hlm and the accomplishment
of bis object. Dr. McDougald had put only
a few thoussand dolla«rs in, and nothing more.
MT. Henry ail through his if e had been a
successful man, and Sweezey said to himself,
"I arn going to get Henry," and, rightly or
wrongly, he got Henry. As 'the price of
getting Henry he took over the Sterling,

Mr. Henry, had invested in that corporation.

said hie liad better go back and consider the
question of selling out, or selling Sterling to

partners? If so, wbait difference would it make
%Vho made the proposition?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do like to
hear these honourable members speak, but in
their turn. I amn a patient Inan for olmost
four hours at a lap, and I do not object to
questions, for tbey g-ive oie a littie breathing
spe il.
I corne back to repeat that Henry, beingtbc practical man, the man wbio had done
the w-ork and hiad given M\cDougald any information lie biad about it at ah, made the
proposition to Sweezey, and named the price.
What wvas the price? First, $50,000, or 2,000
part interests. That ivas the basis on whicb
these two companies merged. It is true that
afterwards botb Hem-v and McDougald sold
those part interests for a rather large amount
of money, and I arn under the impression that
voul would ail have done the saine if you had
tbe opportunity.
That ends tlic Sterling episode.
We ail
bate to
seesene other man make money.
Nearly ail of us would rather make it ourscîx es-put it that way. I think I have discussed Sterling as far as it needs to be discussed.
Lt 'vas a proposition in which the
Beaubarnois wislied to get Henry, and they
took the Sterling and got Henry-one of the
best men they could have got on this continent; and bie is thiere yct.
Now let me point out that some person has
said-I. tbink hie was not from Montreal or
Toronto-tbat lienry wau paid an exorbitant
saiary, S40,000. 1 think I can look into the
face of a man who bas declined a S40,000 job
in tbe last twclve months.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Not I.

APRIL 28. 1932
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I ar n ot looking at you. You are in a class where you do
flot need any job. How you made you.r money
1 amrn ot going to inquire.
Senator McDougald is charged with using
political influence, or, to put it in another
way, it is alleged that on account of being a
senator he made money in greater quantities
than he would have made it had he flot been
a senator. Senator McDougald was asked a
direct question about that in the Senate comniittee. He was asked, "Did you make one
dollar more in any of those things on account
*of being a senator?" He replied, "Absolutely
no." That means that he did flot use any
political influence; and I arn myself in a
position to speak of several years and say
hie did flot. If he had had the influence that
honourable gentlemen wish to attach to him
he could have got anything he desired, even
the approval of the Sterling Company.
I corne again to that other point: either we
have to say that Senator McDougald did not
tcli the truth in the witness box, or we have
to acquit him, as a colleague, of using any
political, influence, or using his position a.s a
senator to make rnoney. If he did not use his
position as a senator to make any money, then
I submit that there is no case against Senator
McDougald for having used political influence.
But there is another charge-I say charge,
because by the devious ways of irresponsible
investigations it has grown to be a chargethat of deceiving the Senate. How? Well,
he said something in April, 1928, that led the
Senate astray. It did not lead me a.stray, and
I do not thinik 1 arn any more conversant with
bis business than any of you; perbaps I arn
less conversant than some of you. He stated
in the Senate in Aipril, 1928, that he had, no
interest in Beauharnois. Was it true or was
it flot true? Every bit of evidence adduced
before the Senate comimittee in hours and
days to prove that that statement wa.s noV
true feil to the ground. The trail by which
the proselcuting attorneys hoped to trace information was through the purchase of Sif ton
stock in Beauharnois. That suspicion-it was
only suspicion-was traversed back, forth, up,
down, north, south, east and west by the able
counSel, and they had to stand before the commit'tee downcast and adandt to hav-ing f ound
no iota of evidence to substantiate the charge.
But let me refer to what was ealled evidence
that there must be something wrong. Before
one committee Senator McDougald had said
he paid $46,000 in one suin, and before the
othercommittee he had said he paid it in two
sumis; consequently he could not be telling the
trutb. Which statement was true? Now,
for the real meat of the question, what

difference did it make whether he paid it in
two sums or in one? He paid $46,000, putting
up his money for his stock, and when that waa
done he owed $144,000 more. I ask legal
gentlemen on both sides of the House-and
you, Senator Wilson-to read this evidence,
and if you do you will conclude that every
effort was made and every avenue explored to
prove that Senator McDougald endeavoured
Vo decoeive the Senate on. that pariicu.lar day.
but every effort absolutely collapsed and
failed.
Then there cornes the question, why did he
make that mistake? I need not ask any man
who niakes a speech. 1 appeai to my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
to say whether it is a fatal mistake Vo make an
crror even in names or in dates. Senator
McDougald, eoming lbefore that Commons
committee, and not knowing all these questions he wasg to he asked, saîd that he had paid
it in two sums, $30,000 and $16,000, but when
he carne Vo examine his books and the gentleman who acted as bis financial manRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: He had no
books whatever.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Well, it would
perhaps be better for sorne people if they did
not have them. They are disastrous sometimes; they are very bad reading. He then
came Vo the conclusion., and knew, that he
paid it ail in one amount. Was he right in
correcting his error, or was he noV? I say
it was manly for Senator McDougald Vo give
a statement as Vo the proper amount. If he
had flot done so he would have been accused
of deceiving the committee again.
Iow do we know that he paid Vhe 846,000 at
one irne? Through gentlemen subpoenaed by
the prosecution, bis financial man, lais lawyer,
the men who through a telephone caîl from
Dr. McDougald paid over the bonds Vo representatives of the Sifton interest, on the
18th of May, I think, and took a small
acknowledgment of the transaction.
Perhaps you wll oay, "Yes, but there was
something there that was burned up." My,
oh myl I should not like Vo ask an.y of us
how many things we burn up every day. But
the reason was given for that. Mr. Sif ton
had asked that when this transaction was
completed this particular document should be
burned. I do noV know what was in it; you
do flot; the committee does not. IV did not
affect the circumstances one iota. To destroY
that particular piece of paper was carrying
out the agreement that had been made with
Sifton when the contract was completed,
Sifton being very iM.

SENATE

I say the suggestion that in April, 1928,
Senator McDougald deceived this House is
not well founded, because every bit of evidence
he gave the Senate committee was corroborated by witnesses summoned by what I call
the prosecution, and it proved that when he
made that speech in April he did not have a
dollar in the Beauharnois project.
One charge, made into a serious charge,
against Senator McDougald was that in May,
1931, in making in this House a speech in
which he was endeavouring to justify his
statement of April, 1928--and he fully succeeded, though to my mind it did not need
any justification-he used the term that he
had not an interest in Beauharnois until the
2nd of October. Although he had paid over
money and taken possession of some of this
stock, he still owed 8144,000, and the transaction was not complete, and lie did not become officially the owner of this property
until the 2nd of October. Or, to put it in
another way, lie did not officially complete
the transaction until that date.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: He did complete the
first 800 units; it was the second 1,600 units
that he did not.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have stated
the case accurately, and I have tried to go
back again and state it more accurately, if
possible. Now, is that a matter for which
the senator ought to be censured, ought to be
condemned? Judging from the experience of
a man who thinks and speaks on his feet,
I say that in ail probability Senator McDougald had in mind the completion of the
transaction on October 2 when lie made that
statement.
Nothing in this incident was
serious, except that somebody was trying to
prove a case against hin for deceiving the
Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
right honourable member mean by "completion'' the completion of the payments?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Of the transfer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If that is the
case, lie never com.pleted at ail.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It was the
transfer from Moyer to Ebbs, and Senator
McDougald became known practically as
owner, with Ebbs as his representative.
Now, I submit that no case lias been made
out that Senator McDougald deceived the
Senate. What else was there? First, the
National Advisory Committee. I submit in
ail humility that when Senator McDougald,
as a nmember of that committee, joined in the
approval of a report recommending the north
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

side, which report was made by the Joint Engineering Board, he was not using his position
to heip Sterling, whose holdings were on the
south side, but was voting against his own
personal interests.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: What is
that? Explain it. I do not understand the
right honourable gentleman.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am sorry,
very sonry-sorry for my honourable friend.
I say that Senator McDougald's interest in
Sterling was on the south side of the river.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
adian side.

The Can-

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No. That is
the north side. I do not wonder now that my
honourable friend does not understand. It was
on the south side of the river. The Joint
Engineering Board sent in a report approving
of the north side, the Canadian side; Senator
MeDougald as a member of the committee
voted for the adoption of that report, which
reconinended the north side, while his interest was on the south side.
Honourable gentlemen, I know that I am
bei-ng tedious. but I have soren worthy and
notable prcedents.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go on.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Now I am
going to take up the case of my old friend
Senator Haydon. I want to look into the face
of every man in this House, I want to look into
the face of the Dominion of Canada, and say
that in my humble judgment there never was
a nob:er character than that of Andrew Haydon.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am proud
to be his friend. Standing high in his
churchAn Hon. SENATOR: Order.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: -the Anglican
Church, trusted by his colleagues of that
cbmrch---serd of whom have discussed this
matter with me-respected of aIl men, Andrew
Havdon stands in my estimation to-day as an
honest man undeserving of being attacked.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: By birth,
instinct, training, education and practice, a
gentleman. He is a graduate of Queen's Univrsity, and never in my recollection through
all the years have I heard, even hinted, any
aspersions on the character of Senator Haydon. I have known him since he was a boyAndy Haydon-and if I appear to show some

APRIL 28, 1932
heat, again 1 shall be following a notable
precedent, twenty-four bours old.
As I said a wbile ago, I was prepared to
a.pplaud tbe efforts of rny honourable friend
froin Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) yesterday,
but when be attaicked Anadew Haydon without justification, wi.tbout waTrant, and in a
most cruel way, I had to de"la frorn that
eulogy.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GIRAHAM: Andrew Haydon, it was hint'ed and insinuated-it was not
done openly; it wùs like the machi-nations of
one of these investigations, witbout anybody
being responsi.le--was not as sick as he pretended to be. Is that a fair inference?
An Hon. SENATOR: Sharnel
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It was adrnitted that he was sick, but it was said that
be was well enougb to do this and that. I arn
sorry that I bave to say this to my bonourable friend, but 1 arn disappointed in hirn in
that respect.
I would not criticize any man on the otber
side of the House who was in tbe state of
bealtb that Senator Haydon is in, and bas
been in, even if I 'had no alternative but to
resign iny seat in the Senate.
Man's jnhumanity to man rnakes eountiess
thousands rnourn.
If ever there was a case wbere we sbould
ensbroud a colleague with cbarity and sympathy, it is the case of Andrew Haydon , wbo
bas gone tbrough so rnucb and wbo bas still
more to go tbrougb. I bave known bim to
be very ilI for montbs and montbs, and every
meniber -of the comimittee who went to bis
bouse knew tbat be was ill, and could see it
in his face. If honourable gentlemen bad
known 'hirn in the beyday of bis sterling,
strong rnanbood, with bis ruddy countenance
and sturdy frame, they would have known
that they were not looking on the Andrew
Haydon of old.
Senator Haydon bas been severely criticized,
but 1 tbink the bitterness results from some
of tbe evîdence he gave. Andrew Haydon, as
I said before, bas been a very sick manI know it-and if we dispute that, we shall
bave to say that one of the leading physicians
of this city also perjured bimself-and no one,
1 tbink, will say that. In fairness to, the
committee, of which I was a member, I want
to say that it did not force itself into Senator
Haydon's bouse. I do not believe the committee would bave insisted on bearing bim at
ail. But Andrew Haydon is made of the kind
of stuif that will face anything, and sick as

he was, he said: "I arn going to be heard
before this committee if I have to go down.
to the comimittee room, and if it be the last
step I ever take." His counsel urged that
the committee go to his home, and after
bearing Dr. Argue we went.
Senator Haydon, as those know who knew
him in bis beyday, was of a quiet disposition,
not excitable, a very poor conversationalist;
in a crowd; what we cali a quiet, thinking
man. As soon as I stepped into the room
wbere he was, I was almost asbamed that 1
had corne, anid I arn sure that inany others feit
that they would rather flot be there. He was
nervous, probably buoyed up for the occasion,
a bit talkative, altogether unlike Andy-or
Senator Haydon, I sbould say. So critical was
bis condition that, tihe ck>ctor stood near by anid
at one stage told the commrittee that they
should flot go any furtber that day. Thle cornmîttee went back again. I arn not finding
any fault with the way in which Senator
Haydon was examined. If he had been a welI
man, it would have been absolutely correct,
and the examination migbt have been even
stronger. But he is attacked for saying sorne
tbings, and certain things were stricken out
of the evidence. It must be remernbered that
in one or two cases he claimed bis rigbt as
senator-the sarne right whicb. was accorded
to other senators--to make statements, and
he did, under pressure, I say, make a statement concerning some conversation between
Sweezey and bimself that I confldently believe
be neyer intended to make.
Put yourself in bis place, you strong,
healthy men. He bad been in the bouse, in
bed most of the time, for months. When he
was able to corne down town for a day everybody said: "I thought Andrew Haydon was
sick. There be is." He had been thinking as
you would tbink, as any sick man does in bis
weakness, that he was figbting the world alone.
What would you bave done? He was pressed
for quite a long time by counsel. I arn not
finding fault witb that. Surely he could tell
of some conversation that he bad had witb
Sweezey. That question was pressed and
pressed and pressed, as 1 -rernember the evidence. Would it flot irritate you if you bad
been there under great pressure and strain?
I have a friend wbo bas known me for the
last fifty years very in'timately, as she lives in
rny bouse, and wben I went home she told me
that if the positions of Andrew Haydon and
myseif had been reversed, there would not
have been policemen enough in the city of
Ottawra to get the comrnittee into ber bouse.
Senator Haydon had been pressed to tell
of sorne conversation be bad with Mr.

280

SENATE

Sweezey, and finally he becaine irritated and
said: "N ew, yen have been insisting that I
teil1 you about some conversation I had witb
Sweezey, and here it is." He neyer said that
Howard Ferguson made a demand on Beauharnois. That ýis flot correct. What hie said
was that Sweezey told him that that was the
reason hie, Sweezýey, had flot got the centraet
through at Toronto. He did flot mýake the
statement to malign the High Commissioner.
His statement was denied by Sweezey. 1 ame
flot going te discuss that, however. I amn
pe'inting out the circumtstances under whieh
the statement was m:ade, and what n'as sajid.
It was net that, Mr. Ferguson had hetd up
a contract until hie get an election conýtribution, bust that Sxvee'zey told bim se. Andl
there the matter stands.
Now I want to take up the charge against
Andrew Hayden.
I say in ail sincerity,
honourable gentlemen, that I think it would
have I)CCf humane, weuld have shown our
brothcrly instinct, that in carrying on this
investigation. owing te the condition of health
and mind of Senator Haydon, we should have
delcted the came of Senater Haydon unýtil
such time as hie might recever, if recevery is
possible. That bas net been done; I suppose
it is net custemary; but it weuld have been
the humace thing to de, and 1 think it is
cet yet tee late.
Senator Haydnn is charged, by lawyers,
mind yeu, with getting $50,000. 1 will state
the case gecerally.
There was more than
that in cennectien with the retailler, as I
thick the lawyers call it when they get sonnethicg
Some Hon. SENATORS:

what I arn dealing with. Everywhere we
heard of the Hayden ficm, while as a matter
of fact the late Hal McGiverin ivas the senior
partnier, and the firm was MeGiverin and
Hayden. Mr. MeGiverin was a member of
the Pcivy Ceuncil, an ex-member of a Gevernment, a mac who kcew ail the members of
the Government v'ery intimately and knew
the mnembers ef Parliament more intimately

APRIL 28, 1932
May 1 relate a littjle incident from my own
experience? At one time 1 was charged by a
clerical friend with carrying some advertising
for Sunday excursions. Having been brought
up inl a clergyman's f amily, I waz flot very
frigh.tened. I %toodbis badgering and criiticism
f or a comcsiderabl wMite. He lived seme distance from me and I thougbit I would go out
to the -country and Vake a look aroundý. I wtent
te his parish--qperbaips I shouild not, caIl it a
parish, hecause that might indicate he was
an Anglican, whereas he was not; he was a
rnember of my own church-and I discovered
that I knew a considerable nýumber of bis
congregation. I asked him if he was acquainted with So-and-so. He said, "Yes; he
is one of rny best contributors." Then I asked,
"Does he go to church?" And the reply was,
"Yes; bis wife goca every Sundiay." Mter Valking the maiter over a Etitle further I asked
him, "Did you say that So-and-so was a
regular contributor?" "Yes, one of the best."
Then I said: "Do you k.now ithât he gets the
mon«ey be gives you frorn selling whiskey?
And you are a good temperanýce manl Good
afternooi." I neyer saw him any more.
When you receive campaign. fund&-as you
ail have done-it is not the habit, even in high
places, to ask the man who brings in the
rnoney where he got it. Did any honourable
member ever ask a man who was heilping him
eut in an election-and it is ne disgrace to be
helped out in an election these daye-"2Are
you sure you did not get that money from
sonte place where yeu should flot have got
it ?" No. You take it andi trust to providence
to justify the act. Nonie of you have ever
considered, where you got it; your tbought was
rather abýout wlvat you were going 4o do wiith
it. That is unanimous. In this day and age
the empens3es of an eleotion, frorn whicb we as
individuaîs aire freed, are enormous. My bonourable friend froru Inkerman (Hom. Simeaton
Wbite), wbo has a pretty go:od paper-if we
do not compare it with the Recorder and
Tirne&-does not question where -the, money
cornes frorn te pay for bis page advertisenient
for either party. And, to . e franc, se it is
with me. We ta-ke the money; we do not
asic wbere it ornes from. We want the âdvertising and we want -to be paid for it. The
espenses of advertising in this age are eniormous, andl I arn glad of it. In etarilier days
men went frorn door to dioor andl madle
speeches from town te town. No'w speeches
are f ewer and, the candidates advertise. The
cost of adverbising is a legitimate cost. Payment bas to be madle not oady for newspaper
space, but for radio broadics.sting, for posters,
and s0 on.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER:

And automobiles.

Rîght Hon. Mr. GRAH.AM: Every dollar
that can be collected is needed to help the
poorer candidates meet their legitimate expenses. There must be campaign funds.
Not only are there the expenses of elections,
but in between the campaign years the parties
bave to maintain central offices. These must
be staffed, literature must be sent eut, and
money must corne in. No one, I think, will
disagree with me when I1say that carnpaign
funds, if legitimately used as campaign funds
for election purposes, are just as proper and
honourable as campaign funds for the Red
Cross.

1 must get on to the crux of tbe matter.
Senator Haydon is charged with takîng a large
surn of money frorn Sweezey, it being said
that Sweczey is the Beaubarnois Corporation.
But is hbc? He~ swears be himsedf gave muney
to both parties. It is said that be couýld noV
have donc that. And the report says that
senators directly or indiu-ctly received carupaign funds from the, corporation. But that
is not Swçýeezey's evidence. H1e says that in
both casets he gave the money personaliy. My
bonourable

friend from

Pictou

(Hon.

Mr.

Tanner) secmed ýto pairt' a halo around- the
bead of Mr. Sweezey yesterday and, to bedieve
the whole of Mr. Sweezey's evidence te wbich
be made reference. Is ;he godng to dishelieve
it in this connection? No.
Mr. Sweezey was a rich young man with
ambition, and in order to realize that ambition be did not hesitate to give bis rnoney
altogether too lavisbly. I say that advisedly.
He would not hesitate a moment in giving to
the political parties twice what be did give
if he tbought that by so doing he would be
helped in acbieving the object of bis ambition. I repeat, bis evidence ia that he hixn.self, and flot the company, gave the money.
I can prove that in the opinion of some
bonourable members, if Senator Haydon got
the money from Sweezey and net from Beauharnois, then the gif t was aIl right. My honcurable friend laugbs.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn going te
prove tbat that is bis opinion. I have expressed mine and I have stated what the
evidence shows. In the evidenoe about the
contributions, I think, Mr. Sweezey or Mr.
Griffith swore that $10,000 had been given te
the Conservative campaign funds. I have ne
reference to the private gift te MTr. Bell. It
was the mest natural thing te make a gif t
of that kind te an eld friend. But there was
another prominent man in Montreal te whom
I think $10,000 was given, General McQuaig.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I hope the right honourable gentleman will excuse me if I object
to his introducing my name into the matter.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I did not do
so. I said General McQuaig.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I apologize.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Will there be
a subscription given with that? I think there
ouglit to be. I am not speaking slightingly
of General McQuaig. He had a perfect right
to do what he did. But when it was intimated
by Mr. Griffith in the box that the $10,000
given to General McQuaig came out of Beauharnois, what a flutter there was in the dovecots. Mind you, it had been testified that
the amount given to the Liberal campaign
funds had come out of Mr. Sweezey's own
pocket, but Mr. Griffith said that the amount
given to the gentleman in Montreal for the
Conservative party-not Mr. Bell-came out
of Beauharnois. And then what happened?
Mr. Griffith was sent for pell-mell, and Mr.
Sweezey too. What for? To come up and
correct that evidence, as they did. After consultation and consideration they said the
money came out of Sweezcy's pocket. Then
wliat happened? Not a word was said. Wlien
to
it was transferred from Beauharnois
Sweezey the gift was sanctified. My honourable friends know that that is the case. Well,
if the money that went to both parties came
out of Mr. Sweezey's private pocket, and
not from Beauharnois-and this is what Mr.
Sweezey swears-what case is there against
Senator Haydon for taking money from Beauharnois?
Now I will pass on to Senator Raymond.
I shall do my best to get through in almost
as short a time as my honourable friend from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) did. The first
thing that is said about Senator Raymond is
that he made a lot of money. Yes; and if
honourable members knew Senator Raymond
they would not be surprised. There are a few
men who have the faculty of making money
while going through life slowly, but with their
eyes and ears open. Mr. Sweezey and Frank
P. Jones got into this Beauliarnois matter.
Any honourable gentleman who is acquaintecd
with Mr. Jones knows that lie will not work
with any double-headed presidency or management. He has the great distinction of
having been born in Brockville, which shows
that he is no coward, whatever else he may
be. As I say, he and Sweezey both got into
this and they got Senator Raymond to take
some part interests.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then the time
came when Jones and Sweezey fell out as to
who was going to run the show. They knew
that fthe two of them could not operate together, for Frank Jones wculd not play second
fiddde to any person in the world. The evidence
shows that options were given to Jones.
Transactions of that kind are earried on every
day in ,the business world. Any honourable
member who is in business knows that at times
there is a tangle like the one I have been referring to, where one partner says: "I will go
to my partner and name an amount. He can
buy me out or I will buy him out." Frank
Jones came to Senator Raymond and said,
"I want to make a proposition to Sweezey,
because either he or I will have to get out of
this." Senator Raymond said: "All right; I
will do whatever you say." He gave his proxy
to Mr. Jones. A little capital was sought to be
made out of the fact that Senator Raymond
said he did not ipay much attention to this.
That is in line with everyday experience. If a
friend of mine, in whom I have confidence,
comes fto me and says, "Graham, I have a good
thing," I may not know anything about his
proposition, but I may take action because of
my confidence in him. So Mr. Jones went to
Sweezey and said: "My group will give you
$550 a share. I will buy you out, or you can
buy me out at the same figure." Sweezey decided to do the buying. He paid the amount
asked, and that is how Senator Raymond made
his money and got out of the syndicate.
Sweezey stayed in with his group. Now, what
was wrong with that? As I say, transactions
of that kind are going on every day. This
affair sirnply showed that Mr. Jones and
Senator Raymond were shrewd business men.
They were prepared to put up their money
or to take Sweezey's rnoney, and they left it
to Sweezey to make tihe choice.
What did Senator Raymond do then? He
wanted to keep 351 shares and he went and
bought them, paying $550 a share for them.
He had sold out part of his first shares to a
friend; there is where he made some of his
moncy. That was before any of the stock went
on the market. What I have said about the
matter of party contributions, with respect to
Senator Haydon, applies absolutely to Senator

which alil honeourable meanbers are familiar.
He was a trustee for part of the campaign
funds of his party. And no person has yet said
that one farthing of campaign funds placed in
the hands of Senator Haydon or Senator Rayinond ever went astray.
I am prepared to go as far as the resolution
goes, for the future. I am prepared to go

senator bas a right, and alinost a duty, to contoeibute to the funds of his party.
I have twlked long enough. I have tried not
to say anything offensive, and ais I oit down

te make. Not lisving bad a legail training,
I hiave not been able ito treat. the evidence ais
analyticall'y as sorne honourable, members
can, but I have tried to state the salient
facts clearly. And I want to reiterate my
belief that I arn as careful a custodian of the
honour of this Senate as any other member
is; no one bas more interest in the welfare of
this House. I cannot join in eondemning my
colleagues. After careful and conscientious
consideration, in an endeavour to act as I
would if I were a jurymnan under oath, I cannot
concur in findings which will condenin my
colleagues, who, I suixnit, are not guilty, under
the evidence.
Right Hlon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, thîs is the first time in six and a
baîf decades of our national history that the
duty has devolved upon the Senate of reviewing and making a- decision as to the conduct of
memnhers of this body. We ail hope that it
will be the last.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It hehooves
us in the pursuit of this inquiry to exact
from ail concerned the utmost faimness and
a sternly judicial attitude towards our fel.low
members. So far as those senators especially associated with myseif are concerned, I
have been anxious, and arn stili, that no
pressure of any kind be brought to bear. My
desire has been that they should examine the
facts in a spirit not only of fairness but of
sympathy for ail concerned, and corne to their
conclusions under the compulsion of conscience and of nothing else. There neyer was
a dase where anything in the nature of party
prejudice or party ambition had less right to
intervene. Those feelings ought to be f oreign
-and I want to give everyone credit for a

283

desire to make theni foreign-to the probleni;
and I hope by my own remarks to-day to
convince honourable enem-bers that I have at
least tried to view the subjeet wholly apart
from. ail coneiderations of that kînd.
I have no complaint to make, on the score
of fairness, of the speech that has just fallen
fromn the lips of the right honourable senator
fromn Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
From. the stendpoin-t of the debateT, it we
fair. I fear hie disclosed hiniseif as so devoted
and entbusiastic a friend of at least one of
those concemned that hie is disqualified as a
Juror in the case. But even that I arn prepared to overlook.
My principal objection to the speech hie
made is this, that- it dealt not in the essence
of the case. I do flot say that in every
feature of his speeoh hie avoided fundamentaIs, but in far the greater part of it
hie was speaking of the mere trappings
and the suits. the trivial externals, taking note
just of fleas and insects around the corpus of
this great matter, and not of what is of the
essence of the probleni which we confront.
.May' I make clear one or two matters of
principle before I go into the argument? I
would not for a moment say that because a
senator in this House makes a statement flot
in accord with the facts, hie should be
expressly censured, with the seriousness
that this censure conveys. If hie make
such a statement inadvertently, it is only a
subjeet for correction. If hie make it even
with intexît, in the ordinary course of dehate,
it becomes a subjeet for rebuke. But there
is a sphere in which. the statement of a senator assumes a wholly different character.
When hie is talking in that sphere a responThe
sibilit>' far heavier falîs upon bum.
class of subi ect te wbich. I refer is that of
bis personal interest as related to bis public
duties. When hie is in that sphere the utmost
scrupulousness is demanded of him, flot oni>'
in the care of his utterances, but in bis
absolute fidelit>' to and full disclosure of facts,
Over the whole histor>' of British parliaments
and ail parliaments on tihe British model those
parliaments have demanded on the beaviest
penalties a rigid adherence te facts and truth
in ever>' utterance on that class of subject.
And the reason for sucb uncompromising insistence is very evident to ail. Without such
a responsibility resting inexorably upon a
member our institutions would fail of their
purpose; fail because the public would flot
have confidence in tbem.
Another thougbt. I want to say that I do
flot think a man coming to trial should bave a
prejudice against him simply because hie has

SENATE
been a custodian of party funds. First, I do
not think it is any offence at ail, or any
unworthy conduct, for a man to act as such
custodian. I go even further: I say thaît fact
alone is rather a certificate of character; it
evidences on the part of those who know himi
hest a confidence in bis personal honesty.
Having said that, I hope no one will accuse
me of approaching this question in a spirit
of self -righteousness or cf prejudice against
those concerned. I can say, and I know the
senators concerned will believe it to be true,
that I have no prejudice at ail, unless it be
a prejudice in their favour. Perhaps I should
add no more to that phase.
I desire now to place in perspective the bistory of this case, and, in as little lime as will
satisi'y the necds of the occasion, to outdine
the connection therewith of the senators conccrned. Actions unbecoming on the part of
senators, and with wvhich these senators are
charg-ed-I do flot shrink from the word-I
shall trv to keep distinct from other things
whjch miay bie rcferred to, in the evidence and
the report, but which really have littie or no
relation to, the main fundamentals esscntiai to
an intclligc'nt conclusion.
To recite thce connection of Senator McDocigld with the project, is to give an bistorical suiinarv of the whole affair. He
cnitcrs at the bcginning and hie stays tiil the
close. In rcciting, now bis connection with the
projeet my primary objeet is nlot to bring
home to hini re4ponsibilt' for the conduet
of which hie is acc'csed in the report before us,
but only to set forth what has taken place.
On the 7th of May, 1924, hie was appointed
a mimber of the National Advisory Cornmittee to inquire into a proposcd canalization
an.d power dievelopment of the St. Lawrence
That ccsmmittee continued until the
riv er.

*iust heard xvhich was designed to ýconvinýce
honourable memnbers that a grave injustice
liad been donc that Advisory Committee, and
that tbis in some unspecifled way affected the
guilt or innocence of those accused. I bad
neyer known that the report of the Commons
committce contained any sneer on this National Advisory Board. On the whole, I
think, pretty good men were appointed. But
there is contained in the report, in the course
of a review of the occurrences, a reference to
the appointment of that body, slaling the
names of only two members-Right Hon.
Senator Grahami and Sir Clifford Sifton-and
tlie way in which the members are referred
to is Ibis: il is said that the committee

"included" those two men and other mnn
"interested in hydro-electric developmcnt.'
That is the sneer.
Right Hon. M'r. GRAHAM: It wau not true.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was true.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Riýght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 0f course it
was true. The committce included the two
men; that is truc?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It included
other men interested in hy-dro>-electric development. Who were they? When I repeat their
mames it is not to insinuate that they were
flot gooýd men. Sir Clifford Sifton, Mr. McDougald. and M.r. Ahearn were some of the
memnibers of a committee of about six. Certainly, therefore, the statement was truc. It
miay not have been wvorth while to point out
the fact. but Ihat i.s the only criticism one
could make. Even Ibis is too much attention
10 devote to what i.s just an external, a mare
matter of the colour of an awning of a bouse
in an estimate of its architecture.
Vcry wcll. On that committcc Senalor
McDougald sat until il made its report on
the llth of Januarv, 1928. In the meantime
lie hecame a senator, called in Jâne of 1926,
I tl)ink, andi taking bis seat and heing sworn
in December of that year. In tbe spring of
1928, on the 2Oth of April, hie took his place
on a special committce of tbis House whose
purpose was te, inquire into and report upon
the dcvclopment of the St. Lawrence river
for purposes
of navigation and power.
That committee, of which hae ias a member,
made ils report on the 7th of June of the
saine year.
During this period, and from earlv in 1922,
Senator McDougald had been, except for a
very small inlerval in 1926, chairman of tbc
Harbour Commission of Montreal.
Now 1 go back again to deal. historically
only, with other things with which. he was
occupied, so far as they affect the cause
that we are rcviewing. On bbc 5th of July,
1924, or about bwo months aftcr hie took his
place on the National Advisory Committee,
Senator McDougaid had incorporated a company known as the Sterling Industrial Corporation. The five shares which hae held, he
stated-bonestly, I do not doubb-representeci this property and hae inbcnded bo
divide tbcm in some way with Mr. R. A. C.
Henry. The main purpose of tbis corporation
xvas bu intercst itself in bydro-electrie develupment. On the 5tb of Juiy, the day of its

APRIL 28, 1932
incorporation, it flled an application with the
Railway Department for power to divert
30,000 cubic second feet of the river St. Lawrence at Soulanges for the purpose of power
production. On the 7th of the same month
it filed a similar application with the Department of Public Works. Its formation was
due to an understanding between Dr. McDougald-not then senator-and Mr. R. A. C.
Henry, who by this time had become hcad
of the Department of Economnics of the Canadian National Railways, by which understanding some plans of Henry with relation
to the St. Lawrence were to be investigated,
and, if they proved good, to be adopted for
the purpose of making money. Dr. MeDougald undertook to finance Henry in this
investigation to the extent of $10,000, and
actually did. finance him through the Sterling
Company to the extent of not more than
$3,500.
Commencing in 1902, there had grown up a
company known as Beauharnôis Light, Heat
and Power Company, whose purpose was to
secure the old Robert rights relating to power
development in this same district, on the
south side--as did the application of
Sterling. This Beauharnois Light, Heat and
Power Company in 1927 became the property
of Mr. Sweczey under an option, and thereafter he proceeded, step by step, to secure
powers of an enlarged character for this
devclopment, making application therefor to
the Government of Canada, and making and
pursuing an application to the Government of
Quebec. In due course, on the 27th of April,
1928, it obtained fromn the Governmcnt of
Q.uebec authority for the execution of a lease
of 40,000 cubic second feet of water, and the
lease was executed the following month. It was
at this point that the company was able to
reach the flrst milestone of its progress.
Now we have come only to the establishment of the Beauharnois Liglit, Heat and
Power Company and the conferring upon it
of the necessary franchise and concessions
by the Province of Quebec. This conmpany,
of which the moving spirit was Mr. Sweezey,
knew that even if it were conceded that the
powers granted by the Province of Quebec
belonged solely to that province-a question
which is not yet decided flnally-it was still
necessary to obtain approval by the
Dominion Government, under the authority
of the Navigable Waters Act, of all its plans
f or the production of power and canalization
of the river. It knew that it had to face a
Government which at least 'had not conccded
that it did not possess the original authority
to grant the riglits based on the ownership
of power. The company knew it had to obtain

285

this consgent from a Dominion Govern-ment
which could not abandon its dlaim even to the
authority exercised by the Goverument of
Quebec, and which in any event had to be
satisfled from the stand-point of navigation
that the works were in the interest of the
country.
The company set about obtaining this
approval, and in January, 1928, flled its application with the Departuient at Ottawa. But
approval of the application was long delayed.
Many exigencies intcrvencd. Many, indeed,
were the methods employed to expedite its
progress. At last, on the 8th of March, 1929,
approval was given by the Governmcnt of
Canada, with conditions attached thereto.
The second milestone had been passed and
the company was well on its way.
At this point it is essential to recaîl that
after Mr. Swcezey got this option on the
shares of the Beauharnois Light, Heat and
Power Company in 1927, he went about financîng the option by the organiza-tion of a
svndicate known as the Beauharnois Power
Syndicate, -which became the owner of the
option and subsequently the owner of the
stock. Mr. Sweezey was a holder of units in
this syndicate. Some other men became
holders. The number was comparatively few,
totalling on the 4th of April, 1928, about 18 or
20.
The amounts paid for these unitsý>-which
cannot technically be called shares-varied.
Some personis got their units at 3.7.50 apiece,
others at $40) odd apiece, but the general
run-of-mine subscriber paid $100 apiece. This
syndirate was converted on the 4th of April,
1929, into another syndicate, the second, commonly called the Beauharnois Syndicate. All
the- men who had shares in the flrst got double
their number of shares in the second. There is
nothing wrong with that. They were given
also the right to subscribe for the same number of shares in the second as they received by
the doubling of their shares in the flrst. That
is to say, if a man had 800 sha-res in the flrst
those were converted into 1,600 in the second,
and at the time of the conversion lie was given
the riglit to subscribe for 1,600 more in the
second at $100 each. All subscribers took advantage of that option. This meant the issue
of four times as many shares of the second as
there were of the first. There were 5,000 of
the first, 20,000 of the second. Additional
shares or units of the second were disposed
of in one way or the other, chiefly by way of
purchase of Sterling Industrial Corporation,
until altogether 25,000 shares or units werc
outstanding in the second syndicate.

what I have to say in this regard bof ore 6
o'clock-the name last mentioned in the
speech of the right honourable gentleman
from Egan'ville (Right Hon. Mr. Grajham).
I find myseif more in accord with the remarks of the right honourablo gentleman there
than in any other portion of his address.
There is no question that the conduct of
Sonator Raymond, as deflnod and reported on
by this committee, is in every way distinguishable fram the conduct of other senators
aifected. The committee makes no express
censure of Senator Raymond. The committee does say, ovidently more by way of
guidance for the future than for any other
purpose-and of this the rigbt bonourable
gentleman froma Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) makes no complaint-that it disapproves of the action of senators in becoming
largely interested in companies which are
dependent upon government concessions,
favours; or franchises, and it also disapproves
of senators afterwards becoming interrnediarios
for the collection of campaign funds from
such campanies.
Now, as this committee is charged, impliedly,
with unfairness, I ask honourable members the
question: Could any comxnittee of this Houso
proclaim to this Dominion that sonators had
a right to engage in such undortakings?
Would any of you care to go bof oro any
audience in Canada and say, "I have the
right, as a senator, to put my money into a
company whoso very breath of life is a concession from the Govornment that presides
over the nation of which I am a senator,
and whose actions I am callod upon to reviow
day by day in the course of my duty"? Dare
the committee have takon any stand less
critical and attempt to justify itsolf before the
people of this Dominion? I think not.
No onc was more pleased than I that the
committee feit able to report as it did with.
regard to Senator Raymond. lis standing in
this bouse and in this country has been
high. I am neot saying lihat the committee
was unduly generous to him. I think the
report is fair and right.
The next portion of the report which I wisb
to discuss refers to Senator Haydon. I shail
not do more bef are 6 o'clock than say that
my knowledge of bima bas been very sligbt.
I cannot aspire to call my acquaintance witb
bim by the name of friendship, but such as
it was, it disposed me in, bis favour.
1 accept the statement of the committee,
and the cominittee accopted the statement of
Senator Haydon, that he is il1, and has been
ili for many months-severely ill, perhaps
seriously ill-and I feel that in disposing of

287

this unpleasant duty we are justified in keeping bis condition in mind. I tbink the committee kept it in mind. I think it sought to
treat him not only fairly, but with kindly
consideration. But tho committoe had ta
decide. "Shaîl we or shaîl we flot invostigato
the relationsbip of Senator Haydon to this
Commons report?" If the suggestion had been
made that it would have been botter at that
time to postpone action-I do not ýthink it was
made-I should have f ound no fault witb the
committee for s0 doing. The right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Grabam) nods bis bead, confirming tho fact
that no such suggestion was made. The committee feit that this buse, knowing of bis
condition-it had been well known for some
time-bad resolved that this subj oct should
ho investigated, and investigated now. How,
then, could the committee have done otherwise than pursue the mandate on which it
rested, and seek to discbarge that mandate ta
the best of its ability?
At 6 o'clock the Sonate took recess.
The Sonate resumed at 8 p.m.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, beo re coming ta the close discussion of the connection of Senator Haydon with
these matters, I want ta make mention of
some other circumstances alleged in general
extonuation or defence of the threo sonators,
by the rigbt bonourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). Ho argues
that this subj oct has not boen troated proporly,
that an indignity bas been done ta, tho Sonate
aof Canada, because a committeo of this
bouse in rendering its report chose ta follow
the form of making quotations from the findings of tbe House of Gommons committee
and adding its affirmation that these findings were true. I sbould like ta, tbink that this
House will neyer suifer any groater offence
than that. What are the circumstances?
This bouse last session professed ta be "gravely disturbed" by the findings of a House of
Commons committee as they aifected three
senators, and unanimously resolved that a
committee should ho appointed this session ta
examine into those findings. In pursuance aof
that unanimous decision we unanimously
agreed this session ta rof or tho report of that
Commons, committee ta a cômmittoe of this
bouse for examination and report. Well, if
there is any illogitimacy-and I do not know
why thatu term should ho applied-to the
Commons report, surely we should not have
referred that report ta aur committoe. But
we unanimously made that roference. It was

288

SENATE

done witb the approval of the senator from
Eganville. This Huse unanimously resolved
to do so ]ast session, before I was a member.
Consequently the bouse adopted the illegitimacy, if there was any, then, and it was done
with the riglit honourable gentlemans own
vote. But what illegitimacy is there? I should
have liked the, right honourable gentleman to
have expanded on that argument; and if hie had
expanded on it I should have liked to sec him
make a greater success of his effort than that
made by counsel for Senator McDougald in
their argument before the committee. Counsel
for Senator McDougald merely give two
quotations in an endeavour to show that a
Commons commjttee commits some breacli
of decorum or of constitutional practice ini
making reference to senators in any report to
its nwn Ho'ise. I have before me the two
citations that counsel use. The first is fromt
Bourinot and is as follows:
Eacb bouse. however, exercises and vindicates
its own prîvileges independently of the other.
L acbi Huse (leclares for itself what cases
aebreaches of privilege, but the groinids for
thieir action are based upon the sanie principles
and precedents.
How can anyone read into that dictum a
contention that if a committee of one bouse
is invcstigating a subject and1 finds that mcmnb-er-s of the other Hoîîse are concernced, it must
bie silont as to those mcnibersNo human
nîind coul'l extract such a conclu.kon from
those woro-~ Thev nicrelv say that each
House is independent in the exercise of its
own priv.ileges.
The second quotation is from May's Constitutional History, and is as follows:
Botlî boiuses of Par]ianient "mnust act within
the Iiiiits of their jurisdiction, and in strict
(oiiforinity w.ith the lanws. An abuse of privilege is eve nore dangerous tlîan an abuse of
mi
prerogative. Jn the one case the wrong is done
byan irresponsible body; in the otiier, the ministers w~ho arlvised it are open to, censure and
p)ini-hlnent. The jîidgnient of offences especially
sboul be guided by thes 'verest priasiples of
Saw%."
I ask bonourable sen'itors opposite if they
think that quotation has the slightest bearing
on the contention that a committee of one
bouse is debarrcd frorn hringing inte its
verdict any reference to or reflection upon
a member of the other Hotise. I cannot find
it there. Both quotatiens are wholly irrelevant
to sucb a contention. When three able counsel, after searcbing ail authorities and examining constitutional jurisprudence, can bring
only these quota tions te our attention, surely
it is quite a stretch in the way of a personal
appea] for the rigbt honourable senator from
Eganville te ask us to say that wbiat the
1Right Honi. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Commons cemmittee did was illegitimate, and
that our committee is offering an indignity te
this Senate in daring te say that it found the
verdict of the Commons committee to be
true.
The right bonourable gentleman says the
committee searched for means of holding
Senator Haydon up to, centempt or misrepresentation. It even asserts, h e tells us,
for the purpose of emphasizing responsibility,
that the law firm of McGiverin and baydon
was "Senator Haydon's firm." The rigbt bonourable gentleman says that the bead of that
firm, until be died. was Mr. MeGiverin, and
that at the time of the occurrences witb wbicb
we are concerned Senator Haydon was only a
junior parteer; therefore it is doing bim a
gross injustice te refer to the firm as bais firm.
Wbile ýhe was on the subject I took a minute
and a lîalf-and no more-mn turning up evidence and I found in ne les&s than three places
Senator Haydon, in bis own evidence, in
speaking of that very time, had called it bis
firin. Do 1 need to quote?
Look at the
bottom of page 193. Senator Haydon was
asked:
What were yoîîr relationships with birn?
Buiness relatieushipe?
That is with Senator McDougald.
And
Sceator Haydon replied:

Mwitlî iini, yes.
And further up on the samne page, Senator
Havdon said:

This ivas part of the prepared statement by
Senator Haydon; it was written eut and rend.
And on thîe next page lie said, '4My firm "

lîideous
offence was it for tue Senate committee te
adopt Senator Haydon's own language in

But theu riglit honuable gentlenman from

nuistake, in any event, te investigate the
conduet of a member of eitlier buse unless
some other member takes the re,aponsibility of

tbat that general principle bas been tee frequently vioiated. But w-bat are the circumstances bere? Why dees hie urge this as a
rcason for net adoptîng the report?
Why
dees lie urge it even by way of suggesting that
there wa,, anything unfair in the proceedings?
No one on this side of the House, at any time
or in any place, entered into pursuit of these

APRIL 28, 1932
three senators, or evinced the slightest
interest in making trouble for them in any
way whatever. The situation we are in bas
been forced upon us; flot by anyone who had
flot the public interest at heart; neverthelcss,
so far as our position goes, it is an involuntary position. The other House, on the
motion of a member who certainly is no
close friord of the party to which. I bolong,
appointed a committooe to investigate a
definite transaction. In the course of the
inquiry certain things developed, which convinred the com'rittee that if it was to report
the facts and flot ignore themn it had to make
certain sbatoments with regard to three senators. The committee feit it to be its duty
to present that report to this buse so that
wo might exerciso our indopondent judgment
and vindicate the proper place of this body in
the Parliamont of Canada, faithful te, that
duty expressod in the language quoted by the
two lawyers for Senator McDougald, and just
referred to by me. This House never for a
moment doubtod that this procedure was
right, and it unan.imously voted a year ago
that as soon as this session openod we should
take that report in-to consideration.
We
unanimously appointed a committee, and the
committee, taking the report fromn the Commons into account, feit it its duty to frame
its verdict on that report. If there could bo
a more logical sequence of events, my mind
is flot able to comprehond or suggest wbat it
would bo.
I amrn ft going to endeavour to compete
with the right honourable senator fromn Egýanville (Rig-ht Hon. Mr. Graham) in the eulog-y
he gives cf the charactor of Senator Haydon.
I ar n ot quaýlified fromn any point of view.
He bas placed around bis head a halo which
some of us xviii be able to sce in our visions
like a spare tire. It may alI ho true; I do
flot knowý; but the question xwbether it is or not
is flot the issue that is before this House.
it is not sucli an issue that is before any
assembly or tribunaÀl in the determination of
its verdict in respect of allegations and
evidence which have beon submittod to it.
The honourablo gentleman seeks to impreas
upon us that if we find any fact, adverse
to the three senators, wo are refusing to
accept t.heir own sworn testimony. He
says their own sworn testimony is that
they did no wrong. Is not Senator Haydon,
he asks, on record ais saying that ho took only
the retainer that he had a right to take? Is
flot Senator McDougald on record as saying
that he did not make a dollar except wbat
he could have made if he was not a senator
at ail? He says it is our duty to protoot our

289

fellow senators, and not find such a verdict as
to lay them open to a charge of having sworn
falsely.
I venture to say that if a court wero to
accept the sworn opinion of mon accused of
wrong-doing in any particular transaction,
there rarely would be an adverse finding. Al
tribunals, this tribunal included, must go down
beneath opinions, espocially tbose of the accused. They must get at the uniderlying facts
and try to, find out where the truth really is,
and where the guilt really belongs.
Now, I proceed to make that inquiry in the
case of Senator Haydon. I think I have disposed of tbe idea that there is anything unfair
in tbe development of the wholo case; in the
conduct of the 'lawyers on one band, or the
committee on the othor, in relation to any of
these men. Throughout the entire report I find
repcated tributes, on the part of counsel for the
tbree senators conccrned, to the fair way in
whicb tbe whole proceeding was conducted,
and especially to the fairness of counsel for
the committee in their attitude towards and
treatmeflt of the mon affected.
To put tbe charge or accusation against him
briefiy, Senator ilsydon bas to answer for two
courses of conduiot. One is that bis firm. including himnsedf, witb his knowledge and
approbation, accepted from, Sweezey a retainer contingent upon the approval of
Sweezey's appdication to the Governor in
Council for ratification of bis St. Lawrence
plans. I asIc honourable gentlemen opposite,
who are concerned equally with us for the good
name of this Sonate, for its place in our
constitutional structure, for its future as an
instrument of -overnment-I ask them, wili it
ho contendod that a membor of this House who
is a lawyer is in a position and bas a right to
take a foe, however largo or small, conditionai
on the succes of an appeal to the Administration for a concession? Wiil any bonourable
gentleman suggest that?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not tbink it was
over put as bal.dly as that.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, but it
should ho.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: T-hat be would flot ho
paid unless they got the Order in Council put

An Hon. SENATOR: That is the wbole
case.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order!
Hon. Mr. FORKE: A case was suggested
in which a Iawyer, if ho wvas successful, xvould
receivo a fee mucb larger than if ho was not
successful. That was exactly the position.

APRIL 28, 1932
have been no future. There would have
been no object in forming the Beauharnois
Corporation. What would have been the
value of it? It could do nothing. The
dlean-up of the past was a clean-up of
nothing; the clean-up of the future was a
ean-up of next to nothing, for the only
thing that amounted to anything was the
Beauharnois Corporation-its constitution sud
its charter-and it would flot exist if the
Order did flot go through.
Exhibit No. 152, which is sworn to by Ebbs,
illustrates the work donc. If lie lied neyer
sworn to it you would know that it did. It
was chiefly agency work. Counsel for the committee were generous in suggesting that $5,000,
instead of 885,000, would have been ample.
One eian iioderstand higli fees for important
legal work, such as Mr. Geoffrion did in this
matter: but this kind of work is the cheapest
cf legal work.
For anyhody te talk of
agreeing te pay $50,000 in a lump and $15,000
a year for three years for that kind of humdrum work is an affront te the commen
sense and intelligence of Parliament. If Mr.
Sweezey had neyer given evidence, if Mr.
Ebbs had neyer given evidence, if Senator
Haydon had neyer given evidence, none of us
would think of any business man making a
bargain of that sort. The work that was to
be done would neyer have had te be done
if the Order in Council had flot been passed.
The inherent facts tell against sucli a proposition, and they are more powerful than
the interpretation given by any witness. The
basic, outstanding, protruding facts, which you
cannet lose siglit cf if you try, just scream
against Senator Haydon. I sheuld like te
appeal to the honourable senator from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Ayleswortb), if lie were
here, and ask bim if in ah bhis experience
he ever knew cf any bargain for legal fees
comparable with that. Why, it neyer was
made. There was ne reason whatever for a
bargain, save on the basis cf the passing of
the Order in Council.
Furtbermore. the work, when it came te be
donc, lied te be donc because the Order in
Council was passed, and the evidence shows
that ail the work that amounted to anything
even then was donc by a firm in Montreal and
a firm in Toronto. The position of this ficm
was that of intermediary, largely that of an
agent. I do net appeal te honeurable gentlemen te exercise anything but cemmon sense
and reason. Does any honourable gentleman
believe that these fees were te be paid whethier
Order in Council No. 422 passed or net?
Then, if we have adimitted-and, I hope
everybody in bie heart has admnitted--ith-at ne

before the -people of this country and, tell them
that Senaiter Haydon is an honourable man,
and that therefore we will not find that he

that Senaitor Haydon, when he gave that
evidence-ood it is te his credit--knew tihat
lic had donc wrong. He would net have given
eviden.ce of that character if he lied felt that
bis conduet was above sreproach.
1 do net read inte bais evidence something
that lie said and that the reporter did net
take dewn. I read within the four corners cf
the evidence taken tapon the twe occasions
when he gave bis testimeny, that he ws
ùvasivc-not onily was lic evasive, but he was
flippantay evasive and defiant. Eve-ry time lie
got a chance lie swung off the track inte a
byway, a political or a legal discussion. That
is always tlie method follewed te get away
from, facts--to get into somcthing else.
The right lionourable senator from. Eganville
(Riglit Hon. Mr. Graham) tcJIs us that it was
only when Senator Haydcn was pestcred, when
tlicy dreve and drove at him te find out if lic
had lied any conversation with Sweczey, that
he made bis most unfortunate statement. I
ask the riglit lionourable senator to read the
evidence again.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I heard it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Weld, lie will
net find that there. Senator Haydon is asked
twe or tliree times, and then Mr. Mann says,
"Wouldn't it be wcll if we were te adjourn
new and take a rest?7' Is that pestering?
Long before those questions were asked similar
tacties on Senator Hayden's part were adoptcd.
Senator Haydon is an intelligent man; lie
knew that lie had a reputation te proect and
neyer would have assumcd tlie attitude which
lie tock towards counsel and the committcc
had lie been sure that the course lie had
trodden was truc.
I come te the campaign funds. I said in

was no ground cf prejudice against any man;
that, on the contrary, it was insignia of confidence. I adhere to these words. I do not

in this long procession of events to place to

laid stes on the importance of something that
did not cxist. No one for a moment can
argue that it did exist. Therefore, Senator
McDougald in this regaird neyer actcd against
bis o\xn intcrests.
Thc report of the N.'ational Adx isory Committee reeommended, for the most part, that
nothing shonld bc dlone for some time. I arn
not complaining about that. But the main
Ihing in the rep'ort of interest tien was the
recoriin uda t on t bat the developmient slîould
be by pri\ ate botcresta in the national section,
and that power should be used to pay for the
ennalization. Was Sonator McDougýald interesteîl in that? H1e wmathe man who held the

the committre wvere flot guilty of any prejudice against him. If there was any doulit,
they certainly gave bim the benefit of it.
Let me relate some farts in support of my
statement. The first syndicate, whici Sweezey
formed in order to get tie money to push
foi'ward bis enterprise, owned the stock of tie
I3eaui Irnois Liglt, Heat and Powver Comnpany,
Limited. That syndirate bad what wvas calîrd
a management committer, and Sweezey sat in
a position of virtual control of the disposition
of its uijts. Very frankly in bis evidence
before both committees lie said, in effect, "I
wanted them to go wbere they would do gond,
wxhere they would holp me along in tbis enterprise." If lie had not said that, would it not
clearly lie truc anyway? He had some units,
Mr. Jones had some, and a nuimber of good
citizens had some.
Sweezey testifird that

tiat tlîey ought to get Senator

Mr. Sifton wvcnt to sec Senator McDougald
with a vi w to gctting him in. At this time
Mr. Sifton did not have a share allottcd to

initial steps through there. Moyer and Sifton
went to New York and were there on the
31st of March. Moyer Fwears that Winfield
Sifton gave him that day fifteen $1,000 bis
-15,000.
Be it noted that the price at which thcse
shares were allotted to Moyer, at Sifton's
request, was $30,000 for 800 shares; that is
$37.50 a share. The sum of $15,000 was then
paid by Sifton in bis in New York and put
to Moyer's credit at the Bank of Nova Scotia
ýon Wall Street. Moyer came back and on
the 4th of April, four or five days afterwards,
he issue.d his cheque in Montreal for $15,000
in payment of those units, against that $15,000
in New York.
1 ask honourable members to note the
secrecy that shrouded this whole transactiona trip te New York in order to pay 815,000,
and the payment in bis and flot by cheque.
On the 4th of April the cheque was issued
and it was cashed on thý 6th. Haif of the
$30,000 was then paid. On the l7th of May
the trail was again f.ollowed down to New
York, where Sifton gave Moyer another
$15,000, this time in the form of a draft, with
nothing to indicate who in the world provided
the draft. Moyer says he doce flot know. I
have no reason whatever to dispute the good
faith of Moyer's testimony, and I ask honourable members to note what he says. In effeet
he states, "In looking back on it now, I thin
the only reason Sifton wanted me to go to
New York was in order that there would be
no way of finding out where the money came
from." Remember he sayq only "I think."
But that shows what ie ini his mind.
The payment of 830,000 had 'Lhen been
made. What happened next? Senator MeDougaid sayýs that on the l8th of May, serieus
negotiations having been carried on for a
week previously, he decided to buy those
units that Sifton had. And he bought them.
In a space of twventy minutes $46,000 in bonds
was handcd over to Winfield Sifton. Again
the blinde were down. 0f that sum $30,000
was to cover the 330,000 that had already
been paid for the 800 units at 837.50 per unit,
and thie $16,000 was to apply on a subscriptien already nmade by Sifton for 1,600 more
units in the second syndicate.
1 ask honourable members to p'iy the closest
attention here, because te my mind there is
something that has not been fully appreciated,
even by the comnmittee. The units of the
first syndicate cost Mr. Sifton $37.50 each,
but on the 4th of April each unit became two
in the second syndicate. So he had 1,600
units for the &W0,000. Then he had the right
te buy 1,600 more of the second syndicate at
8100 each.

295

Win!field Sifton on the 1Oth day of May
elected to buy 1,600 units at'$lOO each, which
was equivalent to $200 each for the units of
the first syndicate. On the lSth of Mvay he
sold the same units to Senator MoDIougald
for $37.50. Is that explainable? Winfield
Sifton, who on the lOth of May regarded it
a privilege to buy units at $200 each-keeping in mindi what 1 said about each unit of
the ýfirst syndicate being equivalent to two of
the second-was ready te sdil andi did seil
them to Senator McDougald for $37.50 each
on the lSth of May.
If what Senator McDou.gaid says is
correct, then only one conclusion je possible. It f ollows that Winfield Sifton must
have been a simpleton. And he was not.
Winfield Sifiton was one osf the brighteet young
men of bhis târne. He knew businees. He had
run the gamut osf apecu1lation. He knew that
nothing on etarbh ocurred between the lOth
and 18th, or for moubhs csf margin on either
skie, te diminish the value of those âhare.
On the contrary, on the 27tth of April the
Order in Council hiad gone through mt Quebec, that being the first milestone in the long
transit of this company. Are we to believe
bhat ýhe who decided on the lOth thait a firet
syndficate unit was worth S20 wes ready on
the 18th to sei units he bought at that price
for $37.50 apiece? Such things are irrational.
I venture to suggest te honourable members
of this House that if that fact stood naked
and alone, no man who knew Winfield Sifton
could possibly reconcile the words of Senator
McDougald with candour and with truth.
But herm is a f.urther reflection: if Sifton
haýd owned the units would the-re n-ot be somne
record of their receipit or of their saýle? If
he paid with bis own m.oney the $15,000 on tihe
3lst of March, and another $15,000 on the l7th
of May, would there not be some cheques
againat bis account? Would there flot be
some deductions somnewhere by which those
payments would be reveaied?
Winfield Sifton died on the 13th of June.
His executor teok the box and in the frankest
possible way saici that they had searched hie
records, edhey had bis bank aocount, and they
cou.ld find -only one, and Vihey could flot find in
bis who]e eetarte the receipt osf a isingle bond
at aIl, net for monrths back, f-or record csf a
cheque of anything like this size, andi could
find no mnoney the proceedis csf bondes. It
may be, says mne one, that he heki for
another; ýpoesi'bly for bis fatiher, who was then
aknve. His father was a very able man of
business. If his fafther was the real owner,
does any human being suggest tha-t what he
elerted was worth $200 on the 1Oth of May
he would selI for $37.50 on the 18th?

SENATE

Jones, the same as Hon. W. G. Mitohell, tihe
same as Senator Raymond; but not the same
as others.
Do not take from my words that I am criticizing him because he bought more cheaply
than his fellows. Thatt is not the reason at all,
but 1e did not pay the same as others; he
paid the same as only two or three, even for
the 1,600 shares. As for the other 1,600, subscribed for by Winfield Sifton (according to
bis story), they were taken over by him and
Be subscribed for them. For those Be paid
the sane as otihens paid. That makes 3,200.
Then there are the 2,000 Sterling shares. Did
he pay the sarne for them as every other
member paid for his syndicate shares? Did
he? All Be ever paid for them was $3,500nearly nothing. The Sterling Company was
turned over at the 2,000 shares, and Be got
the 2.000 shares for that. Yet Be stood in this
House and said Be paid the sane for his shares
as every other member of the syndicate.
These 2.000 shares, we must remember, Be
held for Mr. Henry as well as himself.
When he is reminded in the box about the
Sterling shares he says: " Oh, I was not thinking of the Sterling shares. Neither was the
public." Why, certainl' the public was net;
the public never had heard of the Sterling
Company. 'Certainly the public was not. But
should not Be have thought of those Sterling
shares when he spoke of his shares? They
were his. He was the owner of 5,200 shares;
most of them, a lot more than two-thirds of
thern, Be got for a fraction of what others
paid; yet he dares to stand up and say that
he paid the sane price as the rest, because,
forsooth, Be was net thinking about the 2 000
of them at all, and because 800 had been
bought in the form of shares in the first syndi c te.
J do not like to take advantage of my position as against a iember sitting down, but
doe- the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) think that
that was an honest answer? It was just a
quibble for him to assert that Be got no
favours in any shape or form. When he made
that answer. his conduct was net in harrmony
with either candour or truth.
I now come to his conncotion with the Sterlier Industrial Corporation, whose shares were
"imergeud." to use the language of the right
honourable senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham). in the Beauharnois Company. I do not care what yen call it-a merger,
an amalgamation, a sale. It does net matter
ai all. Like a rose, by any other name it
would snell as sweet. I am concerned with the
facts and the history of the Sterling Industrial
Corporation in relation to the conduct of
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Senator McDougald. On the 5th of July, 1924,
that company put in its application to the
Department of Railways, and on the 7th of
July to the Department of Publie Works.
From that time on it leaves those applications
dormant, bocause it was not ready to proceed.
Some investigations were made through an
engine'er, for which not more than $3,500 was
paid.
There was the financial situation to be
consi.dered, and the possibility of getting
money for this work. At all stages Senator
McDougald is kept in view. Senator Haydon
went to New York for his Sterling Company
in December of 1925. In April of 1925 Be had
a conference with Senator McDougald about it,
and Be had another conference about it in
The evidence is literally
December, 1926.
strewn with conferences with Senator MoDougald about this company.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does my right
honourable friend say that Mr. Haydon, or
Mr. Henry, went to New York?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Hay.don.
Does the right honourable gentleman want the
reference?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Oh, no.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He took an
active interest in the concern all through.
Then, in 1928, Mr. Sweezey, finding that there
is an obstacle, or believing that there is some
obstacle in the way of his success at Ottawa,
searches around to find out where it is. He is
mystified, and does not know what to do to
get Bis application through. He employs
Colonel Thompson, Mr. Ainslie Green, Mr.
Pugsley, Mr. McLaughlin; Be keeps these men
busy "creating atmosphere" in his struggle to
get this approval through Council. But still
he cannot succeed.
Then Be finds out about this Sterling Industrial Corporation. What does he find
about it? He finds that it has nothing, no
asses, not a pen nib. He also finds that it is
owned by Senator MeDougald, or at ail
events that Senator McDougald owns it for
bimiself and another or others. He talks with
Senator McDougald about it, and also with
Mr. Henry and Senator HaydoA, who states.
what I have no reason to doubt, that Be is
merely its solicitor. Senator Haydon's firm
got its charter, presided legally over its birth,
and charged an account to it for some time.
After his talks with Senator Haydon and
Senator McDougald, Mr. Sweezey comes to
the conclusion that there is someone else
interested. He has not given even a hint,
or anything from which anybody could get

APRIL 28, 1932
a hint, who that was, but he tells us he got
the impression from Senators Haydon and
McDougald that there was someone else, and
that he or they, whoever they were, had
better be taken in and not overlooked.
The right honourable senator from Eganville
says that Sweezey made a deal fot Sterling with
Henry because he was anxious to get Henry.
I wonder what the right honourable senator
will think if I read him the evidence given
before the committee, which shows that ho
did not make the deal with Henry at all,
but made it with Senator McDougald. It is
Senator McDougald's evidence that I shall
read. It shows that he is the man who did
it, as of course he is. At page 160 of the
evidence honourable members will find the
following:
Q. Tbere is no doubt about this, that
irrespective of documents, the payment of 2,000
part interests for the five shares of Sterling
was the result of discussion between you and
Sweezey?-A. Yes.
That is a question put to Senator McDougald. Right through the evidence it is
shown that he is the man who made the deal,
and the reason given by Sweezey-a reason
which appeals to everybody, and which, indeed,
is not contradicted-is that he felt that there
was an influence against him somewhere, he
did not know where, and that he began to
think this was it, and wanted to remove
it. He says Sterling had a prior application.
But, he
Yes, it had a prior application.
adds, -it had nothing of any intrinsic value.
Two other companies had prior applications,
but, he says, "I didn't bother with them. The
reason I bothered here was that these were
responsible men. They might give me trouble;
they might even get the money and seriously
go on." Then he says, "The great reason
was that I wanted to get rid of the nuisance."
He told the committee that the only value
it had was a nuisance value, and Senator
McDougald said the same thing, and, what is
more, he said before the Commons committee
that that was all the value it had.
The evidence given by Senator McDougald
before the committee, at page 165, shows that
he could not tell the committee of any value
on earth which this concern had, except as a
nuisance. He controlled it and got its charter.
He was under some indefinite and unenforceable understanding, as the report words
it, to divide with Henry; but he was in ahHe, a senator of Canada,
solute control.
made use of his "nuisance" to enrich himself
at the expense of a public utility company in
process of formation.
I ask, bas a senator of Canada the right to
capitalize on a nuisance as against a company
absoiutedy deRpendent on concessions from

299

Governmen'ts, including the Government of
Canada, and then maintain that he can keep
his place in the Senate as an honourable public man?
Bef ore the Senate committee the senator said
that the great thing they got when they secured
the Sterling Industrial Corporation-and he
cannot tell of anything else they got-was
Mr. Henry. Mr. Henry, he says, was a fine
engineer, and they got him by buying the
Sterling Industrial Corporation. In a word, in
order to get Mr. Henry tbey had to buy a
nuisance from Mr. Henry and Senator MeDougald, at a price ultimately of $300,000 and
80,000 shares. They had to pay 2,000 units, or
about one-ninth of the issued oapital of their
whole enterprise, in order that by the purchase
of a nuisance they might get an engineer. They
paid Mr. Henry $40,000 a year, which was
more than twice what Henry had ever earned
in his 'life before, and he got a block of shares
besides, and they did not take him until some
time after the -nuisance was out of the road.
I do not see how a man who takes his fellow,man to be intelligent can stand up and
say that Sweezey had to buy the Sterling Industrial Corporation before he could get
Henry as an engineer. It is absurd, grotesque,
an affront to common sense. The Sterling Industrial Corporation was bought, aocording to
the evidence of Sweezey, because he thought
by buying it he could better advance his
interests in getting approval at Ottawa. That
does not really mean that he could. It is
why ho bought it. He may have been wrong.
It does not matter. Senator McDougald and
Senator Haydon persuaded him to buy it
with that object in mind, and that is established by the evidence without the sligbtest
possibility of contradiction.
Al these profits were accumulated along the
road, and every one of them was taken care
of out of money subsoribed by the public and
to be paid interest upon in rates. It may be
that a priva-te citizen bas a perfect right to
do some of these things. It is difficult to decide
just when a man is within the circle and just
when he is outside; but in the case of Senator
McDougald, a public servant and member of
this House, there is no question that he was
away outside its cireuniference. And what is
more, his whole conduct shows that he knew
it. Otherwise, why alil the concealment?
Nobody has ever given even a sensible
answer to tho question: Why was all this kept
under a curtain? Why all the trips to the ends
of the continent, over and over again, and all
the drafts and thousand-dollar bills, and agents
and sub-agents and sub-trustees? All these
things were totally unnecessary even if the
senator was anxious that others should not
follow his example. There was not a chance of

100

SENATE

others following his example even if Sifton had
given his choque. How would they know anything froin the fact that Sifton had given his
cheque? These reasons are afterthoughts; they
are useful only as showing the state of mind of
a man holding a high office in this country,
who knows that his conduct is inconsistent
with his position and does not want it revealed.
I ask honourable senators, while being
scrupulously careful not to do injustice to
one of tieir fellow-members by the passing
of this resolution, to be at least equally careful
to do no injustice to those who are our first
concern, the people whom we serve. Let us,
I beg of you, not be defiant to the long
established basic, fundamental rights of those
people in respect of their legislators. This
country is passing through trying times. These
are testing hours. Few are the homes in this
Dominion that are not now struggling in the
tremendous grip of economie forces. Questionings are abroad everywhere as to whether the
system under which we live will endure. Even
now while we speak the ;rstitutions of democracy are being held up to interrogation, and
iere are those who sometimes wonder whether
they will survive the storm. The public mind
is to-day more sensitive than at any time,
perhaps, within the memory of those who
are here. But whether the publie mind is
more sensitive or not, assuming that we act
as we would in normal days, can we face the
people of our country and proclaim to them
and before the world that the conduct of two
of our number is such as to be within the
right of every senator?
Are we going to place the seal of our
approbation upon such actions? If we vote
down this motion and say that their conduct
is not censurable and unbecoming. what are
th, people of Canada going to think of the
Senate? Yea, more, what are they going to
think of our institutions, one and all? If
confidence in parliamentary government is still
further reduced, if it is affected detrimentally
by our verdiet, it will b the responsibility
of every member of this Hoiuse, and a very
painful and lasting responsibility.
I do not comprehend how honourable members of this House can vo to put the seal of
approbation upon the conduct revealed b
evidence given before the committee of this
House. The responsibility of senators opposite
is just as direct, just as great; as that of
senators on this side of the louse. I should
lanent a party verdict on this question. I
should not like to sec honourable members on
this side vote their approval of such behaviour,
but I would rather see a divided conception
Right

Hon.

Mr.

MEIGHEN.

of dutv hee ihn that honourable senators
opposite, to a man, should vote against this
motion. A party verdict on this matter would
be a very serious thing. We do not want it.
Honourable senators must vote as driven by
their consciences, and I hope that no man, on
any side, will be driven by his conscience to
vote against this motion-the verdict of a
unanimously chosen committee of this House
and the unanimous verdict of a committee of
the other.
Surely we can remove this subject from the
sphere of party. I have not made this speech
from a party standpoint, and honourable members now know that to be truc. I have made
it because I shall be held accountable for the
conduct of the Government in relation to
this matter. I know that I shall be held personally responsible, and I am trying to discharge that personal responsibility to the
best of my power.
In closing, I want to say that not one atom,
not one element of antagonism has moved me
for a moment. The simple reason is that
such antagonism does not exist. I do not pretend to a higher sense of responsibility than
anybody else-I think I see the responsibility
more clearly, perhaps, than some-but I beg
honourable members, I implore them, as men
of intelligence and common sense, to read the
evidence over and over with the utmost care,
and I do not think that after having done so,
any honourable member will want to face the
people of Canada if he has declared by his
vote that the facts there revealed against our
fellow-members disclose a line of conduct
which under any sensible interpretation can
command the sanction of this House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Heur, hoar.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable members,
I feel that it is my duty to say a few words
to-night cn the question before theliHouse.
I join with my colleagues who form the
minority of the committee whose report we
are now considering, and I feel that I should
give some reasons why I am taking this position.
My honourable friend the chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Tanner), in moving
concurrence in this report, .commenced his
remarks in almost the same words, but not
with the same eloquence, that closed the
speech of the right honourable gentleman
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). He said
that he was not looking upon this matter
in any way, shape or forrm as one of party
polities. My honourable friend from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) said he had a painful
duty to perform. Well, I offer hirm my hearty

APRIL 28, 1932
congratulations upon carrying out that painfui duty with a great deal of pleasure, as was
îndicated by his remarks. I would remindJ
hum that a sugar-coated pili can contain a.much poison as one that is flot coated.
This is the first time that I1have seen party
polities make their s.ppearance in this Chamber. My honouraible friend from Pictou
asked who had brouglit about this condition
of affairs in the Senate? I will say ta hum
that the whole situation was brought befare
the people of this country as the resuit of a
statement made in -another place by Mr.
Gardiner, a member of Parliament for a
Western constituency. My honaurable friend
said that the Government of the day, of
which he is a supporter, was forced ta take
some action because of the charges made by
Mr. Gardiner. I should lik-e ta ask my honourable friend when the (party to, whicbh le
belongs has ever bei are taken advicc from
someane who is nat a memýber of the party,
as ta what should be done with regard ta an
important question. And my honourable
friend says that the Goveirnmcent ould nat
help takûing notice of the comsnents by the
press af the country on Mr. Gardiner's charges.
If I may digress briefly, I should like ta
ref er ta the attitude that the press sometimes
takes towards the public men ai auýr country.
I do nat wish ta say anything disrespectful
in this connection. After a long experience in
public luýe-I hesitate ta say how long-I
can anly say that 1 have always received
caurteaus treatinent irom. the press. But
sometimes I wonder whether aur newspapers
are justifled in making insinuations against
public men. I have said befare, and I repeat
now, that I think same public nmen in the
past have been parties ta the creation ai
suspicion in the minds of the people that
public men as a whole are tainted with saine
degree of dishonesty. I want ta say that in
my opinion the men who are in publie lufe,
wha represent canstituencies in Paria ment
and in provincial legislatures, are oi just as
high a chaxacter as any men who are an newspapers or in business lufe. A few days ago
the hanourable gentleman from Vancouver
(Han. Mr. McRae) presented a resolution with
regard ta radium, and within the next day or
iso a financial paper contained an article suggesting that the honourable gentleman had
aome personal object in view when he suggested that the Gavernment shauld contraI the
production ai radium in the Great Bear Lake
'jistrict. That innuenda was made, apparently,
because the honau-rable gentleman had been
înterestc d in certain mining operatians, and
it wss felt that he wanted ta benefit himself
thraugh Gaverninent contral of radium. It
is unnecessary ta say in this Chamber that

301

we aIl knaw the honourable mecuber brougit,
the subject ai radium ta auýr attention with
the very highest intentions. 1 submit, hanourable mnembers, that in such a case as that no
newspaper shauld insinuate that a public man
had-ta use a homely expression-an axe ta
grind.
My honaurable friend frain Pictou said that
the Gaverninent cauîd not refuse ta investigate the charges that were made by Mr.
Gardiner with reference fo Beauharnais. The
House ai Cammans had a perfect right ta
inquire ino the Beauharnois matter if it desired ta do sa, but I subinit that it had no
riglit ta appoint a cammittee ta investigate
the conduct ai honourable members of this
Chamber. The Beauharnois matter itself has
been discussed in the press, in Parliament. and
1 suppose in almast every household in the
Dominion, iand I have n douibt :that a great
rnany people are disgusted already wi-th the
discussions that we have had: ebout it.
My hanaurable friend said that we had been
too slow in dealing with this matter. He
said that in England the question wauld have
been settled in as many haurs as we tank
days. Whase fault was ît that we took the
time we did? My honaurable friend knows
that it xvas net possible to hold meetings af
the cammittee every day without interruption.
Some members had other duties ta perforin,
and at times wîtnesses were not available. It
will be remembered that we adjourned for
saine time ta await the appearance oi the
Han. Mr. Fergusan, the High Commissioner
at London. Everyone who heard the evidence
up ta that time knew that Mr. Ferguson
wauld nat give us any enlightenment. After
we had waited for lim for twa weeks, he
came and told us that lie had neyer taîked
t'a Sweezey aboubt the payment of $200,000.
Nabady ever suggested that he had spaken
ta Mr. Sweczey with regard ta that.
Naw I want ta refer ta what toak place
aiter the evidence was aIl in. The cammittee
were called together one rnorning for the purpase, as 1 understood it, af preparing a repart.
We went into the commiitee raam at haîf
past ten and the present long report was laid
an the table. Lt lad- been prepared: by the
,chairman -of the -commnittee, I presumie, thaough
lie probably had saine able assistance.
A
motion was made tiht we iconsider the report.
1 objected, that 1 lad, net had- an opqiartinity
ci seeing it, and then it was suggested that
we adjourn ta tweive ocWock. After saine
furth-er discussion it was arranged toa dj aura
until hulîf past twio in the afternaon. We
me again a-t that hour, and my honourable
iriend froin De Salaberry (Han. Mr. Béique)
said that he hsd been unable ta give propor
attention ta aIl thc evidence 'that had been

SENATE
adduced, and he asked for forty-eight hours
to give further consideration to it. The committee refused his request. They may have
been rigbt in doing that, but J want to say
that four members of that conmittee had no
opportunity of seeing one word of tha.t report
or of making a single suggestion as to what
the report should be. The report was laid on
the table in the conmittee room and we were
told to take it or leave it.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Will my honourable
friend alow me to interrupt him?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Ycs.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Is the honourable
member not aware that on the day previous
to the meeting of the committee a copy of the
report was handed to the honourable gentleman
from De Sa.laberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), with
a notation that the copy was for the consideration of himself and his colleagues? If he
did net take the honourable gentleman into
his confidence, that is not the fault of anyone
else.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: One copy for
four members.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I can say that I was not
aware of that fact until the morning that we
met to consider the report. And I learned
then that each of the other five members of
the commanittee had had an opportunity to
rad the report and study it. But four of us
had no opportanity to make any suggestion
concerning it. The report as presented that
morning has not been changed. That is one
reason why I say I do net think members of
the committee were treated properly.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Will my honourable friend not admit that the report was
placed in the hands of the honourable senator
from De Salaberry on a Wednesday? We met
on Thursday and we adjourned again until
Friday to gi ve members an opportunity of considering the report. If my honourable friend
had made any suggestions they certainly would
have been considered.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If my honourable friend
is through with his second speech, I will go on
and say a few more words. I realize that I
cannot go into a very close discussion of the
evidence without more or less repeating what
has already been said so ably by my right
honourabie friend from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Grabam). If I had not been a member of
the committee and had not strongly dissented
from the report, I should have been quite
content te say notbhing at the conclusion of
my right honourable friend's speech. lie

Hon. Mr. COPP.

cover ta cover of the evidence, in his very
eloquent way. Nevertheless, I feel that I
should take up the time of the House for a
ljttile while in making some further references
to the report.
May I at this point compliment the right
honourable leader of the House (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) upon his eloquent address? I
fully accept his word that in dealing with
this matter he bas been entirely free fron
politieal considerations, and I am very zlad
to hear that. A few years ago I had the
pleasure of listening ta him many times. I
enjoyed his arguments this evening, although
I was unable to agree with his conclusions.
The conmittee's report regarding Senator
McDougald is practically a repetition of the
House of Commons committee's report. Our
committee says "Yea, yea," and "Amen," and
that is virtially all we say. After labauring
for two months we simîply put on record our
approval of the report that was broughit in
by rie committee of the Hoise of Commons

lat

vear.

The report is divided into paragraphs. I
wilî take up first the section referring to
Senator McDougald. No objection can be
taken to the first six paragraphs of that
section, for they deal almost entirely with
facts concerning the different business interests,
and so on. in which the senator was engaged.
The seventh paragraph refers to the Sterling
Industriial Corporation. In the last day or
two we have heard a great deal about that
enneern. The riglit honourable leader devoted
con-idlerable time to it. and although I agree
with sone of his arguments, I disagree with
his conclusions. He and the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) would
male t appear that Senator McDougald was
the man who first thought of the Sterling
Corporation. But that is net the evidence, I
submit.
According to common report, Senator McDougall was a man of large business interests.
I did not become acquainted with him until
recent years, but I have no doubt that he has
been connected with important business transaction; during bis lifetinie. I think it was
in 1922 that he was appointed Chairman of the

brought Lim into contact with public men.
Mr. R. A. C. Henry says that he had a conversation with him, in which Senator McDougald said, "If you see any worthwhile
proposition at any time that requires financial
assistance for its development, I shall be glad
to finance you up to a certain amount." At
that time there was no mention at all of a
proposition concerning the development of

APRIL 28, 1932
power. Mr. Henry is a d'istinguiished engineer
-a man who stands àhjgh in lis profession. H1e
said he was induced to study the development
of power on the St. Lawrence river after readimg somne report. Then he made inquiries,
visited certain localities and realized. the olppo-tuni'ty that exiAted for developing power in
a certain section. Afterwards he told Dr. MeDougald about the matter. There was no
attemfpt Vo imystify anxibody, as t1he righýt honourable gentleman has su.ggested. On the contrary, everything was open and aibove board.
Hienry said he mad-e -this invetstigation,' and
'suggested Vto Dr. MoDougald th-at someîthing
might be done; and the D-octor advianoed hlm
$10.000 for the investigation, and it resulted
in the Siterling Industrial Corporation 'being
organized for oarrying on any business that
might eorne up in this ýconnectdon.
Now, 1 say -that Henry was 'the man who
started the Sterling. 11e went to MoGiverin,
Haydon an.d Ebbs and proposed ;to organize
a cormpany. W7hý? 11e went, there because
Senator McDoug-ald had so!me company or

Company, whicha he thought might he used,
but Henry su.ggested to Senatoir MecDougali

consulted the McGiverin firm and gave them
the f aots, and as ta resulit t.hey retported that

his eloqxuent way, has tried to put a veil of
nystery about it. As far as I am concerned,
I have not had connection with big business
transactions, but I am not surprised to learn
that thosie units were subscribed for by Mr.
Sifton and were transferred to Senator McDougald. I cannot see any great mystery in
regard to that.
My riglit honourable friend says that because Winfield Sifton went down to New York
and drew $15,000 in the name of Mr. Moyer
as trustee, there is great suspicion aroused
about that. I cannot sec why there should
be that suspicion. I do not sec that the fact
that lie wanted to do it in that way has any
business in this House. If I wanted to give
$15,000 to somebody and I went to New York
for the purpose, that would not be a matter
for Senate inquiry as to why I paid it in that
way. That does not appeal te me as being a
suspicious circurnstance, or as having any veil
of secrecy that should be used in this House
to convict Senator McDougald or any other
honourable gentleman of improper conduct as
a senator.
Yet that is what we are asked
to do.
Hon. Mr. COPP.

Now, there is a contradiction as to the
amount paid for those shares. While the
committee says there were suspicious circumstances, there was a difference in the
evidence given. In the House of Commons
committee Senator McDougald said that he
paid $30,000 for those shares, and $16,000 later
on. In our committee he said-and I think
it has been proven beyond a doubt-that he
paid to Sifton, in all, at one time, $46,000 in
bonds for those shares. If we are to assume
the suspicious circumstances suggested by my
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) we should believe that Senator McDougald gathered up $15,000 in cash and said
to Mr. Sifton, "You take Mr. Moyer and
go down to New York and place this $15,000
in the Bank of Nova Scotia, and within the
next day or two we shall have Moyer issue
a choque."
Hon. Mr. CORDON:
This is so funny
that I cannot belp asking this question.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

It may be funny to you.

Hon. Mr. CORDON: Do you think that
any kind of business man, or even a man
who is not a business man, would risk taking
$15,000 in bills in his pocket to New York
when he could go into a bank liere and get a
marked choque to take down?

mendations regarding development on the
north shore. That has been my impression
ever since I first heard about this matter some
months ago. My right honourable friend says
that the report does not make any such recommendation. As to that I cannot say. In
any event, the development that was talked
about has not gone on. As I undersand it,
that committee was considering the advisability of the canalization of the whole St.
Lawrence river, as well as the water-power
development.
Now may I say a word or two in regard to
the history of the Beauharnois organization?
As far as J reimember, from reading the reports, a company known as the Beauharnois
Light, Heat and Power Company was incorpomated under a statute of -the Quebec Legislature in 1902. There was nothing done, I
thinýk, until 1927, when Mr. Sweezey 'came into
the picture and his company acquired the
rights of the Robert family. Mr. Sweezey was
apparently a man of vision, ability and imeans,
and he becaie intercsted in the development
of power at tihat particular part of the St.
Lawrence river. He secured an option on the
righlts of the Robert family in the company
organized in 1902. I have no doubt that after
he got the option lie was in communication
with the men who he hoped would assist him
in financing the proposed .development. One
man that he spoke of was Mr. Frank P.
Jones, a financial man with an almost worldwide reputation. He got .to work on a scheme
to raise money to develop this project. Mr.
Jones went to Senator Raymond-apparently
they were cilose friend.s-and told him, according to Senator Raymond's statement, that he
was taking an interest in this development,
and asked whether Senator Raymond would
like to cone in. Senator Raymond said that
he would put in $30.000.
Jones and Sweezey carried on their negotiations for some period of time, and finally
got down to the formation of the first Beauharnois .yndicate. I think about twenty persons
were inýterested in it, including Senator Raymond, who paid his mioney and took an interest in tIhis enterpnise solely on the suggestion of Mr. Jones.
Subsequenitly Jones and Sweezey were unable to continue -to carry on the work together
and an arrangement was made whereby one
of them said. "I wiill take so much and we
will part company." Mr. Jones was the one
who sold out, and when he sold ont Senator
Raymond also sold out, and made a certain amount of mroney on the transaction. I
do not feel that I should point the finger of
scorn at Senator Raymond, or that as a member of this House I am being debauched beion.

Mr. COPP.

cause he made a few hundred thousand dollars that I could not have made; and I say
te my right honourable friend who asked
whbether there was an honourable ýmember who
would not like to take the place of the senator,
that if I had the opportunity of ge'tting into
a company awhere I could clean up 500,000
as elasily as that, I would give it very serions
thou ght.
Senator McDougald was not in the first
syndicate. He came into the second syndicate
along with the other members of it, and made
some monm'. I want te point out to honourable members that this was net a public
utility according to the general acceptation
of that terni. This would have become a
public utility if the Province of Quebec had
seen fit to develop it. But the Province of
Quebec, through Premier Taschereau, said
that it had no intention of developing this
power. It said: "We do not believe in public
development, but we will sell you or lease
yen the right to develop it for a term of
years at a certain price per year." MY honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and my right honourable friend the
leader of the Government (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) speak of public money. I say that
this was not public money. Publie monev is
Government money, money coming out of
the Government or ont of the people.
I should like to ask the honourable member
from Pictou, and even my right bonourable
friend the leader of the Government in this
House, when they became the guardian angels
Df the widows and orphans in this country. Is
there any honourable gentleman in this
House who, having been connected vith a
corporation or ceompany, when there has been
a reorganization, and water poured into the
company, has not been forced to go without
dividends because dividends could net b
paid on the increased capital brought about
by the reorganization? What is truc of this
is true of other corporations, as everybody
aeil knows. I should like to ask m'y bonourable friend froro Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), wbo has the great responsibility of caring for the honour and dignity of this House.
if lie would support an investigation to ascertain whether there are other honourable members of this Chamber interested in companies
that have sold stock at prices which cannot
now be realized for it? It is truc the Beauharnois Company sold bonds, and that some
of the proceeds enriched some honourable
members of this Chamber, but that was done
in a perfectly legitimate and honest wa.
If
I buy a security for $100 and sell it for $500,
why should I bother about whose money

APRIL 28, 1932

pays for the security? The people who buy
it have every chance to investigate the assets
behind it and to satisfy themselves in this
regard. I do not think it is the duty of a
senator to act as the trustee or guardian of
people who buy stock.
Enthusiastic claims may be made on behalf
of certain stocks, and people may be induced
by those claims to invest their money. But
that sort of thing- has been done ever since
companies issued stocks, and it will be done
for generations to come. I do not feel that
the time has arrived when I can say te a colileague, "You have been more successful than
I have, and you are not fit to sit in this
House." Though sitting on this side of the
Chamber with honourable members against
whom the committee has reported, I feel that
my reputattion-what little I have left-and
my honour are just as safe as they would be
if I were sitting with honourable mermbers
who occupy the other side.
I told my colleagues on the committee that
I could not agree with the report. I said that
in my opinion it was founded largely upon
suspicion and not upon evidence. The right
honourable leader has said he hopes that when
we come to vote on the motion we shall banish
politics from our minds, and not look upon the
matter as a party measure. I shall not vote
on it as a party measure. But I shall vote in
the light of my conviction that the three
senators mentioned in the report are not guilty
of the charges-I do not like that word, but
it has been commonly used-are not guilty
of the charges levelled against them. I believe
they have given complete answer to those
charges.
May I say a word or two with regard to
campaign funds? I am very glad that the
right honourable leader agrees with us on this
side of the House that there is no particular
odium attached to the collection of campaign
funds, if it is done in a right and proper
manner. I have no doubt that every member
of this Chamber and of the House of Commons
would agree with that. Two of the senators
who are mentioned in this report are charged
with having been collectors of campaign funds.
Now, it has been admitted that campaign
funds are a necessity. No one will dispute that.
I am not going to be hypocritical, nor plead
ignorance of campaign funds. On a number
of occasions I have been a recipient of campaign funds, and I have also contributed in a
small way. I am not ashamed of that. I do
not think there is anything in that inconsistent
with my position as a senator. For that reason
I cannot see why any blame should be attached
to other senators for having collected campaign
funds.
41767-201

The right honourable leader also agreeshe did not say this in so many words, but I
think we may draw the inference-that if we
are to have campaign funds we must have
someone te handle them. Are they to be
placed in the hands of-if I may use a slang
expression-some rough-neck or bootlegger?
Or should they be in charge of someone of
financial standing, integrity and honesty, who
would give assurance that the money collected
would be expended legitimately in the channels
for which it was intended? I think we all
agree that campaign funds should be handled
by men of this kind. That being se, is there
any reason why a senator should not be a
trustee of campaign funds? If it is considered
beneath the dignity of a senator to act in
that capacity, then we shoudd have a rule te
guide us in the future. I am disclosing no
secrets when I say that on both sides of this
Chaamber are honourable gentlemen who have
collected campaign funds. As I say, if we
want te prevent anything of that kind in the
future, let us do so. I am prepared te support
a rule along that line.
I want te make some references now te my
friend Senator Haydon. If I had the
vocabulary of a Webster I could net express
my thoughts with regard te Senator Haydon
more 'clearly than they were expressed by my
colileague from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) this aLternoon. I have known Senator Haydon intirmately for the past seventeen
years, ever since I first 'came te Ottawa as a
member of Parliiamfent; and I was acquainted
with him before that, for hie lad previously
done some ageney work for me here. I have
listened te and read the evidence carefully, and
for the life of me I cannot bring myself te beieve that there was anything improper about
the acceptance of the retainer by Senator Haydon's firm in connecition with the Beauharnois
matter. I admit that it was a large retainer,
but I cannot believe that it was paid for the
reason that has been suggested by some honourable members opposite. As a matter of
facot, I could hardly force myself ýto believe
that any honourable menber ef this House
who had taken a retwiner would go into the
witness box and perjure himself with regard te
the reason for which he was paid. I can
understand a man who is under a serious
'charge in a court of la:w colouring a story in
an endeavour te save himnelf from a penitentiary term, or fron the gallows, but I cannot conceive that anyone ocupying any responsible position in this country-whether he
be a merchant, doctor, lawyer, member of
Parliament, or senator-would make an untrue statement under oath in connection with
a proceeding of the kind that we had here.

SENATE
The right honourable leader of the House
stressed the contention that it was Senator
Haydon's firm that received the retainer. At
the time the retainer vas paid the late Mr.
McGiverin was head of the firm. For many
years he was a parliamentary agent here, retained by large companies, and Mr. Sweezey
went to 1im in the first place. Mr. McGiverin
then said that he had been retained by some
other conpany and was not in a position to
state definitely whether he could act for Beauharnois. But some time later ho stated that he
was free to accept a retainer.
Then the
amount of the retainer was discussed. It was
natural that Mr. Sweezey should be desirous
of obtaining the legal services at as reasonably low a figure as possible, but finally the
figure of $50,000 was agreed upon, with additional annual payments of $15,000 for three
years. I do not know whether the right honourabile gentleman bas been engaged in the
practice of Law in a large way recently, but if
he has he must know that a fee of 50,000 is
not unusual. For a counsel like Mr. W. N.
Tilley, $100.000 is a mere bagatelle as a fee in
some of the big cases with which he is connected.
The same thing is truc of Mr.
Geoffrion.
The right honourable leader says tiat the
retainer was paid for no other purpose than
for services in assisting to get Order in Council No. 422 passed. Well, Mr. Sweezey may
have retained .this firm for the purpose of
getting some assistance in that connection.
I have no doubt :that when Mr. Sweezey
retained a number of lawyers at Ottawa he
did so with the intention of getting all the
assistance they could give him along any lino
that would be beneficial to his company. That
would be only natural. Any man who retains
an attorney to carry on business for him buys
his time, his influence, his ability. The right
honourable leader of the House says that the
retainer of $50,000 would not have been paid
if the Order in Counciýl had not been granted.
But there is nothing very strànge about that,
for unless the Order in Council were passed
the company could not carry on and it would
net have enough money te pay such a retainer.
Every lawyer who receives a retainer uses
his influence on behalf of his client, whether
in a business transaction or in a court of law.
For instance, everyone knows that lawyers
seek to influence juries. And there is nothing
improper about that.
Similarly, I submit
there was nothing improper in the attempt
of lawyers to exercise influence on behalf of
Mr. Sweezey or his company. The right honourable gentleman, referring to the statement
Hon.

Mr. COPP.

that they were employed te create an atmosphere, said that they should be perfumers
instead of lawyers. Well, I say to my right
honourable friend tthat he was diffusing an obnoxious perfume when he made various statements that were net supported by evidence.
Senator Haydon said on oath that he did
net try to influence a single member of the
Cabinet-that he never went near the Cabinet.
I want to join with my right honourable
friend from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) in expressing the belief t-hat no man,
having held such a position as Senaitor Haydon has held in the past, and rcabizing himself to be in such a -condition as Senator Havdon is in at present, would kiss the Holy
Evangel, take his oath, and perjure himself in
regard to this matter. I cannot believe it, and
I will not say by my vote hat I do believe it.
It hais been said that certain people were
retained and paid to tise their influence with
the Government. Those people went into the
witness box and said that this was not se. If
the commitcee wanted any real evidence in
regard to the matter, instead of relying on
these suspicious circuîmstances which have
been woven around all this evidence, they
could have secured it. On the contrary, the
people of this country are blinded by a veil
of suspicion or doubt so that some one may
reaip a benefit in a way that J do not want to
mention to-night. With whom was the influience referred te used? The Order in Couincil was passed by the Cabinet of this country.
This being se, the only ones who coi'd lbe
influenced in regard te the passa-ge of the
Order in Council, or the approval of the p!an
of construction, would be the mnembers of the
Cabinet. Practi-cally every one of those gentlemen is in Ottawa, and if positive evidenlee had
been wanited as to whether they had been influeneed or net, all, that was necessary was to
calil them and ask whether Senator Haydon,
Mr. Greene, Colonel Thompson, or any of those
men had tried to use influence. Every one of
the gentlemen I have named went into the
witness box and said that he had net done se.
One out-tanding witness, Mr. Ceoffrion, the
leauding coun-el for the Beauhamois Company.
said that there was no necessity for political
influine. He .apent a year or two getting the
l i<lation and the lease from the Province
of Quebec. Thatl was accomplished, subject to
the condition that it muet recedve the approval
of the Governor in Council within one year.
Then Mr. Geoffrion came to Ottawa. What
vas his evidence? Is the-e a man in this
Hoiuse, knowing Aimé Geoffrion-a gentleman

went inbo 'the witness box and perjured hiruself -to save Vhema fromn the charges of an irresponsiible coêmmittee of the Bouse of Coinmons? I say it is impossible. Mr. Geoffrion
mvas ýcai.ed here, I thin'k, by the honourable
rneanbcr froni De Salaberry (Bon. Mr.
Béique). Whe'n he ws.s examined every item
charges for work in the Province of
of hi.ý3
Quebec, as well as here, was brought te bis
attention. Wiiat was bis e'videnice? It was
that this was an engineering mnatter; that he
came here and saw the- engineers, and that
influence was net necessary. As it was a matter of engineering, tihe engineers of the department ajpproved anid recommrended the
plans. After the plane we*re ap.proveýd, Mr.
Geoffrion said, it became a legal matter. The
Governrent could net refuse after the plans
hA been npproved by the engineers. Mr.
Geoffrion was so sure of bais ground that
although. a great naany conditions were put
,into the Order in Couricil, hie agreed in advance to any furthe-r conditions that niight bo
im4posed. What botter evidence could there
be that there was no need of influence, no
question of inifluence, and that the fact that
-these men were retain-ed to carry on somne of
the work in connection wth this company was
ii-t a .suspicious cir<cum-stance?
What took place when the application came
before the -Cabinet? First of ail, it was ref erred' 'tr a subcomitýtee of the Cabinet and
there was an investigation. There were ten
or eleven other companies protesting, whicha
was all the more reason why the Government
should make a very minute inquiry. That was
done, and no man who has read the Order in
Council passeil at that time, and studied all
the conditions that were imposed, can have
any reasonable suspicion. By that I do not
mean to say that a man- cannot think otherwise than I do without going against his
conscience. I realize that in questions such
as this, even if there had not been the slightest taint of politics, there might be some little
difference of opinion in regard to the evidence.
We find the samne thing in our law courts.
Judges differ in regard to cases that corne before them. But I say to my hônourable friends
on both sides of the Bouse, and to the people
of this country who are interested in this
matter, that after bearing and readîng the
evidence and considering it, and reading and
considering the evidence adduced before the
committee of the Bouse of Commons, I have
no conscientieus seniples, ne doubt as to what
is rny duty in regard to my fellow senators
who stand charged by a comrnittee of the
Bouse of Commons with imprepriety and conduet unbecoming a senator.

309

The Senate Chamber or any other representative body is only as high morally as the
men who compose it. I do net feeil ±that I arn
in a position to say for myseif that I arn any
better than any of my colleagues. I do not
think it lies in the power, in the mind, or
ixi the right of any honourable gentleman on
the other side of the Bouse to accuse me of
not being conscientious in regard to my
vote on this question-just as conscientious
as I ever wvas in any act of my life.
I feel that my honourable friends opposite
have been more or less misled by those suspicious circumstances and mystery that were.
brought up in the first committee in theBlouse of Comnions. The report in different.
places speaks about matters strongly suspiejous, with a view to creating a certain doubt
in the minds of honourable members.
I ar n ft here to express my views or my
hopes in any doubtful way. I believe these
senators are men of integrity, men of honesty
as far as bonesty goes in human mortals today. I believe they are entitled to fair consideration, and I believe that this House and
this counTuy feel that the proper means should
be taken to show that this report of the comnmittee of the Bouse of Commons was a
biased one, one nlot based on facts, one not
giving more than one side, that its conclusions
were prompted by one attitude, and that was;
the view expressed only a few days ago by a
man of h.igh position in this country, indicating that the purpose was to get clear of these
three senators without any reasonable suspicion or any good reason why they should be
charged, or be brought before tbe bar of this
Bouse, or criticized in any way for their
actions.
I have spoke-n longer than I intended, honourable gentlemen, but 1 desired to give my
views in regard to the question and to state,
the reason why I arn opposing concurrence in
this report as brought in by the chairman of
the cemmittee yesterday.
Bon. Mr. LYNCB-STAUNTON: I beg to
move the adjournment of the debate to the
next sitting of the Bouse.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGBEN: Before that
motion is put I move that when the Bouse
resumes, this subi ect be given the flrst place
iii the Orders of the Day.
The motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meiglien
was agreed to.
On motion of Bon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton,
the debate was adjourned.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMIII'EE

The Senate resurned frorn ycsterday the
adjourned debate on tbe motion of Hon. Mr.

Tanner for concurrence in the report of the
special comnrittee appointed for the pus'posc

of laking into consideration the repoct ofa

leader of the Bouse, and personally I should
like to sec what it was hie said.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The honourable gentleman will be able to sec it. I presume
hie intends to speak. We will certainly continue
until the honourable gentleman has a chance
to see the report before hie makes lis speech.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:- I arn not worrying
about that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know
what it is, then.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The worry is this:
We have before us, as has been said, one of
,the most important questions that have ever
corne hefore this body, and yesterday a very
extensive and lucid stat;ement was made hy
the right honourable the leader of the Bouse.
Some of us understood him to say sornething
that, to, our minds, ia entirely contrary to law,
julstice and the usual practice. 1 for one want
to see whether hie said that, hecause I arn
assuming that if he did hie is backed by those
who, sit behind bim,.

An Hon. SENATOR: Order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We should have that
hefore us. I should like, of course, to hear the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), but let us sec what the
right honourable the leader said.

Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wvill go this no partisan feeling in this case. If one of my
far: I think it would be a very serious prc- bonourabie fricnds on either side were to stand
cedent not to proceed with the debate because
up in this Bouse and, say that hie 'had no par-

special comittee of the Bouse of Comsnons,
of the last session thereof, to inveEttgate the
Beaubarnois Power Project, in so far as i
relates to any honourable members of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I hope the right

Hansard may not be out. The debate is
going to continue at somne length, and, while
I have no idea wben Hansard will corne,
it should be out by this tirne. I arn not
going to be at all obstinate with the bonourable leader opposite with respect Vo the continuance of the debate. I do not care wbat
our understanding was. If bie says that it
would not be fair to close the discussion Vonight. I arn going to yield to bis request.
However, I expect Hansard any minute, and
I do not think we sbould delay this Bouse
wben everyone bas heard the speech. I do
not believe the honourable member thinks I
arn quite foolish enough to make a staternent
of the kind hie refers to.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We listcned Vo the
speech of the rigbt bonourable gentleman,
whose words we wcigb very carefully, realizing that bie knows what hie is talking about as

tisan feeling, I would believe him, and 1 ask
thein to accord the saine*eourtesy to me.
I think that some honourable members have
a misapprehiension of the position of the Senate
in re~gard to this motion. One of the honourahie
members said to me that a court would not
convict on this evidence. That indicated to

rny mind that

the

bonourable

gentleman

tbought it necessary that these senators should
be charged with a crime, or that the airn of the
investigation sbould be to ascertain whether or
not they had 'been guilty of any crime against
the law of Canada. That is cntirely a misappre-

hension.

We are not necessarily trying to

ascertain whether or not these gentlemen have
been guilty of a crime.
The Parliament of Canada is the high court
of record, and each of its branches has absolute jurisdiction over its members. I confess
I was very rnuch surprised when, delving into

Ji2

APRIL 29, 1932
when hie says that hae resents the attempt of
a committee of the House of Commans to
try ta censure any member of the Senate. If
a senator lias been guilty of a breach of
privilege of the flouse of Commons, then hie
is, like any other -citizen, iable ta be ba'l'ed
bèf are the Commons for trial, and if that
flouse deems it necessary he may be censured
or punished. I have flot considered whether or
flot the three honourable gentlemen concerned
were guilty of any breacli of privilega of the
flou:se of Commons, 'because it is manifest
that flouse ivets not pretend that the three
senators were gutilty of any such thing, or it
wvouId n'ait have sent its report over ta us for
furt.her action. Therefore, in sa far as the Coinmons 'com'mittee presuenned to, centsure the senators, I resent tits acotion. I .contsider, though,
that every legislative body in this country, and
indeed every citizen of this counutry, have the
i-ight ta draw our attention to. any alleged
irupraprie-ties an the part of senators and ask
us ta inquire into, the matter, and discipline
the senatars concerned if we shoulc' carne ta
the conclusion that su'ch treatimient, is rnerited.
It is a common thing for the flouse of
Commons in England ta impeach memibers of
the flouse of Lords. The flouse of Cammons
in England hias the clear right ta exhibit
articles of impeachment in the flouse of Lards.
I think it f ollows that the flousa of Commans
of Canada hias the right ta exhibit to us coinplaint against the conduct of any of aur members. But that flouse has fia right ta try any
senatar. It bias no right ta try or ta censure
anyane who is not a mnember of that flouse, for
any crime, misdemeanour or misccnduct,
excepting, of course, any persan who bias been
guilty of a breach of privilege of, that flouse.
In deciding how ta cast my vote I shaiH rely
not upon contradictory evidence, but upon
admissions of charges madle. Senator M.cDaugald
admits that hae made a trip ta Bermuda andi
chargeci up the expenses of that trip ta the
Beauharnais Power Corparatian. fie bias not
shown that hae had any right ta <la that, for
hae dici not say bce was on afficial 'business of the
company in Bermuda, andi I think I amn making
only a milci statemant when I say that in bis
action hae Nas guilty of conduct unbecoming a
gentleman and a senatar. Senator McDougald
was subpoc.nac'd before the Hause of Commons
committee. Ha admits that ha retained counsel
for bis personail defence. fie ad-mits that
during the sittings of that cammittee hae was
attending sittings6 of this flouse. Hie admits
that hae ebargeci up ta the Beauharnois Power
Corporation, and caused ta ha paid by that
concern, bis caunsel fee and bill for board while
hae was in this city in connectian with that
cornmittee's sittings. Hie gives fia autharity,

313:

and hae cannot give any, for the appropriationi
of funcis of that; corporation ta pay those billsI conclude-but I do flot ask anyone ta act on.
my conclusion-that Senator McDougald'&
conduct with respect ta those bills was unhbecoming a gentleman and a senator, ta say the
least.
Senatar McDougalci was the President of the.
Beauharnois Powa'r Corporation. That corporation launched a prospectus on the publie
of this country, calling for subsarîptions ta.
$30,000,000 of bonds. In my opinion that
prospectus is fromn beginning ta encd a muisreprasentation, and, I may say, fraududent. It
is not fraudulent in law, be-cause 'hacan find in.
the Companies Act an excuse for everything
hae lias clone; but hae cannot find an excuse in
a court of honour or of maraIs. T'hat cor-poration's directoraîte, of which lie was a mamu
ber, gave ta Newman, Sweezey and Company
and the Dominion Securiities Company 83,-000,000 of that; money and paid aven ta the
Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company,
Limiteci, only $22,500,000. N'a ane who reads
the prospectus eau gainsay that it indicates.
the money was ta be provided for the building
of the great Beauhanois enterprise. The agreement madle with the Beauharnois Light, fleatand Power Company, Limnited, was not dis-closad propenly in the prospectus. The agreement provîdaci that out of the proceeds ofthose bonds $22,500,000 should be lent ta the
Beauharnoris Lighýt, fleat and Power Company,
and that out of that $22,500,000 the sum of$4,000,000 shoulci be paici ta the syndicataflan. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot want,
to intcrruipt mry honourable friand nea'dlassly,
but I wouid point out 'ta him ýthat, if my
memoiry serves me Tightly, this matter doesý
flot faîl undonr 'the reiferen.ce to the Senate comn-mitte ani was nat investigaited by that, comnmittee.
I will
flan. Mr. LYNCU-STAUNTON:
accept the honouiable gentilaman's statemaent.
If ià does not faîl wit.hin, the Teference I shaîl

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The chairman ofthe eoinmittae is not in the flousa at the
moment, andi paerhaps I shall he peirmitted tasay that I tbink 'the matter referrei' ta by the
honouraible gentleman frcmn Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lyncli-Staunton) was taken up by theflousa of Commons .cammi'ttee and was maclepart of the -record of the Sanata committee.

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: I 'think the
point taken by my honourable friend from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is that the
matter now under discussion has no reference
to any of the three senators. Is that the point?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will the honourable gentleman read that?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I want to
be punctilious about this. If the matter is not
clearly within the order of reference I do not
want to discuss it. I willl read the order of
reference:
Ordered, that the following Senators, namely:

Comniittee appointed for the purpose of taking
into consideration the Report of the Speeial
Conunittee of the House of Cotmmons, of the
last Session thercof, to investigate the Beauharnois Power Project. in so far as the said
Report relates to any Honotrable Members of
the Senate, and that the said Committee be

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
say?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAN'D: My honourable
frind will have to find in the House of Commons committee's report, which was referred
to the Senate, a ýreference to the prospectus
as an element to be inquired into.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: I submit that the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton is perfectly in order, because Senator McDougald
was interested in the company at the time
to whieh the honourable gentleman is alludinz.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does my
lonouiralble friend still insist that I am ont
of orer?

J-on. Mr. DANDURAND:
I surelv must
insist, because this matter was not referred
to the Senate commitie. No accusation was
made against Senator McDougald with regard
to the prospectus, and that subject was not
inquired into. Therefore he had no opporlunitv to disprove anv accusation that is now
made in that connection.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH.STAUNTON: Well, all
I can say is that he is lucky. I will give him
the benefit of the doubt.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable senators,
the House of Commons report, which is
included in the report now before this
House, distinctly includes references to the
agreement which the honourable gentleman
from Hamilton is discussing.

At this sae meeting, according to the

my honourable friend is referring.
-dated
the 31st October, 1929, between Beauharnois Power Corporation, Limited, of the first
part and Newman, Sweezey & Company,

creation and issue of thirty-year 6 per cent
collateral trust sinking fend bonds of the

Hon. Mr. DANDIURAND:
But the honourable gentleman froi
Hamilton was discutssing the prospectus.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No; I am
now discussing the agreement. The agreement
provides that the Beauharnois Light, Heat and
Power Conpany, Liinited, is to be paid
822,500,000. and that the Beauharnois Light.
Heat and Power Company shall pay 34,000,000
to the Beauharnois Syndicate, and $3,600.000
interest. So the net result is thalt the Light,
Heat and Power Company got out of that
transaction approximately $15,000,000.
Now,
excepting the S3,000.000 paid -to the Dominion
Securities Company. there are $7,500,000 unaccounted for. In the absence of any explanatien I can quite plainly see where Sweezey
got the 3600,000 or $700,000Hon. Mr. TANNER: Millions.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
No; the
$600,000 or $700,000 that he paid to Senator
Haydon. That clearly is the money of the
company. There is no consideration set out,
no consideration given for the payment of

APRIL 29, 1932
that money to Sweezey or lis partner, the
Dominion Securities Corporation.
.Even if tliat is legai, I say that it is conduct unbecoming a gentleman and a senator.
The right honouralle member from Eganville
(Riglit Hon. Mr. Graham) took exception
yesterday to the statement contained in the
report, or made by tlie lonourable member
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), that it was
clear tlie first directors of that company were
the clerks and solicitors, flot the men hehind
the scenes, Senator McDougald and lis codirectors. The rigît honourahie gentleman
asked members of tlie Bar whetlier it was not
a common thing for incorporators to use
stenographers, clerks and solicitors as the first
directors of a company-I have forgotten tlie
word lie usedAn Hon. SENATOR: Provisional directors.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: -as provisional directors of a company. My answer
to that is: sometimes it is done by honest
people; I have incorporated a good many cornpanies, and aithougli I recognize tliat there is
nothing wrong in the practîce itself, I do flot
recaîl ever having done it; but I think it is
prettypearly universai among pickpockets wlio
incorporate companies.
The wliole series of agreements: was put
tlirougli by the provisionai. directors. That.
to my mind, is something unheard of. All
.that provisionai directors generally do is to
organize the company, pass the formai. by-iaws,
and then eleet permanent directors. Wlien
activity of the provisionai directors is confined
to that the practice is unobjectionable, but
whcn irresponsible people wlio know nothing
about wliat tliey are doing-stenograpliers and
office boys-are asked to pass upon and enter
inito great, important iconitraicts whicli affect
the very existence of tlie corporation, 1 say
that it is insane, if not dishonest. Surely the
stockhoiders are entitled to have these contracts passed on by responsible directors. I
have not leen muel engaged in tliat class of
business, but, as I have said, 1 have neyer
before seen a case in whicli sucli stupendous
responsibilities were placed upon the shoulders
of office boys whule the directors stood behind
the door. 1 think sucli conduet is unbecoming
a senator and a gentleman. In regard to
Senator McDougaid, tlierefore, I intend to
vote for the report.
Now, as to Senator Raymond, 1 have flot
found anything in tlie evidence whicl reflects
uipon him or lis honour.
Some Hon. SENATORLS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
understand this report to reflect upon him or
lis honour. I understand the report to say

1

that the committee does flot think lie should
have done what he did-not because it was
immoral, flot because it was wrong, 'but
because it was imprudent. 1 arn going to
make a personal confession. While this
wonderful project was in the air a Montreal
friend of mine was visiting me in Hamilton
and told me about it. He told me there was
a syndicate -and that he hoped to get some
of its s-hares. 1 confess that I told him I
wished I were in his place, and I confess that if
he had offered me any of the shares in that
syndicate 1 would have taken them. Thank
God, lie did not. I say it in ail sincerity.
I neyer dreamed at that time thait if I had
donc so anybody would cast a reflection on
me. I was mercifully spared.
From a reading of the evidence I consider
that Senator Raymond was in a similar position. An offer was made to him, so far as we
know, and he accepted. We have no right to
entertain nasty, maiicious suspicions about
anybody, and I take it that lie is not in any
way dishonoured or disgraced by anything
contained in the report.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Heur, hear.
Hon. Mr. LYNýCH-STAUNTON: Dogs do
not eat dogs. Senator Haydon is a brother
lawyer. I do flot know him, except to say
"Good-day." So far as ýI have heard, Senator
Haydon lias heretofore been entitled to tlie
reputation given to him by the riglit honourable member ýfrom Eganville (Riglit Hon.
Mr. Graliam). A good name is beyond ail
price, and to a man in his extremity it sliould
stand for something. I arn very mucli disappointed in Senator Haydon. I speak of lis
gratuitous caiumny of tlie Hon. Mr. Ferguson.
The righit honoura;ble member from Eganvilie
made out what appeared to me to be someivhat of an excuse 'for Senator Haydon, 'but it
is not sufficient. Senator Haydon was figliting
for lis reputation, and reputation to every
man is dearer tlian his life. The subject lad
been present in lis mmnd for a year. Sureiy
lie reaiized tliat to rob a man of lis good
name is a terrible thing. Mr. Ferguson neyer
did him any wrong, neyer raised lis voice
agýainst liim. Mr. Ferguson is the representative of this country in the centre of tlie
Empire, und Senator Haydon gratuitous1y
sent ail over tlie Empire a statement calculated to destroy Mr. Ferguson's usefulness.
If what lie said faisely was said impetuously,
wly bas lie not retracted it? He was represented by counsel before tlie commission, and
lie lad counsel with him at lis home. He
knows, if he knows anything, tliat friend and
foe alike condemn him for that utterance. 1
say on this ground alone that lie was guilty

not necd to be introduced. That was the
-%ay I felt about it. But I found that no
consideration was given to any suggestion;
the attitude as to the report was, take it or
leave it. So that is the position with respect
to the report before us. Bonourable gentlemen can understand why, as one of the
members of that committee, I arn not very
sympathetic with that report, and am not
very eager for its acceptance by this flouse.
There is another reason wby I feel that way.
1 refer to section 5 of the old report, dealing
with the case of Senator Raymond. This is
how it reads:
In view of Mr. Sweezey's attitude throughout
and his views as to the necessity for political
influence, it is hardly conceivable that Mr.
Sweezey would pay tliis large sum of money
over to Senator Raymond unless hie at least
was satisfied thýat the Senator's influence had
been or woudd be worth the money.
What is the implication? The only implication to be derived fromn this is that it was a
payment to Mr. Raymond for bis own use, as
a bribe to secure bis influence. We ail know
that, as a matter of fact, it was nothing of
the kind. Be bad no interest whatever in
that money. Be received it as a trustee, a
custodian of party funds. Be did not even
have the privilege that an ordinary trustee
company bas in bandling funds, of collecting
the usual commission. Yet there is certainly
a plain implication, and one which I do not
Not only is that the
believe is correct.
implication of the Gommons committee, but
we find that the committee of tbe Senate
has tbis to say about it:While this committee agrees that the f acts
found in the summary of the Gommons report
referring to Senator Raymond are established,
and with the opinions expressed in sucb
summary, especially that contained in paragraph -No. 5 thereof, it is impossible for us to
do otherwise than accept Senator Raymond's
denial.
1 submit, honourable gentlemen, that that
statement is untrue. Some bonmirable gentlemen would like to draw inferences. A great
deal of that bas been done on suspicion. But
what is the inference that must be drawn
wben the committee of the Bouse of Comnmons is supported in sucb a statement by
the committee of this Bouse?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGBEN: Would the
honourable gentleman be good enougb ta
indicate to me wbere the reference ta Aird
is made in the report? Tbe honourable
gentleman said that hie wanted it struck out,
but I cannot find it.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is in referring ta
Senator Baydon.

;317

Right Bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: 1 do flot
tbink so. I do flot think there is such a
reference there at ail.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Perhaps I should
have said the evidence in regard to Mr.
Ferguson.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGBEN: Maybe so.
There is no reference to Mr. Aird.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: We often hear about
the necessity of being careful in evidence and
stating the truth exactly, wbich is indeed a
good rule for us to observe; and 1 think it
is very important that when a committee dealing witb the honour of members of this Bouse
brings in its report it should at least observe
that rule, or try to observe it. I do not tbink
it bas done so. 1 could not possibly vote for
the adoption of, such a report as this, cven if
there were no other reasons.
Now I ar n ot going to deal witb the
evidence. I arn quite as desirous as other
members that we should flot take too much
time. Tbe evidence bas been pretty thorougbly
deait with. I desire to make just a few
general observations in my own way.
In bringing in this report and moving its
adoption the honourable gentleman from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) made a speech
wbich I arn sure we ahl will say was a remarkable one, a speech wbich, as an exhibition of
industry, care, and great preparation deserves
hearty commendation indeed. But the hionourable gentleman views this matter in a sort
of microscopie way. Be examines ail the
little details to see if he can find where the
witnesses have been tripped up in their
evidence in some small particular. That has
been largely the attitude of the honourable
gentlemen who are supporting the adoption
of this report. The honourable gentleman
f rom Winnipeg, wbom I have in my eye (Hon.
Mr. McMeans), said that hie was the champion
of the widows and orphans.
Bon. Mr. McMEANS: 1 would rather be
the champion of the widows and orpbans than
an apologist for Dr. McDougald.
Bon. Mr. ROBINSON: The samne expression was used by the right bonourable leader
yesterday, though he qualified it a little. The
inference was drawn that some honourable
senators and those associated with them have
in some way done something to injure the
widows and orpbans, among others. Who
really destroyed the securities of the widows
and orphans? Was it not the Parliament
of Canada? Was not that enterprise going
along fairly successfully, well managed and
well handled? Was not the investment of
the widows and orphans pretty safe until the

SENATE
Parliament of Canada stepped in upon the
scene? The honourable member from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) drew a glowing picture of
the power of Parliament, with which I entirely
agree. The power of Parliament is great, but
to mv mind that is all the more reason why,
in the exercise of that power, a proper regard
should be had for the results that will come
to the people of this country.
it has been stated that the Government
bad to bring on this investigation because
the matter was introduced by Mr. Gardiner.
I hope I am not out of order in referring to
anything in connection with the other House.
The Governrment did not bring on the investigation when Mr. King asked it about the
matter. It broJgh't on the investigation when
Mr. Gardiner madé his speech in that House.
To my mind it would have been a great deal
better for this country that the Government
should never have allowed the investigation
at all. I do not know whether I shall gain
the support and agreement of members of
this House, but that is the view that I personally take. In my opinion, there never
should have been such an investigation. It
has been destructive to business life when
we had enough trouble already.
It has
destroyed the investments; perhaps destroyed
is too strong a word: it has had a very
damaging effect on the investments of the
widows and orphans, if you will-on the investments of hundreds and probably thousands of people ail over the Dominion of
Canada. It has interfered with a great work
being carried on, which would no doubt result
in immense benefit to Canada, looked at from
the proper viewpoint.
Honourable gentlemen have approached this
question with a microscope. To my mind
that is not the proper way to view questions
such as this. It is too big a question to
approach in so small a way, if I may be
allowed to use such a word. I do net intend
to say anything at ail offensive to any member
of this House-that is the last thing I would
do, and if I should say anything offensive I
hope honourable members will correct me at
once.
To my mind, the proper way to
approach a question of this magnitude is to
ascend the highest hill-to go to the mountain
top and get a proper perspective, so as to
understand what this whole scheme meant to
this country, and what will be its effects.
Reference has been made to the fact that
some gentlemen made $2,189,000. The ears
of people are stunned when large figures are
mentioned.
In a matter of this kind. of
course, it does net matter whether the figures
are large or small, but I notice that the
Hon.

Mr. ROBINSON.

speeches made on the other side of the
House have dwelt with the size of those
figures-the hugeness of this amount of
$2,189,000 made by some people connected
with this affair. I do net suppose any affair
of like magnitude is ever promoted, in Canada, the United States, or anywhere else,
without fully as much as that being paid out
in connection with those who promote it.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
My honourable
friend seems to be so fair, impartial and
sincere that I am sure that he, having been
a member of the committee, will try to
enlighten me on this. The $2,189,000 mentioned has net been condemned by anyone.
Is the honourable gentleman referring to
that money that went to senators, to Frank
Jones, and others?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:

That is one item.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
That is net under
consideration at all. No one condemns them
for that.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I am net the first
one to use these figures; they have been used
alreadv in this House. The honourable
gentleman knows that. The right honourable leader knows that.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What I was driving
at was that the $2,189,000 found its wav into
the pockets of gentlemen who are net in this
House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The right honourable leader used the figures, and he knows
the explanation. I thank him for helping
me out in the explanation. What does this
$2.189,000 aniount to after ail, as compared
with the magnitude of this whole work?
Les.s than one-third of one per cent; and that
is not a very big commission in view of the
magnitude of the work.
In thanking the right honourable leader
for his kindness in putting me right on this
matter, I want to say that in listening to his
romarkable speech yesterday I was thinking
about a littie tine that I took off one night
to go to a show. There was a conjurer doing
ail sorts of tricks; he could bring rabbits out

APRIL 29, 1932
ai bats, be could deal yau any kind of hand
ai cards he liked; but I want ta say ta this
House that the conjurer had nothing on the
right honourable leader of this buse. I will
guarantee that wben he gat through with thie
conjurer, the conjurer wauld not know whether
he took the rabbit out af the hat or the
rabbit took bim out ai tbe bat. I want ta
compliment tbe right honourable gentleman
upon the remarkable con.iury which he displayed in the handling ai this question. 1 have
always had a very great admiration for his
ability, but I must say tbat I was consumed
witb admiration at ýthe ability he displayed in
that speech.
Now I think tbis question should be
approacbed from tbe proper viewpoint-that
we should get the rigbt perspective. What
does it ail mean, and what daes it ail amount
ta? As I look at it and sec the different stcps
tbat were taken at Quebec, at Ottawa and
befare the Government, I must say tbat I
have very igreat admiration for the arganizing
ability ai these gentlemen and the way in
wbich they brougbt this great undertaking ta
a stage whcre it bid fair ta be anc ai the most
successful enterprises af its kind in the whole
Dominion of Canada. 1 rcally think it is nat
fair for honourable members ai this House, or
for anyone, ta be too critical with regard ta
some af the ways that were adopted ta bring
about the success ai this great undertaking.
When the application came befare the
Covernment, what happened? There was an
investigation by de'partmental chief engineers
and by the National Advisory Committee.
There were references ta the Departmnent of
Justice and ta the courts in an codeavour ta
find out in wbomn rested the awnership of the
vwater-power rigbts. Finally, there was a
reference ta the Deputy Minister of Public
Works, I belieýve. I think there were other
references, for the purpose af guiding the
Goveroment in its decision. Ta say that the
influenceofa any ai these honourable senstors, or ai anyane cisc, had aoy effeet upon
the Government's decision is ta cast a refectian upon every «engineer, every official, and
cvcry other persan who had anytbing ta do
with the recommending ai this great public
work. Thut is the way I feel about it. I
tbink this suggestion of great influence is
absurd.
Mr. Sweezcy was very liberal, perliaps mare
liberal tban he needed ta be, whcn he scattered tbousands ai dollars with a lavish band.
Who would nat have taken some af the
moncy if be had bad a chance? Mr. Aird
took same, as did ather people. I believe

be fair about this. I understand that the
leading members of the Conservative Party
refused ta accept $200,OOO. They were wanderfully wise when they did sa. At any rate,
they displayed remarkable astutencss and
foresight in refusing thase funds.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Wonderful restraint.
Han. Mr. ROBINSON: I suppase sa. They
carried an their election, thaugh, in the same
old way, and that means they gat their funds
samewhere. I do nat want ta make any
insinuatians as ta where they got them, but
I suppose same people wha had an axe ta

posite will agree with me aniMt
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:

The axes are stili

Han. Mr. ROBINSON: 0f course, we are
not going inta these things. I for ane do not
want ta go ino tbem. I have no desire ta
cast reflection upon any honourable member
of this Hause. nor upon anyane else. My
oblect is ta defend, as far as I passibly cao.
tbe honour and integrity of ail my assaciates
in the Senate. That is the stand I prefer ta
take.
The right hanourable leader af the Huse
refcrred yestcrday ta some coostitutional
authorities that were cited by caunsel for
Senator McDougald, as shawing that each
House must be careful ta guard its own
privileges. I qitc agree with the remarks
made in this connectian by the right hanourable senatar fram Eganville (Right Han.
Mr. Graham) and ivith same of those made
by the banourable senator from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Stauntan). In my opinion
it is aur duty ta prutect the privileges af
this Hause. That is another reason why I
cannot possibly vote for the adoption ai this
report. It seems ta me the repart shauld
bave emphasized the fact that we are the
custodians ai the rights and privileges af
aur own members. That is common sense.
We do not need any authorities ta tell us that
every legislative body looks after the privileges af its awn members. I take it that
the Commans committee had a perfect right
ta examine the honaurable senators. As a
matter af fact, wc gave leave ta the honourable senatars ta appear before that committee.
But I believe every reasonable persan will
agree with me wheii I say that the Commons
committee went beyond its rigbts wben it
attempted ta condemn, or ta pass judgment
upon, members ai this Chamber.

SENATE

After the Commons committee had rendered
judgment, it

sent a copy of its report to us.

What for? So that we might act as sheriff,
or executioner, or whatever you wish to call
it, in carrying out the behest of that commit tee. Was that a reasonable thing to do?
Sone Hon. SENATORS:

No.

carried

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: My mind may be
altogether distorted on this question, but that
is the way it appeals to me. I think we
should stand on our rights in this matter.
The right honourable leader of the House
says there was a unanimous report of the
House of Commons committee.
That has
been disputed. I believe the report was
carried on division.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
committee, but in

Not in the

the House.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
In the House,
exactly, but not in the committee. I will
admit this House unanimously referred the
matter to a committee. But two or three
wrongs never yet made a right. I will say
what they can (o, though, and what there
is a very grave dlanger they will do; that is,
make a precedent. We need to be careful
about that. Throughout these proceedings
we have been making precedents. I do not
think there bas ever been a case similar to
this in Canada. If we have any regard for the
future welfare of members of this Chamber.
we should be very careful what kind of
precedent we create.
The three honourable senators mentioned
in the report have had a pretty hard time.
They were haled before the House of Commens committee, where one of the cleverest
lawyers that the Government could find had
themn on the gridiron. Then they were haled
before the Senate .committee and subjected to
severe examination by two of the ablest lawyers available, who were also selected by the
Governient.
Hon. Mr. COPP: There were two or more
lawyers selected by the Government on the
House of Commons committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: These honourable
senators have been tried twice. They were
examined and cross-examined at great length;
all their activities were pried into as closely
as it was possible for the lawyers to pry.
But what do we find with regard to the leading lawyer in the Commons committee? It
would be interesting to know just what connection he bas with this man John Aird. Yet
that was the lawyer who cross-examined Mr.
Aird with regard to his knowledge concerning
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.

campaign fonds. Furthermore, one of the
members of that Commons committee bas been
compelled to resign his seat in the House, and
it is a matter of very grave doubt whether
he was qualified to hold bis seat at the time
he was a member of the committee. These
things show the kind of operation that bas been
on.

The chairman of our own committee (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) bas said ithere was no partisanship in it. I have very great admiration for
the honourable gentleman, but his ideas of
partisanship do not altogether agree with mine.
I repeat that the three honourable senators
have had a pretty hard time so far. They
have been virtually persecuted; they have
been abused.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Is the honourable gentleman net aware that Senator McDougald demanded in this House a trial by his peers?
Yet be claims that he was persecuted by the
committee that was appointed at his request.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Keep your boots
on. He is not making that claim; I an; and
there is a diffei-ence. I ai claining that le
was persecuted.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: He asked for a trial.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I say these honourable gentlemen have been persecuted. If they
did commit a small errer, if they did go a
little way astray, they have been migbtily well
punished up to this time. If we are to adopt
a polic' of going beyond the British North
A.merica Act and the Senate and House of
Commons Act, as was suggested this afternoon,
and if we proceed to dive into the ethical conduct of every member of the Senate, I am
going te take to the woods, and I think a considerable numxber of other senators had better
do the saame.
Hon. Mr. COPP: You would have a large
camp.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not think we
have any right to investigate -maters of
ethics. May I quote from one of the authorities referred te yesterday by the right honourable leader of the House? At page 313 of
the Proceedings of the Special Committee this
quotation is given as part of the argument by
counsel for Senator McDougald. It is from
May's Constitutional History:
Bothl Houses of Parliament "must act within
the Iimits of their jurisdiction. and in strict
conformity with the laws.... The judgmnent of
offences especially should be guided by the
severest principles of ýlaw."
What does that mean? I think it is an
admonition to us to deal only with ques-

APRIL 29, 1932
tions of law, according to the severest principles of law. But we are going into this
matter in the style of an old woman's quilting party. According to the honourable
senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) we are to invest-igate everything
that some honourable senators ever did.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Senator McDougald
requested an investigation.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I say we are going
beyond the dignity of this body.
Perhaps, honourable senators, I have continued talking longer than I should have
done.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go on.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Some reference
was made by the honourable senator from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) to the so-called
Pacific Scandal. I do not know that I should
have mentioned it otherwise. The object of
his remarks was to show, by comparison, the
magnitude of the sums involved in the present
matter, to stun our intellects with figures,
so that we could not properly understand the
issue. He said that at the time of the Pacifie
Scandal the Government was driven out of
power for collecting about $200,000 of campaign funds, and he asked us to consider how
small a sum that was in comparison with the
$600,000 or $700,000 donated by Mr. Sweezey.
Well, it happens that some time ago I saw a
copy of a speech delivered by Hon. Alexander
Mackenzie on October 27, 1873, with regard
to the Pacifie Scandal, and in that speech he
said that Sir Hugli Allen had contributed to
the election fund $360,000, to Minis'ters themselves $162,000, and to their friends $17,000
orS18,000, and expended a balance of $200,000,
making in all $740,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Where did
my honourable friend get those figures?
From a speech
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
delivered by the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie
on October 27, 1873. Now, that $740,000
was contributed at a time when the whole
revenue of Canada was probably not onefifteenth part of what it is to-day. And the
whole list of voters in the Dominion of
Canada at that time was very small, compared with the present list. That sum would
be equivalent to-day to about $3,000,000 or
$4,000,000. I am not citing these figures as
an argument, but merely attempting to reply
to the argument of my honourable friend who
sought to emphasize the magnitude of Mr.
Sweezey's contribution.
What happened to the honourable gentlemen who revelled in that old fund? For
answer, look out on Parliament Hill. The

first bronze statue that the early morning sun
kisses is that of Sir John A. Macdonald; the
last statue upon which the setting sun shines
before it goes down behind the western hills
is that of Sir George E. Cartier. These gentlemen were two of the most prominent figures
connected with the Pacifie Scandal, yet this
country has seen fit to honour them. Their
statues stand guard, one at the east and the
other at the west, over our Parliament Buildings, the particular guardian of the Senate
Chamber being the statue of Right Hon. Sir
John A. Macdonald. I think the country was
right in honouring those gentlemen. Our
country considered the good work that they
had done. They were statesmen, builders of
empire, and the trivial matters connected with
the Pacifie Scandal were not worth considering.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: But the Government
was kicked out over that affair.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Temporarily.
Hbn. Mr. HARDY: It came back.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Yes, it came back; it
had to come back.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If the figure of Sir
John A. Macdonald could come through the
doors of this Chamber to-day, he would make
short work of this motion before us.
What was the bargain made between the
Province of Quebec and the Dominion of
Canada? The Dominion of Canada had control over navigation, and had the power to
decide whether this Beauharnois work would
destroy the navigation on a non-navigable
portion of the river. Everyone knows that
this work, when finished, will tremendously
improve the navigation of the St. Lawrence
river. I think everyone will admit that. The
value of this work to the Dominon of Canada,
as estimated by the Government's own engineers-it is to be found somewhere in the
evidence-is $16,000,000. That is not my valuation, not the valuation given by Senator McDougald, but the valuation put upon it by the
engineers of the Dominion of Canada in their
report. This is given for the right to change
the channel of the St. Lawrence, to create a
navigable channel instead of one with many
rapids and navigable only by small boats. The
Dominion of Canada gets a proposition worth
$16,000,000-a pretty good bargain, I should
say. The rights of Canada are well protected.
The public of Canada is not suffering very
much. And what happens in the Province of
Quebec? For this emphyteutic lease-and
there is no particular charm about the word
"emphyteutic"; it is used in the Province of
Quebec, and means a good leaseHon. Mr. DANDURAND: A long lease.

41767-21
REVISED EDITION

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: A long lease. For
this emphyteutic lease the Province of Quebec
gets an annual rental of $20,000, payable in
advance, for the first five years, and after that
$50,000, and in addition to that it gets $1 per
horse-power, under an agreement which can be
revised every ten years, I believe. When
500,000 horse-power is developed the Province
gets a revenue of $550,000 a year. The $2,189,000 that went to the promoters of this work
for their endeavours in developing this huge
undertaking is a mere bagatelle compared to
what the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Quebec get.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
The honourable
gentleman must not forget the other things
besides the $2,189,000.
Hon. Mr. PARENT:
much now.

They are not worth

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is right. They
own it after the bonds are taken care of. I
am only trying to get the picture of this
thing; I am not applying the microscope to it.
I want to get a real picture of what it means
to the people of the country and to the Province of Quebec. I believe the larger view is
the proper one to take.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: What is the honourable
gentleman's opinion of the clause in this contract whereby the Beauharnois Company is
compelled to keep off the Island of Montreal.
thereby allowing the supply of electric power
for the whole city of Montreal to come under
the control of a company that exists at the
present time?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
The honourable
gentleman refers to the contract between the
two companies. I think that is a small matter.
That is my opinion about that.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The people of Montreal will not think it is a small matter.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is one of the
difficulties that had to be ironed out. I think
that probably Sir Herbert Holt had something
to do with that.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I am afraid
that I have talked longer than I intended.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Go on.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I hope you will
pardon me. I am only trying as a member of
this House to give the viewpoint which appeals to me as being the correct one -in this
matter. My proposition is that I am compelled by my reason, by my judgment, and
by everything else, to vote against the adoption of this report. I might quote the words
fon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of Sir Leonard Tilley, uttered at the time
when Sir John Macdonald was going through
his valley of humiliation. Sir Leonard Tilley
was one of the most highly respected and
nonourable men that we ever had in the
Province of New Brunswick. He said:
The charges which had been promulgated
against the head of the administration were of
the gravest and most serious character.
He
wras bound to say, having been seated with him
in council for the last six years, that he did
not believe from the evidence that he was
guilty of the corrupt charges that had been
brought against bim.
He was prepared to
support him, rather than let his influence,
smail as it might be, give influence to arm
the foes raised agairst him and that were
raised against him at that moment to strike
him down, and he believed improperly and
unfairly.
Rather than give the opportunity of doing
an injiistice to his right honourable friend, lie
would foliow him and take the consequences
of his line of conduct before the country. He
considered that he would be recreant to his
duty and unworthy of position as a representative of the people if he were to do otherwise.
I take the same stand.

Hon. A. D. MeRAE:

Honourable senators,

as I am a new arrival in this honourable
House, it was not moy intention to take part
in this debate. I have no desire to do so at
this timie, and should regard it as inappropriate
if it were not for the question raised by my
very good friend the honourable gentleman
from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson). who
referred to the reputed offer of $200,000 froin
the Beauharnois interests to fhe Conservative
Party. This is the first opportnity I have
had to state my position with regard to that
matter, a matter about which I know probahly
more thian anvone else.
Perhaps before referring to that ineident I
should explain muy present political position. I
Io this in the hope that I nay thereby relieve
myself of any handicap which would affect
my uîsefuîlness in this honourable House. As
eve<rn knows, it is a fact that in the last
Parliament I was the chief whip and organizer
of the Conservative Party, a position wlhich
I took on the distinct understanding with
my party and with my leader that my job
ceased the day after the election, win, lose
or draw. Since that time I have had no
responsibility of that nature.
WVe have heard a great deal about campaign
funds, and I think I may add one word,
something that is not generally appreciated
by the public; that is that the law in regard
to campaign funds was changed in the last
Parliament, on the motion, as I remember,
of the member for Winnipeg North Centre,
Mr. Woodsworth. Under this change it was

APRIL 29, 1932
made legal for corporations to contribute to
campaign funds. Previous to that time it had
been illegal. Mr. Woodsworth's intention was,
I believe, to enable labour unions to make
contributions to the labour candidates in
The
different sections of the country.
unanimity with which the motion was approved was wonderful. I am sure we shall
have ample time next year to discuss campaign funds in connection with the amendments of the Elections Act. Already we have
heard considerable about the subject here.
I noticed that the right honourable senator
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
suggested that senators should in future be
debarred from collecting campaign funds, and
I want to say that in this I agree with him one
hundred per cent.
Someone has said that there are campaign
funds and campaign funds. That, I presume,
means that there are reasonable campaign
funds and unreasonable campaign funds. If
I may go one step further, I would say that
there are decent campaign funds and indecent
campa.ign funds.
Hon. Mr. PARADIS:
they come from.

It depends on where

Hon. Mr. McRAE:
That is a matter of
conscience.
I never accepted a dollar of
campaign funds from any individual or corporation that asked anything for it, and I
have never asked for or accepted a dollar
for any purpose that I am ashamed of.
Now I come to the reputed contribution of
$200,000 by the Beauharnois interests to the
Conservative Party. I was here during the
early part of the hearing of the House of
Commons committee last year, and I was at
the Coast when this incident came out. When
I got the report I was left smarting under the
inference that I had solicited campaign contributions from the Beauharnois interests. I
was in a somewhat embarrassing position,
inasmuch as the negotiator was no longer
alive. However, my embarrassment was relieved by Mr. Sweezey, who made the statement before the present Senate committee
that the man with whom he disbussed the
matter was Mr. Howard Smith. When I returned from the South after Easter the work of
the committee was still under way, and I prepared a statement that I wished to make under
oath before the committee in regard to this
matter. I submitted that statement to counsel
for the committee and was advised by him
that it was outside of the scope of the committee and would not be received. I have
carried that statement around with me, in the
anticipation that some honourable gentleman
41767-21à

on the other side would mention the incident.
I am grateful to my very good friend the honourable gentleman from Moncton (Hon. Mr.
Robinson) for bringing the question up early,
because a statement made by me now may
save a good deal of discussion afterwards, in
which event I shall feel that my remarks have
not been entirely wasted.
I have with me an exact copy of the statement submitted to Mr. Smith, counsel for
the committee, and which he told me would
not be received. With the permission of
honourable gentlemen I will read this, and I
ask you to take it as being of the same force
and effect as it would have been had I given
it under oath before the committee.
The statement I wish to refer to will be found
in the evidence of Mr. Sweezey, on page 823 of
the Report of the Special Committee of the
House of Commons, and reads as follows:
"Q. Have you told us of the Federal contributions?-A. Yes, sir.
Q. Was there any proposal indicating a contribution to the Federal campaign fund through
its organizer, General McRae?-A. Yes, a proposal came to me at one time to make a contribution.
Q. Of how much?-A. Of $200,000.
Q. Was it made?-A. No. .
Q. Why?-A. I do not know what happened.
Q. I understand that Mr. Bennett would not
accept it?-A. I do not know that, but I presume that may be so."
The facts regarding this matter are as
follows:
About two weeks before the election-I think
it was early in the week of July 13, 1930-Mr.
Howard Smith called on me at the Mount
Royal Hotel, Montreal, and said he could get
me a $100,000 contribution for the Conservative
Party. I asked him who was so enthusiastic
about our success and he said, "Beauharnois,"
to which I replied, "Nothing doing."
Then followed a discussion in which I explained to Mr. Smith the position my leader,
supported by his party, had taken in the House
of Commons on the Beauharnois project; that
in my judgment an inquiry into Beauharnois
development was a certainty if we carried the
country; that it was patent why such a contribution was now offered; and under the circumstances if I were to accept a dollar of Beauharnois money, I would be false to my trust.
Later in the same week Mr. Smith again
called on me and said that he thought the offer
could be increased to $200,000. I told him the
same principle applied to a $200,000 contribution as to a $100,000 contribution and I could
not entertain it. After some discussion he asked
if I did not think I was taking a lot of responsibility on my shoulders in refusing the offer.
I asked him what he had in mind and he suggested that I put it up to my leader. I told
him that I would do so; that Mr. Bennett
would be in Montreal in a few days, but I was
quite certain what his answer would be.
When Mr. Bennett arrived on the following
Sunday I referred the matter to him and his
immediate reply was, "Not a damned cent!"
The answer was so inevitable that there was no
further discussion about it. Mr. Smith called

SENATE
on me the next day and I told him the Chief
said, "Not a damned cent!" That ended it.
J wish to refer to the reference the Right
Honourable Mr. Mackenzie King made to this
matter as recorded in the verbatim report of
his London speech, apparently from manuscript,
which appeared in the issue of the London
Advertiser of October 21 last. In the first
column on page 13 of that issue will be found
the following words:
"The return of the contribution made to the
general fund of the Conservative Party was on
the grounds of party expediency and not public
policy."
Then again he says:
"Later the contribution given to the Treasurer
of the Conservative Party was returned, he,
according to Mr. Sweezey's statement of what
lie had been told. having had instructions from
Mr. Bennett to return the contribution."
Then Mr. King later refers to the organizer
(myself) as having accepted the contribution.
I want to say here under oath that these
statements of the right honourable gentleman
are absolutely and totally untrue.
I never solicited a dollar from the Beauharnois interests-never accepted a dollar from
them and consequently never returned a dollar
to then-Beauharnois. Sweezey or anv other
so-called Beauharnois interests. On the contrary. from start to finish. J absolutely and
positively dleclined to accept any contribution
from that source.
I wish to make it very clear, bonourable
gentlemen. that I make this statement in the
hope of saving this honourable House and
the country any further discussion of the
matter. I cannot say that I appreciate the
compliment extended by my very good friend
the bonourable gentleman from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) on our good luck in
refusing this money. I think it is the obligation of every campaign solicitor, every custodian of campaign funds, at least to keep
within the bounds of his own conscience.
This I could never have done had I accepted
money from the source referred to.
Honourable
R. DANDURAND:
Hon.
gentlemen, I must admit at the outset that
towards the end of July, 1931, when the report
of the evidence which was being taken in the
other Chamber reached the press. I was considerably perturbed. Therc were statements
which seemed to go uncontradicted and whicb,
to my mind, needed explanation from some
members of this Chamber whose names have
been mentioned. But I soon discovered tbe
unfairness of the work of the Commons committee. Looking through the investigation
proceedings, I found that an inquiry was
being conducted by a prosecuting attorney
who had beside him no one to represent the
other party. The Conservative Party was
there represented by a strong party man
named Mr. Peter White, and be seemed to
have the full direction of that committee,
examining and cross-examining the witnesses,
Hon. Mr. MeRAE

stopping them when they were in the course
of making an answer, and keeping them te
the point where he wanted to have them.
Now I would draw the attention of this
Chamber to the draft report, which was prepared by the chairman of the committee.
That chairman was a Minister of the Crown,
a member of the Cabinet, and was representing his party officially as a Minister and
as a member of the House. Having penned
that draft report, be brought it into the committee, and for a day it was examined by
all the members. But towards the end of the
sitting lie was asked by the minority members,
the three Liberal representativesRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If my bonourable friend will permit me-is this in the
record of the committee? If it is not, the
honourable gentleman has no right to be
reciting it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

May I ask the
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
honourable gentleman to get this matter
straight? He spoke of the Conservative Party
having a prosecuting attorney.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

This investigation
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
was not carried on by the Conservative Part.
It was based on a charge made by Mr.
Gardiner, who is one of the Progressive Party,
and the organized Conservative Party was
not in it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the whole
comminttee was presided over by the Minister,
the Hon. Mr. Gordon. It was the committee,
or the Hon. Mr. Gordon, or the Department
of Justice, who selected the prosecuting
attorney, and it so happened that lie was
Mr. Peter White.
My right honourable friend may ask me
where I am getting this information. For a
number of years we have been in the habit
of refraining from quoting the Official Report
of the other House, but we could always say
that we had seen the information in the newspapers. W.ell, what I am stating I have read
in the newspapers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Surely the
honourable gentleman is not suggesting that
be ought to seek to modify the effect of the
official document of a House by reading something from a newspaper. Here is a document
submitted to us. He can look at the terms
of this document. I do not think my honourable friend should go so far as to say that
the report is not a fair account of what took
place.

APRIL 29, 1932
No. I am
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stating that the report came before the House
of Commons and was discussed. I read at
the time the discussion that took place, and
I will say that I read it in the Montreal
Gazette. I have to refresh my memory by
looking at Hansard. I am not citing Hansard, but am merely stating what took place
in the Commons, as reported in the press.
Yesterday, as I understood, the honourable
gentleman -from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
read from Hansard some extracts from
speeches of the Right Hon. Mr. King. I let
him make those citations, for I intended following him to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not want
honourable members to think I am unfair. I
thought a senator could not cite from Commons Hansard in this House, unless he was
quoting from a previous session. I may be
wrong, but I think that is what the rule says.
I am not objecting to the honourable member
quoting from Hansard, but I want him to
let us know whether he was exposing what
took place in the committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will cite the
exact text of Hansard. When the report was
brought in, Mr. Mackenzie of Vancouver said,
in answer to a remark from the Hon. Mr.
Gordon, who claimed that the report had been
made unanimous:
Mr. Mackenzie: I want to ask the Minister
a question. Is it not a fact that at the conclusion of the proceedings in camera. at about
half past five, I asked whether the Liberal
members of the committee might have permission to adjourn and consider their attitude to
the report as a whole? I protested against the
Minister submitting the report te Parliament

as a unanimous report without giving us an

opportunity to consider it.
Mr. Gordon: Hon. members may applaud that
statement, but what I have said I have said
with a full consciousness of the seriousness of
it. When the report was finally revised the

hon.

member

for Vancouver

Centre

(Mr.

Mackenzie) asked me whether he could have a
copy to submit to his leader.
Mr. Mackenzie: That is right.
Mr. Gordon: I said to the hon. member that
the report had not been in any way referred
to the Prime Minister; not a thing had been
referred to him.
Mr. Mackenzie: Is it not a fact that I asked
for an adjournment of the committee and to
have the committee reconvene?
Mr. Cordon: I will leave it to hon. members
of the committee as te whether my recollection
is correct or incorrect. The clerk of the committee says it was unanimous, and so does the
report. I made it abundantly plain that I con-

sidered it to be my duty to see that the report

was a report from this select committee and
not one influenced by any advice which might

come from the leader of the opposition or
others.

Now, I say this was an unfair position to
take towards the members of a party whose
friends in this Chamber were being violently
or unjustly assaulted. It was unfair on the
part of the Minister of the Crown, Hon.
Mr. Gordon, who sat every day in Council,
who had the assistance and co-operation of
his colleagues in discussing these matters, to
deny the leader of the Liberal Party the
opportunity to examine-hastily, if you will
-this draft report which was being presented
in that committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman suggest that reports
should be submitted to leaders of parties before
they are concurred in?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I do not
suggest that, but I say that in connection
with the lengthy report which was in the
hands of Hon. Mr. Gordon, covering the whole
operations of the Beauharnois Company and
containing a criticism of the evidence that
had been presented, copies of that draft
report having been offered to members of the
committee the day before, the request of the
members representing the Liberal Party on
that committee was a fair one. They asked
only to be allowed to examine the draft
for themselves, quietly, for a few hours, with
the intention of considering seriously the whole
economy of it in order to decide whether they
would adhere to it or would express their
dissent. I say it was a fair request, but they
were denied the right to examine it thoroughly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; the
honourable gentleman is wrong. They were
denied the right to a copy for submission to
any political leader. I think the denial was
perfectly right. There was plenty of time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, on
that point I disagree with my right honourable friend, who does not seem to realize
that the documents were being prepared by
Hon. Mr. Gordon, chairman of the committee
and Minister of the Crown, who could confer
with his colleagues every day, and who did
confer--for Ministers meet during the session
every day. Now, who wielded the pen in the
drafting of that report? Hon. Mr. Gordon.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Were not the
other members of the committee at liberty to
meet with their leader every day? There was
exactly the same right on both sides.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But that report was brought in at ten o'clock in the
morning, after it had been prepared and penned
by Hon. Mr. Gordon, who took the responsi-

We agreed to the appointment of a Sonate

The action of the committee has been criticized seriously by the honourablo senator

mildly by the honourable senator from
Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson), and now by
the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I do not wish to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourabie

declared more than once that the committee
would flot present any conclusions, but

there wouid ho a quiet conference arouind the
table for the purpose of discussing the whoie
matter front every angle. But there was flot.
The mai ority of the committee met separately,
more than once, and the report was brouglit
in to the other members by the ch'rirman.
I find that only one copy of that report was
handed to the honoîrrahie gentleiman front
De Salaberrv (Hon. Mr. Béique) for his examination; the other tbrec, members front this
side cf the Bouse had no copy of the report
submitted to themn before the commjittee was
called to consider it.
Whcn my honourable frirind the chairman
of the committee decidei that the report
should contain certain conclusions and condemnations, if any were found to, be justified,
did ho expect that his report woii!d bie

Did lie think they would swaliow the whole

meeting after his arrival in Ottawa he found
the application of the Beauharnois Light,
Heat and Power Company, Limited, before
the Council. In substantiation of the facts
that I have just recited, may I read a letter
which Mr. Jones wrote to the Prime Minister, Mr. King, on November 30, 1928? It
will be remembered that the application from
the Beaubarnois Company had corne before
Council only in that month of November.
Rt. Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King, P.C., M.P.,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa.
Sir:
You will recall that when I saw you a few
months ago regarding the application of the
Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company
for the approval of its plans under the
Navigable Waters Protection Act, you asked me
regarding the attitude of the premiers of
Quebec and Ontario regarding this project.
I was in a position to assure you that not
only the premier but -the entire government of
Quebec was practically unanimously in favour
of it and anxious to see the development go
ahead. I could not, however, state definitely
the precise attitude of the premier of Ontario.
I now take the liberty of enclosing a copy of
a letter from the Hon. Mr. Ferguson, dated
November 19, to the Hon. Mr. Taschereau, by
which you will see that Hon. Mr. Ferguson
considers that the matter is one which should
be dealt with according to the wishes of the
province of Quebec. Mr. Ferguson appreciates
the spirit of co-operation shown by the province of Quebec, and evidently feels that this
development will b beneficial to Ontario, inasmuch as it will be an additional source of
supply of power to help satisfy Ontario's rapidly
increasing demand.
I think the letter of the Hon. Mr. Ferguson
justifies my stating te you that Ontario, as well
as Quebec, is in favour of the project.
There was enclosed in that letter a copy
of a letter from Hon. Mr. Ferguson to Hon.
Mr. Taschereau, the Premier of Quebec. Part
of that letter is reproduced at page 4359 of the
Debates of the House of Commons of 1931,
and is as follows:
I note you say that the Beauharnois people
are about to press the Dominion authorities to
give effect to the legislation passed by your
legislature at the Jast session. I fully realize
that this development is entirely within the
boundaries of the province of Quebec and this
province bas no voice in the matter. We do,
however, greatly appreciate the spirit of cooperation in the development of these two great
old provinces which you have so frequently
shown, and which is again evidenced by the
provisions you have made that a portion of this
power may be made available to this province
should we need it and are able to negotiate
a favourable contract, so long as it is not
directly or indirectly exported to the United
States.
Owing to the undoubted delay there will be
in regard to the settlement of the development
of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa river powers,
and the rapidly increasing demand for power
ie Ontario, I feel that we will probably again

32J

in the near future have te take advantage of
your good-will and secure a further supply from
some point in your province.
I am sure I need not assure you again, as I
have done in the past, of our appreciation of
your attitude towards Ontario and her power
problems by voluntarily making such generous
provision a condition of your approval of the
Beauharnois undertaking. If I am right in my
view as to our early requirements of power,
Beauharnois would seem te me to be a very
convenient and favourable point from which to
procure our 'requirements.
Yours faithful.ly,
G. H. Ferguson.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members of the Senate, the letter of Mr. Jones
which I have just read was written in November. How did the Government proceed to
examine into that question? I may say that
no problem which came before the Government of Canada during my term of officeand I sat in the Council for eight years-was
given more serious study than the one presented to us by the application of the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company.
That problem was studied from all angles. The
provinces, through their Prime Ministers and
others, had met in Ottawa in 1927, and had
asked that the question regarding water-powers
be submitted to the Supreme Court. It took
some time to reach an agreement as to the
terms of the reference to the court. After the
first attempt, which failed, an Order in Council
acceptable to the provinces was passed on the
31st of May, 1928, and the reference was made
to the Supreme Court.
The pleadings before that tribunal took
place in October; so that when the matter
came before us in Council in November it
was sub judice. But the whole application
had been referred to the Department of Justice
for an opinion, and during the summer the
Government engineers were at work on the
matter. Later on a reference was made to
an inter-departmental board of engineers. This
board gave considerable attention to the technical problems, and reported in January. The
Government, before passing judgment on that
application, decided to grant a public hearing.
That hearing took place on the 15th of January, 1929, and all parties who were interested in
power matters in and around Montreal were
present to explain their positions. The opinion
of the Supreme Court was given on the 7th of
February, 1929. This will give honourable
members an idea of the measures that were
taken by the Cabinet to make sure that it
was on safe ground.

SENATE
Mr. Geoffrion was examined before the
committee of the Senate, and he gave that
committee some idea of the task that he had
in hand. He said, at page 26:
In Ottawa my troubles were entirely legal,
not engineering. The theory I held, and I still
hold-and I think it is clearly a sound theory
-is that the whole power belonged to the province. so we had asked for a grant from the
province. We now came to the Dominion only
for approval or disapproval under the Navigable Waters Protection Act. If we were right
on that question, all the Dominion Government
had to do was to get its engineers to report on
the subject. If the engineers reported favourably. naniely, that this was not an interference
with navigation, they were bound to give us
their approval. The decision is a judicial one.
If they thought it was an interference they
were bound to say no. That was a matter for
the enginleers almost entirely. . . . I have my
engineers, and they were fighting it out with
the Government engineers, but there arose a
seond point.
That was that these waters
bllonged to the Dominion. I first tried to convince the Department of Justice that that was
not right. I was anxious not to take any reference to the Supreme Court, because J was in a
hurrv, and that reference miglt have gone to
tise Privy Council. and that takes long. So I
suggested to the Government that they should
put in the Order in Council a clause stating
that this was only an approval under the
Navigable Waters Protection Act, and that if
it turned out that the Dominion was the owner
of the waters then tie natter would be
reopened. Tiat did not succeed at that time.
They insisted on a reference to flic Supreme
Court.

At hast we got a judgment which was

considered a victory for the province.
Honourable members of this House have
an idea of the various questions that had to
be examined into and decided upon before the
plans were approved. The Government decidcd that the province bad some rights in
tie water, and that although the judgment of
the Supreme Court was not very clear, it
could not very well refuse to accept the
situation. Nevertheless, the Government decidcd to await the opening of Parliament in
order to submit to the House, as soon as it
was signed. the Order in Council approving
of the plans. That was donc because Parliamuent, under the Navigable Waters Protection
Act. had the right to annul or vary that
Order in Council. The Order in Council was
brought before the House the very day it
was passed. That took place in March, 1929.
We are now in April, 1932, and I think I can
affirm that that Order in Council has stood
the test. It is the full justification of the
Governnent that passed it. It was commended by the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett in
the session of 1931. I cite from page 4402.
He said:
If those who are interested will look at page
628 of the proceedings of the comnittee they
will find certain matters set forth which will
leave no doubt as to the conditions imposed.
Hai.

M r. DANDURAND.

That is, the conditions imposed were in that
Order in Council. He goes on:
I will say this, that there were twenty-eight
conditions imposed in the order in council, and
the original slips by which little amendments
were made here and there as the document was
being prepared are stil. extant, in the handwriting of one who is still a member of this
House. Those amendments introduced into the
final licence, as settled on the recommendation
of the former Minister of Public Works, indicated that if they were observed the public
interest would be protected.
And he proceeded to declare that the cornpany had not followed to the letter the
prescriptions of that Order in Council. The
Prime Minister only questioned the right of
the preceding Government to proceed to
approve of those plans by Order in Council.
He withdrew that Order in Council and subnitted to Parliament an Act authorizing him
to proceed to give sanction by an Order in
Council. He thougit that Parliament had the
right to intervenc in a matter of that nature,
and we could not sanction plans which threatened to divert all the water in the St.
Lawrence.
Under the conditions imposed by that Order
in Council 422 the work proceeded, and it has
proteeded to the complete satisfaction of the
iarfie-s most interested at this day outside
of the bond iolders-the complete satisfaction
of the men w-lo in recent msonths have been
adv ancing the msoney. I refer to the letter of
Mr. M. W. Wilson, dated Januari-y 8, 1932,
and
laddressed to the Prime Minister, Mr.
Wilson being the representative of the Bank
of Montreal, the Royal Bank, and the Bank
of Commerce. In that letter is to be found
this statement:
Tie work has been laid out on a time
sciedîsle calculated to bring the power plant
into production by October 1. 1932, the date
wlien the two contracts for the sale of substantial and increasing blocks of power to the
Hydro-Electric Power Conmnission of Ontario
and Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated call for initial deliveries. The reports
of the company's officers and engineers show
that, so far. the work ias been carried out
in suels manner that it is now up to schedule
as to timie, and is also within the estimates of
cost made at the outset. If las progressed te
such

a point that it

is reasonable to assume

that if carried on without interruption, the
power plant can be brouglt into production by
October 1. 1932. and at a cost not exceeding the
original estimîate for such installation.
This explains what was done during the
Noveniber, December, January and February prior to the time when the Order in
Council was deposited on the Table of the
House of Commons. I think no one in this
Chamsber will claim that too much time was
taken for the study of that question. The
departmuentil engineers had te study and re-

APRIL 29, 1932
port upon it; the Department of Justice had
to be satisfied; and the Supreme Court was
studying the respective rights of the provinces and of the Federal Government in the
water-power on the St. Lawrence.
I attended a considerable number of meetilgs of Council, and during ail that time I
found the atmosphere in and around the
Council absolutely serene. Apparently it was
flot so outside. The principal promoter, Mr.
Sweezey, was busying himself trying to meet
ail the opposition which he had met in Quebee.
His excuse for retaining that array of counsel
is to be f ound in his inexperience, which is
evident when one reads bis testimony, and

his fear of the mighty opposition tha.t was ail
around him.
The large corporation interests in power in
Montreal and in the province had shown their
hand in the Legýisiature in 1927 and 1928.
They had succeeded in having an amendiment
rejected in 1927, but they failed when they
tried to oppose the amendments that were proposed in 1928.
Now, Mr. Sweezey came to Ottawa, and he
was quite sure that his opponents were on
bis heels. In fact some had reached here
before him. When hie went to the Hon. Mr.
McGiverin to retain him, he found that Mr.
McGiverin wa.s under a retainer by the enemy;
and when lie went to Mr. Daly, a barrister of
Ottawa. lie found likewise that Mr. Daly was
rctained by some other interest. He paid
considerable sums of money in order to protect himself and to further his interests. If

lie had consultedi me, I should bave told hi-m
that, as lie was himself an engineer, probably
hie did flot need any other enginieer; and as lie
had Mr. Geoffrion, a good lawyer, lie did not
need any other; and thus I should have caused
injury to the Bar of Ottawa.
I Iistened to my honourable friend from
Mr.
Lyncli-Staunton),
Hamilton
(Hon.
who knows something about retainers. My
honourable friend the dhairman of the Senate
committee (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and others have
been wondering what those higli fees -were for,
since apparentl3y there was no special or very
great legal work to be performed, or departmental work to be attended to. I want to say
that retainers are very often given without
any definite understanding as to whether there
will lie any work performed for them. Some
large corporations that I know of have been
in the habit of retaining certain high-class
barristers in Montreal-and I arn quite sure
that the samne thing is done in Torontosimply to make sure that other corporations
will not lie able to retain them.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: To create an atmospbere.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn speaking
now of bigli fees and retainers given by large
corporations to eminent counsel.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Name some.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The evidence says
the intention was to create an atmosphere.
No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is what the
evidence says.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You bave not
stuck to the evidence, thougli.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 sat in Council
during those months when the lawyers were
employed by Beauharnois, and I can say that
the atmosphere in Council was most serene.
We did not know there was apparently a
storm outside; we cared not a fig what the
outside atmosphere was.

The trend of the inquiry in the Gommons
and in the Senate has revealed a conviction
on the part of some people that certain senators were using their political influence to
help Mr. Sweezey obtain approval of bis plans.
But could senators do anyt.hing of tbat kind?
Some innocent and inexperienced people, like

Mr' Sweezey, may think that they could.
There seems to lie a general opinion throughout the country that if you want a favour
from the Government you must obtain that
favour through a friend of the Government.
0f course, no one will dispute my statement
that if any person wanted a favour of a
member of the present Cabinet, and if lie had
the opportunity of seeking that favour
through any senator, lie would approach a

senator on the Government side of the
House. That would lie only natural. After
all, a friend at court is more valuable than
an enemy, and it is only reasonable that an
inexperienced gentleman like Mr. Sweezey
should think that lie needed all the attorneys
in Ottawa, or as many as lie could get, to
help him. I do not know whether they were
all Liberals. I do not know about Mr.
DalyHe did not act

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Oh, yes.

Never.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But surely such
a common impression as that to which I have
referred should not work to the injury of any
of our colleagues. I have asked the question
whether any senators could possibly have
used influence to help in getting an Order in
Councit passed. When a matter of importance
comes before a Government, whether Liberal
or Conservative, it is examined simply on its
merits.
I am rerninded of an incident that took
place in the other House in the session of 1903.
Mr. Tarte, who had been Minister of Public
Works, had left the Government in October
or November of 1902, on the return of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier from Europe. Mr. Tarte
was sitting in the House beside members of the
Cabinet, of which he was no longer a member.
in the sessions of 1903 and 1901. On one
occasion the Opposition was attaýcking the
Government as best it could, in an attempt
to find something with which the Government
as a whole could be reproached. It happened
that Mr. Tarte had been a Minister jointly
responsible for the action which was under discussion. After the debate had proceeded for
some time, Mr. Tarte rose and spoke to his new
friends, on the left of the Speaker, in words
to Ihis effet: "I think that you are making
an error in spending so much time discussing
an Order in Counil, a ministerial action of
the Government, in an attempt to find something crooked. My experience is that when a
natter comes before a Governnent and is
presented to Council, it is considered on its
nierits. Conneil is composed of some of the
very best men from every province, whether
Liberal or Conservative, and there is nothing
that can prevent the best judgrment of a
niajority of the Cabinet fron prevailing. After
a natter has been disnssed and examined
from all anes,.the decision that is reached is,
in the opinion of the Ministers, or a majority
of theim, in the bet interests of the country.
If yon are trving to find something with which
to reproach the Government, I suggest that
you scrutinize the administration of the departments separately, and if one of those departments appears to be operated below the
proper standard you should make further inquiries and you may find something on which
to base an attempt to upset the Government.
But you vill never find any such basis of
attack in any action by nmembers of a Government as a whole:'
For eight years I was a mrember of Council

Couneillor in this Chamber-and I (an say

that all matters that come before the Government of Canada are treated seriously, conscientiously, and in the light of what the
Cabinet considers to bu the best interests of
the country. That does not mean that a
Cabinet will not err. But I appeal to every
Privy Councillor in this House to say wlether
the -people of Canada cannot have this assurance, that our Government is administered
in the light of the highest ideals and with a
view to the best interests of the country.
Now I come to the question of campaign
funds. The view of the majority of the committce on tiis matter may be summarized
in these words: contributions from people
expecting favours should not be accepted.
lat is a very good doctrine. But I ask my
honourable friends, is it constantly or generally applied? Do the trustees of campaign
iunds for either of the great parties. Conservative or Liberal, ever inquire as to the motives
of people who send in subscriptions, or who
are solicited for subscriptions?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

campaign funds who is calling on a prospect
for a large subscription, say in Monireal, bas
in the back of his mind any question as to
whether the prospect, if ho makes a contribution of $5.000 or $10,000, will have a
motive for doing so.

the few contribute large sums.
The honourable

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If from Toronto,
or Winnipeg, or Montreal-

APRIL 29, 1932
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Or HalifaxHon. Mr. DANDURAND: -or Halifax, a
list of subscriptions were produced by the
treasurers of both parties, it would be found
that many large corporations had subscribed
to both funds.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Do they do so in
equal proportions?
1 have heard
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
that many of them will give 75 per cent to
the Government forces and 25 per cent to
the Opposition. I have known of cases where
the reverse happenod.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: In some cases it is
fifty-fifty.
The wish of
Hon. Mr. DAN?'DURAND:
the committee that senators should abstai
from collecting funds, particularly from parties
who expect advantages, is nothing more than
a pious wish, if it goes no further. If we
resolved that henceforth, contrary to the eustom that has prevailed for many years,
senators should not be collectors or treasurers
of party funds, in my opinion our action
would be puerile. Such action would by no
means resuit in a cure of the ilîs affecting the
body politic.
If honourable senators who have been entrusted with the handling of party funds were
to produce a list of subscriptions received by
them, it would be found that at least half
of the contributors had had something to
do with the Government or had expected to
receive favours of some kind. Prior to July,
1930, I met men who were incensed at the
Robb budgets and who threatened me with
their displeasure if the Government did not
give them someHon. Mr. HATFIELD: Tariff concessions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -if the Government did not corne to their rescue in some
way. It would be interesting to read the list
of subscriptions to the Conservative Party
fromn Montreal iii July, 1930. I amn sure that
I should see certain names there.
The bonourable
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
gentleman did not subseribe, I suppose?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Order. That is cruel.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: His subscription would have been taken.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I have said,
the adoption of the recommendation that
senators should not receive subscriptions for
their parties, and especially from people who
expeet advantages from the Government,
would not curtail the practice of contributing

333

to party funds. Money is now spent for
campaign purposes by thousands of dollars
where in the past it was spent by hundreds.
The remedy is elsewhere. If we want to cure
the evil, we must abolish, or materially
diminish, the need of money. Why is money
so much in demand at election time? Apart
from publicity in the columns of the newspapers, of which my right honourable friend
to my right (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) spoke
yesterday, I say that the main need for
money is to meet the expenses necessarily incurred in inducing the elector to decide to
exercise his franchise, and in bringing him to
the poli. The next obligation to ho met is in
towns of ton, fifteen, twenty-five ýthousand or
more, for the registration of the voters.
Another large expenditure is necessary in order
to notify all the electors where they may vote.
Now, honourable senators, I desire to make
a statement, and I preface it with the truism
that democracy exercises sovereignty. It used
to be the duty of the king to choose his
ministers. Demos bas declared that it is now
our privilege. To that I would add that it
is also our duty, and I would suggest compulsory votîng. If the elector is made to corne
to the polI, even tbough it be only to put a
blank ballot into the box, he will begin to
realize that a duty has been imposed upon
bim. He now bas a privilege, but in very
many places the Ford motor car is no longer
regarded as a proper vehicle for the conveyance of electors to the polis.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That applies more
to the ladies, does it not?
To all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would suggest permanent lists under the
supervision of a permanent electoral officer.
There also should be permanent returning
officers who would maintain the voters' lists
and keep themn up to date, from day to day.
If this were provided for by the State it
would, I think, remedy the evils resulting
from the subscription of money by large
corporations, which gives them, perhaps, an
undue influence in the halls of parliaments
throughout the world. Furtbermore, I would
recommend the adoption of the system whiph
prevails, I think, in the city of Montreal,
whereby notice of where they are to vote is
sent to electors by a permanent returning
officer. In my opinion, if that were done, we
should save ourselves the humiliation of canvassing men who lack the flame, the passion
of party politics, but who subscribe because
they think it will be to their advantage to
do so, or because they fear they may be
treated wîth hostility or indifference in momenta of need if they do not. We should

free Parliament from the domination of big
interests, and clear up and purify the atmosphere.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

I submitted
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

that I leave to members of the Commons and
members of the Senate who have run elections.
After having affirmed in the presence of
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) that contributions to the two large
parties have come mainly from people who,
if the truth were known, expect favours from
the Government or are desirous of retaining
those that they have, I say that the Senate

gentleman. who has been Prime Minister of
this country, has experienced, like every other
Prime Minister, the humiliation of seeing
his best friends sent on the errand of collecting money for an election. It is all very
well to say that campaign funds are needed;
we all know that; but to this moment no
effort has been made to define clearly where
those subscriptions should come from. We
say we will draw a line between subscriptions
that are decent, as someone has said, and
those that are indecent. Between the two
there is a vast difference, and in regard to the
second class there are such varying shades

in which to work. That being so, I repeat:

The right honourable the leader of the
Jovernment in this Chamber has presented a
orilliant argument in favour of the report of
the majority of the committee, but I venture
to say that it has corne from one angle only,
that of the prosecution.
I stand by the
opinion of our delegates who were sent to
that inquiry. The senior among them, the
honourable member from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique), stands as high in the estimation
of this Chamber as any member of the
Senate; he stands as high as any other Montrealer in the city of Montreal; he is esteemed

by all, respected by all, admired by all. As
I have said, he entered that committee with
the intention of doing his duty judicially. He
was surprised-I may repeat it for him-to
find an atmosphere that was somewhat different
from what he had expected, but he listened
te the evidence-prejudiced as he had been,
I am sure, at the outset, when the news came
from the other Chamber-and when he returned from the committee he said, "I shall
vote against that report." You have heard
his speech.
As to the right honourable gentleman from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), I will
not, because he is here, say what we all think
of him. It was said this afternoon that he

the honourable member from Moncton (Hon.
Mr. Robinson), and the honourable gentlernan from Westmoreland (Hon. Mr. Copp)
have declared that they cannot reconcile themselves to voting for the report. We, on this
side, who selected them, shall not disown
them-; we shall vote against the report.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members of the Senate, I rise merely to make a
statement in regard to the opportunities which
were given to the four members of the special
committee from the other side of the House.
Perhaps before making that statement I should
explain my position. When this report was
brougit into the Senate, 1, as a member of
the conmittee, thought it would be my duty
to speak in support of it, but after listening
to the able, complete and eloquent presentation of the argument, of the chairman in
faveur of its adoption, and the eloquent summing-up of my right honourable leader, I felt
that there was no need for me to delay any
longer the taking of the vote.
When that report was brought into the
Senate, I felt and believed it to be a fair
and proper report, based upon the evidence.
I believe so still.
Now I come to the statement that I wish

member of the committee present on the
other side of the House. I will be careful to
make my statenent as correctly as I can. If

capable of doing.
On Thursday, the 14th of April, there was
an informal meeting of the committee in
roorn 258, the smoking room. Eight members
were present. The honourable member from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais), owing to illness, was absent, and the clerk of the committee was not present.
At that meeting
there was a general discussion as to the method

APRIL 29, 1932
of preparing the report, which resulted in the
chairman of the committee being instructed
to prepare a draft report. The honourable
senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique)
said that he also would prepare a report, and
the honourable senator froma Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Grieshacli) assured us that lie too would
bring in a draft report. Other members were
invited to bring in reports on particular
features, if they so desired. That was on
Tliursday, April 14.
On Wednesday of the following week, April
20, 1 met -the chai-rman. of the. committee, and
we fuirtlher dýise*ussed the pireiparation of the
report. We decided that we shouId anake an
effort to -have the report kirought in as soon as
possible, and also that it was proqier that thle
four members of the committee frors tihe other
side of the House should have an opportunity
te study the draft report before àt was
presented in the House. The ichairman. told me
-I was in his room-that lie would. take a
copy of the dfraft report, go and see Hon. Mr.
Béique, and give it to, him, and ait the same
time find. out if he had lis report ready. The
chairman, went te the room of Hon. Mr. Béique, taking a copy of the report with him,
and when lie came back toêld me thaît the honourable gentleman was neot in his room, but
was attendling a committee. Later on, about
the middle of the day, on Aqiri 20, the chairman of the committee hand-ed- a copy of the
report to t'he hon-ourable memiber from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique). I asked the
chairman if lie had told hi-m to take it up with
the other members of the committee. He
replied that lie had made a notation on it
thet it was for tihe consideration of the hon-ourable gentleman firom De Sallaberry and- the
,other members of the commjittee.
The chairman then had notices sent out for
a meeting on- Thursdiay morning. Wlien we
met on, Thur-iday morning we were rather
Gurpriscd to bie informed by Mr. Graham,
ýMr.,Copp and .Mr. Rohinson thae they lied not
seen a copy of the draft report. We feit
that it would be unfair to expect tliem to go
on without 'having an opportuniity to read the
report. Copies were thon prepared, and Mr.
Grahiam aind Mr. Copp assured, us that, as
4they were in the same room, one copy would
be sufficient for -them. Another copy was given
to Mr. Robinson, and the suggestion was made
-that we shouild meet -again oit 2.30.
Ri-glt Hon.. Mr. GRAJHAM: The first suggestion was 12 oclock.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Pooeibly. As a matter of fact, we did meet at 2.30. Honourable
gentlemen then olaimeid that tliey were not
ready to -considea, the report, and aisked for

335

moire time. We then adjourned until Fridýay
moeming.
As a matter of fact, one ceqiy of the report
was lianided te, Mr. Béique forty-eight hours
before the report was presen-teid, with tihe expectation that 'he woulld give lis colleagues
an opportun-ity to study it. When it was found
that lie had flot done so, they weze given
copies of the report, and had at leat twentyfouir hours within whioli to, examine into it.
When we met on Friday the three members I have reiferred te presented a signed
statement. I do not think I need deal with
that, as the riglit honouraîbde gentleman from
Egauv-illec (Right Hon. Mr. Grahiam) lias
read it, and it is now a matter of record.
There is just one other point. Some objection bas been takýen on the ground that a
request was made by Mr. Béique for a further
postpenement of 'consideration of the report,
on account of illness. As I stated a moment
ago, we had a meeting on the 14th. On Friday,
the lSth, the Senate adjourned until Tuesday
the 19th. If honourahie members care to look
over the Minutes of the Senate they will find
that Hon. Mr. Béique is entered as being
present in the Senate on the l9th, the 2Oth
and the 2lst; also, 1 understand, aithougli I
wvas not present, lie was active in different
committees. So lie liad lied a week to prepare
lis report. H1e did read a portion of lis draft
report to the chairman of the cnmmittee, but
lie did net care te band it over to him.
In. view of th4c feet that the honourable
member from De Salaberry lad been present
in the Soenate and taken part in the deliberations of committees, the chairman and other
members of the committee did net feel that
tbey should delay the report any further by
complying ivith bis roqucet. On Friday Mr.
Béique was not present. He did tell us on
Tlursday that lie would not be present on the
Friday; that lie was feeling vemy well, but
thait lie was going to Montreal on personal
business and, as 1 understood him, not on
the ground of illness. There lied been
some oriticism of the committee the day
before. Lt was tbe honourable member from
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke), I think, wlio
called attention to the fact that the committee
had been delîberating for two months. We
aise heard tbat prorogation was net very far
away if we could get through witli this matter,
and therefore we were eager to get along as
quickly as we could.
I submit that every roasonable opportunity
was given to the members of the comm-ittee
te study the draft report. 1 do net tbink that
honourable senators will disagreo when I say
that at the last meeting there was not mucli
hope expressed of a unanimous report.

much more. But as one of the carlier appointees of the late Government te this House
I feel that in se important a matter as this
I should net sit sulent, merely voting when
the time cornes. I want te express my opinion,
as shortly as 1 can, on one or two points.
My chief feeling about this whole proceedthe
in
ing, beginning with the discussion
lieuse of Commons, is that it is a matter of
partisanship from one end right te the other.
This is especially true of the persecution of
the senaters on this side. I doubt that wve
should bave heard anything about the Beauharnois matter if those men had net received
party contributions. There, I think, was the
root of the wbele affair. I will pay my compliments te the honourable gentleman who
act.ed as chaîrman of this committee (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) on the very able speech hie
delivered the other night, net as chairman,
but as prosecuting attorney. I do not think I
ever bofore heard a chairman's address quite
se fuîll of partisanship, absolutely disregarding ex erything, explanatory from the other
side and considering only those things whieh
lie migbt work up te condemn the men who
were being charged. There is only one inference for us te gather from the attitude of
the chairmian: althoughf counsel for the cernnmittee bas saitl, and'it, bas been stated, I
beliex e, in this House, that ne charge was
la"id. we know that these mon were condemned
and sentenced, and their executioner was
apipointed, long before the committee itself
%vas formed. If that is net partisanship 1
should like te know wbat it is. W\e had the
condemnation of those mon on publie record
-weeks before any ex idence xvas taken. If,
thon, we on this side feel that an injustice is
being done, we may well ask for sympathy
from the general public, and for consideration
of the whele matter frem our standpoint.
Much bas been said about the report itself.
I arn net geing te discuss that at lengtb. I
xvill only say that, far from being a report
of the Senate, it is simply the report of the
lieuse of Commens with a few paragraphs

a few paragrcphs here andi there about evidence taken hofore the special commiiittee of
tbe Sonate, our committce merely ratifies,
confirrns and approves, paragraph after paragraph, the findings by the committee of the
lieuse of Commons. On somne peints there
is nierely a lino or two from the findings of
the Commons committee. The right honourable gentleman w-ho leads this Huse (Rigbt
Hon. Mr-. Meighen) said the other day that
that report eould net have been partisan,

APRIL 29, 1932
because it ivas unanimous. I arn not going
to discuss again the question of unanimitY.
We have heard a good deal about it. As to,
whether the report is partisan or not, we have
merely to look it over and observe what
evidence wvas adduced. what evidence was put
down, and what evidence was suppressed.
Regarding the evidence taken before the
Senate committee, so far as it relates to the
report, I would point out one thing in particular. As shown on page 53 of the Senate
evidence, when counsel brought in the name
of John Aird, Jr., and the question of provincial matters was raised, the chairman said:
'We have nothing to do with that. It is outside the scope of our inquiry altogether." Yet
when the namne of Hon. Howard Ferguson was
mentioned the committee met and arranged
to hear Mr. Ferguson's evidence, which was
entirely without the terms of the reference to
the committee. The committee insisted on
hearing Mr. Ferguson on this provincial
matter; it even called a special meeting, and
it would flot wait for counsel, even an hour.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Will the hon ourable
gentleman permit me to ask him a question?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hoiu. Mr~. HARDY: I do not give way to
If the honourable chairman had kept
you.
hais head for a moment, when Senator Haydon
mentioned Mr. Ferguson's namne he would
have taken the proper course-ruled aI that
evidence out. That evidence had nothing to
do with the inquiry and did not come within
its scope. It is not within the jurisdiction of
this House, or of Parliament itself. I think a
great deal of bitterness, not only in this debate,
but in feeling throughout the whole province
of Ontario, would have been eliminated had
the chairman there observed a strictly nonpartisan stand-had he stuck to what he had
previously said, as reported on page 53, that
those provincial matters were entirely out of
the committee's jurisdiction.
I have said that these honourable gentlemen
had been condemned before they were heard,
or before any evidence was taken. Some
twenty years ago a very distinguished parliamentarian referred to the right honourable
leader of this House-I amn sorry he is not
here-as the gramophone of two very famousperhaps I should say notorious--railway buccancers. It is strange that the whirligig of
time should have placed that samne right honourable gentleman in this House and that he
should be playing the samne musical instrument at the behest of the very man who
designated him as the gramophone of Mackenzie and Mann. It is amazing what extra-

337

ordinary circumstances occur through the passage of time. We are constantly seeing fresh
illustrations of the old adage that politics
makes strange bedfellows.
The decision that we have before us concerning the three huitourable senators was made
in advance of the hearing of evidenoe. We
who are on the minoi ity side of the House,
though we may be hieipless to prevent the
adoption of the report, are justifiMd in stating
our position and opposing, as far as we can,
the attempts to undermnine the position of not
only these three honourable members, but of
the whole Liberal Party, to which they belong.
I think I neod say very littie at ail about the
case of Senator Raymond, after what has been
said by the honourable senator from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) to-day. It seems
to me that the proper thing for the chairman
of the committee to do is to, ask that Senator
Raymond's name be deleted entirely from the
report. The right honourable leader of the
House said ycsterday:
The committee makes no express censure of
Senator Raymond. The committee does say,
evidently more by way of guidance for the f uture th-an for any other purpose..that At
disapproves of the action of senators in beeoining largely interested in companies which
are dependent upon government concessions...
The latter part of those remarks has nothing
to do with Senator Raymond, though perhaps
the right honourable gentleman had his eye
directed particularly towards this side of the
House when he made them. I repeat that if
there is no censure of Senator Raymond his
Dame should be deleted from the report.
The evidence concerning senators Raymond
and McDougald bas been discussed so
thoroughly that 1 should be wasting the time
of the House if I went into the matter further.
But I want to say that I agree with every
word uttered by the right honourable senator
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). 1
have known Senator Haydon for nearly thirty
years, persunally and professionally. I have
been associated with him as a colleague on
university and charity organization boards, to
which he contributed not only wise counsel,
but also, fnancial assistance beyond what his
means justified. I know that bis honour, his
kindness of heart and Mis generosity are such
as ta make him a truc gentleman. When he
says that he did not take a contingent retainer, or a retainer of any kind inconsistent
with his office, I believe him. I do not care
how the right honourable leader of the House,
in his extraordinary way, manipulated the
evidence last night. The right honourable
gentleman was running true to form. That is
the sort of tbing that has made him the most

outstanding debater and the most outstanding
failure in the political life of Canada to-day.
The chairman of the committee says that
great consideration and kindness were shown
to Senator Haydon. As to that, I would ask
honourable senators to read the evidence.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I believe that some
members
of the committee
deliberately
blinded themselves to the condition of Senator
Haydon. I was told by two persons-I do
not say they were members of the committee,
but they were connected with it-that Senator
Haydon was not as ill as he was alleged to be.
One person said to me, "He is no more sick
than you or I." That shows the spirit in
which Senator Haydon was approached.
I
know what his condition is, and I say that if
he used language unbecoming a witness, he
had every excuse for doing so. If he at times
showed any asperity, we should make every
allowance in his favour because of the grinding examination to which be was subjected.
A great deal has been made of the retainer
that was paid to the law firm of McGiverin,
Haydon and Ebbs. Well, $50,000 is a handsome sum. But I do not think that anyone
who is connected with business in a large way
will say that $50,000 was an extraordinary retainer to be paid by a $75,000,000 conpany.
Any company of that size that bas to pay
no more than $50,000 as a legal retainer is
getting away very cheaply. If I am allowed to
make a personal reference, I can say that I
know the same law firm got a much larger fee
for work that did not take them six rnonths.
Indeed, the fee was larger than the 850,000
plus the annual payments of 815,000 that were
to be made by Beauharnois to this firm for
three years. The party who paid this larger
retainer felt that be was getting good value
for bis monev. I know, because I was one
of the interested parties.
I must make some reference to the great
speech that was made by the right honourable
leader of the House last night. Whether we
sit on this side or the other side. we must
a(limit that it was a great speech. It was the
kind of speech that bas built up for him the
repuftation of being the keenest and most incisive debater in Canada. Last night was the
first time I ever had the pleasure of hearing
him speak at length. because I never had an
instrument that would enable me to hear him
in the House of Commons. His extraordinary
mental activities are nothing less than amazing. He bas a marvellous memory, one such
as very few men possess. While I listened te
his extrenely acute deductions I could not
help wondering why he is leading this House
instead of leading anothor House, or occupyHon.

ing a very much higher position than is available in Parliament. I think the explanation
is that he has been engaged in mental gymnastics for so long that his particular ability
is well known and is discounted. We realize
that ho could come here to-morrow and make
a speech just as incisive and just as cutting in
favour of the honourable gentlemen mentioned
in the report as was his speech of last night
in attack upon them. In other words, I believe that the people of this country do net
think he is sincere.

gave the right honourable gentleman a piece
of an old shoc-lace, a shred of cloth and a footprint, he could hang almost any honourable
memnber of this House on the evidence.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

parliamentary work here, and he said that

Hon. Mr. HARDY: The right honourable
gentleman said that apparently they were not
lawyers but perfumers. I wonder if his mind
takes him back five or six years to the time
when two or three companies, with capital of
millions each, were formed in the city of
Toronto, and at the head of the prospectus
if
each company appeared his name, Right
Hon. Arthur Meighen, as that of Chief Counsel and Chairman. Was that name put on
those prospectuses to create an atmosphere?
I know it created a very sweet perfume when
a canvasser came te my office. I subscribed
for a very substantial sum, and I told the canvasser that I did so for one reason. that the
right bonourable gentleman's name was there.
But that perfume does net smell quite so sweet
te me to-day.

APRIL 29, 1932
May I refer ta one aspect of the inquiry
concerning Senator Mcflougald, as ta whether
he had an interest in power development such
as lie spoke about in April, 1928. It neyer
occurred ta me, and I do flot think it did to
any other honourable member of this Huse,
that the senator's denial referred ta anything
but Beauharnois. That was the matter before Parliament at the time, and I consider
toa much stress has been laid upon the charge
against Senator McDougald that lie made a
deliberate misstatement, in view of bis connection with the Sterling Company. Each
honourable member will have ta reach bis own
conclusions on this matter, but I do flot think
AL fair ta empliasize the charge that lie was
is
interested in Sterling when lie said he liad noa
interest in Beauharnois. I repeat that I believe it was in the minds of ail lionourable
members at tlie time tliat bis reference was
simply ta Beauliarnois.
My good friend the lionourable gentleman
from Winnipeg (Han. Mr. McMeans)-I use
that term advisedly, because heis agood friend
of mine-said that he approached discussion of
the committee's report witli the greatest delicacy. I wonder what the honourable gentleman
wvould do if lie got inta full play. 1 arn not
going ta take exception ta what he said, because
1 know lie means kindly. H1e lias strong
opinions an everything, but that is ail right.
However, if he was treating the matter with
real delicacy iast rnght, 1 should nlot want ta
be in bis road if lie ever broke into a real riat.
He referred ta the Bermuda voucher. I have
that voucher here. This is the first time I have
seen iL. The evidence of Senator McDougald
with regard ta this matter appears at page 180
and following pages in the printed report of the
special committee of the Senate. It should nat
bie necessary ta make any further explanation
on this point, beause the evidence is clear and
complete and was accepted as sucli by the committee.
The account rendered by Senator McDougald's office ta the Beauharnois Company,
Exhitiit No. 118 in the proceedings of the

bouse of Commons select committee, in no

Haydon. As explained by Senator McDougald,
at pages 180 and fallowing ai the Senate committee's proceedings, iL related solely ta bis
personal expenses an bis trip from Montreal
ta Bermuda and return, and bis personal expenses incurred while in Bermuda, and in fia
way, either directly or indirectly, ta the expenses of the ather two gentlemen named.
It lias already been explained that the account was rendered ta the Beauharnois Company by Senator McDougald's office without
bis knowledge, in bis absence, and in tlie
absence af bis persanal secretary, as tlie result
of a telephone meýsage fromn someone in the
company ta a book-keeper in the senator's
employ. The account was worded as follows:

APRIL 29, 1932
My particular abject in rising at this time
is ta take adjvantage of the oppo>rtunitY, S I
think I should, to make some remarks in reference ta -the activities of the National Advisory
Co'mmittee. I lia4ppened ta be a memiher of that
com:mlittee fram. its; formation in 1924, and at a
'iater diate was chairman for a short period of
time. I ledl that it is d'ue ta the otjher members of ithe board that I shoulid give some
explanýations in Teference ta certain questions
that have arisen, in order ta olear up certain
misunderstandings. 1 believe that the sincerity of -the report of thagt committee 'has
been challenngecd, and I think this -is an opportune time for me ta answer.
The right honouraible member from Eganville (Right Han. Mr. 'Graham), in his very
able addrcss of yesterday, went into the early
history af thc National Advisory Cnmmittce.
He read the Order in Council -defining the
powers and duties of that committee, and
mentianed the names af variaus gentilemen
I think lie
who occupied positions on it.
estahlished in the miýnd ai this Hanse the fact
tJist -the gentlemen named! in the recommendation ta the Governor in Council for appointment ta the board, even thougli they were
intercsted in -poweor prajeats6, were actuated by
no othe-r desire thain ta serve -the in'terest of
the public as far as they possibly ýcourld, and
ta keep out of thei-r deliberatians anything
th-at might have a bearing u'pan their private
interests in projeets of that kind.
I da naot intend ta fallow the line taken by
the riglit lionourable member from Eganville
(Riglit Hoýn. Mr. Graham) in .referring ta the
activities af that cammittee. 1 should like,
however, ta ask honourable gentlemen ta cast
their -minds hack for a moment ta the work
that this -commit-tee had in view, and ta remember ýthat it involved the consideration. of
one ai the grcatest, anc of the most colossal
projects ever propo.sed an the North Aimerican
continent.
1 shall ipass aver the twa years that elapsed
after the joint board ai engincers appointed
by the gavernments of the United States and
Canada started on their work af survey and
investigation. Permit me ta say, however,
ihat during these two years a great deal of
prapaganda wa.s ciruiated, and a great deai
oi free advice was received by the committee

others wlio tliaught they knew what shoul1d

bhat if one had undertaken ta peruse it alf
anc would not have been aible ta acamplisli
very mucli else.
Now I shaîl endeavour, as far as I possibli
and reasonably can, ta establish ta the satisiac
tion ai the riglit lionourable gentleman whc

leads the Government (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Meighen) that some of the observations that
lie made in lis very able address last evening
were such as he would. fot have made had lie
given to this phase of the matter the attention
that lie gave to the evidence and certain other
portions af the subject-matter under discussion. 1 think that when I point out certain
things to him lie will be fair enough to realize
that.
The first point that I want ta dlean up
relates ta the statement, which has been made
from time ta time, that in connection with
the work of the National Advisory Committee
there was subînitted a minority report. I
should like honourable gentlemen, when they
get dn opportunity of doing so, to look at
the end of this report signed hy Mr. Beaudry
Leman and the late Hon. Mr. Turgeon of the
Province of Quebec. It will lie noted that
what it contains are merely observations by
certain members upon the report of the

clauses, and I think that if honourable gentlemen read those observations carefully and
closely they will find in them little or no deviation from the principle of the report of the
National Advisory Committee. Theref are I
do n-ot think it is reason-able ta state that this
was a minority report.
Then I should like ta point out that these
observations are signed by Mr. Beaudry Leman, of the city of Montreal, a gentleman of
reputation who has occupied the very important position of president, I think, of the
Banque Nationale.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

General man-

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: In any event, lie has
occupied a very important position in the city
of Montreal, and I do not think that any.body who knows him would- say that in
making those observations lic was actuated
by anything but a desire to serve the hest
interests of the people of Canada, or that the
fact that he was interested in power companies wauld change lis opinion or have any
influence whatever upan any suggestions or
observations he might make as a member of
the National Advisory Committec.
In this connection I should lilhe ta cali the
attention of honourable gentlemen to a state*ment made last evcning by the riglit lionourable the leader of the Government touching
this phase of the matter. He said:
Possibly this is the place ta refer parenthetically ta that section of the speech we have
just heard whieh was designed ta convince
hionourable members that a grave injustice had

this in sone unspecified way affected the guilt or
innocence of those accused. I had never known
that the report of the Commons conmmittee contained any sneer on this National Advisory
Board. On the whole, I think, pretty good men
were appointed. But there is contained in the
report, in the course of a review of the occurrences, a reference to the alppointment of that
body, stating the naines of only two membersRight Hon. ;Senator Grahani and Sir Clifford
Sifton-and the way in which the members are
referred to is this: it is said that the cominittee
"incluled" those two men and other men "interested in hydro-electric development." That is
the sneer.

Personally I should like to know what is the
eustom regarding campaign funds, a matter
whieh has been brought into this discussionin fact, one of the most important features of
this whole investigation. I have run a few
elections myself, and I have been the head of

sphere I occupied for some time.

APRIL 29, 1932
I arn going now to get back to the purpose
for which I rose, and that is ta refer to
another matter in connection with the Advisory
Committee discussed by the right honourable
leader of the Government last evening. Speaking about the report of that board, and the
fact that in that report there was no recommendation with regard to the north shore
of the river, hie said:
But will honourable gentlemen be astounded
to learn that the committee neyer made any
sueh recommendation at all, and that this
virtue, which has been s0 strongly stressed as
appertaining to Senator MeDougaild, siniply
does net exist? I have read the report, I have
it here, I have sulenitted it ta honourable gentlemen opposte, and I def y anyone to find a
recommendation in the report cd the National
Advisory Cominittee in faveur of the north side
or of any side. The report of the committee
miakes reference to the report of the Joint Engineering Board, which apparently wau coinpased of three egeerg from Canada and
three frein the Unitnýe States, and it adopts
that report--.concurs, is the word used-to the
extent of the finding that t-hs canalazation
scheme of the whole St. Lawrence is feasible.
Beyond that one article of concurrence it does
not adopt a word of t'be 9eport. Indeed, in two
special instances it decl.ee that there will have
to be fýurther investigation before any tting of
value cau be got out of the Joint Engineering
Boa.rd's report. I repeat that in the report
of the National Advisory Committee signed by
the majority, which included Senator McDougald,
there is nlot a word of adoption, of concurrence,
in any way, with reference ta the north side
or any other side. directly or indirectly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Hlear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER:
One can co.mprehend how bard put these
caunsel were ta try ta find something nti
long proceesion of events ta place ta te credit
af Senator McDougald, when tbey laid stress
on the importance of something that did net
exist. No ane for a moment can argue that
it did exist. Therefore, Senator McDougald lu
this regard neyer acted against bis owu interests.
I would point out ta the right honourable
gentleman thaý ai ter thase two years and a
half in whieh the Joint Board of Engineers
was carrying on its work, we gathered, together
in Ottawa expressly ta take into consideration
the repart of tbat Joint Board. On receiving
its report we made a repart ta the Gavernmïent of Canada. And this is wbat we said:
We concur in the finding of the Joint Board
of Engineers, etc.

I would draw my right honourable friend's
attention ta clause 6, on page 20. Let us se
whetber or not this clause bas any indirect
referenoe ta this matter. 1 want ta read all
the clause. It 8tarts off:
The Committee bas gien ca.reful thought to
the financial side of the international situation.

Then it gaes an:
We are of opinion that it would not be unreasonable te expect the Unàted States ta undertake the entire work, bath for navigation
and power, in the international section, and
we are furtber of tbe opinion that even if the
United States shauld do so the preponderance
of outlay will bave been with Canada. In support of this contention, tbe following figures
are subm-dtted, based ou expeuditures by bath
cauntries on the present tbrough waterway,
and on tbe estimated cost of the presently recammended scbeme witb 27-ft. navigation.
The recommended sebeme for navigation
was a scbeme recommended by the Joint
Board af Engineers.

From the report of the Joint Board of Engineers. I claim it is an indirect reference to
that report.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I never denied that there was a reference to it, but
you do not adopt it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think the
right honourable gentleman did not read this
part of the report.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I read it, and
I sent it to my right honourable friend, and
he could not find the recommendation.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They accepted
the north shore.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I am now going to
refer to certain statements made by the
honourable member for Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), chairman of the committee which investigated this matter. He refers to the report of the National Advisory Committee,
andi he challenges the good faith of that report;
there is no question about that. I am not
going to read all that he said. He stated that
in one part of the report we advocated that
owing to the general conditions existing in
this country, due to the high debt of the
country and the financial situation, the scheme
should not be proceeded with, but we recoinmended that it should be gone on with by
private agencies. He did not stop at that.
Referring to a member of this House who was
a member of the National Advisory Committee, he made this statement:
There was the situation. Yet Senator McDougald said he forgot about Sterling because
the majority of the Advisory Conmittee said the
development should be on the north si-de of the
river. But the najority also said: "Don't go on

with the north side at all.

Don't mnake a move.

You have not the noney."

And then they said:

"Get along with this Quebec section. Turn it
over to private interests. We know thern; we
can put our hands on them."
I ask honourable gentlemen if they think
that is a fair statement to come from one
selected to judge in a fair, unbiased manner

Senate.

to find the large sunms required for needen

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
Read the other
paragraph.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I am going to. It
was for the Government to say whether they
wanted to spend 8200,000,000 on such a projcet, and it was our business to suggest various ways in which development could be
carried on. We were not putting in a report
that the Governrment had to follow. The
first suggestion was that the development
could be financed as a public undertaking at
a cost of about $200,000,000. 'But there was
another possible way. We said, in paragraph 4:
We are of opinion, however, that an arrangenient migbt be made which would make possible the undertaking at little, if any, public
expense, so far as Canada is concerned. The
St. Lawrence, between Montreal and Lake Ontario, consists of a national and international
section, and, with the exception of the Welland
Canal, the international problem continues
throughout to the head of the lakes. We believe that the first concern of this Com.mittee
should be, and of the Government will be, the
national aspects of the proposed undertaking,
and we regard it as most desirable that the
initial development take place in the purely
donmestie section of the river lying within the
Province of Quebec.
We believe that if a

APRIL 29, 1932
reasonabie time were permitted in which to
enable the resultant power Vo be economieally
a'bsorbed the development of this national section wouid be undertaken by private agencies
able and willing to finance the entire work, inciuding the necessary canalization, in return
for the right to develop the power.
The Government ddd not proceed to follow
the flrst, suggestion, which would have involved an expenditure of $200,000,000, but
apparently they have gone ahead, in accordsuce with paragrapb 4, with the building of
a canal in that river. In this way the Government have got a canal, as was pointed out
by an honour&bie member this afternoon,
valued at $16,000,000. Furthermore, considerable revenue is .being obtained by tihe Province of Quebec. I ask honourabie members if
tbere is -anything wrong with a recommendation that had such resuits as those. There is
nothing wrong, as far as I can see. No criticismn can be made of the National Advisory
Committe for .mak.ing these alternative suggesticns. And I want to, say here that I lielieve that no member of the National Ad-elsory Commiittee, including the honouralble
senator from Wellngton (Hon. Mr. McDougald), used his position on the committee
Lo furtber bis personal interests, if hie had any.
May I briefly refer to the bonourabie mcmbers whose conduct bas been the subject of
.mquiry? The right bonourabie leader of the
House said last nighit that a distinction must
be drawn between Senator Raymond and the
other two senators, but that bis actions were
considered by the committce members to warrant a rebuke. Now, before we vote for or
against the adoption of the cornmittee's report
1 think we sbould know wbetber Senator Rayrnond's namne bas been rernoved from the report and whetber or not ha bam been given a
clear discbarge. As far as I can see from reading the report, hie bam not been freed from
censure, and I do flot tbink that bonourable
members sbould get the impression from certain remarks made by the right honourable
leader of the flouse and by the chairman of
thie committee tbat Senator Raymond is no
longer involved in the report. If the coinm-ittee considers that hie did not do anything
inconsistent witb bis position as a senator, the
report sbould state that.
As to Senator McDougadd, it seems to me
that the main charge is that bie deoeived honourable members of this flouse. In plain
language, bie either lied to the flouse or hie
did not. As far as I arn concerned, in passing
judgment upon the add.ress whicb lie made in
the Senate on April 19, 1928, I arn prepared
to accept his sworn evidence that lie acquired
his internat in tbe Beauharnois Corporation
after lie made the address. And in that re-

347

gard I arn not guided by bis evidenoe alone,
for it bas been corroborated by the testimony
of Mr. Barnard an-d Mr. Bankis. According to
the sworn evidence of these gentlemen, the
Beaubaruois transaction, so far as Senator McDougald was concerned, was not completed untii some tirne in May. It bas been said that
the transaction was a concocted or mysterious
affair of some sort. But what do we flnd?
There was nothing very strange about it. It
took place after Senator McDougald made bis
address. Mr. Barnard testified as Vo the particulars and dates, and toid about the reoeipt
given by the late Mr. Winfield Sif ton for payment for bis shares. It seems Vo me that there
is nothing at ail in these charges against Senator McDougald.
I arn not very well acquainted with Senator finydon, but from bis standing in this
community I should judge that lie wouid not
swear to anything that hie did not believe
was true.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. POSTER: Senator Haydon, or
bis law flrm, received a retainer of 850,000. I
do not need to go into the details concerning
it. It bas been stated that bie accepted tbat
retaining fee for the use of bis influence in getting an Order in Council passed. But I submit that ail tbe influence in Christendom
would be of no av ail for sucli a purpose. If
the Prince of Wales came to Canada and used
ail the influence at bis command, lie could flot
get such an Order in -Council through unless
there were a favourabie report by departmnental
engineers. Wbat influence could bave resulted
in the passing of an Order in Council such as
tbis, unless the engineers had reported that
the proposed deveiopment wouid not interfere witb navigation? If the engineers said
that it would interfere witb navigation, no
influence would bave been strong enougli to
get the Order in Couneil tbrougb. It was
yes or no.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Wiil my honourabIe
fricnd permit me Vo ask bim a question? How
is it that the Order in Council was passed, before tbe plans of the company were approved?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Certainly tbe plans
bad to be approved. The approval was part
of the work done by the departmental engineers.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: How did tbe coinpany succeed in getting the Order in Council
through before there was that approval?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: That neyer bappened.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, it did.

Hon. Mvr. FOSTER: I say the payment of
the retaining fea and the alleged use of influence had nothing ta do with getting the
Order in Council passed.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

But it did.

Han. Mr. FOSTER: Time wvas the essence
of the whole thing. Honourable members
know the procedure connected with the passing of Orders in Council. Time was very important in this instance. There wcre clouds
on the company's financial horizon and it was
necessary that action should bo taken with as
little delay as possible. And I say that if
Senator Haydon did make any representation
to a member of the Government with regard
to the urgent necessity of getting the Order
in Council through. having in mind that the
principle of the Order in Council was not
involved, he did not do anything unbecoming
a senator.

But if I did need any assistance in making

passionate appeal for non-partisan consideration of the matter that is now before us, but
-in cooler and quieter moments I wondered
whether there was anything of a non-partisan
character in the report that was sulymitted by
the special committee.
I was particularly influenced by the speech
of the hanaurable gentleman from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp), who ýfollawed the
right honourable leader, and also by that of
the honourable gentleman from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robi*nson) this afternoon. They
revealed some facts cancerning the ýcperatians
of the cammittea, especially in connection
with the drafting of the report th.at xvas suhmitted ta this body. It seems ta me that if
there had been a desire for non-partisan consîderetion of the evidence that was submitted, ail the inembers of the cammittee shculd
hav e been asked ta gather together and attcinpt ta frame a unýanimaus report. I shaîl
be taltl et once that ,oich a repart would hae
boon impossible. It mev ho so, but 1 ihink
thet ihe people of the country woffld hae
boon better ,satisfied if an attempt hed boon
made ta dret t a unanimous report. No uch
a
attrnmpt wes 1-edo. On the (nir.the,
meý,.Iaritv-, prepered e report end handecl it ta
the minority for acceptance or rejectian. As
fer as I have heen able ta gather from whet
has, heon said here, the minarity wcre nat
givon an uppartunity ta suhmit amendments.
In view of theso facets, what conclusion must
wvoincvitaily rea-ch? 1 submit the only passible conclusion is that the report presented
ta us is a partisan report. Theýre was na
ettc.mpt ta make it a repart representative of
bath parties in this Chamber.
I amn net fuIliy satisfied with aIýl that has
been revealcd in connectian with the Beauharnais matter; there are a number of things
that 1 should like ta have 'oleared u:p. But I
nover will ho content ta accept the findings
of a party ma.Iarity and allow them ta influence my opinion of ýmy honourablo colleagues in this Hanse. I feel that as a result
of what thîs committee has done we are nat
giving ta the public at large a correct pict.ure of what gaes en haro, but 'that on, the

that in this Chamber we are pronounced partisans and view important questions from a

partisan standpoint.
decision reached hy some body that would

APRIL 29, 1932
view the matter fromn a judicial standpoint,
and convey to the people of this country a
comapiete understanding of the whole situation.
Strong political partisanship was also evideneed, 1 think, in the earlier speeches in this
debate. I have no complaint to offer as to
the speech made by the right hanouraJble the
leader of the House. I think be made the
type of speech that one would expect from
him. Whi-le he did nat stir any paa'rty passions within me, I feit 'that some of the earlier
speeches bore out the character of the Teport
su'bmitted ta the House.
There are two or three matters in cannection with this investigation that I think have
left in the public mind the impression that
ail the guilt lies with one party in this country. Reference lias been made to campaign
funds. I arn no hypocrite in regard ta campaign funds. I feel that there is a good deal
of hypocrisy on this question, but the blamne
goes back to the very people who criticize
campaign funds and the methods of raising
them-the people themselves. If it were not
for the failure of the people of this country
to put their hands into their pockets and help
the political parties in which they believe, there
would be na necessity for the taking of rnoney
from corporations or wealthy individuals. We
know that through the years contributians
have been made ta the political parties of this
country by corparations and individuals who
were seeking favours frorn the Gavernment. 1
can recaîl a speech delivered by a very distinguished. gentleman. now the leader of the
Goverinnent of this country, in which lie
nlleged-and 1 think with every foundationthat one Canadian railroad was a generous contributor to the funds of both the political
parties of that tiîne. If that railroad was a
contributor, undoubtedly it was expecting
something -in return.
Whether maney cames into the liands of the
party through a senator, a member of the
House of Commons or some other individual.
it is wrong to convey to the people of the
cauntry the idea, that only one party is receiving contributions, or that only one party
is seeking contributions, from corporations in
Canada. I say that the evil can be removed
only by a change in the attitude of the public
of Canada towards the cost of elections, and
contributions for the expenditures of candidates.
While tliere is no recomamendation cancerning it, there is empliasis placed upon tlie pyramiding of shares in connection witli tliis Beauharnais projeet, in order that the people af
the country may lie led ta believe tliat one
person has made a great deal of wvealth
through bis investment. Into that matter I do

349

flot care to go, in sa far as the evidence is concerned, but I should like to say this, and 1
think this is the proper occasion on which to
say it: that the people of Canada as a whole
are very critical of the methods of finance that
have been adopted in Canada in recent years.
It is not right to say that the financial operafions of this company, or its methods of finance, were peculiar to it alone. Those methods
have been the mcthods of ail the large corporations in Canada for many years. I do flot
say for a moment that any honourable members of this House have participated in sueh
operations, but I do say that ail the large
financial companies have on many occasions
proceeded in a similar .way to allot stock. So,
to convey the impression that this was an
unusual case, and that a senator was getting a
greater benefit from it than anyone else, is to
mislead the public.
I believe that if the committee, in its efforts
to clean up polities in business in Canada,
had gone further in its recommendation in
connection with campaign funds, and had
struck boldly at watered stock and pyramided
stock,' it would have satisfied the people of
the country that it was caring for more than
party politics and party advantage.
Now, honourable senators, 1 came to this
Chamber with a perfectly open mind on the
question before us; in fact, as the publisher
of a newspaper I have on two or three occasions uttered criticismns of some of the methods
practised in connection with the organization
and financing of this company; but I arn not
prepared to accept this report as submitted
to this House, because it would compel me to
accept findinga with which I do not agree in
regard to several colleagues in whoma I have
the greatest confidence, men in whom 1 arn
still willing to believe, particularly when they
make statements upon oath before a body of
feliow senators. I do feel, however, that in
the interests of this buse and of those
senators something must be done hy a nonpartisan tribunal of sonne kind ta clear up the
whole question and to satisfy the people of
Canada at large.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators, I understand that an agreement bas been
reached that the House should adjourn at Il
o'clock. I therefore beg ta move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, in view of certain conversations I
have had with the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), I may explain that
we are asking only for the first reading of
this Bill to-day. It was the intention, when
I spoke to him, to ask for the second and
third readings, that the Royal Assent might
be obtained at 5 o'clock. The request in that
respect is withdrawn. I am glad to say the
Sena)te will have time to give full consideration to this measure. I suggest that, if the
House will agree, the second reading might
be on Friday next. As to that, the only point
in my mind is that I know some honourable
senators would like net to be called for Friday
next, on account of Thursday being a holiday,
but I do not like to take the responsibility of
putting this treaty off longer.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJEOT
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed fromn April 29 the
adjourneil debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Tanner for concurrence in the report of the
special committee appointed for the purpose
of taking into consideration the report of a
.special committee of the House of Commons,
of the last session thereof, to investigate tbe
Beauharnois PoweT Projeet, in so far as it
relates to any honourable members of the
Senate.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES:- Honourable members,
on rising to present my views on the question
now before the House 1 shail refrain, for two
reasons, from, going into the history and preliminary details of the Beaubarnois Power
Corporation or the Beaubarnois Light, Heat
& Power Company: first, because I could not
do so if I would, and second, because I think
such a mass of details only beclouds the issue
and produces no practical resuits. I shaîl try
to get at the kernel of the thing in my own
wav, and in the shortest possible time.
The case appears to me to, be about as
f ollows. If these men, or any of them, bave
broken any law of the land which entails a
penalty, or if they have violated any provision of the constitution which determines
the qualifications of a senator and defines bis
duties and responsibilities, they must bear the
consequences, however unfortunate or unpleasant these consequences may be. On the
other hand, if they have broken no law of
the land, nor violated any provision of the
constitution which determines the qualifications of a senator and defines bis duties and
responsibilities, to infiict any punisbment upon
them, in property or in character, would be,
as I see it, the rankest injustice that could
well be conceived. If tbese men have done
notbing but what bu-ndreda of other men, both
ia and out of Parliament, have done since
Confederation without incurring any penalty,
for the Senate to infiet punishment upon
these men would be adding extreme partisanship to injustice. Further, if this bonourable
House should so far forget wbat is due to
itself as to be influenced in its decision by
political party affiliations, every honest person
in Canada shouiri rise up and demand the
abolition of the Senate. Since I have had a
scat in this honourable House I have seen

351

hardly a trace of party polities, and 1 do flot
think I have seen even a trace in the consideration of weighty matters. I fear, however,
that that condition of things is at an end, and
I very much fear that its passing will flot be.
to the advantage of either the Senate or the
country.
The question, then, is: Have these men
broken any law of the land, or violated any
principle of the constitution which determines
the qualifications of a senator and defines bis
duties and reszponisiýbidities? As I read the
British North America Act and the S-enate
and House of 'Commons Art, they have not.
1 arn not learned in the law, and therefore I
may not be aible to appraise ail the fine points
in it. We laymen must leave the technical
interpretation of the law to the lawyers, who,
by the way, are silmoSt sure to disagree. We
are compelled to interpret the law for ourEelves when, as in the present instance, we are
oblige-d to act in a judicial capacity. We have
theriefore to try to catch thse spirit of the law
rather than the letter, knowing, as we do, that
the letter killeth, whe.reas the spirit quickeneth
an~d giveth life.
I considering this question we must not
lose sight of this important fact: tbougb the
case against the accused has been argued by
the three able&t lawyers in this House, and
perhaps in Canada, ýnot one of themn bas
asserted that these rnen have offended, against
the plain *meaning of the law in the plain sections of the Acts 1 have mentioned. The hionourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Stauntan) -cites section 18 of the British
North Ameri-ca Act, which refers to the privileges, immunities and powers we senators
possess, and wbhich bie brushes aside. But we
arc flot concerned, for the moment, about our
rights. Two of us are being tried for offences
against the -law, but even the bonourable member fromn Haimilton intimates, almost states,
that no offenýce against the constitution or
statute law bas been committed. He positively
states that Senator McDougald ýcould find
justification for ail bis financial transactions
in conneetion with this ýmatter in the Companies Aet, which is the law of the land. He
says, however, that Senator McDougald and
Senator Haydon have offended against bonour,
and aga.inst the ethical standards which govern
public life, that Senator Haydon uttered a
gratuitous and unbrutlhfuq statement about the
High Commissioner in London, and that, therefore, both senators should be formally censured by tbis House and ýdriven from public
life; and that from a decision by a majority
of this House there is no appeal.
Now, it must be apparent to everybody that
if this code of hon-our and these ethical stand-

352

SENATE

ards depend upon a decision by a majority of
either House, they may vary from time to time
as the political complexion of Parliament
changes. So it has come to this, that the
British North America Act and the Senate and
House of Commons Act, under which we
thought we were living, and which we thought
protected us, may be suspended or abrogated,
and any member of either House who may
have the misfortune or the temerity to offend
the majesty of the majority, may be destroyed,
may be driven out of public life, and his place
declared vacant and filled by a person of the
right political faith. And this is not Russia;
this is Canada in the twentieth century, where
freedon has broadencd down from precedent
to precedent. I very mueh fear that the serious
economic conditions with whi.ch we are now
facedI may not be our worst troubles in the
near future. Perhaps we should be grateful to
the honourable member from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) for laying bare the
weakness of his casc, and exposing the motive
behind this whole business.
The honourable member from Hamilton
stated that Senator Haydon uttered a
gr:atuitous calumny against Hon. Mr. Ferguon. and that a man's reputation is dearer
to him than bis life. If I understand the
siuation correctlv, Senator Havdon made no
direct charge against Hon. Mr. Ferguson. He
said Mr. Sweezey had told him certain things
regarding the honourable gentleman. These
things Mr. Sweezey denied under oath, and
Mr. Ferguson also denied them under oath.
J whole-heartedlv agree with the bonourable
member from Hamilton when he states that
a man's reputation is dearer to him than his
life. and I certainlv think Senator Haydon,
under the circumstances, should not have
made the statement he did make. But perhaps senators, like other men, have feelings
in regard to their reputations. Even Liberal
senators should have some rights, and this
whole thing, from beginning to end, bristles
with partisanship against the senators accused.
Yes. every man's reputation is very dear to
him. and therefore we should all be very
careful how we act towards our neighbours.
A man of our race, who understood human
nature well, wrote as follows:
Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis bis. and has been slave to
thousands:
But lie that filches from me my good name
Robs moeof that whicli not enriches hin
And makes me poor indeed.
I commend these sentiments to honourable
gentlemen opposite and to every member of
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

The next question that arises is this: Have
these men, and have bundreds of others, both
in and out of Parliament, done things for
which we as a nation are suffering to-day,
and for which our children's children will continue to suffer in the days to come, if a
remedy be not found? I believe they have,
and I believe that that is the question to
which we should address ourselves.
If the natural resources of this earth could
and would be justly and equitably administered for the benefit of all the people who
inhabit it, there is net a single individual
in all the world who would want for the real
neessaries and perhaps some of the comforts
of life. But in all ages and in all climes these
natural resources have been exploited by the
few for their own particular advantage, and
in conqequence multitudes of men, women and
children have borne miseries and suffered
hardships that the beasts of the fields have
not endured, and in many cases the wealth
so acquired bas been a eurse raier than a
blessing to the few who possessed it. Perhaps
the greatest exploitation of all has been the
seizing. or the acquiring for a trifle, by the
fewv, of large portions of the most advantageous parts of the earth's surface, such parts
being called their land, and other men being
compelled to pay for the mere right of living
on and improving it. This method gives the
few the ownership of the land on which towns
and cities have been built, and the enormous
and constantly increasing value which growing
communities always give to land, instead of
being taken for community purposes, goes
te the few. for their personal enrichment.
while industry bas te bear a load of taxation
whicl is almost impossible to carry.
We may be on the eve of fundamental
world changes and no man now living can tell
awhat the next decade may bring forth. Of
one thing we may be alnost certain: it will
bring forth fundamental changes in the
economie systems of the world. It appears
to me that while such momentous changes
are impending, and while hundreds and thousands of our fellow citizens are hungry and
distressed. the members of Parliament could
be better employed than in tearing each other
with tooth and claw. But whatever may
happen, if we follow the advice of Him who
said, "Whatsoever you would that men should
do to you, do you also to them in like
manner," we shall net go far astray in our
conduet towards our neighbour.
Canada has been dowered with enormous
natural resources, which are being exploited
every day by the captains of industry-the
pillars, I presume, of church and state. I do

MAY 3, 1932
not for a moment adversely criticize these
men. They are breaking no law, and many
of them are most worthy citizens. But the
system under which they operate is, I believe,
altogether wrong, and to allow this to go on,
to recognize and legalize it, while singling out
two or three men for condemnation for
similar activities at Beauharnois, would, as
I see it, be such an outrage that the very
stones would cry out against so great an
injustice.
I realize that to put the world right would
be too big a job for the Canadian Senate, but
we can surely contribute our quota or our
mite to so great a cause, and, more surely still,
we ought to be able to put our own house
in order. Reform of the Senate has often
been mooted in Parliament and in the press,
and it would be no reflection on the intelligence of the Fathers of Confederation to say
that time and circumstances have worked such
changes that the instrument they fashioned
for the government of Canada has outlived its usefulness, in part. Some reform is,
in my opinion, overdue, and if it is under-

taken, the body best fitted to bring it about
is the Senate itself. And here let me say that
I whole-heartedly subscribe to the last paragraph in the committee's report on this Beauharnois affair, which reads as follows:
This Committee feel it to be their duty to
express the opinion that senators of Canada
should not place themselves in the position of
receiving contributions from or being interested
in an enterprise dependent on speeific favour,
franchise or concession to be made by a government whose conduct is, under the constitution
of Canada, subject to review by both branches
of Parliament.
The only fault I have to find with this
resolution or affirmation is that it does not
go far enough, and the distance I would
travel will appear as I proceed in my remarks.
The judiciary in Canada has the confidence
and respect of the people to a considerable
degree, even though appointments to the
Bench have not always been as carefully and
as prudently made as they should have been.
The administration of justice in the Dominion
is so far ahead of what it is in some countries
where the elective method prevails that we
are justified in congratulating ourselves upon
this branch of our governmental system.
Would it not be possible to have conferred
upon the Senate more of the powers and
more of the responsibilities of the judiciary
than it possesses now? I have always thought
that it was a reflection upon the Senate to
have its judicial powers confined to divorce
cases only. If such a reform were deemed
advisable, changes would doubtless be .neces-

sary in the constitution of the Senate, and
perhaps more care would be exercised in the
making of appointments to it.
The two leaders, and other men in this

House, if divorced from party politics, would
in my opinion do credit to any judicial body
in the world; and then there are other men in
the Senate whose legislative experience and
talents are not employed to the extent they
might be in the service of the country. If such
changes as I have imperfectly hinted at were
brought into effect, it would be necessary for
men when accepting a seat in the Senate to
give up all connection with party politics, and
perhaps with professional life; also to give up
all personal connection with industrial corporations and business affairs, excepting possibly the business of farming, at which there
would be no danger of becoming wealthy.
An age limit might have to be fixed at which
senators should retire, with the provision that
if active and useful they could be reappointed,
with the concurrence of the Senate. I have
said "with the concurrence of the Senate"

because the Senate itself would be the best
judge of the usefulness and activity of its
members.
A legislative and judicial body so constituted and selected would surely have the
confidence and respect of the country, and,
what would be more important, would be
worthy of such confidence and respect. Would
it be too much to hope that we might have
a body worthy of such confidence and
respect? To such a body might well be committed all parliamentary investigations and
inquiries, and all work donc now by royal
commissions. The judges, who have now to
do work of that kind, may not always have
sufficient time to do it and their regular work
well. Moreover, parliamentary investigations
are not always carried on in a manner free
from political party prejudices; and royal

commissions, considering

themselves bound

by the rules of evidence that prevail in law
courts, have a procedure not sufficiently
elastic to bring out all the facts and circumstances that it might be desirable to elicit
in the public interest. It could surely be
arranged that Senate investigations would

combine the good points in all other forms of
investigations, and eliminate the weak points
in all other forms. I should suppose that the
Commons and the judiciary would be glad
to be relieved of such work, and the Senate
should be able to do it well.
Such changes and such additional work
given to the Senate would necessitate the
paying of an indemnity sufficient to give poor
yet capable men a decent living, and might

41767-23
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
necessitate the paying of retiring pensions.
To rich men the size of the indemnity would
make little difference, but te all, the honour
of belonging to such a body and the opportunity it would confer of giving service
to the state would, I believe, induce the best
men in the state to seek such service, or at
all events te accept a call to such duty. I
have not lost faith in the Senate yet, and
I hope that nothing will occur in the next
few days or the next few weeks te destroy
that faith.
If the Beauharnois incident be the 1mmediate cause of bringing about such a reform
as I have tried to visualize, it will have been
worth all it cost, and, in all probability, never
again will any member of this honourable
House be even suspected of being faithless
in the discharge of his duty te bis country.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senaitors,
I gather from the remarks of the honourable
gentleman who has just taken his seat that,
though he did not state his intention in so
many words, he is not going to support the
report of this commi.ttee. A few weeks ago
we listened to a dissertation by the honourable
gentleman. Whether it was a speech or a
sermon I have semn difficulty in deciding.
In the course of bis remarks he dwelt upon our
dulties as Christians; e told us what we ought
to do as individuals and as a nation, and very
clearly pointed out the course that ve should
follow. Is he going to turn bis back upon the
principles enunciated in that very strong dissertation and oppose a motion to adoplt a
report which, u,pon sworn testimony, condemns the attitude of certain members of this
House and their connection with a certain
public utility of Canada? The honourable
gentleman, I am afraid, has forgotten that
consistency is a precious jewel. If he follows
that course he will have te take a turn or
two through the valley of humiliation in order
to get back ýto the sane plane that he occupied
when he made his speech, or sermon, a few
weeks ago.
A great deal has ben said by members
of the committee who sit on the other side of
the House to the effect that they have net
been fairly treated in connection with the
report brought in. They claim that they did
net have an opportunity of studying the report or of proposing any amendments to it.
Well, I think I can show in just a moment
that they had every possible opportunity, and
that their complaint is merely a lame excuse
for their inability to suggest any amendments
or bring in a different report.
The honourable member for Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Copp) made several statements
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

that are not supported by the evidence or the
facts now before this House. I will give one
example whieh shows how indifferent he was
to the facts. At page 345 of Senate Hansard
he is reported as saying:
I want to say that four members of that
committee had no opportunity of seeing one
word of that report or of making a single
suggestion

as to

what the

report

should

be.

The report was laid on the table in the conmittee room and we were told to take- it or
leave it.
Now let us see what are the facts in this
connection. They are as follows:
First, that the members of tihe comititee
met on the 14th of April for an informal conference and talked the matter over.
Second, that at that meeting the other members of the committee asked the chairman to
prepare a draft report, and he suggested that
any members who felt so disposed might also
make drafts.
Third, that all the members of the coinmittee had from the 14th of April to the 20th
of April to consider matters and make such
drafts as they were disposed to make.
Fourth, that the Senate resumed its sittings
on the evening of Tuesday, the 19th of April,
and the chairman the next day, immediately
after luncheon, waited on Senator Béique, as
the senior inember, to ascertain w hether he
had made a draft report, and handed to
Senator Béique a draft report which had
written at the top, "For the in-spection of
Senator Béique and his colleagues on the
committee." Senator Béique did net have
a draft report ready at the time.
Fifth, at the same time [he chairman told
Senator Béique that a meeting of ie
committee would be held the next day, April 21,
at 10.30 in the morning.
Sixth, the committee met at the time mentioned, on April 21, and the chairman subSenators Graham,
mitted his draft report.
Copp and Robinson said they had net seen
the draft report whici had been given to
Thereupon copies of the
Senator Béique.
draft report were given to them, and the
committee adjourned until 2.30 o'clock that
afternoon.
Seventh, that no one but Senator Béique was
responsible for the fact that he omitted to
show his colleagues.the draft report which he
had received from the chairman on April 20,
or to consult with them about it.
Eighth, that when the committee met at
2.30 in the afternoon of April 21 there was no
suggestion from the Liberal members, except
one from Senator Robinson, that the Ferguson
episode should be eliminated, and another
from Senator Béique, that the committee

MAY 3, 1932
should adjourn until the following week because he was leaving for Montreal on private
business.
Ninth, that after discussion, the com.mittee
adjourned until the next day, Friday, April 22,
at 10.30 o'clock, to give the members further
time for consideration of the report.
Tenth, that wben the committee met on
Friday, April 22, the Liberal members had
nothing to submit, that they were wholly opposed to the draft report, and that they put
on file the protest that the right honourable
senator fromn Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Grahamn) has read to this House.
Honourable senators, 1 submit that there
is absolutely no ground for the statement
that bas been made on the other side of the
House, that Liberal members of the committee did nlot have an opportunity to see
and examine carefully the draft report.
I want particularly to cali the attention of
the honourable gentleman from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) ta the remarks 1 have
just made. I arn sorry he is net in his seat
at the moment. He seems to have been impressed by statements made by members of
the committee on his side of the flouse that
the draft report was not submitted ta them
in time for full consideration, and that this
draft was forced on the minority members,
who had no chance to make suggestions. But
the fact is that the minority had from the
14th to the 2Oth of April to put their ideas
on paper, yet they failed to do so. What
excuse have they for their neglect? Tbey
have no excuse. If the honourahie gentleman
from De Salaherry (Hon. Mr. Béique) was unwell, other members could have worked on
the draft. The committee met on the 20th
of April at mid-day, and the draft report of
the chairman was suhmitted. The memibers
then had until the morning of the 22nd of
April ta formulate their objections or suggest
any other form. of report. How much more
time could they bave wanted? The honourable member for Lethbridge will see that the
minority were given ail the time any reasonable persan could ask for. It was the duty
of the members of the committee ta give
prompt attention. ta the business referred ta
tbem by the flouse. I bave outlined wbat
occurred ini connection with the various sittings
of the committee, and I say agwin that there is
no ground for any complaînt by members of
the committee tbat tbey did not have the
fullest opportunity of examining the report
and making any suggestions tbey desired.
This debate has been carried on for a consideraible time, and it has been repeatedly
stated that practically everytbing necessary ta
41767-23 à

355

be said in connection with the matter under
discussion bas heen said. As far as speakers
on this aide of the flouse are concerned, I
fu]ly agree with that. The chairman of tbe
committee (Hon. Mr. Tanner) mnade a
splendid address in maving the adoption of
thwý report, fie went into every detail, based
bis statements upon the evidence submitted
bef are the committees of bath Houses, and
prekented a report that was based upon that
evidence. fie deseirves a great deal of credit
for the trouble be ba& taken ta place before
this Chamber the findings of that cammittee.
fie did se without the elightest indication of
partisanship. I attended nearly ail the meetings of tihat com.mittee, and I defy anyone ta
produce a single iota of evidence that the
chairman showed the slîgbtest partisansbip in
any way, shape or f orm. We should feel
grateful ta bim for bis work, and I think the
flouse- ought ta commend very bighly bis
industry.
Then there was the speech of the right
hanourable leader of the Government in this
Chamber (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighen). I have
had the plesure of listening ta bim on many
occasions, and I arn prepared ta say that
the speech he delivered. here an this matter
a few nîgbts ago wa-s probably ane of the
ablest speeches, if nat the ablest, ever made
in the Parliamen-t of Canada, Hie went into
the whole question very fully, dealt with every
detail and showed us clearIy what aur duties
are in cannection with the matters involved.
The honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Han. Mr. Béique) aIsa spoke ta us. Hie is
one of the oldest menibers, of this flouse and
is regarded as one of the moet eminent legal
minds in Canada. Without a doubt he is a
man of exceptianal. ability in bis awn profession. But what do we find in his address?
Hie, no doubt, had gone very carefully into the
evidence, considering it from every standpoint.
Hie spent a gaod deal of time trying ta justify
the stand of Senator Haydon, but when he
came ta Senatar MacDougald he bad very
littie ta say-just a few words-four short
lines:
.As to Senat-or McDougald. 1 followed cose1y
the long examinatian ta which he was subjected,
and I was satisfied with the way in which he
answered every question.
The honourable senatar for De Salaberry is,
as I have stated, a very able lawyer, and I say
that if be bad considered there was anything
sufficiently strong in the evidence ta justify
bis commending Senator McDougald for bis
actions, be certainly would bave re'ferred ta it.
Our genýial friend from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) also spoke ta us. We are always

SENATE

-356

glad ta hcar him. Uc delivcred a somnewhat*
lengthy speech; in fact, I think the principal
feature of his speech wvas its Iength. lis personal friendships towards the men whose
actions are under consideration were shown
very clearly. He devoted a large portion of
lais speech ta painting Senator Haydon as a
man who is as pure as a lily; he exhausted
alrnost every adjective in the English language
ta show him ta be a man above reiproach, a
man of unusually splendid character. As he
was speaking the thought came ta me that a
well-known Shakespearian sentence might be
paraphrwscd in this way: "Methinks he doth
paint taa much."
I think, that Senator Haydon is about equal
ta the average citizen; that is, aside from the
senator's connection with Beauharnois, of
course. I have nothing ta say against him . I
suppos~e hie is pcrhaps as good as the average
lawycr; though 1 may be wrong in making
that statement. But he is no botter than the
average citizen.
The right honourable senator fram Eganvilie
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) devotcd a great
dcal of timie te, the inembers of the National
Advisory Committee. He acted the part of
a.n auctiancer. Placing cach of the members
an a pcdestal, hie asked, "What about this

sida af the Hanse responded, hae would say,
'Agrced-he is as pure as a I;ly." Hie put them
up anc after the other and knockcd them down,
according- ta bis inclination. Why did he do
that? Sa far as I have been able ta gather,
no anc has ever cast any aspersions on the
integrity af the majority af those mon. I was
at a Io-é- ta understand my right honourable
friand's argument in that respect.
Then the honourable leader of the other side
af the Hanse (Hon. Mr. Dandnrand) spake. I
fully expected a lengthy outburst, of the ixsual
hrilliancy. For many years 1 have been a great
admirer ai bis, although I do not agree with
hiim poiitic.ally. I have known him an many
occasions, by the use of brilliant tacties, ta
crawl ont of a vcry difficuît hale. Bnt I do nat
think bis hcart wvas in the work this time. In

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: We wili allow the hionourable gentleman ail the time he likes. We
are not in a hurry. Whcn I have finished my

stated is not true.
Hon. Mr. MacARTH-UR : That remark is
not parliamentary.
Some Hon. SENATOIIS: Order, orderl
The Hon. the SPEAKER:- I Vhink that
word should not be used.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The honourable gentleman from. Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) is
not, as a ruie, inclined to say anything to
which we can take exception. In this instance
lis rerearks were very mild; but lie made one
littIe error, or probably two. Altliough, as
I have already shown, the members of the
committee lad no ground for complaint regarding the treatreent they received, the lionourable gentleman fromn Moncton stated that
the committee migît as weil have been a
one-man corerittee. It may be so. In my
opinion, the only kind of report to whicl he
and those associated with lire on the other
side of the House would agree would le one
that whitewasled those wlio are ireplicated
in tlie matter liefore the Senate to-day.*
The lonourable member said also that it
was a mistake to bring the investigation on.
As lias already heen explained by a nureler of
speakers, the investigation was net lirougît on
at tlie instance of VIe Conservative Party.
On two occasions an independent member of
the House of Comamons, Mr. Gardiner, a Progressive f.rom Alberta, made statereents of
sudh a character that action had to be taken.
His allegations pointed to an outrageous situation that the people of Canada could noV
ignore. The honourable gentleman advanced,
as another reason why tIe inquiry slould not
have been proceeded with, the argument that
it disorganized business. If we are to follow
such an argument to its conclusion, we slould
say that the proper course would have been
Vo allow certain men to continue their depredations in the process of making additional
millions, for the benelit noV of tlie country,
but of thereselves alone.

The toile of this debate has been high, up
to a certain point. I have been ini this House
for ten or eleven years, and bhougih we have
lad many warmn debates, sometimes on political lines and somnetimes on public questions, we
have always observed the rule, which 1 think
is ahnmost sacred in this House, that we do not
allow personalities to, enter into our discussions.
But the other night we found the honourable
member from Brockville making a staternent
of a personal nature that was uncalled for, and
that was not true to the standard required to
be observed in the dehates in this House. It
was unfortunate.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Pardon meHon. MT. GILLIS: Will you sit down,
please?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is the honourable memober rising to a point of order?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Yes. I was just
wondering whether it was Senator Graham or
Senator Hardy who was meant. One is fromn
Eganville -and the other from. Leeds. Brockille is not the designation of either.
V
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I hope the honourabie
member, when I finish, will spread hiniself
and. say something.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I really do not
know which senator is referred to.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: 1 say it was an unfortunate indent. That gentleman lias the distincti-on of being the first memtee of this
House who has stooped to ta-ctics of that kind.
Ihf le is satisfied with wlat he ha.s done in
that regard, and with the record that le has
created, I ho>pe he will enjoy the laurels that
are coming to lien.
Now, we have two men to deal with in connection with this report. I will speak first of
Senator Haydon. Some lionourable gentlemen
oppoeite have asked us not to deal with h.im,
because of his iNneas, but someone told me
the otler day that he was met on the streýet,
and another toki me ha saw him in a bootblack &hop, and- saw lire going around the
streets. If le is really ihi he has my sympathy.
But we are not dealing with lis private
affairs; we are deling witl his publie connection with ths Beaulharnois de-al.
We find that the firre with which Mr. Haydon is connected re-ceived, for imaginary legal
services, the sure of $90,000 or $95,000. It is
claimed that they got this througli the Beauharnois, and I think that ia quite brue. It is
claimed tihat tley got hils money for ilegal
services performed. But have they ever subreitted an account slowing the nature of tho.

SENATE

legal serviýces? I do flot think they have.
Every concern that we have a record of, that

worked for' the Beauharnois people, have submittoed their cdaimns. Take the olaim of our
genial friend Col. Thoirapson. I do not know
whether hie is in the gallery or nlot. Some
people cali him a lobbyist. 1 do flot care what
they call him; lie is an honest man. He said
that lie worked for the Beauharnois people
for two and a haiýf yearm and got $6,000, and
that if he had got any more the payment
would have been excessive. But we find that
the firm with which Senator llaydon is connected get 89 ,00a-4or what? As I have said,
they neyer submaitted an account. They
claimed it was foir woek t.hat had been done
in the_ past, for work that was heing done, and
work that was to le d'one. They put in ail
the tenses. A littie dater on we flnd that this
same gentleman, acting as treasurer for the
Liberal Party, received some $700.000 or $800,000 for that party. Is that in keeping with the
dignity of thjs House? WVe do flot neüd te,
side-track the question: there is no douit,
that this mone-y-the 8700000 or S«0,000 and
the S9O000-all came through Beaiîharnojs.
Is it rvasonable to suppose that, even if Mr.
Seeeczey w-as the possessor of a large fortune,
h4, wofldl lhave made this gift to the Liberal
P~art,*v for campa-ign purposes? The 890,000
was paid to the Haydon firni for one purpose
onIv
ý-thc, use of their influence in ohtaining
th(, î-iu-.nt of the Goveromnent te Order in
Counril 422. If Senator Havdon could get
S700,000l or S800.000 for canmpaign purposes, hie
mis~t have had a consilerble pull with the
Governinent; siiih as te he able to secure the
passiog of this particular Orîlor in Council.
Thon we corne to Senator McDougald.
Before the commjttee lie admittcd that he
lu uic aproxjnatelv hall a million dollars out
of this deal; and lie made really more than
that, for he ouglit to have a number of
shares which were of great value. Did lie get
that meney by honestly earning it? Did lie
get tîjat by honest business methods? la it
reasonable to suppose that a man in a month
or two, or a few months, could have secured
that immense wealth without grafting? 1 use
the word advisedly.
Then we have the Sifton deal. That is the
most mysterious part of it aIl. Why was it
necessary, in order to carry that transaction
to its conclusion, to go to New York and
deposit money in the bank there? There are
financial institutions in this country amply
capable of carrying out such a deal, It is
a mysterious deal from begjnning to end, and
it involves matters that should be properly
investigated.
IIoen.

NIr. GILLIS.

The honourable senator fromn Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lyndli-Staunton) a day or two
ago stated on the floor of this Chamber that
several million dollars were still unaccounted
f or. I have not heen able to go into the
details of that statoment, but that money hias
not been investigated, and such a large
amount, as that should be traced. There are
seven millions, and probably more, to be
accounted for. Where did those millions go?
They came from the people of Canada, from
one end of the country to the other, who
were induced by the promises contained in the
Beauharnois prospectus to invest froely in this
projeet. Some tribunal ouglit to be set up
for the purpese of making an inquiry to
ascertain who got the benefit of this money.
We have only scratchod the surface of this
iniquitous affair, and we want to find out who
roceived the rest of the money involved in
this transaction. We have done our duty in
hringing this matter to the attention of the
public.
Now the Govornment ought to
institute a commission of sonne kind that
wvould have fuît authority to go fully into
every detail and force out the information
neeessary in order to expose those who are
still implicated. In regard to the Sifton deal
there is no question that some other party
or parties are implicated; otherwise they
would not have hiad to use those complicatcd
miethoda in ordor to close the deal.
ilonourable members, I want now to make
a few general remarks. WVe should have it
tlieroughlv impresscd on our minds that wo
are now dealing with a matter of outstanding
importance. It may be truly said to ho one
of the most important subjeets that have ever
corne hefore the Sonate of Canada, and probably it is the most vital. Othor groat questions that have heen dobated and considered
in this House relatod to concernas outaide of
the lufe of the Sonate itacîf. As I seo the
matter, wo are faced with the question
whether this Sonate is te ho of use to, this
country or whcthor it is to go down in history
with a hlackened character.
The Senate is in tlîis striking position, that
it is the solo instrument for purifying itacîf.
Members of the othor Chamber at rogular
intervals go hark to the people. Thon the
people deal with them. If they have been
failhful in the discharge of their duties, the
people are likely to approvo of them and
senrl tlîem baek to Parliament. If they have
ot proved faithful, the people usually punish
them. Se it is with governments. Governnients come and go. Sometimes they are
(lefeatecl, even thougli they have monits;

MAY 3, 1932
sometimes they are returned to power, even
though they are without menit. The principle
I am striving to bring to your attention is
that the people of the country have regulai'
opportunities to deal with members of Parliament and with governments.
We must take it to heart that in this
'Senate wc are in an entirely different position.
We are given places here, and we hold thern,
no matter how many governrnents may come
and go; no matter how many members of
Parliament may be nllowed to ait in the House
of Commons for a few years only. When we
contemplate this vital fact, Lt will surely be
deeply impressed upon our minds that we owe
it to ourselves and to the country to see to
it that nothing ever happens that will bning
dishonour upon the Senate, or raise questions
in regard to the integrity of members of this
bouse in the discharge of their great and
onerous duties to the people.
ýSpeaking as a member of this Senate who
cornes from the Western country, 1 want to
tell you, honourable members, that everywhere throughout that growing part of Canada people are discussing this weighty quesNeyer before were they s0 much
tion.
interested in the question of a Senate in this
country. Heretofore they have regarded the
Senate in a questionable way; I mean they
have been wondering whether or not this
Senate ja of real and praetical use to Canada.
But now there is an entirely different phase
to what is being said in the West. A new
issue has been injected into the discussions,
and I wish to tell honourable members that
the issue which is before the people in the
Western parts of this country is not so much
as to whether we do or do not perform work
of value, but whethcr or nlot this Senate
deserves public respect, as having that measure
of honour and integrîty which all public bodies
must have.
In private life, honour and integrity are
the essence of success. A man who does not
have regard for these two things may prosper
for a while, but in the end hie cornes to
disaster. So it is in business life. Whether in
private life or in business, honour and integrity
are the foundation of the respect which elowcountrymen have for one another. I rnay say
to you, honourable rnembers--and I arn sure
that I voice the general opinion and judgment
of the people in the Western regions of
Canada-if anywhere or in anything the people
of this country demand sterling integrity and
honour, and the upholding of these principles,
they dernand thern in this Senate and in the
conduct of its members. I can safely assure
honourable senators that the Western country

will nlot for long stand for a Senate whose
character is besmirched. It cannot be pretended for a moment that this Senate can
be of any use to the people of Canada if
they have no respect for it, and no confidence
in its integrity. That goes without saying,
and it is to me a lamentable fact--and 1 am
sure it will deeply impress the people of the
country from which I come-that honourable
members on the other side of the House have
now given clear evidence that they are readýy
to serve party prejudices, instead of standing
by the honour of the Senate of Canada.
As it has been pointed out, honourable members, we have under consideration one of the
greatest natural resources of Canada. We of
the West are deeply interested in it. We are
far removed from the sca, but we look upon
the great St. Lawrence river as a probable
means of giving us access to the sea. We consider the great St. Lawrence river and everything related to it as the property of the
people of Canada, and the Western country
will not stand for any gambling with that
great natural resource by honourable members
of this House, who should be safeguarding
and promoting our interests, in common with
the interests of -ail Canadians. And when we
see that honourable members of this House
have been engaged in this gambling, and in
the course of a few months have walked off
with millions of dollars which they neyer
earned, is it any wonder that there should be
a spirit of revolt throughout Canada, a spirit
of unrest, and that honest people who have to
work for their money, who have to earn it with
hard labour, should feel that injustice is being
done to them, and that the honour of this
branch of Parliament is heing dragged in the
nud? Surely honourable members on the
other side of the Huse will not condone such
offences and declare by their speeches and their
votes that honourable members.who. are entrusteil with the people's interests in this
Parliament should be allowed to conduct themselvesin such a manner. Ils it right, is it just,
can it hc defended, that a few men, including
honourable members in this Huse, should be
permitted to acquire immense riches in a few
months by the manipulation of a great publie
utility of Canada? -1 say to you, lhonourahie
members, that the people of this coun.try will
not stand for any such thing, and the sooner
this truth becomes imbedded in the minds of
honouraible members of this bouse, the better
it will be for themselves and the country at
large.
Now, there is no question remaining unsettled in this matter. I am only a layman.
I do not pretend ito be able to apply a critical,

SEN ATE
legal mmid ta the evidence which has bcen
given, but I try ta apply cammaon sen.se, and
1 find that je the Western cuuntrY that is the
ane thing that is bcing brought ta hear an
the cansideratian of these questions. That
common sense tellst us at once that there is ne
doubt a.hout the guit of the honourable members whose names are mentioned in this repart. Legal men may split hairs h'ere and
there, but splitting hairs will net save the
hanaur and integrity af the Senate ai
Canada. XVe must get detvn ta fundamen-tal
facets, and thase fundamental faots are clearly
establishied by the evidence submitted ta this
ilouse.
These haneurable members have been given
ful and fair apportunity of clearing themselves. Last year, when the matter came
befare thjs Hause, we withheld final .iudgment. Henaurable gentlemen need nat pretend that the evidence adduced. before the
Hause of Cammens did net impress them
deeply. They wcre nat slaw ta say that it
clearly shawed that the hanaurable members
reierred ta had breught dishanaur upan the
Seate af Canada. That, 1 say, is established
beyand questian by the fact that nat a voice
was~ raised in pratest, and that the Senate
adapted withaut a dissenting vaice the resalutien which ivas deliberately drawn up by a
cammittee campased of hanaurable members
from bath sides oi the Hause.
Now, henaurable members, I ask you, are
we ta go back rîpan that actian? Are we ta
say ta ourselves and ta the country at large
that we did nat knaw what we were doing?
If we take such an attitude we canfess that
we are net fit ta be here; that we are nat fit
ta eccupy the high positions ta which we
have been appointed. It has been pointed eut
that hanaurable members in this House are
mcn of experience and are net carried about
by every shift of wind; that we are stable,
we arc deliberate in aur actions, we are mature.
If we dlaim ail this, and if we are right in
claiming it, then wve cannot niake the excuse
that 'vo did net uederstand what we wcre
daieg when at the last session af Parliament
we passed the resolutian accepting the condemeatian ai the senators named in the Hause
of Cammons repart, but agrecd ta give them
a further hearing if they se desired. I submit ta hanourable members that it would be
a most humiliating act an tbe part of this
Senate ai Canada ta make such a profession
hefare the people. It would be mare than
humiliating; it would be, as I have already
stated. a confession ai aur inability ta discharge praperly aur responsible duties.
Hor. Mr GILLIS.

I was painting out a iew moments aga howv

conclusion than that these honourable rnernbers have trcated with the utmost contempt
the honour of the Senate of Canada, and that
they have done it because they weýre determined to make huge riches by rnanipulating
a great public utility?
Honourable members on the other side of
the House rnay labour under the delusion that
they are doing a party service in this respect,
but this -is flot at alI the time for party
service; it is a tirne when the Senate of
Canada should be giving the whole country
true, unbiased, national service. This is the
action that the people of the country wiIl
expect front the honourable members of this
flouse; and I say to you, honourable members,
in conclusion, that any honourable member
who thinks that hie is doing himself, this
Senate or his country, in any measure, a good
service by projecting party polities into the
consideration of the subject will find himself
greatly disappointed in the end. Rie will find
that the people will resent such action; that
they wil] conclude that instead of being a
great national body, free from undue influence,
the Senate is more prejudiced in polities than
even the Commons. For be it remernbered
that in the flouse of Commons, representing
the people, where we usually look for the
fiercest party fights, there was a rernarkable
and striking unanirnity of the members in
denouncing the conduct of the senators
accused.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
because of the acoustic properties of the
Chaniber I found it difficult to follow my hionourable friend who has just taken his seat
(Hon. Mr. Gillis), but if I heard hirn aright,
hie was convinced in his own mmnd that the
committee report subrnitted to the flouse of
Commons was concurred in by all the members of the committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is what I caught
from this distance. I want to say that the
records show that that is not true, and 1 would
refer my honourable friend to Hansard of
July last.
The honourable gentleman also implied
that those members who had appeared before
the committee of the flouse of Commons aïd.
the comrnittee of the Senate had been received
and treated with great courtesy. And in his
last sztatement, which I could flot entirely
follow, hie indicated that hie was speaking for
a group, flot for himself, for from. time to,
time hie used the word "we." I cannot believe
that my honourable friend was speaking for
a group. I quite realize froni his statement
that hie is well satisfied with his career thus
far.

361

I wish to apologize for taking up any more
time in this flouse. As far as I amn concerned,
I should be well satisfied to leave my views
unexpreased and. rely upon the staternents of my
honiourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), the
right honourable senator from Eganville (Riglit
Hon. Mr. Graham), my honourable friend the
senator froni De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique),
and the honoura-ble gentlemen from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) end Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Copp). Four of those honourable gentlemen were menimbers of the committee, and not
only read the evidence, but heard it, and they
have flot hesitated. to corne before this honourable 'body and state in fiair and definite terms
why they could flot be parties to, the report.
So, as far as I arn concerned, I should be
satisfied to leave aside any arguments that I
rnight make, and to adopt the arguments made
by them. However, I happen to have been a
member of the Governrnent which dealt w;.th
the matter under discussion froni the year 1922
to the year 1930, with the exception of a
brief period during 1926, after niy right honourable friend the leader of tbe Government in
this flouse (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) assumed
office in July. Having been in 1that position,
I feel that it is m.y duty to inake a statement.
Froi -the knolledge that one obtains from
being a memnber of the Governrnent, I know
of the great care th-at the Govern'rnent took
in dealing with this matter. Questions pertaining to water-powers and power privileges
usually cone before the Public Works Departrnent and are dealt with by Council upon the
recommend&tion of the Miniister of Public
W'orks. That is the procedure in rnost cases,
but because this application involved the righits
not only of the Federal Governrnent, but also
of a Provincial Government. it became necessary for the Governrnent of Canada to exercise
great care-and it did exercise that care.
The applicatiion came before it early in 1928,
and it was received. We knoew that there had
been an application before the Governent of
Quebec for certain rights which the promoters
thouglit were within the 'power of the province.
They had taken. over a right granted, I tlnk,
by that province. The Federal Governmenit,
knowing the difficuilties that cxisted between
the Provincial Goveruýment andc the legal
authoritiee of the Dominion Government,
decided to move carefully. It wa8 agreed
between the two Governrnents that there
wou'ld be a reference to the court to try to
determaine the rights of the two governing
bodies. Thut reference was mnade, and although.
the court decision was not definite and flot
exp'icit-in foct, we know that the court
suggested that each case would have to be
adjudicated upon as it came up-the Federal
Government felt that this niatter should be

dealt with in relation to the judgment rendered
by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court
indicated that the Provincial Government had
definite rights, and the Quebec Government
dealt with the matter on that basis and gave
certain rights to this company.
What had the Government to go on? If it
took the position that the right of granting
power was within the province, then all it had
to do was to see that navigation on the St.
Lawrence river was protected. That was the
whdle story, and no one can contend that
there was more. That was the attitude the
Government took. However, as I say, it went
carefully into the matter. It had a great deal
of knowledge secured from the International
Joint Engineering Board and special committees set up to study the question of international waterways. Then the Government
went further, and set up an interde.partmental
committee composed of the engineers of the
Department of Public Works, the Department
of Railways and the Department of the Interior
-departments which were familiar with and
had to do with water-powers-and upon the
advice of that interdepartmental committee

MAY 3,1932
THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
REPORT

0F

SPECIAL

COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate resumed the adjourned debate
on the motion of Hon: Mr. Tanner for concurrence in the report of the special coinmittee appointed for the purpose of taking
into consideration the report of a special committee of the House of Commons, of the last
session thereof, to investigate the Beauharnois
Power Project, in so far as it relates to any
honourable memibers of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators,
before taking my seat I was trying to give a
bit of the history of the developments that
bad led up to the necessity of our discussing
certain matters arising out of the proceedings
before the Senate and the House of Commons
committees. I should like to correct one
thing, if I may. Early in my remarks I
mentioned the taking over of certain rights
b>' the Beauharnois Company. I referred to
the Robert interests. I ma>' have implied that
those interests were within the power of the
Provincial Government. That is not correct.
1 understand the application was made to the
Public Works Department some twenty odd
years ago, and certain rights were granted.
I wias about to deal with certain statements
made in 1930 by a mýember of the House of
Commons, Mr. Gardiner. I suggest that in
those statements Mr. Gardiner rather implied
that the compan>' had donc some wrong in its
organization. There was no implication in
Mr. Gardiner's statement as regards the Goveznnent, or members of the House of Commens, or niembers of this Senate, but lie was
doubtful as to the activities of this company,
bow it had incorporated, and what it had
secured in the way of public domain for its
advantage.
We pass from that time on through a general eiection, at which the positions of the
parties were reversed: the Government of
Mackenzie King went out of power, and that
led b>' the present Premier came into power.
Mr. Gardiner rc'peated his statements, and an
investigation was undertaken by the House of
Com-mons. But is it flot curious, and does it
not E4ppear unfair to ever>' honourable memnber of this House, that Mr,. Gardiner, the
accuser, should be nomînated b>' the Government as a judge on that cosnmittee?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hou. Mr. KING: No one wiil take any exception to that statement. No more im.proper
procedure could have taken place in any court
of justice in this Empire of ours. In fact it
wus fot defended as a proper attitude or

363

proper prooedure *by the Government, who
control the sppointment of comimittees. I wiUi
repea.t: Mr,. Gardiner aocused the conmpany of
irregularities-of hiaving secured rights a.nd
privileges as against the public interest; yet
hie became a judge on that committee.
The committee having been formed, many
witnesses were caaled. A meimber of our own
honourable body aippeared. voluntaril>' before
the committee because his name was mentioned. He gave his evidence fra.n.kly, saying
hie invested in this comjpany. He was commended by one of the members of the comnmittee for his frankness. In a day or two it
developed that Mr. Sweezey had intimated
there were capaign contributions. What was
the action of that comnmittee? They said that
Senator Raymond, whom they had *comamended for bis franikness, had not been quite
frank, because hie did not disclose the faet
that hie was a trustee and had received campaign funds.
Now, we aire ail intelligent men-at least
we pretend to be-and we know that a witness
in court does not, and is not adlowed to,
volunteer evidence. We know, too, that other
persons went before that com-nmittee and tried
to exmpress theniselves in their own words, according te their knowledge of the facts, but
somnetimes the facts were not developed to the
iiking of comnittee',s coun.sel. I have flot refêrred to him, and -do net now refer te him,
as a Crown Prosecutor, but when a person
who *had been brought before the comimittee
to give evidence unjder oath wss attemqting
to gî-ve centroversial evidence, what happened? He was interruipted b>' interjections,
not only from. the Crown counsel, or the committee's courisel-whichever you prefer to cali
him-but aseo from, the chairinan. and other
members of the committee, the resWit being
that it was ver>' difficuIt for witnessS to givç
their eviden-ce as they wished.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: Did the honourable gentleman not observe throughout the
entire Senate testimon>' statements made repeatedly by counsel for the accused that the
cond:uct of the matter by counseI for the conimittee was fair in ever>' way?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He is talking
about the Conuons cerfmittee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: I beg pardon.
Hon. Mr. ING: I amn dealing with the
varions phases of this situation as it came to
us. My right honoura:ble friend may have
missed the remarks in which I expressed
admiration of his address, from which I read
a paragraph. But what I am trying to do
at present is to review the situation as it came

before the Senate (ornrittcc. I repeat that
the treatment of the senators who appearcd
before the committee of the Commons was
unfair. You will find in the evidence taken
by the S.enate cornmittee staternents by witnesses to the effeet that their evidence this
tirne was given under nuch bett-r conditions;
they bad an opportunity to think and te
give their evidence fuliy and fairly.
I have been a member of Parliament for
some years, but a member of this Chamber
for only a very short tirne. As this honourable House was nlot very busy last year, I
attcnded many sessions of the House of Gommons committee. I have said that that comrnittee was unfair, and what I have said is
truce.
lt is cornplained that we ourse]ves, as a
body, cornmitted ourselves 10 the House of
Commons report iast 3'ear hy deciding that
thiere shouici be a rex iew of the evidence
taken by the House of Commons. That may
ho truc; but this aiso is truc. that those who
suggested or app)roved of that proccdure were
satisflcd to foiiow it-an(i for what rcason?
Because we beliived that in a cornrittee of
the Senate wc shouid have a judicial and not
a partisan body.
So mjc committee was appointed to carry
out. the suggestion of last year, and that comsession. I attended many
rnittcc xvcnt
meetings of the committce. The pcoceedings
werc carried on in a judiciai and very fair
w ay. Early in the sessions, I noted, the chairman intimated to the cornrittee and to those
who were present that no evidence wouid be
taken exccpt that involving the three senators.
I thought the chairman xvas carrying out his

But whcn members of this cornmittee and a
gcoup with thcm, fiftcen persons altogether,
had proceeded to Senator Haydon's house and
started to interview him. and Senator baydon
made a certain ceference to a public officiai
of Ibis country, the chairman of the comrnitr.ee did not tell Senator Haydon and bis
counsci that the staternent couid not go on

that he told thcrn. He himsclf as informed
this honourabie body that be bad deicted
certain profane statements from SenatorHaydon's evidence. Hie did not besitate to

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is for the
honourable member who lias the floor to say.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
suggests that. Mr. Ferguson came at his own

honour had been attacked. After ail, honourable members, this is flot a kinderga.rten; we
are sutpposed -to lie an asseinbly of mature
gentlemen. We know there was no obWet, no
advantage, to lie gained by Mr. Howard
Ferguson proceeding to Canada to contradict
a statement of which lie had no knowledge, and
neyer could have any knowiedge; and ta advertise, as my friend the chairman did in bis
report, that Mr. Ferguson carne at his awn
expenseRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is that the
evidence?
Hon. Mr. KING: It is in the evidence.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not that statement.
Hon. Mr. KING: That lie came at his own

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Hon. Mr. KING: The comrnittee re.ported
that what Mr. Ferguson stated was that it was
at his own exipense so far.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: So far. Wait
tiii they get the bill in.
Hon. Mr. KING: How absurd it was that
Mr. Howard Ferguson, the High Commissioner,
a -man baving great responsibility, and who bas
lad great influence and great responsibulities in
Canada, should bie brought aver here to contradiet a statement which lie had no knowledge
of, and could not deny. He rnight have merely
sent a wire saying, "Any conversation between
Mr. Sweezey and Biaydon had no basis in fact,
as far as I am concerned."
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Why are you spending
sa mudli time on ths?
Hon. Mr. KING: Because my honourable
friend spent so mudli time on it.
I will take but a few minutes longer. I
think we agreed a few minutes a.go that this
body decided last year that a special cornmittee sbould be appointed to review the
evidence. That coniiittee was set up, and the
clairman laid down the line it should take, and
he beld to that, with the exeption of one or
two cases or instances.

The rnost rernarkable thing to rny mmnd,
and to tbe mind of every one who attended
the meetings of the cornrittee of the Senate
and knew the evidence tbat liad corne from
the House of Commons, was the fact that
counsel tbere representing tbe committee,
ivhose business it was to break down tbe
evidence, neyer broke down one bit of
evidence. Men were able to relate, under
oath,' experiences that liad taken place one,
two, five and eight years ago. It was not the
sarne counsel. The Government, wisely, 1
think, had chosen different counsel for the
committee. I doubt that Mr. White would
have been given a liearing or ailowed to crossexamine witnesses before tlie Senate committee. At least, I arn satisfied, he would not
bave been allowed to go the length lie did in
examining and cross-exarning before the
House of Commons committee.
Now we bave before us the report of aur
special comrnittee. My honourable friend the
chairman (Hon. Mr. Tanner) spoke for et
least two or tliree hours; I have heard it was
four hours. Anyway, iL was a consîderable
Lime.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: IL was plenty.
Hon. Mr. KING: It was a long speech, and
fromn lis point of vîew a very excellent speech.
As chairman of a responsible cornmittee, lie
was nat prepared ta, take the evidence of an
eminent medical adviser in tlie city of Ottawa.
I have known tbe medical adviser of Senator
Haydon for many years. He was a classmate of mine in MoGili. He graduated in
1895, and lie bas built up a veiy good practice
in this city. My lonourable friend went a
long way wben lie *criticized lis evidence and
indicated that Senator Haydon's condition
was not as this medical practitioner, un(ler
oath, represented iL ta lie.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have bad some experience in tbe practice of medicine. I arn not
particularly familiar with Senator Haydon's
condition, but I arn prepared ta take the
staternent of Dr. Argue that the senator is
very Mi. Dr. Argue advised Senator Haydon
not ta appear before the cornrittee, but as
Senator Haydon said lie wanted La give lis evidence, the doctar consented if the committee
would go ta Senator Haydon's bouse. As I
said a few moments ago, the members of the
cornrittee and sorne aLlier gentlemen, to the
number of fifteen, went there. Knowing the
condition of Senator Haydon, I arn nut surprised that under examination lie hecarne an-

noyed and was bitter, especially when I look
back upon what transpired in the Commons
committee last year.
My honourable friend the chairman, in his
presentation, tried to indicate, not to this
honourable body-for I do not believe he
had any idea that be could fool the members
of this Chamber-but to the public at large,
that the Federal Government had control of
the power rights. He indicated that on
navigable waters such rights were within the
Federal Government, and that we were to
protect the widows and orphans against cornpanies that might be organized and set up to
develop those rights. My honourable friend
lias heard the evidence. It was very clear that
the company had secured its rights from the
Province of Quebec, and that, as was said
before the committee by counsel, once the
Federal Government was satisfied under the
Navigable Waters Act, there was nothing for
the Federal Government to (1o but say yes
or no. I think no one will dispute that fact.
And the Order in Council has stood the test
of time. It bas been confirmed by our friends
wio werc in opposition at the time it was
passed, and who ara now in control.
It is
such an Order in Coneil, so fair in respect
of the interests of the public of this country,
that the present Federal Covernment is prepared to guarantee 816,000,000 in order that
this scheme may be completed.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Is the honourable gentleman quite sure of bis ground for that statement? lias the matter of policy with regard
to the $16,000,000 been settled by the Government?
Hon. Mr. KING: It bas not been enacted,
but we have the statement in the press setting
forth the Premier's word as given in the House
of Commons.
Ho.

Mr. LAIRD: Not to that effect.

Hon. Mr. KING: It lias not been enacted,
but we have the statement that the Government is prepared to go so far; and, more than
that. that it bas found, under the most trying
conditions, that the project was well coneeived, that it was wiihin the estimate, and
that if completed it will serve Canada as a
part of a great waterway. There is no question about that
My honourable friend will
not take exception to that statement.
Now I want to refer to the statement of
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), who appealed to us not to deal
with this matter in a partisan way. I think
I have been able to show that it must be
very difficult for members, on both sides of
Hon. Mr. KING.

the House, who are familiar with the conditions lcading up to the present situation, to
deal with this matter as the right honourable
gentleman has suggested. I wish to refer to
another paragraph in his speech. This is as
clever as the one to which I have already
referred. He says, as reported on page 289:
I venture to say that if a court were to
accepit the sworn opinion of men accused of
wrong-doing in any particular transaction. there
rarely would he an adverse finding. AIl tribunals, this tribunal included, must go down
beneath opinions, especially those of the accused.
They must get at the underlying facts and try
to find out where the truth really is, and
where the guilt really belongs.
I listened to that statement, and I bave read
it very carefully. I was one who concurred
with the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) when he objected to
our continuing the debate, on the ground
that Hansard was not before us. That is
the statement that he and I were discrussing.
It is an amazing statement. It miglit be
allowed in a court of law, but I an satisfied
that in his surnming-unp the judge wxould say
that the jury should not convict on inference, or on circumstantial evidence, but must
consider the direct evidence before the court.
My right honourable friend the other day
made a statement which I say, after consideration, might be described as having been
prepared with the skill of an advocate, the
subtlety of a trained lawyer and the astuteness of an experienced politician. That, I
think, is not a harsh way of describing that
statenient. It gives my right honourable friend
credit for what migrht have been expected
froi him under such conditions. We know,
the House of Commons know, the people of
Canada know, the ability of my right honourable friend. He bas great ability in presenting a case, especially as a prosecuting
attorney. Perhaps he bas not succeeded as
well when he has been defending, but in this
case he bas presented an argument that some
of our friends may find it diffiecult to get away
froin.
But should we follow the right honourable
gentleman's advice? Of course, my honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) said the other day that this was
not a jury, and that there were no charges
against these men. He said we had merely
to adjudicate and decide whether or not they
were gentlemen. But there is more than that
involved. We have had two committees, one
in the House of Commons and one in the
Senate, before which responsible persons have
given evidence under oath. and I do not
believe that even the fine 'statement of my

MAY 3,1932
right honourable friend can offset that fact,
and make perjurers of Senator Haydon,
Senator McDougald, Moyer, Ebbs and
Sweezey. If we are fair to ourselves and to
this Chamber we cannot do what my right
honourable friend has suggested-we cannot
disregard the sworn evidence of responsible
men, men who, in the communities ini whicb
tbey live, are beld in as high regard, perhaps,
as any honourable member of this Chamber.
We cannot wipe out their evidence and say
that we must go beyond that and find a
motive, and by inferenceRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn afraid 1
cannot let the honourable gentleman pro-cecd
in that way, without rising to a point of order.
He cannot read that meaning into my simple
statement. What I said was this, that if courts
were to accept the sworn opinion of the person
accused, on the moral resuit of his own conduet, there would not be convictions. I said
that you had to take the evidence of fact. I
said, flot that you could not believe Moyer or
Ebbs or anybody else, but that the sworn
opinion of the accused person could not be
accepted-that you had to get behind that
and get the facts.
Hon. Mr. KING: I quite agree witb my rigbt
honourabie friend that you cannot accept the
statement of the accused, but I contend that
corroborative evidence cannot. ha wiped out.
Right Roni. Mr. MEIGHEN: I said the
opinion.
Hon. Mr. KING: It wa. the opinion of this
Huse, and of counsel, that nobody was
accused; then we finally arrive at the conclusion that eveirybody who gave evidence is
accused. I think it is a foregone conclusion
that these anen are convicted. It bas been
comrmon knowledge in the clubs and on the
itreets for the lu.t eight or nine montbs that
they were already convicted. I quite appreciate
the difficulty of my right honourable, frienýd's
task--more particularly since hie discharged
it in bis speech the other day-mn carrying
forward proposals that were preconceived,
not in Parliament, but, as intimated througb
the press, by representatives who are in
Parliament. That is a fair statement, I
think. I arn not referring to what was said by
the dean of this House (Hon. Mr. Poirier) and
the honourable senator frorn Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) in trying to eleaxr up that
matter.
My honourable friend fromn Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) eoncurred, I think,' in
the speech of may right honouraible friend from
Eganvi4e (Right Hon. Mr. Grahamn). Be said
it was a noble speech. I will go further than

that: I wili say that it was a noble speech
delivered by one who bas had a large and ripe
political experience-a speech that appealed to
this Bouse and that will appeal to the public,
because it was an honest statement of facts.
It is true that hie was defending as; a layman
would, but his defence was so good that it
became necessary for my right bonourable
friend tbc leader of the Governiment (Right
Hon. M.r. Meighen) to place his case before tic
Bouse immediately.
Wc have heard much about influence and
the creating of an atmosphere. I feît that the
suggestion of my honourable friend the chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
that his observation did flot verify the
evidence given by the medical practitionor
before the committee, was not justified. I
tbink that is a fair statement, hae beîng a layman. We have not only the profession of
medicine, but also that of law involved in this
inquiry. My right honourable friend the
leader of the Government has objected 10
members of the legal profession being arnployed to use their influence in creating a
favourable atmoephere. In fact, hae designated them as perfumers. He bas twice been
Prime Minister, and bas been too long in
public life flot to know that the Cbateau
Laurier to-day, and every day in the week,
is iflled with people wbo are trying to create
an atmospbere that is favourable to tbe projects or the proposais that tbey bave to put
before the Government. Nobody will dcny
that. Why, then, should exception be taken
to Sweezey employing people wbo had influence? There is a marked difference between
employing men who have influence witb the
Government and employing men who will
use that influence improperlySome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Bon. Mr. KING: -and there is not one
word in the evidence to show that Andrew
Baydon or bis law firm, or Senator Raymond,
used improperly their influence witb tbe Government. I should like bonourable gentlemen to tbink that over. Is it not usual, is it
not normal, is it flot sensible for those who
are approaching a Government or anyone elsc
to make use of someone who will create an
atmosphere that is favourable to their prop osaI? No one will contend differently, I
think, and unless honourable members can
say that the three senators mentioned in the
report, who were friends of the Liberal Party
-we do not object to that-used their influence improperly, the acts of those tbree
senators cannot be condemned.

Hon. Mr. KING: I tako my bonourable
friend's suggestion. However, it is not in tlie
conîpetence of this assembly or tbe assembly
af Ontario ta judge of the nature of that fee.
That was in the judgment of the Commission,
I bave no daubt, and it will maintain its
decision and justify that fee. Therefore I
say that tbe fee paid to MeGiverin and
Haydon is a matter that is entirely witbin
tbe judgment of those wbo employed that firm
of lawyers.
We bave also bad a rather interestiflg contribution ta this debate by an lionourable
senator wbo lias recently came ta this House
(Hon. Mr. McRae), and wham the people
have known as tbe arganizer of the Conservative Party during the last campaig-n; a man
who stands bigb in the regard of the people
on account of bis arganizing ability. He indicated ta this House that lie liad judgment
and knawledge wliereby lie could distinguish
between wbat was good and wliat was bad in
campaign funds. Well, I think that if my
hanourable friend lias that faculty lie will be
very valuable ta tlie pcolitical leaders af this
country. But bofore we can consent ta bis

campaign funds sbauld nat belong ta one political party in tbis country. My bonourable
friend sbould go furtlier and supply information as to wbere hoe received his funds. and
beave ta a cammittee af this Bouse ta decide
wvhetber tbey were good or bad. I do not
believe that my bononrable friend would
consent ta sucb a committee. However, bis
statement is anc worthy of consideratian.
Now, in regard ta campaign funds, why
slionld tbere be this hypocrisy? We aýre ahl
agreed-we are aid enongh ta know and we
do know, and it is generally accepted not
only by members of this Hanse and tlie Bouse
of Commons, but by the public generaýlly,
that campaign funds are essential. Do the
people who run elections question the source
frare wbich they receive thase funds? Would
any bonourable gentleman or any other gen41767-24

;jrbu

tieman who undertook to run an election ini
a constituency, and who required financial
support, ask where those funds came from?
In this country we try to follow the English
precedent and practice. What is the history in the Old Country? It is well known
that the people over there do not mince
matters as we do here. There is not the
hypoerisy. It is well understood between
the various organizations that moneys are
essential, flot to corrupt the electors, but
to educate them. So wve find this statement
in a book whicb 1 have here, by Mr. James
Kerr Pollock, on "Money and Polities
Abroad":
Mr. Asquith, diiring one of these debates, in
1922, stated his opinion as fallows: "We should
nover associate ourselves, nar ought any intelligent and sane politician associate himself with
this vulgar claptrap outcry against contributions to party funds. You cannot carry on
poditical if e, you cannot organize political warf are, except by these means."
Moneys were spent in the last election by
hoth political parties. To say that the Conservative Party received moneys from those
who were not receiving consideration would
flot meet the question fairly. Party f unds
are rarely contributed by individuals or corporations without bîgh hopes of promoting
something that w'ill be to the advantage of
their work or their interests. Unless aur
friends opposite can show that tbey accepted
only funds contributed without such hopes,
then tbey must he and they are in the sanie
position as any other political party in this
country.
I amn going to conclude my remarks as did
my honourable friend on this side wbo
quoted from a very good autbority. It bas
been said that only gentlemen should sit in
this House. 1 appeal to every Christian gentleman, and I -think that in aur Christian world
a Chiristian gentleman is the finest type of
gentleman. Therefore 1 shahl quote from the
samne autbority. I would ask honourable
members as Christian gentlemen to give consideration to this quotation: "Cast out first
the beam out of thine own, eye, and then
%haît thou see clearly to pull out the mate
that is in thy brother's oye." 1 will go furtber,
and say, "Judge not, lest ye be judged."
My idea, is not that this question should be
treated lightly, but I realize that, unfortunately, the Senate is to-day divided on political
lines, and unless there is a larger consideration
of the attitude that is being taken, mucli harm
wilI be done ta tbis Chamber, and instead of
upliolding its honour we F-ball probably bring
discredit upon this very honourable body.

SENATE

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable gentlemen, I was in my place in the Huse
on Friday wvhen the hon-ourablc gentleman
from Hamnilton (Hon. Mr. Lyneh-Staunton)
began bis speech. I left before he had gone
far. I left wjth the fullest intention on my part
that, if I were present when the vote came
on the pendin-, motion, I wou'ld vote in silence,
and make no observations with reference te
the motion before the House. But when I
came to read the fiîll text of what the honourable senator froin Hamilton said on Friday, I
felt, last night and this morning, that I could
net prcperly keep silence any longer, because
what 1 bave to say with regard to the matter
is so much in the nature of disagreement with
the views that ho expressed, se far as the iaw
applicabde to this matter is concernied.
With a great deal of wvhat the bonourable
gentleman from Hlamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) said I am in the fullest agreement.
I shaîl try before I finish to point out the
features of bis address with which I arn in
full accord, and those with w'bich 1 amn in
entire disag-rement. Before doing that, as I
have begun to express rny views with regard
to the prescrnt motion, ]et me say a wvord or
two-and I shall bc very brief-with regard
to the merits-er the demerits--of the wholo
mat ter.
Nearly cverv bonourable gentleman wbo
bas addressed the House in the course of this
debate bas spoken of party politics, or of
partisanslîip as we knew it in Canada. I do
not want to say mucb about that, but 1 arn
w'illing te confess that before I hecaune a
member of this House I was as full, 1 think,
of the ordinary prejudices of partisansbip in
Canada as any man wvas. I even went the
lengtb when in the bouse of Commons, of
stating mv position as heing that of a political
partisan, because 1 thought. whetber rigbtly
or wrengly, that 1 bad been elected to tbe
bouse of Commons on tbe footing of political
partisansbip. and that thit was exactl 'y what
tbe people of tbis countrY wanted frorn tbeir
rel)re-.ntatives in the House of Commons.
At anY rate, it seeined te me tbat tbat wvas
wbat my constituîent-~ wanted me for. and 1
was free te eonfess that I bad been a political
partisan ail my life-was hemn se, brougbt
up se, and could net get rid of pelitîcal
partisansbip if I tried.
ýSome bon. SENATORS:

lutien in my own mind tbat fmom that moment
forward 1 weuld try my best, for tbe
remainder of rny life, te suppress those projudices of political partisanship that I had bad
witb me always thoretofore. I do net knowv
wbetber or net I succeeded. but I bave tried,
and I arn geing te try, with yeur kind indulgence, te do tbe same tbing te-night. I do
net want te talk party polities bore; I tbirik,
tbey ought net te bave any place in this
bouise. I say notbing about what anv other
bonourable member of tbis House bas said;
rny task is te trv te regulate my ewn words
and my own cenduct, and in that res~pect I
can only do my best.
This matter is undoubtedlv befere us tunight in tbe sbape of a political party question;
tbcre is ne escaping tbat; and if we are te

its very language, in so many places that
it does seem to me that it has narrowly
escaped, if it has escaped at ail, the charge
of engaging, itself, in political partisanship.
I do flot want to talk about that, though. 1
did flot mean to say anything more about it.
I want to, point out, in as few words as
possible, one or two minor things, but things
big enough to, make me unwilling to adopt,
for my part, the language of the report of
our own committee. Take the very opening
sentence of our committee's report with regard
to our member for Wellington (Hon. Mr.
McDougald). It quotes the first paragraph
of the Commons report with regard to his
coming into this flouse:
Senator McDougald was first summnoned to, the
Senate on the 25th June, 1926, but owing to, the
dissolution of Pariaînent was not then sworn
in and his appointment lapsed. Hie was again
sumnmoned in October of that saine year and
was sworl in the following year.
I omit the remainder of the first paragraph.
I take up now the comment of our own coinmittee upon that first sentence. It is:
This eommittee finds that this is correct,
except that Senator McDougald was summoned
to the Senate June 25, 1926, and took his seat
9th December, 1926, and flot as stated in the
said paragraph.
Then it proceeds -to something else. Well,
now, on the part of our cominittee, that was
an extraordinary glossing over of the most
extraordinary and inaccurate, and indeed,
untrue, language, on the part of the House of
Commons committee, for the House of Commons commibtee tells us, and &,pparently our
cornmittee hae concurre-d in that, that Senator
McDouga)4d was first summoned to the Senate
in June, 1926, and was again, summoned in
Octôober, 1926, and took his seat.
The faets,, if anybody had thought it worth
while to look, wou.ld be found spread upon our
own Journalsý-of course, they neceasarily had
to be-and I want to show to honourable
genrdfemen what the true facts of the matter
are. In our minutes for the 9th of December,
1926, which was the first day of the first sitting
of the Parfiament of Canada after the general
elections of 1926, it is recorded that:
The Hon. Wilfrid Laurier MeDougald was
introdueed, and having presented His Maiesty's
writ of sumnmons, it was read by the clerk as
follows.
And here it follows in full, and it is dated, I
need hardly say, -the 25th day of June in the
year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundrcd
and twenty-six, and is signed, «Byng of Vimy."
That is the only writ of su;mmons under which
the honourable member for Wellington (Hon.

Commons report, as it did. But it has gone Mr. McDougald) has ever presented himself
the length of adopting it, and of re-echoing for swearing in at our Table; that is the only

us now, whether or flot this report shall be
concurred in-can resuit in any other than a
division of this House upon practically the
old-fashioned party lines of division.
The fact that that is so does not, I hope,
prevent our discussing the matter, or acting,
when it comes to our voting, without exhibiting, unduly at any rate, the prejudices of
political partisanshîp. Ini trying to, look upon
this matter in that way 1 have to say that I
cannot support the resolution for concurrence
in this report. Apart entirely from any other
considerations, I cannot support it by reason
of the language which is used in the report
that is now before the House for our consideration.

no business to say the things it did sayr about
members of this flouse, or to crîticize the

me, whether, after reading, in the report of
the flouse of Commons committee, the hanguage used in what it had to say about
the senators whose conduet was under investigation-whether bie thinks that that is
the language of an impartial judge or whether
it is not much more like the language a
political partisan would use in a stump
speech.
I do not intend to go over the matter in
any detail. I do not intend to try to discuss
the evidence. That has been done very fully
on both sides of the Bouse. I want merely
to repeat what I have said-that it is now
impossible, I think, to treat this matter in
this flouse, or anywhere, as anything other
than a question of Canadian party polities.
The report of the committee of this flouse
that we are asked to concur in is the alhimportant thing, and it would not have seemed
to me necessary to say anythîng about the
earlier report of the flouse of Commons coinmittee if our committee had prepared a report
entirely independent of the other.

on the proceedings of aur committee and

devotad a good deal of tima and a good deal
of delay ta the succassful attempt ta giva ta
the Hon. Mr. Ferguson an opportunity of
denying what neyer had been in the least
degrea charged against him.
Some Hon. SEN_,ATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: What
Senator Haydon said was a matter of fact
bctween him and Sweezey. Ha did not pratend ta know, or ta say, anything about tha
truth of Sweazay's remark, but ha said that
Sweazey, an one occasion, undoubtedly said
ta himi words ta this affect: "Ferguson won't
let this Hydro contract ha signed unless a
large suma of money is handed over." Swcczpy
did nat say, and Senatar Haydon did not
pratend ta say that ha had said, that Ferguson had avar stated that, or that Ferguson
had ever had any interview with Sweazey.
That was simply what Sweazey thouglit, what
Sweezey said. Sweezey was saying what ha,
apparently, thought Ferguson's staýte of mind
was. Wall, Swaezey danies it, and it is a
question of fact pure and simple between
Swaazay's statemant and Haydon's statement.
I think, as averybody thinks who lias said
anything about the matter at all, that it is
uttarly irrelevant ta the subst.ance of the
Sanata inquiry. It is just exactly what I was
talking about, a matter of political partisanship. But the question of fact as betwaen
H-aydon on the ana part, and Sweezey on
the other, whather or not Swaezcy said that,
lias all the probabilitias in favour of Swaezcy
having utterad thosa very wards. For whether
or not ha saîd themn, ha evidently thouglit ta
that affect, for that is haw ha acted. Ha tells
us himsalf, and nobody doubts, that ha did
band over, for some reason or othar, $125,000
which ha thouglit was going ta the party lad
by Hon. Mr. Farguson, for provincial purposes.

The circumnstance that there are these comments I have referred to, throughout the report of our committee, and the report of the
House of Commons committea, adopted by
aur committee, is in itsalf sufficient to maka
me unwilling to say, by my vote, that I concur in those reports, so far as any one of our
three senators is concerned. But what our
committea bas done, following the action of
the Commons committee, with regard to the
honourable senator fram De la Vallière (Hon.
Mr. Raymond) is, in it.self, to my mind, ample
reason why nobody who believes in the honourable gentleman's innocence of wrongdoing
could possibly vote for concurrence in this
report. The right honourable gentleman who
leads this House was good enough-was sensible enaugh, I was going to say; was, at
any rate, fair-minded enough-to say with
tolerable plainness in bis speech that there
was little, if anything, to ha said by way of
censure or rebuke sa far as Senatar Raymond was concarned. I cannot pretend to,
remember the exact words. But the report
of the committea is by no means equally clear.
The honourable senatar from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lyncli-Staunton) was very empliatic, very
distinct, in his remarks with regard to Senator
Raymond, and I concur with aIl xny heart in
those remarks.
I read Iast summer, day by day, every word,
I think, of the evidence that was given hefore
the House of Commons committea. I have
certainly read, with cansiderabla care, every
word of the evidence given before our own
committee, and every word of its report that
we are now asked to concur in. I think it
lias not been fair to Senatar Raxymond; and
becruse its report with regard ta him ie
couched in language which would certainl 'v
admit of the contention that he has becn
guilty of some sort of dishonourable conduct,
I could not vote in support of this motion for
concurrence, even if there were r.,, other
reasons whatever for my opposiog it.
Let me spend a few brief minutes in pointing out axactly what I mean. The Commons
committea criticized him most unkindly, most
împroperly, I think, on the ground that lie
was lacking in candour or frankness in bis
evidence. And why? Because Mr. Lannox,
one of that committee's own members, had
said, when Mr. Raymond's avidence was concludad, that ha ought to ha commended for
bis frankness. I suppose we aIl know Mr.
Lennox. Ha is my colleagua in the representation of North York in this Parliamant.

MAY 3,1932
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Oh, no, you are
not.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: However that may be, let me ask, when had it
become dishonourable to aecept contributions
for legitimate campaign pur.poses from a company? It is not illegai. We ail know that
tho Bouse of Gommons, in custody of its own
privilegos, passed long beforo this, and the
Senate concnrred in it, an enactment which
expressly makos it perfectly legal and legitimate to accept contributions for campaign
purposes from companies.
Each committee went out of its way to
state that Senator Raymond aocepted funds
fromn the company, and that the company
from which, such funds were aoceptod was
dependent vitally on govornment franchises
or concessions, and that one of the governmonts from. which. such franchises or concessions were necessary was the Governinent of
Canada, of which. Senator iRaymond was a
prominent supporter.
WelI, I arn not going to extend those
remarks any further than I have to, by discussing these larger questibris of practical
polities. If I were, I should like to question
very strongly the propriety of that remark
about this Beauharnoîs company getting any
franchise or concession in the sense that it
was a favour frorn the Dominion Government,
of which Senator Raymond was a supporter.
I dlaim t'hat everything that company evor
received or over can receive fromn any Dominion Government was a matter of legal
right on its ,oart. Its franchise, its concessions it got from the provincial authorities
under a contract. Whether or not t-hat contract camne to that conipany by favour or
otherwize is none of our affair. It has not
been any matter of înquiry; is not anything
for which Senator Raymond is responsible.
But so f ar as concerns every right it received
at the hands of the Government of Canada,
my view, as I have stated, is that it was a
matter of legal right on the part of the company once it established what the law required
it to establish. That, in a word, is the position
which Mr. *Geoffrion took bof ore the coinmittee. I have only to say that, reading Mr.
Geoffrion's evidence, knowing him, and knowing thoroughly his high standing as a lawyer
in this country, I concur to the fullest extent
in the position he took before the -cornmittee,
that his application for the rights which he
obtained fromn the Dominion Government
was no application for favour, or no application in regard to which Senator Raymond's
influence, if he had influence, or if he tried
to exert influence, would have been of the
leasb assistance or could have been of any
kind of use.

So I complain of the language which each
comrnittee has used in regard to Senator
Raymond. 1 thinkz they ought, to have been
generous enough to give him the fullest kind
of acquittai, and I think this House ought to
say, by its vote on this occasion or on somi
later occasion, that Senator Raymond has
done nothing, so far as the evidence before
either of those committees shows, which any
honourable man could not have done, which
you or 1 or any other member of this Senate
might. not have done without rendering hirnself
in the least degree liable to, answer or to
interrogation on the part of a brother senator.
The concluding paragraph of this report
is, perhaps like the closing paragraph of many
other things, the place where the sting is to
be found. I do not know whether or not that
was intended, but I want to say in perfect
honesty that elhen 1 read this report of the
committee and reread and exarnined and
studied it word by word, I was not; able to
decide in my own mind whether that Iast
paragraph was intended to be aimed at
Senator Raymond, or whether it was a general
observation to the Sonate at large. It is worded
in a strange fashion, it seems to me:
Týhis Commiittee. feel it te be their duty to
express the opinioni that senators of Canada
should flot place themnselves in the position of
receiving contributions from or being interested
in an enterprise dependent on specifle f avour,
franchise or concession te be made by a government whose conduet is, under the constitution
of Canada, subject to review by both branches
of Parliament.
If that is a general statement, what is
called a pious aspiration after botter things, 1
concur in it, and I arn willing to go perhaps
beyond the distance which members of
the committee were willing te, go. 1 arn
willing to go so far as to support in every way
possible a law disfranchising every senator of
Canada, and saying that fromn the moment he
is sworn as a senator he loses his right to vote.
Judges are in that position, and we, each of
us, ought to be, I think, as nearly as possible
in a like position. I really tbink in alI honesty
it wouid be better to have it understood,
whether it is law or flot law, that senators
fromn the moment they enter this House
should have no more to do with party politics, or party election contests for the House
of Commons. The Bouse of Commons has
always been peculiarly jealous of interferonce
in its elections, and I think it would be ail the
better that we should be equally jealous of
our superior position, and hold ourselves
above mingling in political party contesta once
we corne into this Bouse, where we do not
have any more elections of our own. An
election contest is, of course, of the very life

of a member of the House of Commons. By
that means he wins his seat and is sent to
that House. It is exactly the reverse here, and
intended to be the reverse.
This brings me to a consideration of the
speech to which I referred at the out.et,
the speech of my honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton). He opens
with a consideration of the law, and further
on lie makes the remarks that I alluded to
;vith regard to Senator Raymond. I cannot
refrain,
because I concur in them so
thoroughly, from reading, in a word or two,
what he said in that respect:
As to Senator Raymond J have not found
ainything in the evidence which reflects upon
him or his honour. I do not uuderstand this

Parliament has delegated to the courts that

maintains it, and in any case not -covered by

Everybody knows that this Bouse of Parliament, and too, the Bouse af Coýmmons,
owe their very existence ta the British statute
called the British North America Act. Before
This
1867 there was no0 such Parliament.
present Parliament of Canada was brought
inta being by, and awes its pawers, its vitality
and its right ta legislate ta, this statute and
nothing else; and because this was a new
Parliament being created by this Act of the
British Parliament it was necessary that the
statute itself should define with full particularity what this Parliament of Canada
should cansist af, and what each House of
this Parliament should be. I call attention
ta one or twa sections as I pass.
First, I take the liberty of referring ta section 17, for .iust a word. Section 17 declares:
There shall be on1e Parliament for Canada,
consisting af the Queen, an Upper Bouse,
styled the Senate, and the Bouse of Commons.
I read that clause because of the use and
the prominent position in the sentence of the
Camparisons are always
word "Upper."
adiaus, it is said, and "Upper" is comparative.
But there it is on the face of the statute,
and it means, I venture ta think, exactly what
it says and what the word implies. This
Bouse is called the Senate. It might just as
well have been called the Assembly or any
other name. This Bouse was ta, be the Upper
House, the Bouse Superiar. And why? Because of the manner of the selection of its
members. Its members are picked men-or
picked men and wamen, I should say, since
we now have representation of the other sex.
Some Bon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: This
was intended ta be just what the statute says
-the Upper Bouse of Parliament. The Queen
-the King-the Crown-is the superiar of us
ahl, but as between the Senate and the Bouse
of. Commons there is no question of which is
the one-not of higher authority; the authority
is equal-but of higher place, in the statute
at least, and supposed ta be, possibly, of
higher dignity and honour.
We came next ta the constitution of the
Senate. I will not delay ta go aver the qualificatians of membee's, and other details, but
in passing will simply point out that each is
called by writ af summons from the Crawn,
and that lis right ta sit in this Bouse is the
gif t af the Crown itseif.
'rhen we have the ail-important sectian 29,
whicb deciares in a few words, and the plainest
passible English, that "subject te the provisions
ai this Act" a senator shahl hald bis place in
the Senate for life. Again 1 say that means

exactly what it says, and what it says is that,
save in the manner and for the reasons stated
in that Act, no0 authority anywhere in the
world has any right to say that the place of
a senator is vacated or lost to the individûal
who has been summoned.
We often speak of the tenure of office of
aur judgea, and lawyers will ail remember the
old Latin phrase in which their commissions
wvere couched: "Quamdiu se bene gesserit," or,
ta put it in plain English, as long as he behaves
himself. Now we have it put into an Act of
Parliament. Section 99 of this same statute
provides:
The judges of the Superior Courts shall hold
offienlot for life, but-during good behaviour, but shall be rernavable by the Governor General on Address of
the Senate and Bouse of Commons.
There is a section which provides that the
tenure of office is always anly during good
behaviaur, but notwithstanding that, the clause
af the Act provides a means of remaval for a
judge. Is there any such means even suggested in regard ta a senator? Na, because it
was not intended that a senatar should ever
be removable except far the causes mentioned
in the Act. And let me paint out in that cannection just one ather thing, by cant.rast, in
the wordiýngs af clauses. Sectian Il of this
same statute provides:
There shall be a Concil to ai<1 and a(lvise
in the Government of Canada, te hae styled the
Queen's Privy Council for Canada: and the
persans who are ta be members af that Council
shall be from time to timne chasen andi summ-oned by the Governar Generalprecisely as senatars are-and s-worn ie as Privy Councillers, and members thereof may be f roin time ta time removed

has canferred upon him by the Act of Parliament, in so many wards, the pawer, the right,
ta remove a Privy Caunciller from time ta,
time. With that express pravisian in the Act
af Parliament, in section 11, is it nat beyond
doubt, when we came ta section 29 and find
no such provision in any shape or f orm. that
senators were neyer intended ta ha removable;
that the draftsman of that statute, and the
Parliament that enacted it, knew what they
were about, and intended ta pravide, and did
provide in the clearest possible language, that a
senator ance appainted should hald his place
for life, subject, and subjeet anîy, ta the
pravisions af this Act?
In the circumstances specified in the section which immediately fallows the sectian
I have been discussing, senatars may lase

their place. This Senate, on finding the fact
te be within the language of that section, has
a perfect right to declare the fact. Suppose
some member of this House has failed to
attend for two years. Somebody must find
whether or no that is a fact, and our general
rules provide how it is to be done. The
matter is referred to a committee; the Journails of the House are examined; evidence, if
necessary, will be taken; and the committee
will report te the House what the fact is,
whether or no that member has failed to
attend for two years. Upon the Sonate receiving the report of that committee and
accepting it, confirming it, or concurring in it,
that member's place in the Senate becomes
vacant; not by reason of any action of this
House; for this House dors nothing but find
out and report what the facts are, and thereupon the statute itself works by its own operation the making of the vacancy.
In that connection it is a duty on my part,
I think, to call the attention of everyone who
hears me to the distinct statement of the law
which bas been made by this House itself.
The honourable chairman of the committee,
in moving the adoption of this report, read
the resolution of the House on the suhjec.
I am unable to find it as readily as I thought
I could, but it is stated in the Journals of the
Senate as of the 1st day of August last year.
On that date, only nine months ago, this
Senate unanimously-if there is any virtue
in the word "unanimously"-passed a resolution which recites:
Whereas the constitution does net permit of
effective penalties being applied to the senators
implicated-that is. these three senators-should
they fail te justify them.selves, as
under the BN. A. Act a member of the Senate
may be disqualified froin sitting in Parliament
only upon one of the following grounds:(a) lack of property qualifications;
(b) failure te reside in the Province which
he represents;
(c) bankruptcy;
(dl) conviction of treason, felony or any
infamous crime.
This Senate having considered this identical
matter a few months ago, and having unanimously stated that in its opinion the Constitution provided for disqualification or exclusion
of a senator only under the circumstances of
the statutory grounds mentioned, how can
m' honourable friend from Hamilton, or any
honourable member of this House, rise today and ask the Senate to stultify itself by
delaring that it has some other or additional
power? I think the law is too plain for any
anvil or question.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

But my honourable friend from Hamilton
places his reliance upon the provisions of
section 18 of the British North America Act.
That section, therefore, requires most careful
consideration. Every senator holds his place
subject te the provisions of section 18, just
as much as to the provisions of any other
section of the statute. Let us see what that
section says. The honourable gentleman from
Hamilton appears to have read it as though
it said the Senate of Canada has aill the
powers with regard to expelling members that
the House of Commons in England possessed
in 1867. That was his whole argument, and
that is exactly where I differ from him toto
eælo. This section 18 does not confer upon
the Senate any such power, and indeed it does
net confer upon the Sonate any power at all,
except to assist in legislation. The section
says, as it was originally drawn in the Act of
1867:
The privileges, immunities, and powers te be
held. enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and
by*the House of Commons and by the Members
thereof respectively shall beXhat? Not "shai) be such as the House of
Commons in England enjoys and exorcises,"
but shall b:
-such as are from time to time defined by Act
of the Parliament of Canada.
In other - words, our privileges, immunities
and powers shall be such as Canadian legisJation from time to time ena.cts. No Canadian
legislation has ever enacted, or intended to
enact, any such law as that this Senate bas
power to expel a member. I cannot understand
the argument of the honourable gentleman,
or how ho came to make it, unless it was that
he had not read the clause closely enough.
The section distinctily states that our powers,
like those of the House of Commons, shall be
such as are conferred-defined is the word
used, but I do not .distinguish between the two
word-such as are defined by Art of the
Parliament -of Canada.
The section goes on to refer to the
privileges and powers of the House of Commons in England, net by way of conferring
upon this House or upon the Canadian Parliament all such powers, but as limiting the
extent to which the Canadian Parliament has
power to legislate on the subject. Our
powersshall ho such as are from time te time
defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada,
but se that the same shall never exceed thoseof the House of Commons in England. I
leave out words that are net material to the
point. There is no ýconferring upon this House
of the powers possessed by the House of Conmons of England. Indeed, section 18 does not

MAY 3,1932
confer upon this House any powers at all, but
is merely a statement that our powers shall
be such as the Parliament of Canada, by legislation, may confer upon us, provided that the
legislation never goes beyond the powers which
the House of Commons in England possesses.
That clause in the statute of 1867 was repealed
in 1875, upon an occasion that I need not stop
now to discuss, but may refer to in a word or
two. One of our Acts of Paniament, passed,
I think, in 1873, was disallowed by the Queen
under the provision of the British North
America Act which gives the right of disallowance to the authorities at home. And of
course that created considerable discussion
between the Government of Canada and the
Government of Great Britain, and, as a result,
in 1875 that 'clause of the British North
America Act which I have just read was repealed, and a slightly different clause substituted, which is now our governiûg law. The
substituted clause provides:
The privileges, immunities, and powers to be
held, enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and
by the House of Commons, and by the members
thereof respectively, shall be such as are from
time to time defined by Act of the Parliament
of Canada, but so that any Act of the Parliament
of Canada defining such privileges, immunities
and powers, shall not confer any privileges,
immunities or powers exceeding those at the
passing of such Act, held, enjoyed and exercised
by the Commons House of Parliament of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
and by the members thereof.
That gives this Parliament of Canada at the
present time power to confer by legislation, if
it so pleases, upon this Senate privileges,
immunities and powers, so long as those
privileges, immunities and powers do not
exceed those presently possessed by the House
of Commons in England. But until the Parliament of Canada does by legislation conferimpose, I should rather say-upon this House,
power to exclude a senator or to declare
vacant the place of a senator, this House
possesses no such power whatever.
I am tired and I do not need, I think, to go
on much fu-rther. There is but a little more
that I desire to say. The power to legislate,
under section 18 of the British North America
Act, with regard to immunities and privileges
of the House of Commons and of the Senate
of Canada, was promptly exercised at the very
first session of the first Parliament of this
Dominion, in 1868, by the passing of an Act
entitled, I think, an Act respecting the Senate
and the House of Commons. This statute has
remained in force upon our Statute Book from
that day to this, in precisely the same words,
but we commonly refer to it now as the Independence of Parliament Act. The fourth
section of that Act, which is chapter 147 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, provides:

The Senate and the House of Commons
respectively, and the members thereof respectively, shall hold, enjoy and exercise,
(a) such and the like privileges, immunities
and powers as, at the time of the passing of
the British North America Act 1867, were held,
enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House
of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and by
the members thereof,It does not stop there. It goes on with words
of the utmost significance:
-so far as the same are consistent with and
not repugnant to the said Act.
The B. N. A. Act. That language appeared
in the original statute of 1868; it has been
continued from that day to this; it is now
the law of the land. That is the only Canadian
legislation there is conferring upon this Senate
any powers a.dditional to those specifically
given by the original B.N.A. Act, and that
section in express language declares that such
powers shall not.be inconsistent with or repugnant to the B.N.A. Act itself. Any attemptin exercise of the powers-to exclude a senator
or declare his place vacant for causes other
than those mentioned in the provisions of the
B.N.A. Act, would be in the most distinct way
inconsistent with and repugnant to the provisions of that statute; would therefore be
equally repugnant to and inconsistent with the
provisions of our Canadian Act; and would,
I maintain, be utterly illegal and utterly
nugatory.
The honourable gentleman from Hamilton
told -us that the Senate was the highest court
in the land; that it was a court without any
appeal; that no court would think of controlling our action by mandamus or by endeavouring to enjoin us from acting. I agree
with him that no court would think of
attempting to restrain us from taking action,
even though that action were in the opinion
of the court illegal; that no court would think
of issuing to this Senate a mandamus or any
other order directing us to do this or that or
any particular thing. Such matters are matters
for our judgment and discretion.
But any court in the country is bound, if
the question is properly ibrought before it,
to inquire into and to adjudge whether
or no we have acted within our power, whether
or no we had legal authority for whatever
we did; and if we did assume to exclude a
member from this House, and did it illegally,
I think-whatever my humble opinion is
worth-that means could readily be found to
inquire by the courts and in the courts with
regard to our legal authority to do what we
had done. It is wholly and entirely a legal
question, in that regard, whether we have the
power to do what perhaps the majority of

380

SENATE

this House might wish to do. There is a great
deal more to be said on that subject. I do
not consider that the little I have said tonight begins to be properly or justly a dealing
with such a large question.
I will say only this one thing more, that if
we were given by the Parliament of Canada,
by legislation passed by both Houses and
assented to by the Crown, power to excludenecessarily at the will of the majority of this
House for the time being-any member who
for any cause was obnoxious to that majority,
it would be a fatal blow against the independence of this House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: I do
not think each member of this House sits by
sufferance of the majority. I do not want a
seat in this Houise subject to the will of the
majority; it would not be worth the holding
if the maj.ority for the time being could, at
its ipleasure, exercise the power to say, "That
man is no longer going to retain his place
here."
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen, I am sure we have all listened with very
great interest to the constitutional argument
of tihi honourable gentleman, who is se
eminently qualified to speak from the legal
standpoint. I think, however, that at this
stage of the debate lie could have saved at
least two tours of the time of this House
if lie had addressed himself to the subject
before the House instead of engaging in a
legal discussion on something that is not
before it at all. I would remind him that the
subject before this House just now is the
adoption of this report, and the motion for
its adoption contains no word, no reference
whatsocver, on the subject to which my
honourable friend has addressed himself for
the last two hours. At a later stage of the
developments in tliis case, it may become
necessary to discuss the constitutional phase,
and ien I suppose we shall be subjected to
a reputition of all this legal argument to which
we have listened to-night.
The history of Canada when written fifty
or one hundred years hence will not be confined to a recital of the desperate'efforts of
a Government to cope with the distressing
times through whieh we are passing; nor will
it be content with a discussion of what was
accomplished by an Imperial Economie Conference, which we all hope will have an
important bearing on the future of Canada
in its relationship to other parts of the
Empire.
An important chapter will undoubtedly be devoted to the action of this
Chamber in dealing with the water-power

privileges on the St. Lawrence river, and in
particular to the stand taken by the Senate
of Canada regarding certain members thereof
who sought to obtain privileges for the electrie harnessing of this great Canadian waterway to the sea. I propose for a few minutes
to anticipate the historian and deal with some
features of this question which may or may
not be touched upon by other speakers.
For hundreds of years this great waterway
has been flowing to the sea, extending thousands of miles from the heart of the continent through the great freshwater reservoirs
of lakes, through connecting rivers of great
expanse, over cataracts and rapids, the latent
powers of which were unknown to man until
in recent years scientists and engineers
developed a method by which the rushing
waters could be controlled and turned to good
account for the benefit of mankind.
For over a century the advantage of this
great waterway was confined to its facilities
for navigation and the transporting of comm-erce to and from the interior of the continent. It has served a great purpose in this
regard by affording competition in carrying
charges, and was probably the most effective
means of reducing the prices of commodities
by reason of the lower charges for haulage
which water competition invariably affords.
The eletrie energy which comprises perhaps
its greatest asset is a development of quite
recent date. The modern conveniences and
the reduction in the cost of living, by reason
of the developient of electricity for power
and domestic purposes, are innovations within
the memory of most of those in this Chamber.
At the outset of electric development the loss
in transmission for distances was a great factor
to be contended against. but during the process of years this difficulty has been overcome
by scientific and engineering minds, until now
electric power can be transmitted hundreds
of miles without appreciable loss. The demand for power has, as a consequence, enormously increased from year to year, and this
has led to corresponding competition among
great corporations formed for the purpose of
producing and transmitting clectrie energy in
various parts of the country. Hydro-electrie
concerns of great magnitude, and involving
the expenditure of untold millions of dollars,
have therefore come into being for the purpose of meeting the ever increasing demand.
As a logical sequence, this movement has
developed into keen competition for available
power sites within reach of the large centres
of population and industrial activity. The
smaller and less exponsive developments were

MAY 3, 1932
first sought after and utilized, and then it
became necessary to undertake the harnessing
of the larger projects, which involved great
expenditures of capital, the resources of the
best engineering minds of the country, and
long periods of time, in order to put them
into effective operation. One of the greatest
sources of power on the North American continent-in fact in the whole world-is the St.
Lawrence river, and it was not to be expected
that the stupendous reservoirs of electrie
power in this great seaway would long remain
without being tapped by the ingenuity of
man. It was simply a matter of time, the
application of engineering brains, and the
provision of sufficient capital in order to bring
this great source of electrie power into being.
Many years ago-or, to be exact, in the
9
year 1 02-a man of vision in the Province
of Quebec, by the name of Robert, saw the
possibilities in the St. Lawrence river and
applied for rights to divert water for this
purpose. He did not get much further than
his application, for reasons which it is not
necessary to state.
In the year 1927, however, the market for
electric power had developed enormously and
attracted the attention of a very competent
engineer by the name of Sweezey, who possessed the necessary vision to appreciate properly the enormous latent powers of the St.
Lawrence river, located as they were in the
heart of the industrial part of this great and

growing Dominion of Canada.
out the Robert interests in that year, and
at. the same time acquired the charter of the
Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Corporation. This was the birth and inception
of a company which has now become a household word in Canada from Halifax to Vancouver, and it is doubtful if there is any
subject which is of more frequent current
comment than this company and the history
of its operations. Sweezey, besides being a
competent engineer and a very aggressive
personality, was a man of wide vision, and
saw into the future far enough to justify him
in getting control of this company and
endeavouring to carry out the purposes for
which it was formed to their logical conclusion. It was a seventy-five million dollar
proposition, but this did not faze Sweezey
nor hold him back from his ultimate purpose.
He realized that he would have to deal with
Provincial Governments in getting power
privileges, hecause the provinces are in control of power under our system. He realized
he would have to approach the Federal
Government, because in Dominion authority

381

are vested all rights of navigation on navigable streams and navigable rivers, and he
knew he could not undertake the construction
of any works on a navigable river without
getting Dominion authority. He realized
that in view of the enormous capital expenditures lie would have to interest capital and
capitalists who controlled the monetary
resources, and he knew lie had to have other
brains than his own in order to carry the
great enterprise to a successful conclusion.
He had no doubts in his own mind that, having been carried out to completion, it would
prove an enormously profitable enterprise, repay him handsomely for his efforts and at the
same time develop the industrial resources of
the country and be a general advantage to
the people of Canada.
The working out of all these great plans
comprises the story of Beauharnois and is the
basis for all the charges and countercharges
which have been made in connection therewith in recent years, the investigations of
special committees of Parliament, the heated
discussions in and out of legislative bodies
and the raising of bitter political animosities
which will continue for years to come.
This debate has been proceeding for almost
a week, and I think it would be well for us
now, as we have almost reached its conclusion, to make a general review of the discussion so far, and sec where we stand.
The case presented on this side is very
simple. The report of the committee speaks
for itself, and the chairman has exhaustively
reviewed the evidence, and the House has been
asked to adopt the report. Against this adoption varions arguments are advanced: first,
that the report is a partisan report gratuitously
introduced for the purpose of injuring the
honourable gentlemen affected by it; second,
that the report is not justified by the evidence;
third, that even if the charges were true, all
political parties in Canada have been accustomed to receive political funds, and if
the practice is a wrong one all parties are
equally guilty; and, fourth, therefore the report should not be adopted, and Messrs. McDougald and Haydon should be absolved from
blame in the matter.

favourite claim of honourable members of this

we may profitably spend a few minutes and
see to what extent their claim is correct.

382

SENATE

What is the history of this discussion? What
is the history of this whole Beauharnois affair
which has led to this discussion to-night? It
originated in a speech of an independent member of the House of Commons in the session
of 1931. That gentleman was not a member
of the Conservative Party; he was leader of
the Progressive Party, and had no sympathy
with us, as shown by his votes or support.
In view of the charges which he made at
that time, the special committee of the lieuse
of Commons was inevitable, and the eommittee was appointed in due course upon the
demand of members of the House of Commons.
The report of that House of Commons committ-ee, referring to Messrs. McDougald and
Haydon, concluded that those gentlemen could
not be too strongly condemned. In the first
place, let us bear in mind that that committee, which was comprised of Liberails, Conservatives and Progressives, made a unanimous
report. I understand that statement has heen
questioned. Well, fortunately, we have the
wholle matter in black and white in the records
of this House and of the House of Commons.
I refer to the Minutes of the Senate, No. 49,
of 1931, at page 313. The report says:
It was unanimously agreed that the following
be presented to the House of Commons as a
fourth report.
The report was unanimously agreed to by the
committec.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: We have heard it
claimed, net once, but a 'dozen times during
the discussion, that this was not a unanimous
report of the House of Commons committee,
but the official records as quoted speak for
themselves. It m>ay be true that a few days
later, when the ill effects of agreeing to the
report became apparent to some of the
members on the opposition side of the House
of Commons, one member at least repudiated
the statement that the report was a unanimous one. But the official documents of both
Houses and the records of the .committee show
beyond question that it was a unanimous report that was presented to the House of Commons.
We have heard all through this discussion,
and we have heard it to-night from no less a
gentleman than the honourable member from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), that
this was a partisan committee; that it was coneeived in partisanship and that the report was
drafted in partisanshiýp by the chairman. But
what do we find on page 339 of the unanimous report submitted by the members of the
Hon.

Mr.

LAIRD.

Commons committee? We find that a unanimous vote of thanks was tendered by the
other members to the Hon. Mr. Gordon for
the manner in which he had discharged his
duties as chairmian of that committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIlGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There may not
have been many present.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They were all there.
Sureîly my right honourable friend 'does not
deny that this vote of thanks was tendered.
Surely he will not go so far.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Oh, no, not
so far. I think our committee would have
tendered a similar vote.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: We are talking about the
report of the House of Commons committee.
That cannot be laughed off, because it is here
under the signature of the secretary of the
committee. So, when we hear idIle talk about
the partisan manner in which this investigatien was handled in the House of Commons,
alil we have to :do to show the futility of such
statements is to produce the unanimous report
of that committee and the unanimous resolutien of thanks to the chairman for the manner
in which he had carried on his .duties as chairmian of that committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are all
right except for the record. That is where they
are wea:k.
Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: I know how
records are made in committees.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I want to refer now to
the opinion of a gentleman high in the councils
of the Liberal Party in Canada
I allude to
an extract from a speech of the leader of the
Liberal Party, made at the time this report
was adopted, which appears at page 287 of
the Senate Hansard. Honourable gentlemen
have heard this read before, and I do not
think they like it very much, but I am going
to read it again and run the risk of its
offending their sensibilities. Here is what Mr.
King said:
Individual members of the Liberal Party
may have done what they should not have done,
but the whole party is net thereby disgraced.
The party is not disgraced, but it is in the
valley of humiliation. I tell the people of this
country to-day that as its leader I feel humiliated and I know my following feel huimiliated.
I have told them so in caucus, that we are in
the valley of humiliation.
Now, let us analyse this statement. Here
is the best authority on the subject, the leader
of the Liberal Party in Canada, speaking
before the members of his own party in the
House of Commons. He says:

MAY 3,1932
Individual members of the Liberal Party may
have done what they should flot have done.
What is the implication? Surely it is that
somne members of the Liberal Party did what
they shou]d nlot have done. And who were
the members to whom lie was referring?
Undoubtedly our senatorial colleagues, nobody
else.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Then he goes further,
and says that the whole party is not disgraced.
The oniy implication to be taken from that
is that part of the party was disgraced. Now
then, what part of the Liberal Party was
disgraced if it was flot the Liberal senators
who were mixed up in this investigation and
hiad brouglit humiliation upon the Liberal
Party?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: It was Aird.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The party was "in the
valley of humiliation." There is the best
authorily in Canada speaking. We do not
have to ask individual members in the' other
House what their opinion is. There is the
opinion of the leader of the Liberal Party,
who says that the senators condemned in this
report have done what they should flot have
done; and further, that they have disgraced
the Liberal Party of Canada and forçed it
into the valley of humiliation. How do
honourable gentlemen reconcile such a statement as that, coming from sucli an authority,
with the statements made by them in this
House? IL seems incredible that they should
take sucli an attitude when ail the charges are
practically admitted by the leader of the
party. Yet these gentlemen have the hardihood to stand up and make excuses and dodge
the issueRiglit Hon. Mr.,.MEIGHEN: And quote
scripture.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: -and quote seripture,
and in other ways distort the evidence ta try
to show that the senators reported agaînst are
as pure as the driven snow.
Now we will go n step further. When this
report of the House of Commons committee
was received in this Chamber last session, it
became neoessary for this House ta take
cognizance of it, and a special committee,
consisting of twc or three members from the
other aide of the House and two or three from
thîs side, was appointed to make a recomnmendation to this House as to what should lie
done with the House of Commons report. It
was toc late in the session then te take up
the matter and deal with it. My riglit honourable friend from. Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) was a member of that committee.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I have no doubt that
he is the man who penned the report. If lie
did not, at least lie was conisulted about it.
The mç'mbers of the committee from the
other side of the House were the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), the honourable
member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béiqua),
and the riglit honourable senator from Eganville (Rîglit Hon. Mr. Graham). The report
of that committee-, wbich was unanimous, was
placed before this House and was unanirnously
adopted, and I invite the attention of honcurable meinbers to clause 1 of that report,
which says:
A special committee cf the Senate sbould be
appointed within the first week cf the next
session of Parliament te deal with the conduct
and actions of the~ senators above referred te,
as set out in the said report.
This was the unanimous expression of opinion
cf that committee. Some disposition had tc lie
made of the report sent to the Senate, and this
was a unanimous recommendation that the
ma tter should be taken up by this buse during
the first week of this session, and that a cernmittee should be appointed te, deal with it.
One woîild thinik, after action cf that kind,
which was taken publicly and made a matter
cf record, that our honourable friends who
participated in the making cf such a report
could net have the hardihood to corne here
this session and talk about a partisan coinmittee, a.nd persecution, and cast aIl kind8 cf
aspersions upon the committee after its appointment. Can honourable gentlemen not
see that their whole course is a subter-fuge
fromn start te finish? The action cf this House
was decided upon unanimously, the honourable gentlemen themselves participating. So
the manner in wbich the question was deaît
with up to the time cf the appointment cf
the committee cannot be criticized.
We have heard, net once, but fifty times,
such termas as "the proeecutien," "the concmned," "the sheriff," and "the executioner."
in regard to the treatment extended by this
House, and hy the committee, appointed to
deal with the matter, to Senator McDougald
and Senator Haydon. But I shall show that not
only was the committee appointed unanimously
by this House, but it was appointed at the
request and on the de'mand cf Senator Mc-

Dougald.

tions upon the very capable statement he
made on behalf of lis friend. It was a most
exhaustive defence, and, I think, the only real
attempt on the part of anybody on the other
side of the House to analyse the evidence in
this case. But after hearing him, and after
reading his address, I notice one thing about
bis whole argument, namely, that although
it was an able presentation, and we were all
very much interested in it, from start to
finish it was an argument based entirely on
the evidence of the friends of the persons
interested in this report. He did not follow
the usual practice of a lawyer who argues
a case before a jury or court of law,. who
takes the evidence on both sides of the case
and asks the court or jury to draw conclusions
from it. The address by the right honourable
senator from Eganville was based entirely
upon the statements of one side, the statements of those who are charged in this report,

and of course he had no trouble whatever in
building up an argument leading to certain
conclusions. Anybody could do that. One
does not need legal training to adopt a course
of that kind. His method of presentation is
the best evidence that he was a layman trying
to do a lawyer's job, and failing in bis effort.
Nevertheless bis summary of the evidence
was the only serious attempt made on bis
side of the House to deal with the evidence
in an exhaustive way.
The honourable gentleman from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) used the words "sheriff"
and "executioner." He, too, wobbled a little;
he was not quite sure of his ground. On page
320 of the Debates he is reported as saying:

convince this House. Anybody could say that.
Anybody could say of a man, no matter how
guilty he was, "If So-and-so says he did not
do such and such a thing, I believe him." If
the honourable gentleman is content to base

bis vote on this question on an argument of that
kind, he bas only bis own conscience to
satisfy.
And now we come to the honourable gentleman from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster).
He was a wobbler also. He said he did not
require any assistance in making up bis mind
on how to vote, but if ho did requiré any he
would go for assistance and inspiration to the
honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique). Well, I have already endeavoured
to show that the honourable senator from De
Salaberry did not have any inspiration to
spare. He was extremely doubtful about the
case of Senator McDougald, for he devoted
only five lines to bis defence.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Four.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: So if the honourable
gentleman from Saint John is going to base
bis confidence and future action on the ipse
dixit of the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry, I think he is relying upon a
broken reed. He says, too, that the committee report is partisan from start to finish,
but I notice that he does not go into any
details to show a single, solitary respect in
which it is partisan.
Then we heard the honourable gentleman

complaint was that no attempt had been made

SENATE

I do feel, however, that in the interests of
this House and of those senators something
must be done by a non-partisan tribunal of
some kind to clear up the whole question and
to satisfy the people of Canada at large.
The first implication there is that something has not been cleared up. Then he goes
further and says that the people of Canada
should be more fully informed about the
matter, which indicates that at the present
time the people are not satisfied. But did
he make any attempt to point out how in
any way, shape or form this committee had
been derelict in its duty in failing to inquire
into the matters referred to them, or failing
to bring out any information that was available? He did not. He contents himself with
the general statement.
I now pass to defence number two, that the
report is not justified by the evidence. I need
not dwell upon that, because surely it was
the duty of honourable members who so
contended to show in what respect the report
is not justified by the evidence; and the only
serious attempt made in that connection was
that of the right honourable senator from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). I have
already pointed out that his statement was
based solely upon the evidence of the parties
implicated, without regard to the damaging
evidence against them.
Defence number three is that even if the
charges were true, all political parties in
Canada have been accustomed to receive
party funds, and that if the practice is a
wrong one all parties are equally guilty. But,
I ask, what has this House to do with that
question? Is that within the scope of the
reference? By the reference I mean the duty
assigned to the committee by this House
when the committee was appointed. It reads
as follows:
That a special committee of nine senators to
be hereafter named, be appointed for the purpose of taking into considerýation the report of
a special comnittee of the House of Commons
of the last session thereof to investigate the
Beauharnois Power Project, in so far as said
report relates to any honourable members of
the Senate. said special committee to hear such
further evidence on oath bearing on the subjectmatter of such report in relation to any sucli
honourable members of the Senate as it may
deem desirable and in accordance with constitutional practice, and that the said committee
be authorized to send for persons, papers and
records.
There has been a lot of talk about camnpaign funds. But what authority had this
committee to go into the question of campaign funds? I suibmit it had none whatever, and if any question had been asked
respecting party funds, it very properly would
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

have been ruled out. I say it is ridiculous
to raise that bugaboo on the floor of the
House as a reason why the report should not
be adopted.
The fourth and last defence is that, therefore, the report should not be adopted and
that Senators McDougald and Haydon should
be absolved from all blame.
I shall be interested to sec how far the
members of this House are prepared to go
in refusing to adopt this report. Bear in mind
that the House of Commons unanimously
adopted its committee's report; no yeas and
nays were recorded. Bear in mind also that
the committee appointed by this House at
the last session, and comprised of members
from both sides of the House, recommended
unanimously that a special committee bc appointed this year. That special committee
was appointed and made its report, which has
been presented. It was not a unanimous
report, but it must be borne in mind that no
other report was submitted, notwithstanding
the fact that members of the committee on
the other side of this House were requested
to submit a draft report. The chairman was
the onlyv member who submitted a draft report. It may fairly bc asked why members
representing the other side of this House
did not choose to submit a report. There
must be one of two reasons: either they were
incapable of preparing a report-did not have
industry enough te prepare one, or they were
indifferent and thought it bet net to present one. I will be charitable and say that
they did not have the necessary industry, for
I know that it required great industry on the
part of the chairman to prepare his report,
and that it represented some weeks of hard
work.
I am interested to know on what grounds
the honourable senators on the other side of
the House will justify their action in refusing to support this motion for the adoption
of the report. All through this discussion they
seemed to have had the idea that the whole
question is a matter confined to the four walls
of this Chamber, that we are going to settle
this matter within this House, and that no one
else in the country is interested. Well, if
that is their idea, they are grossly mistaken.
I want to warn honourable gentlemen that
the interest in this case, and in their vote on
the motion to adopt this report, extends from
Halifax on the Atlantic to Vancouver on the
Pacific. There are ten million people in this
country who have their eyes fixed upon the
action of this Senate to-night.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear. hear.

MAY 3, 1932
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Ten million people will
open their merning newspapers ýto-4morrow
to ascertain what course we have pursued with
regard to the motion for the adoption of this
report. Are honourable members going to vote
against the report? If they do, what explanation will they 'le able to give? The report says that certain senators have been
guilty of conduct unbecoming members of the
Senate. Those who vote against concurrence
in this report will say, in effect, that the
conduct of the senators in question was becoming for senators, that the charges are not
tru.e, that ail this investigation has developed
nothing unusual or wrong, and proved a myth,
and that the senators concerned are white as
the driven snew. Now, I invite honourable
members to go to, any part of Canada, fromn
Vancouver te Halifax, to any city or tewn in
this vast distance, and ask the opinion of
the man in the street with respect to this
question. 1 also suggest that they consider
public opinion as expressed in the newspapers
of this country. Have they seen a single
c-ditorial in any newspaper defending these
gentlemen and stating that the conimittee's
report should not lie adopted? I defy them
te produce a solitary editorial of that kind.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: What about the Brockville Recorder?
. Hon. MrU LAIRID: 1 have flot Inoked at
the Breckville Recorder; but I have looked
at the Lethbridge newspaper which is controlled and owned 'by our friend fromn Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan). I flnd that the
editorial columns of that newspaper are as
dumb as the proverbial eyster, for lot a single
word, one way or another, has been said about
this question.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: H1e is on the fence.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 1 say that the action :n
this Ilouse has attracted a great oloud of
witnesses who are watching and waiting to
sec what disposition is made -of this report and
what action is taken by honourabie gentlemen
on the other side of the House. They want to
know whether these gentlemen are geing te
make the cause of the senators their ewn. Up
te the present time they have done so in this
House; they practically stand together, regardiess of consequen-ces; they have in every
way defended these charged, notwithstanding
that their colleaguesl in the House of Coinmens denounced them, and notwithstanding
that the leader of their party denounced them.
I say to these honourable gentlemen, before
they vote against this report, before they
defeat it, they should bear in mmnd the public
sentiment in this country, which is focuased
41767-25à

upon them te-niglit, and if they have any
heseitatien in recognizing where their duty lies
they sheuld have regard te public sentiment
and govern their action accordingly.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable gentlemen, I
shaîl net at this late stage of the debate
attempt te analyse the evidence, which. has
been already done. I shaîl briefly censider the
manner in which the case has been presented
te us, and the spirit and 'temper in which it
ought te lie received, especially in view of
the fervent appeals addressed te us te discard
party prejudice and passien, and deal with the
matter in a judicial spirit. There were semae
grounds for hope that that weuld lie done. The
Senata has heen describad as a quasi-j udicial
body, independent of the Heuse of Commons,
free from partisan spirit, and with a creditable
recerd of revising the legislation of the Huse
of Cemmons and cerrecting any errs which
may have been made in the hurry and conflict
of the popular Chamber. Se, when the matter
was referred to this honeura.hle bouse, there,
were hepes of a calm, judicial inquiry, cenducted in no partisan spirit, and with ne motive
excapt te elicit the truth. In this serene
atmesphere, far fremn the madding crewd's
ignoble strif e, the case would be fairly heard,
and conclusiens arrived at which would cernmend themselves te the judgment of men of
ail parties. Especiaily was there confidence
in -the independence of the Senate, and fts
resolute refusaI, more than ence affirmad,
te bie a mere ruliber stam-p for the opinions of
the bouse of Cemmens. True, the bouse of
Cemmens report was transmuitted te us, net
with the idea that we should swallow it who]e,
but rather that we sheuld apply te it that
impartial judgment which we exercise in revising the legislatien of the ether Heuse.
Se we appointed our Smimittee, and we
awaited its judgment, hoping for a calm, judicia;l utterance du the true senato-rial spirit. How

are like the dathier who, in wielding the red,

Weill, as I say, I amn net trying te resd their

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I thought you were
going to say that he turned his guns on
Humiliation Valley.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I do not quite see the
point. The honourable gentleman will perhaps speak afterwards. Anyway, we have the
fact that judgment was pronounced and
execution ordered before a word of evidence
was given.
The right honourable leader of the House
resents the imputation that he is acting under
instructions from the Prime Minister. However, I am not discussing his attitude, but
our own; and I say that our reaction toward
any attempt at dictation or interference from
outside is one of resistance. We offer, on
behalf of the Senate, a declaration of independence. We declare our independence of
We declare our inthe Prime Minister.
dependence of the Govcrnment. We declare
our independence of the House of Commons
committee. We declare our independence of
the House of Commons and all its parties.
Let me repeat my objections: (1) We have
before us a report which in the main is
not independent, but merely a copy of the
report of the House of Commons committee.
(2) A disagreement and a practical equality
of expression in the committee. (3) A total
absence of the judicial spirit in the presentation of the report to the House. (4) The fact
that judgment was rendered and execution
ordered by the Government before the matter
was considered by us.
I shall therefore vote for the rejection of
the report on the ground that the accused
senators have not had a fair trial before an
impartial tribunal. My conclusion also is that
if, on account of party spirit, or the subordination of this Chamber to the Government
or the House of Commons, we cannot try
the case fairly, the best course would be to
refer the case to a royal commission of judges.
But my preference would be for an independent action by this House if possible.
If I am not wearying the House I should
like to say a few words as to campaign funds.
We are agreed that these are necessary and
legitimate, but that they must not be obtained
by contributions from persons or from corporations which have a direct pecuniary interest in legislation or administration. But
apparently the implications of that are not
fully realized. It means, for instance, that
there must be no contributions from manufacturers receiving or hoping to receive
favourable tariff treatment if they have a
direct pecuniary interest in the result of the
election.
I believe that the present practice is wrong,
and believe that in order to raise legitimate

389

campaign funds it ought not to be necessary
to call upon possible beneficiaries of legislation or administration, or corporations which
consider that they need some kind of protection against radical legislation, such as banks,
or upon men of great wealth. At the same
time I see difficulties in the way of reform.
The ideal system is one of small contributions
from large numbers of people. In the last
general election there were cast some four
million votes. A dollar from each elector
would produce $4,000,O0, enough for all the
legitimate expenses of all the parties. But I
am aware that this is a counsel of perfection.
There is unfortunately a large body of electors
who think they are conferring a benefit on
the candidate and the party by going to the
polls and marking*a ballot, and who would
be shocked by the proposal that they should
pay even a dollar to advance the cause they
prefer. I admit the difficulty, but until the
electors are willing ta do that, I agree with
the honourable senator for Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) it is useless for them to
deplore the fact that election funds are raised
in the only way they can be raised under
present conditions. I admit that the problem
is a serious one, and I am glad it is being
discussed.
I have net hitherto been an advocate of
compulsory voting, but I am prepared to give
more study to the question in view of the
present opinion of the leader on this side of
the House that it would tend to remedy the
evil; an opinion expressed also by the leader
of the Liberal party.
I will support any reasonable measure of
reform, but I will not vote for a report which
is equivalent to a complete surrender of the
independence of the Senate, as well as an
injustice to men who have not had a fair
trial.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable members, it is only because the leader of the House
is anxious that the debate be concluded at
this sitting that I speak now. Otherwise, under
the usual procedure, I would ask to adjourn
the debate until next sitting of the House.
At this late hour I will not enter into details
as I ordinarily would.
With my short experience in this House,
and a longer experience in another place,
I felt that it would not be right to cast a vote
affecting the honour of senators,and particularly
senators with whom I have had the closest
personal acquaintance during the years that
I have been in Parliament, without expressing
myself on this matter.
The honourable gentleman who spoke last
on the other side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Laird) used a great part of his speech in

âU0

SEXATE

criticizing the preceding speeches of members
on this side. Be accused almost everyone
on this side f0 whom hie referred of wobbling.
Now. 1 think thaf honourable members
opposite who are supporting this majority
report will find that in the accusation made
against at least one member of this House,
the honourable member from Wellington
(Hon. W. L. McDougald), there is very littie
more than a charge of wohhling. la other
words, they accuse hlm of not being frank
in bjs statement in this House.
The honourable senator from Regina (Hon.
Mr. Laird) and the honourable senator from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), chairman of the
special committee, aîter directing the attention of honourable members on this side of
the Bouse to the special committee's report,
in which the senators uîîder rev iew are supposedly found guilty, say f0 those ine this
Chamber who have heen defending thema,
"Show us that they are not guilty and we
wiIl believe it." In doing this they have
departed enfirely from ail principles of British
justice. They first find the accused guilty
and thon ask us f0 prox e thieir innocence.
1 think that is most unusual in a matter of
this kind, which should be approached with
delicacv and good judgment.
Now I want f0 say a word on the situation,
as I sec it, in relation f0 the honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. McDougald).
The flnding of the commitfee
against hlm was that bis actions were not
consistent with bis duties and standing as a
senafor. To prove that, they cite first bis
statement to týhis Boýuse of April, 1928, and
try to imply, by innuendo, not by
evidence,'
that that was not a correct statement. Th,
evidence is f0 the contrary, and 1 say fo the
honourable gentleman from Regina (Hon. Mr.
Laird) and the other honourable gentleman
from Saskafchewan whio spoke this affernoon
(Bon. Mr. Gillis) that if they want f0 make
use of the evidence they should quofe thaf
part of the ex idence of the honouýrable senafor from Wellington (Hon. Mr. McDougald)
which hears them ouf. Furfher, they tried f0
attribute f0 him a wrong stafemenýt regarding
his holdings in the Sterling Industrial Corporation. I will not deal wif h this from the
legal standpoint, for I have no legal training.
I can perhaps illustrate the relation of Senafor MeDougald with the Sterling Industrial
Corporation and ftbe Beauharnois Corporation by way of an anialogy. Let us suppose
thaf we, as farmers, wanf to exfend our activitie.s and buy more land. We know where
there is a farm týhat is suitable for our purposes. WVeknow that if we went f0 buy it
lIon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

ours9elves the price would be unreasonable; so
we send someone else te> make an investigation and examine if. Af fer examining it bie
cornes back and reports fhaf if is neccssary te>
secure some means of getting te if; fhaf we
must bave a rigbt-of-way. So we take an
option uýpon a right-of-way from. anofher
owner, and we hold that option. Meantime
someone else cornes along and buys fbe land.
Be wants a right-of-way, but finds fhaf we
have an opt ion on if, and hie concludes thaf if
would hc better for him f0 purchase our
option than f0 firy f0 get another righf-ofway. Would if be right or proper fo say thaf
we, who f ook the option, were the owncrs of
that land? I say, honourable gentlemen, thaf
this committee is drawing a very fine line
when if deals with Senafor McDougald's
inferest in a company which, according to the
righf honourable the leader of the Government, bad no tangible assets unfil if wais faken
into the Beauharnois Company, and had a
value only because if had a prior application.
The extreme stcps that arc sougbf fo he
taken would neyer be sanctioned by any
.judioial body on the ground of any proof
hîoughf forward by the commitfee in support
of ifs finding in regard f0 the Sterling Industrial Corporation.
Let mie go furtber. The law bas been so
ably deait with by the bonourable senator
from North York (Hon. Mr. Aylesworth) that
1 need hardly mention this. If bas heen admitted hv the chairman of the commiffe thaf
t he senators in question have donc nothing
that would be prcventcd by the law at the
pi esent tirne. I could quof e the cbairman's
mords in regard f0 that, but I will not do so.
Anvone who wishes f0 sec thera can find fhem
in biis speech in support of the adoption of the
report. I therefore state frankly and fearlessly thaf, as far as I arn able fo see-and I
have rcad t he evidence and followcd if closely
-there is no reason for the extreme nction
.suggested hy the report of the committoee
To support sucb action you have f0 assume
more than the evidence pr-oves; and I fhink
if is unfair that sucb action should be faken
merely because of innuendo or inference, and
wifhout anv clear proof by way of evidence
in support of if.
N'ýow a word as f0, Senator Baydon. Senator
Haydon, according f0 the report of the coinmiittee, bas been found f0 be, guilty of conduet that is not consistent wifh bis standing
as a senator. There are twvo particular grounds
for this findfing-. The first is thaf bis firma
took a large contingent retainer. I do nof
think if is necessarv that I should go info
thaf. I arn sure fhere is no evidence thaf

MAY 3, 1932
any undue influence was exercised by the
honourable senator from Lanark (Hon. Mr.
Haydon) by reason of his firm receiving that
retainer. In fact, honourable gentlemen, I
say there has been no evidence submitted
throughout this whole inquiry and discussion
to show that political influence was exercised
in any degree whatsoever. As was stated by
the honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), there was no
opportunity for the exercise of political or undue influence except in regard to the giving of
legal assent to the rights granted to Beauharnois by the Province of Quebec;- and the
Federal Government was not in a position to
refuse if the requirements of navigation were
fully safeguarded.
lI referring to the relation of Senator Haydon with this transaction, the honourable
senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchiStaunton) was unfair, I think, in saying that
the whole trouble, as he saw it, was due to
Senator Haydon's reference to Canad-a's Bigli
Commissioner in London; that lie was content to leave other matters to be presented by
other members of the Bouse, and would
pronounce lis judgment against Senator Haydon for that alone. That, however,' I think,
explains everything. I arn full.y convînced
that we should not have heard the ranting
remarks of the honourable senator from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) and bis accusation
of partisanship prevailing on this side of the
Chamber had it not been for bis own partisan
feelings in regard to the manner in which this
report was being upheld by memýbers on lis
own side of the Bouse.
Reflections were made upon Senator Baydon by the cornmittee because lie received
campaign funds. Campaign. funds have been
thoroughly discussed, during this debate, and
we have receivedt sorne very interesting information in this regard. As the honourable
senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
has said, there is no disgrace attaching to
campaign funds; and I say that no evidence
was given to the conimittee -that campaign
funds were improperly given or impropeTly
accepted. Counsel representing the honourable senator from Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haydon)
before the committee endeavoured to inquire
into the motive behind the giving of ca.mpaign
funds, and I think it is fair to say, without
going to the length of reading the evidence
to you, that the honourable chairman of the
committee ruled that counsel did not have
the right to do so, and that the committee
had no business to inquire into the motive
bebind the contribution. In spite of that

Uli1

ruling, the report of the committee imputes
a motive for the acceptance of campaign
funds. The committee found in reference to
Senator Raymond that it was to secure bis
influence, thus insinuating that lie kept some
of that money for lis own use. This is not
fair to Senator Raymond. We listened to a
very interesting account of campaign funds
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae)Riglit Hon.. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think the honourable gentleman should make
the statement that there is in the report any
inferene, however remote, that Senator Raymond kept a cent of the money. Nothing but
a dliseased imagination could prompt such a
conclusion.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: My rigbt honourable friend .may use the words "diseased
imagination." I arn not going to f ollow him
in the use of such wordis as those. That is
a matter between him and His Honour the
Speaker.
The clause that I refer to is clause 5, which
is quoted fromn the Bouse of Commons report:
In view of Mr. Sweezey's attitude throughout
and bis views as to the necessity for political
influence, it is hardly conceivable that Mr.
Sweezey would pay this large surn of rnoney
over to Senator Raymiond unless lie at least was
satisfied that the Senator's influence had been
or would be worth the moneyRight Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
---- nd it is remarkable that Senator Raymnond
a
did flot insist on making some explanation of
his position in this regard in view of the
evidence.
That is the report of the House of Comnions
Committee, implying that the m~opiey was paîd
to secure the politioal influence of Senator
Raymond.
Riglit Bon. Mr. MEIGREN: Certainly; but
not paid to him personally.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I arn sorry, but I
did not hear the interjection.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: 0f course it
was paid to him, but there is no intimation
that it was kept for bis personal use.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: How, then, are thcy
going to secure bis influence?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because of bis
interest in the Liber>l Party.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Then it iniglit go
through any other channel.

392

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Another man
might not have much influence with the Liberal
Party. There is no reflection whatever on
Senator Ravmond with respect to the $200,000
-that is, as to keeping it for himself-and
I do not think the honourable gentleman is
fair in intimating that there is.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I quite realize that
there is no reflection, but all the friends of
the right honourable gentleman are taking the
attitude that there is. I take the attitude that
the three senators are in the same positionthat there is no evidence to incriminate them
under the law; and I think the right honourable gentleman almost agreed with that in the
speech that be made not long ago.
I was referring to campaign funds, and to
the information that we received on Friday
last from the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), who rather gave
himself a certificate of character. Perhaps that
is not quite the right term. In any event, ho
certainly gave us to understand that his
olfactory nerves were very highly .developed
in the matter of scenting out good funds and
bad iunds. When he was giving us that information I was wondcring how he distinguished. He referred to the activities of, and
the assistance that he received from, a man
named Howard Smith. The same name came
out in the committec, and it was said that he
was a collecter.

He was going between the

honourable gentleman, who was secretary, or
treasurer, or organizer of the Conservative
Party, and contributedHon. Mr. MeRAE: Will the honourable
gentleman tel] me where he finds that? The
collector he refers to certainly was not the
collector for the Conservative Party.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: As I understood the
statement, he came offering funds, went to
sec those who were furnishing the funds, and
came back again with the offer of more funds.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I said that he came and
offered funds. I did not say he went back.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: He was not a collector;
he was a distributor.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It is a very unusual
organization that distributes funds before it
reaches the treasury. I just want to say that
the whole implication about the contribution
of campaign funds, in regard to which the
senators under review are charged, is that they
were induced by those means to influence the
party to which they belong-that their influence was secured by those who gave the
monoy. My honourable friend referred to the
head of the Howard Smith Pape-r Company.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

He shou'ld take the responsibility of saying
that, apart from Beauharnois, no other funds
were recedved by him froni those people. He
has not d'one that. He has been very careful
in his references to the people who represent
the paýper companies. It is well known that in
1928-I mention this to show how necessary
it is to go into the things my honourable friend
brought out in bis speech-the magazine
publishers of Canada asked to be relieved of
certain duties so that they might get their
paper more cheaply. They were given a rebate
of 80 per cent of the duty when the paper was
used in magazines, and from that time on the
magazine business flourished and the publishers
were pleased. They were placed in a position
to compete satisfactorily with similar publishers
in the United States. My honourable friend
has told us about the activities of the man
wsho was going between him and someone who
was eager to contribute funds to his party at
the last election.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I beg the honourable
gentleman's pardon. He was net going between
myself and anybody.
If the
honourable
gentleman will confine his remarks to my
statement, he will be correct.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In his statenient he
referred to the activities of Howard Smith in
relation to hinself.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Ye mean the activities
of Smith on belihalf of the Beauharnois Company.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In approaching the
lionourable gentleman, who was the organizer
of the Conservative Partv.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: For Beauharnois.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: My honourable friend
should have been frank enough to say whcre
he got the contributions.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: When you begin to
inquire about contributions to campaign funds
you will find it a matter of record that within
about two months of the date when the honourable gentleman saw this other gentleman
an Order was pasced cancelling the rebate of
80 per cent of the duty, and putting that one
firm in a position to supply the publishers of
magazines in Canada with paper at an increased profit of 80 per cent. In view of that
result, and of the activities of Howard Smith,
I think it is onlv fair to say that this question
of campaign contributions should be examined
into a good deal further, .as was requested in
another place last year. I submit that the
matter calls for a more searching investigation,

heard of the resuit of influence with regard
ta the flrm that the honourable gentleman
from Vancauver (Han. Mr. McRae) named
as appraaching him in the matter.
lIon. Mr. McRAE: WiiI the hanaurable
member pardon me again? I mentioned na
flrm at ail, but merely an individual. I suggest agaîn thqt if the honourabie gentleman
will canfine bis rernarks ta my statement lie
wiil be correct.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: My bonaurable friend
wants to, distinguieli between the flrm and the
individuai, but tbat je a pretty bard tbing ta
do. A man who is president of a flrm cani
liardly dissociate himself from bis firm when
lie goes ta neake campaign contributions. If
my bonourable friend wants ta make a distinction so fine, lie may make it for himef.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I can say this ta my
honourable friend, that the gentleman did flot
dissociate hiniseif fromn Beauharnois. That is
the only tbing lie repre.sented.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I am not going ta
follow il- up. I have stated the facts. that
lie was cannected with a certain campany and
tbat certain beneflts were received fram tbe
Gevernment. The charges that we are deaiing
with here are ail based on inference and not
on evidence placed before the committee.
Han. Mr. McRAE: I quite understand that
that is the opinion on my honourable friend's
side of tbe Hanse, and that lie lias become
contaminated by inferences.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does my honourabie
friend deny the fact that tbe rebate on
magazine paper coming into Canada was eaucelled?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I cannot say. My
honourable friend must rememiber that I was

Hon. M.r.SINCLAIR: I am taking the time

But I desire ta say that my remarks with
regard ta Senators Haydon and McDougaid
apply equaily ta Senator Raymond. The committee liad no riglit ta bring in sucli a report
as it did against these tliree senators. It is
based largely -on inference and innuendo.
Honourable members -on tbe other side,
particuiar]y the right lionourable leader, have
disregarded certain features of the evidence.
I sulimit tbat in the interests of this country
and of aur parliamentary institutions it is
unfair ta go so f ar as this report asks us ta go.
The riglit lionourable gentleman wlio leads the
Government in this House stated that it
wouid be deplorable that tbe vote on the
motion for the adoption of the report should

lie bad the rîglit view as ta that, but I sulimit
that the manner in wbich tbe report bias corne

RESIGNATION

0F HON. SENATOR

McDOUGALD
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I am just in receipt of a letter frorn
Hon. Senator McDougald, wbich I beg leaye
to read.
Ottawa, May 3, 1932.
Hon. Raout Dandurand, P.C., LL.D., K.C.,
The Senate, Ottaw a.
Dear Senator Dandurand,
You will reeall that some months ago I told
you 1 lîad no desire to continue longer as a
mnember of the Senate, but that, in view of the
refleotions cast upon my integrity and character

b3 the report of the special comrnittee appointed
by the House of Commions iii June last to
inquire into the Beaubarnois projeet. 1 could
not, and would not, tbink of retiring until I
liad been accorded, and availed myseif of, tbe
constitutional rigbt of appearing before my
peers, the mnembers of the Senate of Canada,
wvith respect to, the matters referred to in tbe

report of the House of Commions cormittee.
That opportunity 1 bave now bad.
I distinguish, as you yourseif have done in your
speech in the Senate on Friday last, between

those, in a political assembly, wbo are one's
peers in the true sense of the word, and those

who are one's political enemies.
The Hon. F. L. Béique, tbe Rt. Hon. George
P. Graham, the Hon. A. B. Copp. and the Hon.
C. W. Robinson, wbo were the Liheral members
of the ecormittee appointed by the Senate ta
investigate the matters referred to in the House
of Commons repoýrt, in s0 far as they reflected
upon members of the Senate, are, ail of them,
gentlemen wbo bave heen a long time in public

395

MAY 3, 1932
life, and whose names are held in the highest
regard by the citizens of Canada generally.
These gentlemen, having heard the evidence
given before the committee, and having reviewed
the argument of counsel, have unanimously
expressed the opinion that the condemnatory
findings of the reports of the special committees
of the Commons and of the Senate are not
justified by the evidence.
Leading members of the Liberal Party who
thus far have participated in the debate in
the Senate on the motion to adopt the report of
the Senate committee, and who have followed the
inquiry throughout and have carefully perused
the evidence, have been equally emphatie
in their declarations that political partisanship
alone accounts for the condemnatory features of
the report, and there is every reason to believe
that, when the Senate divides on the motion for
the adoption of the report of its committee, it
will be found that the division will be on party
lines pure and simple, and that without exception, the Liberal members of the, Senate will
decline to accept the report.
In the light of the partisan political character of both inquiries, it would be impossible
for anyone belonging to the political party
which is in the minority in both Houses of
Parliament to expect more in the way of
vindication than this. So far as relates to the
recorded views and votes of members of the
Senate who are also members of my own
political party, it is a complete vindication.
To all who have joined in denouncing the
partisan nature of the inquiry, and in making
clear that what has been expressed by way of
condemnation of myself in the report is not
borne out by the evidence, I wish to express my
profound gratitude as weill as thanks.
With those members of the Conservative
Party in the Senate who have not hesitated to
do all in their power to destroy me, both
politically and personally, I have no desire to
have any further association. Having received
the vindication I have from those whose regard
I cherish, I feel that the time bas come when
I may honourably withdraw from the Senate,
and I therefore -give to you herewith, as leader
of the party in the Senate, my resignation,
witnessed as required, and shall ba obliged if,
on my behalf, you will kindly see that it l
tendered in due form.
In severing my connection with the Senate,
may I. as a parting word, express the hope
that my withdrawal may help to appease the
passions and recriminations which have already
donc untold injury to an enterprise of national

importance, and help to restore peace and amity
in this Chamber.
I remain, my dear Senator,
Faithfully yours,
W. L. McDougald.
To this letter is attached a letter to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency
The Governor General of Canada.
Your Excellency:
1, Wilfrid Laurier McDougald, a member of
the Senate of Canada, do hereby tender my

This letter I will now hand over to the
right honourable leader of this House, who

may transmit it to His Excellency.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable

to the extent of a single sentence, on the
letter which Senator McDougald has written
to the leader of his party. The time is not
appropriate for comment. I refrain absolutely.
I do wish to say, though, that I believe he
has taken the right course in tendering his

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
ATTITUDE TOWARDS CERTAIN SENATORS

Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen, in view of the resignation submitted to this House flast night, I think it is
due al. senators that I should make a statement indicative-indeed, completely so-of
the position which, as leader of the Government, I feel should be taken with respect to
the entire matter.
The resignation submitted by Senator McDougald naturally and necessariLy disposes of
the necessity for any further consideration as
regards the phase of the subject having to do
with him. Last night I expressed appreciation

of his action. I think the terms of the letter

with which his resignation was communicated
were unfortunate; but that is his concern.
As respects Senator Raymond I have never
felt, and do not now feel, that the terms of
the findings of the committee-just though
they were, and, I think, entirely fair-would

warrant the consideration of any further action
at alil with regard to hi.m.
As to Senator Haydon I desire to state to
the House that I have received the most convincing, and I feel I may say authoritative,
information respecting his health. The information as to his condition now is such
that, without any reservation whatever, I feel
we shouild not be justified in considering further action as respects Senator Haydon.
In making this statement I submit the
judgment here expressed to that of honourable senators.
FISH INSPECTION BILL
SECOND READING
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN

moved the

second reading of Bill 6, an Act to amend
the Fish Inspection Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the right
honourable gentleman give a summary explanation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Under the
terms of the Fish Inspection Act as now in
force, provision is made for the inspection of
fish, the containers in which they are placed,
the bona fides of the quality under which they
re shipped, and so on. The provisions of
the Act are such that all fish that come under
the terms of the Act do not need to be inspected. Apparently the principle of it was
that an occasional inspection would effect the
purpose. This bas proven to be not best, or
perhaps net right at all. The purpose of
this Bill is to provide for complete inspection
and to bring certain additional classes of

goods within the terms of the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that,
living inland, I do not know very much about
the fish industry. I have no special remarks
to make at this stage of the procedure. The
Bill will go to committee, and any honour-

able members of this House living on the
Pacific or on the '.tlantic or near the Gulf
of St. Lawrence will have opportunity to
examine the Bill and offer any criticism they
may deem proper.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

any request for a postponement, I shall have
it placed on the Order Paper for Tuesday.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Consideration in Committee was postponed

CRIMINAL CODE BILL (TRUSTEES
DEFINED)
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 42, an Act to amend
the Criminal Code (Trustees defined).
He said: This Bill defines what is meant
by the word "Trustee" where such word
appears in the Criminal Code. The only
addition to the definition are the words, "or
by any Act." I will read as far as those
words appear:
"Trustee" means a trustee on sotie express
trust created by some deed, vill or instrument
in writing, or by parole, or by any Act.
That is, if a person is named a trustee by
an Act, then he is within the definition of
a trustee under the Criminal Code. The words
'any Act" extend not only to any Act now
in effect, but to any future Act.
The amendHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment appears to me to be a quite natural
one.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps we can
dispense with the committee stage.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would suggest there is no need of going into Committee.
The explanation is very simple and there is
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

no detail whatever to be given. The amendment consists in the insertion of the words
",or by any Act."
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Is the object of the
amendment to bring assignees and liquidators
under the Criminal Code?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not unless
they are named trustees by an Act of Parliament. If they are named liquidators, they
are not named trustees.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

If they are named

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
No. The
only amendment is "or by any Act," and that
would not mean the act of any court. The
words "any Act" are defined as follows:
"Any Act," or "any other Act," includes any
Act passed or to be passed by the Parliament
of Canada, or any Act passed by the legislature
of the late province of Canada, or passed or to
be passed by the legislature of any province of
Canada, or passed by the legislature of any

FRONTIER COLLEGE BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved th.
second reading of Bill 53, an Act to amend
the Act of Incorporation of The Frontier
College.
He said: Honourable senators, the Frontier
College is an institution rendering educational
services to working men and others on the
frontier, or, to be more accurate, in the outlying parts of our country. The College bas
had the power to conter degrees, but last year
it entered into an agreement with the Province of Ontario to apply to the Parliament of
Canada for an Act to be passed repealing the
section giving it this power. The purpose of
the College in so doing is to bring itself
within the terms of the Statutes of Ontario
entitling it to certain assistance, which assistance it would not be entitled to as a degreeconferring college.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Can the right
honourable gentleman tell us whether the
College has a seat of learning where its
students congregate, or whether it is a mobile
association that travels from one place to
another?

COWAN

DIVORCE BILL

SECONI)

R EADIN.G

Hon. Mr. McMEANS imoved the second
rdi:u'lng of Bill VI, an Act for the relief of
Gordon Alexander Cowan.
Hon. I. W. LAIRD: Honourable senators,
it is not the practice in this Chamber to chaIlenge sueports of the Divorce Comnittee. On
the contrary, the reports of that committee
are usually adopted without question, and
bills, based upon theem arc passed without
discussion. But there are circumstances connsected with this Bill that I think should
receive some consideration at the hands of the
House. It is not ny intention to challenge
the decision of the committee, and the report
which followed, but, as the Bill will have to be
considered in another place, I think it is well
tiat certain facts should be pointed out.
The petition in this case is from Gordon
Alexander Cowan for a Bill of Divorce frocs
Marion Turcnlull Binns Cowan. At the outset
let me say that I do not know these people
at all; I never heard of them before, have no
acquaintance with theem, and no one on their
behalf bas spoken to me about this matter.
But it so happens that I heard a large portion
of the evidence, and I have since carefully
perused the record. In my opinion the report
of the commsîittee was not justified by the
exvicIence.

familiar.

That sounds

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It bas become a habit.
I am not intending to challenge the report,
nor am I going to undertake an analysis of
the evidence to show wherein it is improper or
unfair; but I wish to point out one or two
features that to my mind, at least, have
an important bearing as to why this divorce
should not be granted. As you will see by
the report, the evidence is quite voluminous,
and if you will read it you will notice that it
is largely confined to matters of the class we
have heard about in this House for the last
two or three days-matters of suspicion. As
this House lias adopted the principle of not
acting on anything that is founded only on
suspicion, I think we should not adopt this
re port.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But you have
set a precedent.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Not on suspicion.
I want to point out, however, that the main
evidence upon which this divorce was recommended was the evidence of two hired detectives, and in what I have to say I wish to
concentrate upon that. The principal detective in the case was an uncle of the petitioner.
This would indicate that he, at least, was not
an impartial witness. I want to read from
his evidence as to the incident that gave rise
to this divorce. I am not going to read the
sordid details. Honourable gentlemen can
take them as read, or peruse them for themThis detective, an uncle of the

petitioner, described what happened immediately after the incident was discovered, as
follows:
Q. Juîst describe it fully?-A. As I put the
heavy flash on the car you could sec them both,
and Cowan used some abusive language to the
man, told in lie had wrecked lis home and
stole his wife.

Q. And there was a fight there?-A. Yes.
I stopped the fighft after I thought the other
man got enough.
Q. Wh/at was Collins saying all the time?A. Collins asked him net to kill him. And the
woman hollered for ber father.
Q. Did anybody coie ouit of the house?A. Yes, the same little girl, I presume, came
out; and the fathser came eut. The father
wanted te hit him with a lamp.
Q. _Who did?-A. Collins and the others. He
was laying down at one timee, and tlsey tore
his clothing, and scratcled him; and the wife
made a scratch at him and I pushed ber away
too. She went to scratch, to take hies off this

Q. You took a hand in ict yourself?-A.
Well, 1 didn't want to eee the maxi hurt. I
was looking after his interests, Mr. Senator,

Q. I suppose that flght must have caused
quite a lot of noise around the bush?-A.
Well, only with the womenfolks hoJlering. We
wasn',t hollering, only I told him to give hima

That je the evidence of this impartial witness, advising the petitioner "'to give him
plenty when he started.' That je the evidence
of the firet detective, who, as I say, was an
uncle of the petitioner.
The second detective was a man hired by
the uncle. He describes the fight in more
lucid terme, and I think hie description is
sufficient of a claesic to be placed on the
records of the Flouse. Honourable gentlemen,
who are ueed to fights, will know what I
mean. Here it is:
Q. What ahouit the lighte on the car? Did
they remain on af.ter the girl went away?-A.
No, they went ont .after. And Akin give a
signal a few minutes after, for Cowan to corne
up, and then they were in the position the Mame
as on the llth. And he flashed the iight and
Cowan jumped on to Colline and started to beat
him up and hammer him around, and there was
a lot of shouting poing on and everything.

Q. When Cowan started to beat up Collins,
who turned up ?-A. Weil, there wae a man
came running up, I think it was Mr. Binns,
and there was a lot.-of yelling there, knocking
hell out of him there.
Q. Who knocked hell out of whom?-A.
Cowan was on Colline.
Q. Dîd anybody try to interfere with Cowan?
-A. Yes, a man came running up with a lamp
there, Mr. Binne, and he came running up with
that.
Q. What did Mr. Binne do?-A. Well, to tell
you the truth, -there was a reai hattle on. The
girls were ail yeiling, the women were yelling.
Q. Did you see Mrs. Cowan there?-A. Yes,
Mre. Cowan was there.
Q. Did she interfere in the scuffle?-A. She
wae yelling and pulaing.
Q. Whom wae she puliing at?-A. I don't
know. 1 know they were rolling over on the
ground, Cowan and Collins.
Q. Tell us what ynou eaw ?-A. Well, the
hattle was se fast. When he got out, after
Cowan was given the flash, he rushed at hirn
and he started at him, and they were down.
And the man corne up with a lamp, he wae in
hie nightshirt, and he had a lamp with a handie
on the top, and he said, "Don't do this." And
the girls were ail shouting, and you coulId hear
it aIl over because-it is at Echo Lake--you
could hear it ail over.
As I eay, the evidence relating Vo the point
upon which the divorce was granted was

that would indicate a very impartial spirit on
the part of any witness, let alone a detective
who was brought into the case to give the
evidence which. was the main factor in securing the divorce.
As 1 say, it le not my intention to challenge
the report, but I wish to put this statement

FINANCING BILL
SEOOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 34, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to
authorize the provision of moneys to meet
expenditures made and indebtedness incurred
during the calendar year 1932.
He said: I may say, honourable senators,
that this Bill follows an only too well-beaten
path. It is the same in form and structure as
a Bill previously passed at this session, which
had to do with the excess deficits of last
year. This Bill relates to the estimated deficit
of this year, and is to enable the company to
issue securities up to a maximum of S61,500,000. The Bill that came to us from the other
House to-day authorized a guarantee with
respect to these securities; this Bill merely
authorizes the issue of the securities. I do not
sec that anything is to be gained by going
into Committee on the Bill, because it follows
a form that we have passed upon many times.
Pight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is the usual
method when there is a deficit; but there are
in this instance two Bills-one to authorize the
issuing of securities and the other to authorize
the Government to guarantee them.

GOLD EXPORT BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 45, an Act respecting
the Export of Gold.
He said:
Honourable senators, the authority which for some time has been
exercised by the Government, and which up
to now lias been based merely upon an Order
in Council under the Unemployment and
Farm Relief Act-the successor of the War
Measures Act-is embodied in this Bill and
will become statutory if the Bill passes. This
measure provides that the Governor in Council may prohibit the export of gold, save
ender certain conditions and at such times as
exception may be made, and that such export
shall be made only by chartered banks, the
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

purpose, of course, being to preserve such a
supply of gold as will enable us, in respect of
outside payments, to keep upon a gold basis.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I notice that
there is a penalty clause, as follows:
4. Whenever a regulation made under the
piovisions of section three of this Act is in
force any person who, without a licence issued
by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance,
as afnresaid, exports or attempts to export,
carries or attermpts to carry out of Canada any
gold, whbether in the forem of coin or bullion,
shall be liable upon suînmary conviction to a
penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars or
to inprisonment for a terni not exceeding two
years, or to both fine or inprisonment.
Is that a new departure in legislation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Something that
we have not yet had on our Statute Book?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It must be.
There is no antecedent Bill. This Bill is to
take the place not of any other Bill, but of
an Order in Council. I think I know what is
in the mind of my honourable friend: it is
that a man should not be held to be a criminal if he puts $10 in gold into his pocket and
takes it across the line. The Bill is not
intended to apply at all to such a case. It is
intended to apply to the export of gold by
banks in quantity, or in the form of bullion;
and the right to define bullion is provided in
the Act. I do not think there is any danger
of the Act being abused. I can sec that a
Pcrson would not want to be accused of breaking the lav because he carried over a little
gold in his pocket. I do not think that is
called export.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Are there
many instances of Canadian men with gold in
their pockets?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My observation has been that people who are going to
the States, or going to Europe through New
York, go to the bank and obtain a certain
sum in gold pieces, which they expect to
use, either in New York or in Europe, as
standard money, not depreciated.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes. That is

In Europe, I

States is taken with greater alacrity than gold

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It is rendered
necessary, I believe, by those agreements,
but, there is some question as to whether
it was not necessary ail along. The House
will appreciate the purposes of the Bill better
by a specific case. Under the regulations of
the departmcnt, authorized by statute, petroleum and natural gas prospecting was permnitted, and there had to be deposits when
leases were taken out for the working of
In
petroleum and natural gas privileges.
addition to the prescribed rentai, each applicant for a permit wvas -required to make a
deposit of forty cents an acre, which was
returnable upon evidence being submitted that
an equal expenditure bad been incurred in
prospccting operations on the location held
under the permit. Tbis was merely security
that the work would be done, and that the
party had his lease for lis own use rather
than for speculation. If he did not do the
work, then the rnoney that hie had put up
was held; but if he did the work he was
entitled to receive it back again. Now, cases
have arisen where parties are entitled to receive back their deposits, but bccause of the
transfer of the natural resources the legal
power is lacking. The purpose of this Bill
is merely to enable the department to exercise the samne right that it has always exercised
to return the money. I do flot need to enter
into the question of removing the doubt as to
the exercise of that right in the past, but it
is now necessary, in the opinion of the Department of Justice, that these returns be
authorized.
Would the

Wben homesteaders gave assignments to
railway companies for areas acquired for rigbt
of way, the railway com.pany, at the request
of the department, instead of paying the consideration money over to the entrant, f orwarded it here to be beld in trust, pending
the issue of patent. It bas been tbe practice
to pay the money to the entrant when the
departmnent ascertains that bie bas become
entitled to patent. The entrant is not entitled to the money until he gets bis patent.
Tbere would be some cases of that character.

Then there would be moneys paid to the
department in connection with yearly licences
and permits to cut timber on Dominion lands.
The department here is holding certain sums
which have been received in connection with
the disposal of timber rights on Dominion
lands in the four Western Provinces. These
sums are either deposits made to guarantee
that the permittee should pay the prescribed
charges and conform to the timber regulations, or they are credit balances which have
arisen in favour of the permittee or berthholder during the course of his operations.
Also, in the matter of seed grain, in
occasional cases where a settler bas paid an
instalment on seed grain indebtedness charged
against the land for which he obtained entry,
he bas been permitted, on his abandonment
of the entry, to obtain a refund of the sum so
paid. Then there are cases of pre-emptions

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Was there anything specified in the contracts with the provinces as to these amounts being liquidated,
or being returned to the provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN: I should presume that the contracts with the provinces,
ratified when the natural resources were
turned over, provided for the return of these
moneys. There lias to be statutory authority
for it. I presume the provision is only contractual now.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think my
right honourable friend is right. In the settlement made with the provinces when the
natural resources were finadly transferred there
was a long succession of conferences that
bristled with difficulties, not in great questions,
but in these smaller things. If I remember
correctly, it was arranged in the final discussion that such matters as are included in the
present Bibi were to be settled by conference
and agreement. Although the money rea'liy
could not be handed over, it was agreed that
it should be. These are not the only matters;
there are a thousand and one other minor
details; but there was no statute giving the
federal authority power to do certain things
which were provided for in the agreement,

though not perhaps in detail. I think this Bill
is one that ought to receive the support of the
House on that ground.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might take
the second reading now and have the third
reading next week, and in the meantime the
right honourable 'leader may be able to inquire as to the tenms of the contraet with the
various provinces governing these operations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The explanatory notes are prietty clear. Apparently these
moneys vere formerly paid out of current
revenue. I think these eiplanatory notes
should go on Hansard now:
Up to the time of the transfer of the natural
resources to the Western Provinces it was
customary for the Department of the Interior,
as a matter of departmental routine, te refund
to those who had been doing business with the
department payment for which no value had
been conveyed.
Generally speaking, these
refunds were a matter of departmental routine
practice; others were provided specially by regulation of the Governor in Council. The policy
was well known and those who did business
with the department counted on being able to
obtain these refunds with reasonable promptitude.
The whole question bas been carefully
reviewed by the Legal Officers of the Crown,
who advise that while there is presently no
legal authority to niake these refunds. there is
a responsibility upon the Dominion. In certain
cases this is a legal responsibility and in other
cases a moral obligation.
The purpose of this Bill is to obtain authority
to niake from the Consolidated Revenue Fund
such refunds as the Governor in Council nay
authorize.
They do not add much to what I have already
said.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Take the case of a right
of way, where the railway company had paid
the funds into the Dominion Government and
the patent had not been issued when the
natural resources were handed over. Suppose
the patent was issued the year followingRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then the company would be entitled to that money. It is
a case exactly in point.

FASTERN BANK OF CANADA BILL

Bill about?

MAY 4, 1932
iRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black), the Chairman of the Banking and
Commerce Committee, understands the circumstances of this Bill better than I do, but he is
flot here at the moment. The Eastern
Bank was incorporated by the Statutes of
1928. Mr. Angus McLean and Mr. Taylor,'
I recali, were active in the initiation of the
enterprise, but liard times came and it was
not gone on with. They had to make a deposit
of a large sum of money, which was subscribed.
The affairs of the Bank having been wound
up, the executors of Angus McLean have made
application to the Minister of Finance for
payment out of the Bank Circulation ]Redemption Fund of the amount at the credit of the
Bank. The ýjum of $5,000, deposited by the
Bank under the provisions of the Bank Act
in the Bank Circulation Redemption Fund,
reprements moneys subscribed and paid for
shares in the capital stock of the Bank by the
said Angus McLean. The purpose of the Bill
is to authorize the return of that money to the
estate of An.-Us McLean.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: AhI the other
shareholders have reoeived their refunds?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I may say that the
facts of the case are stated in the preamble
of the Bihl.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: As I understand it, alh the rest of the subscribers have
been paid, but, Angus McLean being dead,
authority is needed to make a refund to bis
estate?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN, That is it.
.Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: And under the Bank
Act these arnounts paid into the Bank Circulation Redemption Fund are not forfeited, if
it happens that the Bank does not operate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 think that is
right.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Therefore this amount
shouhd be refunded.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bank had
not received its licence.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS

wvhich construction is postponed until the 3lst
of August, 1934, are set out in the sehedule.
The Act authorizing the construction or coinpletion is indicated in the schedule -opposite
the namne of each line.

respecting what has been donc, where anything has been done, and what the intention
is. I arn net asking for any more than second
reading now, and we can heave the committee

mneasure may be discussed in detail, if desired,
Honourable
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
senators, perhaps 1 can throw a little liglit
on this. Some years ago it was represented
to the Department of Railways, and through
that department to the Government, that
construction of branch lines could be carried
on more practicaýlly, and possibly more economicahly, if a certain programn for more than
one year's construction were laid down. Consequently Parliament adopted the plan of
oaming certain ines in a program of construction that would require two years for
completion. The Minister of Railwe.ys was
required to make a report within fifteen days
of the opening of Parhiament succeeding the
granting of any such riglits, stating what had
been expended and how many miles of railway had heen constructed. Parliament and
the Government now find that the country
is in a finaucial condition that does not warrant the immediate construction of these hines,
but at the samne time it is not desired to
cancel the program. The object is merehy to
extend the present programn for two years
from the date of its expiration. In that extension of time financial conditions may be
such as to warrant the construction of these
branch hunes, and there will he the necessary
authority to proceed with the work.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is it.

proposed lines we were in the last days of a
session, and. as it was felt that the country
was surfeited with railways that were confronted with an immense deficit, my motion
for second reading of the measure was defeated.
The following year we came back
with twenty-eight bills, instead of one, and
those were sent to the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. Representatives of the Canadian National Railways appeared bcfore that committee and were required to show whether each one of the proposed branches was needed and would pay.
I am wondering now whether it would not
be the proper thing to send this Bill before
the same committee, so that we might make
sure that there still is a necessity for the
building of the lines mentioned. Of course,
if honourable members think that there would
be a sufficient safeguard against unnecessary
expenditures on these lines without a reference
of the Bill to the Raihvay Committee, then
I should be satisfied to leave it to the discretion of the right honourable leader whether
the Bill should go to that committee or not.
Perhaps it might go in the meantime to the
Committee of the Whole. It could then be
transferred to the Railway Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest that
it should go direct to the Raiiway Committee.

CONTROL OF RADIUM FROM
CANADIAN ORES
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION
WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed from April 21 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Senator MoRae:
That in the opinion of this House the
Government should declare its intention to
control the production and distribution of all
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND.

radium procured from Canadian ores; and to
that end should immediately appoint a Canadian Radium Commission tx investigate and
recomnmend at the next session of Parliament
the best methods to adopt to give effect to
such control.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Honourable
senators, I point out that the terms of the
resolution are such as to render inapplicable
a considerable part of the discussion that we
have had on this matter. The debate has
proceeded in large degree upon the assumption that the resolution, if given effect to,
would compel the Government to take over
the pitch-blende deposits in which radium
appears, and develop them as a Government
enterprise.
I do not think that is imphied
in the resolution. It cannot be questioned
that there should be control, and inasmuch as
the deposits are in the Territories, and not
in any province, responsibility for such control is a federal one. I think, though, that the
statutory provisions are already sufficient to
enable a measure of control to be exercised.
Whether they are ample or not for the control
that the mover of the resolution has in mind,
I am not sure.
The latter part of the resolution, however,
is such that I should not like to sec it passed.
I have become somewhat horrified at the
multiplicity of commissions and investigations
that we have under way in this country in
various forms and guises.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Machinations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: People who
are not under investigation in one way or
another will soon be in the minority.
Of
course, the importance of our radium deposits
can hardly be over-estimated. I realize that
the mover has not in mind the making of
tbis proposal a source of great revenue to the
Crown. His objective is to have the deposits
developed for humane purposes, to have them
recognized as a great nmeans of medical service,
and to try to have them used for the benefit
of this country first, and of all countries next,
in a medicinal and humane way rather than
for purposes of profit. I suggest, though, that
a Radium Commission is not necessary in
order that this goal be reached. There is
still a reserve of resourcefulness in the
Government sufficient to work out a solution
without the aid of a special commission, and
if the honourable member will permit me I
would ask him to withdraw the motion, upon
the assurance that the subject is having the
immediate and earnest attention of the
Administration.
I know that various suggestions have been before the Administration,

MAY 4,1932
and 1 arn confident that a solution involving
-control, and out of line with this resolution
on]y to the extent of avoiding a commission,
for the presant at ail ev-ents, is under review
and, indeed, active consideration.
I compliment the honourable member (Hon.
Mr. McRae) on the interest he takes in
this subject, the importance of which it is
impossible to over-estimate. I do not pretend
to be an authority on the value of the pitchblende deposits. I see they are discussed by
an officiai ini the Department of Mines, and
it does look as if 'Canada had a suply of
radium of inestimàble value to this country
and to the whole world, such a sujpply that
there is an apparent need of having its administration carried on perhaps more carefully
than that of any of our other resources. I
cannot go further at the present tiine than
to assure the honourabla senator frorn Vancouver that the interest 'he takes in the matter
and the facts ha has presentad regarding it
are valued by the Administration, and that
we hope to attain at least the spirit and the
main body of the object of 'his motion.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourabie senators,
after the remarks of the right honourable
leader of t.he House it is no longer necessary
for me to deai with what 1 thought was a
misinterpretation of .my motion, having regard
particularly to the word "control." The
honourable gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) a few days ago dwelt at considerable
length upon the cost of taking over the pitchblende claims. But that was neyer the intention of the resolution as I viewed it. When
I made the motion, the inteipretation I gave
to the word "-control" was the sarne as that
which has just been indiýcated by the right
honourable gentleman. I have looked up the
word "control" in the revised (1929) edition
of the Concise Oxford Dictionary, which was

myself ýneither add to nor detract frorn it.
When I made my statement to the House I
went into considerable detail to show how it
might be applied, and in doing so I may have

sornewhat obscured this fact. I referred
to management under the direction of the
Departrnent of Mines, which is now experimanting with pitch-blende; this rneaning under
the guidance of the Department of Mines. I
also said it rnight corne under a controlled
private corporation, which means a company
the Government would hold in check.

I think

I can give quotations frorn the press to show
that this is a necessity. Than again I said it
might be under the direction of a permanent
Radium Commission.
I arn sure the Government had something
like this in mind. Paragra*ph 130 of the

Quartz Mining Regulations for the Northwest Territories, which bacame effective on
April 2 of this year, is undoubtedly what the
right honourable gentleman referred to, and
somewhat covers the situation.

It reads:

The Governor in Council reserves the right
to make such additional regulations from time
to time as rnay appear to be necessary or

expedient in the public interest, governýing the
developrnent and oparation of any mninerai dlaim
or mine acquired under these regulations in
which, in the opinion of the Minister, ores containing radio-active elements oceur in sufficient
quantity for extraction, also regulations governing the production and conservation of such ores
and the elimination of waste.

That paragraph undoubtedly refers to pitchblende. It indicates, I quite agrea, the assertion on the part of the Government of the
right to control; but I do flot think it goes
far enough in this case, or that it expresses
any intention to enforce that right.
in regard to that 1 have a word or two
to say. I doubt whether this development
wilI corne along in the natural course, without
some co-operation from the Government, ave-n
if it is left to private corporations to work

nature.
I think I arn right in stating that the motion
stands by itseif, and that remarks made with
reference to it by honourable senators or by

developrnant in the far away, frozan north.
Before doing this I would clear up one or
two questions which. have arisen since I introduced this motion. The cost of radium bas
been discussed at considerable length. 1 made

SENATE
the statement that the probable cost would be
$10,000 a gram and that the ultimate possible
cost might be $5,000 a gram. I said that for
present calculations I would take $10,000 a
gram. In support of that statement I have
no less an authority than Mr. Parsons, of
Washington, the gentleman who managed the
Colorado radium deposits for the United
States Government. He gives it as his opinion
that the cost of the Belgian radium, the ore
of which is not, I believe, as rich as our own.
does not exceed $10,000 a gram. I think the
statement of the coal requirements made by
one honourable gentleman was misleading, and
although I have been unable td check it up,
authorities consider it excessive.
Now, with regard to the transportation of
pitch-blende: at the present time the Department of Mines estimates the cost of transporting pitch-blende, with the present facilities,
which are very expensive, at $400 a ton. An
ultimate cost of $100 a ton, which was my
estimate, will be much more than ample, I
think, if a railroad ever reaches that territory.
I ask honourable gentlemen to permit me
to refer to some items appearing in the press.
I was told when I took up this subject that
it was controversial, and that I had better
leave it alone. Sone people regard what I
have suggested as a statement of Government
policy. I need not tell you, honourable gentlemen, that I am net in any way speaking for
the Government, and that the Government
is not responsible for my utterances in this
louse, any more than are any of my friends
and associates who have been drawn into the
matter. I speak for myself. I believe that
when something comes up which, from my
long experience in business, I think is of
benefit to the country, I as a member of this
honourable House should have the privilege
of giving the benefit of my knowledge and
experience to the House without having my
motives questioned for so doing. I notice
that so reputable a paper as the Northern
Miner says that my motion smells of Moscow.
Also the Financial Post, which I have no
desire to advertise here, impugns my motive
in bringing up this matter. In fact, in a
heading, it asks: "What is back of McRae's
proposal?" It might have been headed "Shades
of the Last Election." Then it goes on to
say that I happen to be an important party
organizer-something which I do not think
bears any relation to this question. In any
event, as I explained to the House last week,
that was two years ago.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

Just suspicion.

Hon. Mr. McRAE:
They are just about
as accurate in this as they were in their forecast of the last election. However, there are
one or two other things to which I wish to
refer. They say that I am a mine promoter
on no mean scale. Well, honourable gentlemen, I do net come within that category. The
plain facts are that at the present time I
have an interest of less than one-quarter of
one per cent in a company that owns some
claims in the Great Bear district. Whether
there is pitch-blende on those claims or not
I do not know and do not care. My reason
for taking up this matter is a personal one,
I admit, but not a financial one. Unfortunately I have had the experience that brings
this subject close to the hearts of most of
the families of this Dominion, and consequently, as far as 1 am humanly able, I will
endeavour to see initiated such a policy as
shall place radium at the disposal of every
man or woman in this country who needs it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I am very grateful to
the medical members of this honourable
House for their unanimous support, and also
for the encouragement of the medical profession throughout Canada-the guardians of
our national health.
So far as the charge of being a mining promoter is concerned, let me say, strange as it
may seem, I have never organized a mining
company. With one exception, I have never
been an executive officer or a director of a
mining company. The exception to which I
refer is a directorship in a base metal company which is to-day struggling to make both
ends meet, and in the effort is providing
sustenance, it is estimated, for some 2500
Canadian people. No apology is needed for
that.
There is one criticism of the Financial Post
with which I agree. I quote from the issue
of that paper of April 23, 1932:
General
McRae
can hardly have been
unaware tîat there has been a persistent effort
to turn the legitimate mining operations at
Great Bear Lake into the foundation for
another speculative boom which would permit
millions of dollars of shares to be unloaded on
the public.
There is good reason to believe that in that
regard the Financial Post is correct.
I notice in the New York Sun of Wednesday, April 20, 1932, an article headed, "Radium miners rush to Canada." It says:
With the break-up of winter about one thousand men. mostly veteran gold prospectors, will
set out from various points in the United

MAY 4, 1932
States, Canada and Alaska to, penetrate to the
sub-Arctic wilderness of the Great Bear Lake
country.
Then 1 observe in the Ottawa Citizen of
April 28 iast an article headed "Crazy miner 's
dream cornes true at Great Bear Lake"
-an article copyrighted, if you please, by
Frederic B. Watt, in which, dealing with Great
Bear Lake, he refers to silver ore assaying
10,000 ounces to the ton.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: In to-night's Citizen
there is another copyrighted article by Watt
referring to Great Bear Lake. It says:
Further evidence of a richness almost beyond
the dreams of a Croesus was obtained at Labine
Point, Sunday, when a one-ton chunk of ore,
believed to contain about forty per cent silver,
was blasted off No. 2 vein.
Twelve thousand ounces of silver in a one-ton
piece of ore is a record unrivalled, and even
mîining- men "hard-boiled"* to the breath-taking
value of minerais here were shocked into openmouthed amazement.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: 1 thank the honourable gentleman for his contribution. If that
region cornes up to anything like expectations
it undoubtedly will be a profitable mining
field, but such values cannot be expected to,
apply to a large tonnage.
As I pointed out, Great Bear Lake is a
thousand miles north of Edmonton as the
crow flues, eight hundred miles from, Waterway, and about eight hundred miles from
Peace River ýCrossing, from whîeh a railway
could be built. This means that we have to
look forward to a very large capital expenditure
for transportation. if that area justifies such a
development. Eight hundred miles would
probably mean an expenditure of S50,000,000
for more railways. I think we ail agree that
the Canadian people cannot stand such
expenditure. It might be well for those
interested in the Great Bear section to
appreciate that when the time arrives when
the district justifies this large expenditure,
the mines will have to bear it, and some
arrangement will have to be made, by
royalties or otherwise, to recoup the Govern,ment for any money it inay spend, in providing transportation for the ore to market.
I suppose that here, again, I shahl be subjected
to the eriticisrn of more smells from Moscow.
The people cf this country have enough railways on their hands, and they certainly wil
look te the natural resources of that district to
finance its transportation requirements.
1 started out, honourable gentlemen, with
the fear that these radium resources of ours
might flu into the hands of foreign interests,
and there are some late reports to support that
view. I find an article appearing in the Calgary
press of April il, in which Dr. H. W. McGili,

409

of that eity, speaking before the Alberta
Council of Physicians and Surgeons, issued a
warning which ends with the following
paragraph:
The intereste seeking control of Canadian
radium production were the same as those now
operating in Central Africa, and financed by
Enropean money.
In an Edmonton paper I find Mr. L. A.
Giroux, one of the members of the local Legislature, claiming that foreign capital was seeking
te -control northern radium fields.
The main objeet that I have in using the
word "control" in this motion is to give
warning to any foreign interest that this
Government would take whatever action was
necessary to regulate the production, distribution and priýce of radium in this country. 1
do not think a .paragraph in the mining regulations wîlil accomiplish this; otherwise I should
have no serious objection to accepting the
proposai of the right honourable gentleman.
I share with him his view of a commission
in many cases, but dealing with radium, which
is a very technical matter indeed, requiring
special know-ledge of engineering, mining,
medical and similar professions, I arn doubtful
as to how far the Governmnent will get unleas
it appoints some body of men-cali it a commission or not, as you like-to study the situation this summer and bring in a report for
the consideration of Parliament, providing for
the proper safeguarding of not only the prod-uction, but a'lso the distribution of radium.
To summarize the rernarks I have made
before this honourable House in regard to my
motion, I would say: first, that steps shorald
he taken, to prevent our radium resources from
falIing into foreign hands; second, that inquiry
should he made as to the best methods to
,produce radium from Canadian ore in adequate
quantities and at a reasonable price; third,
that the educational program. essential to an
increased distribution of radium should re-ceive
consideration; fourth, that steps should bc
taken to regulate the movement to our Arctic
which is apparently now under way.
I do neot feed, honourable gentlemen, that
this House is going too far in expressing its
approvai ta this motion. I think it is the unanimous opinion of the people that some steps
should be taken to proteet radium production
and distribution.
Hon. Mr. GUILIS: There is just one question I would ask the honourable gentleman,
in regard to the necessity for radium to the
world. Suppose the people of Canada are not
prepared to make the deveioqsment. If foreign
money is available for the puerpose of deveiopment, is it not botter, from the humaxie stand-

410

SENATE

point, to have it done by foreign money
than to have the radium lie dormant there for
a number of years, when it is so much needed
in the world?
Hon. Mr. MýeRAE: In answer to the honourable senator I would say that control of
radium by our Government would not necessarily mean the exclusion of foreign money;
quite the contrary. So long as foreign money
d<veloped the industry and helped to foster
the interest of Canada and the interest of
humanity at large, there would be no interference. But if the time came when exorbitant prices were asked for the product, or production was restricted so that an exorbitant
price might be obtained, then the Government
could step in. That is the crux of my motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the desire
of the honourable senator to withdraw his
motion?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: On the assurance of the
right honourable leader that action will be
taken along the lines I have mentioned in this
honourable House, I will withdraw the motion.
The motion was withdrawn.
DUPLICATION IN CANADIAN RAILWAY
SERVICES
MOTION ANI) DISCISION
The Senate resu.med from April 26 the adjourned debate on the motion of the Hon.
Mr. Casgrain:
That in thie judgment of the Senate, in order
to give ininediate relief by eliminating some
dupliuation in the service of the Canadian
railways, pending action by the Commission
presently investigating Canadian railwsays, a
commnittec composed of an equal number of
present officials from the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company and the Canadian National
Railways be formed, 'and elect an umpire.
Failing to agree in their choice, the Supreme
Court of Canada shall appoint this umpire.
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourable senators,
I shall not detain you long at this late hour.
lt seems to me that the discussion on this
matter has at times drifted far away from the
turms of the motion, hy which it was sought
to effect economies by eliminating some
duplication in the services of the two great
railways. I shall not speak upon that phase
of the subject. The honourable senator from
Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) digressed somewhat from that aspect when he referred to the
report of Sir Alexander Gibb and the maritime
harbours. I shall try to confine myself to
bhese questions.
Whether or not we agree with the extensive
report of Sir Alexander Gibb on the harbours
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

of Canada, we must admit that he has compiled
a great deal of useful information. I trust that
honourable senators will read his report when
it is printed. There is, however, a distinct
objection in the Maritime Provinces to the
centralization of control, and I think it will
be some time before that part of his report
which recommends the elimination of local
harbour commissions will be put into effect.
Evidently there is similar objection in Vancouver. The Vancouver Sun of April 14
features an editorial criticism of the recommendation that the control of port administration be centralized. Among other things, the
Sun states:
The day that Vancouver allows the authority
and control of our port to be taken fromn
Vancouver three thousand miles east to Ottawa
that day Vancouver will cease to grow. The
Gibb statement that Ithis port could be better
run from Ottawa may be theoretically right,
but in practice and politics it is one hundred
per cent wrong. Even a Vancouver man seated
iu an office in a swivel chair three thousand
miles froni Vancouver becoes useless. Vancouver owants and needs and must have, not less
control, but more control of her own affairs.
The Halifax Herald, referring to this editorial, states:
Certain it is that centralized control is not
looked upon with any degree of favour in
Halifax and Nova Scotia-and Halifax and
'Vancouver are Canada's greatest ocean ports.
The Halifax Chronicle also opposes centralization.
I propose to refer briefly to the port of
Halifax, to show what a great harbour we
have there.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
agan.

Maritime

rights

Hon. Mr. LOGAN: Yes. Maritime rights
are what we want, but we do not get them.
Halifax has a deep waterway harbour, one of
the best harbours in the world. Including
Bedford Basin, there is a water area of thirteen
and one-quarter square miles, of which at
least ten square miles have a depth of water
of not less than thirty feet. The tidal range
varies between 6 feet 6 inches and 4 fet, and
only at the narrows connecting the main harbour
with Bedford Basin does the current reach
three-quarters of a knot. The main harbour
is practically free of ice. Fog is of some
frequency during the summer months, but
since a wireless directional station has been
provided very few navigation difficulties have
been experienced.
As Sir Alexander Gibb
says, the natural conditions of this port are
almost ideal. In Nova Scotia we think it is
the best harbour in the whole world. It is a
land-locked harbour.

MAY 4,1932
The port is divided into three separate
sections. Richmond Terminal has a single
shore quay 700 feet long, and there is a depth
of 28 feet of water at low tide. This quay
has rail connections. The cattle shed in the
rear has a capacity of 1,000 head. South of the
Naval Dockyard is another section, known
as Deep Water Terminals. At these terminals
there are already three piers, providing berths
with a minimum depth of 30 feet of water at
low tide. Pier No. 2 is built of concrete and
bas a two-storey shed. The third, and newly
developed, section of Halifax Harbour is
known as Ocean Terminals. It consists of a
bulkhead wharf and one pier, known as "A".
There are three berths parallel to the shore
line, numbers 20, 21 and 22; and four berths in
the basin, numbers 23, 24, 25 and 26; also
two berths on the south side of Pier "A",
numbers 27 and 28. Berth 24 bas 30 feet of
water at low tide; number 23 has 40 feet, and
the remaining berths have 45 feet.
Pier "B", now under construction, will be
1,250 feet long and 300 feet wide, and will
have four .more berths, the two outer ones
having 45 feet of water and the two inner
ones 35 feet at low tide.
It will thus be seen that Halifax Harbour
by nature has been provided with great depth
There is no
of water, even at low tide.
harbour in Canada that has the same natural
advantages.
The harbour has been thoroughly equipped.
May I say, in passing, that this equipment is
not being used. There are faciilities for handling 20,000,000 bushels of grain annua'ly, yet
far less than 1,000,000 bushels are shipped
through the port each year.
For the handling of wheat and other grains
there has been provided by the Government
an elevator, which is owned by the Department of Trade and Commerce and operated
by the Halifax Habour Commission, with a
caipacity of 2,235,450 bushels per year. But we
handle nothing like even 1,000,000 bushels a
year. This elevator is situated at the back
of Pier "A" and connected with the marine
leg at berth No. 24, and grain conveyors for
loading vessels at berths 21 to 25, inclusive.
The Canadian National Railways operate
all the raidway trackage. The main iline of the
Canadian National Rai'lways divides at Fairview, which is close to the city of Halifax.
One route skirts the shore past Richmond,
and goes on to Deep Water Terminals; the
-other passes down the east side of the Northwest Arm and crosses over to Pier "A". The
total storage capacity of the railway yards
in Halifax is about 4,900 cars. Liverpool is
distant from Halifax 2,490 miles, as compared
with 3,040 miles from New York-a difference

in favour of Halifax of 550 miles, which gives
Halifax an advantage of about one and a half
days' sailing of an ordinary steamer inward,
and the same outward.
With reference to port charges, Sir Alexander Gibb has reported that the port of Hailifax
is not at any disadvantage es compared with
competing North Atlantic ports. I hope
honourable senators who have not seen the
port will visit it at the very first opportunity.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I saw it fifty years ago.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: The section of railway
from Winnipeg to Moncton was built on the
express understanding that it wou'ld be used
particularly for the carriage o! grain froîm the
Western Prairies. When the building of that
line was under consideration in Parliament,
Sir Willfrid Laurier said:
This new railway will be another link in
that chain f union. It will not only open
territory hitherto idle and unprofitable; it will
not only force Canadian trade into Canadian
channels; it will not only promote citizenship
between Old Canada and New CanadaMark these words.
-but it will secure us our commercial independence, and it will for ever make us free from
the bondage of the bonding privilege.
Those words were spoken on July 30, 1903.
Yet at the present time we are shipping
through American ports nearly all our Western
grain that is exported eastward, excepting that
which goes through the port of Montreal.
The fundamental trade policy of Canada is
an east-and-west policy. This was conceived
at the time of Confederation and has been
recognized ever since as the only true Canadian
policy. But during the last eight calendar
years, from 1924 to 1931, inclusive, the
enormous total of 841,801,868 bushels of Canadian grain has passed through American ports,
and during that period the port of Halifax
bas handled only 8,953,614 bushels of Canadian grain, or just about one one-hundredth
of the quantity that went through American
ports. These figures are all the more astounding when we consider that we spent from
$250,000,000 to $300,000,000 on the Canadian
National Railways for the purpose of enabling
them to bring this grain to our maritime ports.
While the traffic from Canada to American
ports is increasing, our road from Winnipeg
to Moncton is almost forgotten. I think it is
the part of Canadian statesmanship to insist
upon the use of our own railway services
for the transportation of our own wheat. If
we do that, the result will be the employment
of more railway men, the purchase of more
Canadian coal, and the transportation of our

412

SENATE

own wheat. While this forgotten piece of
road is rusting, we are spending from 815,000,.
000 to $20,000,000 in United States freight
and port charges. Our road was built with
very low grades and the acceptable curvatures,
but we have failed to use it. I wish to speak
for the people of the Maritime Provinces, as
far as I can, in favour of a change of policy
which would result in a proper patronage
of this Transcontinental Railway. Some time
ago there was a freight rate of 34.5 cents
from Winnipeg to Quebec, with a 1 cent
differential on wheat going to Halifax and
Saint John. The people of Quebec appealed
against those rates, which were reduced to
18.33 cents; but we have not been able to
get a reduction in the rate from Quebec to
Halifax and Saint John, our great ocean ports.
The people of the Maritime Provinces cannot
understand this.
I desire to impress upon the Government
the importance of recognizing as a Canadian
national policy the use of the Transcontinental
Railway for the transportation of wheat from
the great granary of the world to the ports
of Saint John and Halifax. We should be
ashamed of ourselves that we are allowing
American ports to handle our business, which
we are fully equipped to handle.
On motion of Hon. G. V. White, the debate
was adjourned.

DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT OF
FRANCE
EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, since we last met the world has
been shocked by one of those sad events in
high places which try the nerves of nations.
It appears that we must always look for the
face of tragedy to peer through all scenes,
however exalted, and take its toll in the
rnourning of a nation and in the sympathy of
the world. The President of France, shot down
by an assassin, is now enshrined-as, indeed,
he always has been-in the goodwill and the
affection of mankind.
It is very hard to realize the state of mind
which drives any human being to an act so
cold-blooded, so uninitelligent, so futile; but
the windings of the intellect of some of our
species no other man can follow. Each of these
acts seems to be the product of a more or less
disordered constitution. Universally it is the
act of a relatively ignorant and aimless man,
but the result is fearful and sometimes brings
us to despair as to whether or not our
civilization is advancing.
M. Doumer, the late President of France,
was one of the most unoffending, one of the
most kindly, one of the most highly regarded
in all circles, of the men of our time. It is but
a few short months since, because of his high
character, his simplicity of nature and the
universal respect in which he was held by high
and low, he was able to defeat, for the
presidency of the Republic, the most brilliant
orator of this generation.
Four of his sons, in the late War, gave their
lives for France. His sacrifice for his own
country raised him to a pinnacle of popularity,
and we are among those nations who regard
that sacrifice as a sacrifice for the world. We
are bound by ties of kinship and of history
with the ,people of France, inasmuch as so
many of our own people, in years gone by,
came from her shores. In this day of mourning of the French Republic we feel we have
a right to join with the French people, and
we assure them, through the voices of both
Houses, that here in this far western country

of all. Now that he has gone from us, we
unite in extending te his family and to those

I am sure that in paying this short tribute to
his memory I am voicing not only the sentiments of the House, but especially those of
his friends who knew him iongest and best.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members of the Sonate, I join with my right
honourable friend in paying homage to the
memory of our departed colleague. The Hon.
Mr. Girroir, as my right honourable friend
has said, spent some twenty years in our
midst, and I confess that in the busy days
that I gave to the Sonate I had not the
privilege of close intimacy with the honourable
gentleman. I hardly ever had the advantage
of conversing at any length with him. He
was of a very retiring disposition, and perhaps
was affected by shyness.
In the first years that he was with us, and
up to the time of his illness, he participated
ie fairly large measure in our debates.
We in the Province of Quebec often boast
that, down below Quebec City, we have been
able to assimilate a whole Scottish regiment,
whose decendants now call themselves French
Canadians. The Hon. Mr. Girroir, an Acadian,
is the only person of French descent that I
know of who was similarly absorbed by the
Scots of Nova Sceotia. He spoke English as
though it were his native }anguage. We have
no Girroirs in the Province of Quebec, but
we have Girouards. The Hon. Mr. Girroir
with my honourable and revered friend the
senior member of this Chamber (Hon. Mr.
Poirier), the honourable gentleman from
Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), and the honourable gentleman from Richibucto (Hon. Mr.
Bourque), represented the Acadian race in this
House.
I join with my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) in expressing our
sympathy to his family.
Hon. P. POIRIER (Translation): Honourable members of the Sonate, Acadia was represented je this Chamber by four senators. One
of them, and he was not the least, has gone
from among us-has taken that road which
we all must travel, each in our turn. Senator
Girroir represented the Acadians of Nova
Scotia; the other three, whom it is needless

to na.me, represent the Province of New
Brunswick. May I recall an historical fact?
The appointment of the first Acadian to be
raised to the dignity of a senatorship was a
highly considerate act, politica'lly, socially,
and -I might say also from the human standpoint, on the part of Sir John A. Macdonald.
He recognized, with Sir John Costigan, Sir
Leonard Tilley, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir
Hector Langevin, all the Ministers of that
day, that it was desirable, even necessary,
to give representation in the Upper Chamber
te the people who first imiplanted European
civilization and Ghristianity in this country.
Port Roya-1, as you know, was foundcd two
years before Quebec. Our departed colleague,
Senator Girroir, having been the sole representative of the Acadians of Acadia proper
-that is to say, of Nova Scotia-I venture to
hope, indeed I am sure, that the Government, actuated not by racial or religious
prejudice, but by a high sense of justice. wilI
see to it that he is replaced by another
Acadian.
Let me say a word also on the tragic and
lamentable death of the President of France.
There is nothing to be added by way of improvement to what has been said by the right
honourable leader of the Government and
by the honourable leader sitting on the left
of His Honour the Speaker; but it has been
expressed in the language probably in widest
use throughout the world, the language of
Shakespeare and of Milton, which has produced some of the world's greatest masterpiaces. The language of France has not been
heard. My purpose in adding a word is
simply that, outside of the French Republic,

ii may be said in French that we, in common
with the rest of the world, have deplored and
do bitterly deplore what has happened in
France, the assassination of President Doumer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
Hear, hear.

(Translation):

Hon. JACQUES BUREAU (Translation):
Honourable members of the Senate, I heartilv concur in what has been said by the right
honourable leader on the right of the Speaker,
and by the honourable leader on the loft.
It is proper that those of us who are Frenchspeaking, in voicing our sympathy with the
country whence our ancestors came, should
use the language we have inherited from
them. As the honourable gentleman from
Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier) has just said,
we deem it fitting to convey in French to our
brethren overseas our deepest sympathy in
the terrible and disastrous loss that France
has suffered. With her we deplore the cruel

415

attack which has resulted in the death of
one of hier most illustrious citizens, President
Doumer.
I congratulate the honourable senator from
Acadie upon having given heed to, the voice of
affection and kinship in using the French
language to express the sympathy of the
French in Canada with those in the 01d
Country. It scems to us that we shall thus
be better understood and shall more surcly
toucli their hearts.

The Hon. the SPEAKER inf.omed the

Trade in Arms and Ammunition. Geneva, l7th

Honours ýwi,1l imite with this House in the
napproval of the above mentiorned Convention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: HonourabIe
gentlemen, this convention was adopted. by
way of a treaty in 1925, and althongh in 1926,
very shortly after the execution of the convention, the Imperial Conference passed some
rather solemn resolutions, and Canada herself
formafly came to the conclusion that ail conventions should be ratified by bath Houses of
Parliament, nevertheless, strange to say, this
one, evidently by oversight, escaped ratification. Therefore, it is now necessary to, ratify
this convention in order to proceed with the
execution of our statutoýry duties under it,
and, in compliance with the message f-rom the
House of Commons, I bcg to move:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the International Convention for

COWAN DIVORCE BILL
MOTrION FOR THIRI) READING

Hon. Mr. McMEANS, Chs.irman of the
Committee on Divorce, moved the third reading of Bill Vl, an Act for the relief of Gordon
Alexander Cowan.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable members, a few days ago, on the motion for the
second reading ocd this Bill, the honourable
senator from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) stated
that the committee's report was not justified
hy the evidence. That caused me to read the
evidence with some care, and after having
donc so I have come to the saine conclusion
as the honourable member from Regina.
I may say that I belong to a denomination
which does not. believe in divorce; which
believes that more harm is donc by any
system of divorce *than is prevented by it.
The members of that denomination in this
House appear to have come to the conclusion

that

they

are

adequately

conforming

to

their principles, and doing their duty as
citizens and senators, when they refrain from

taking part in any divorce legisiation. I have
followed that rule, but I think occasions may
arise when it shonld be departed from. In
my opinion this is sncb an occasion. According to my view, when the evidence submitted
to the committee is conclnsive and meets with
the approval of the committee, and when
no objection is taken in this House, we who
do not believe in divorce shonld follow the

416

SENATE

course that we have hitherto pursued; but
when the evîdence is of such a character that
it does nlot meet with the unanimous approvai
of the committee, and objections arc taken to
the Bill in this House, rny dufy is to read the
evidence and take part in the proceedings,
lest my abstention migbf contribiite towards
injury f0 an innocent person.
After reading the evidence in this case, I
consider if very conflicting. Furthermore, in
my judgment, the witnesses for the applicant
were flot credible and disinterested. I will not
undertake to analyse the evidence or to
explain if to anybody; I will only say that
I tbink if would bo well for every member
of the flouse to try to read the evidence
in this case and to f orm his own iudgment
upon if.
When reading the evidence I
tbought it strange that the respondent did
not welcome the divorce, did nof wisb to
gef alfogether clear of the applicant, but
upon reflection I saw that this woman was
fighting in defence of her repufation, and I
concluded that she was pursuing a proper
course. If is, I believe, a fundamental principle of law, and of common sense, that a
person should bo considered innocent until
proved to bo guilty. As I say, the evidence
in this case is certainly conflicting, to say the
least, and it appears f0 me a very serious
matter to take away the reputation of any
person, particularly a woman, by iegislation,
when the testimony against that person is,
f0 put it mildly, doubfful.
If the motion for
the third reading of this Bill comes to a vote
I shall cerfainly oppose it. Perhaps, under
ail the circumnsfances, the third rcading should
be deferred a few days in order that those
who wish to do so may have an opporfunity
f0 read the evidence.
At ail events, I have
thought it my duty f0 put my views on
record.
Hon. H1. W. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen, had I been aware that my honourable
friend from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) intended to bring up this question on the third
reading, I should have been better able f0
diseuss if. The House «'ili rememýber that
on the motion for the second reading of the
Bill I suggested thaf the third reading be
defcrred so that some honourable members
mighf have an opporfunity of reading the
evidence
and looking
into
the matter
furfher. I did not underfake f0 analyse the
evidence at that fime, because if bas been the
recognized practice of this House to accept
the recommendations of the Divorce Committee as a maffer of course. I raised the
question with the idea of letfing it be K-nown
that the second reading was not carried by
Hi . Mr. HUGHES.

the unanimous vote of the Huse. In view
of the possibility of a division on this question, I arn moved f0 make a few further
remarks.
As I poinfed ouf at the time of the second
reading, the evidence in thîs case covers a
very large number of pages, and, to my mind,
consisfs largely of suspicion. I arn quite free
to admit, affer reading the evidence, that the
respondent was n very foolish woman and
that some of ber actions were open f0 criticism.
But divorces are nof granfed on such grounds
as that. The main evidence upon whicb this
case was decided was given by fwo professional
defectives, and if was the only evidence bearing upon the crucial point in the case, namely,
whefher the offence alleged fo have been committed was a sufficient ground for an application for divorce. If was pointed ouf that
one of the detectives was an uncle of the
petifioner. Thaf mighf mean anything or
nofhing. But when thaf was backed up in
bis sworn fesfimony by the statement thaf he
advised the petitioner to "give if f0 bim,
and give if f0 bim plenty," and f0 "knock
bell ouf of him," or, in other words,
f0 assault*
the co-respondient, if did flot tend f0 show
thaf he was impartial and thaf bis evidence
was such as should be accepted by this House.
As againsf this evidence, and fbaf of the
pefitioner, wbo apparently was very biffer
againsf the respondent, there was the testirnony of the respondenf and the co-respondent.
Their evidence absolutely confradicfed the
pefifioncr's. I heard the evidence of the corespondent, and I must say f bat, alfhough
we usually receive the evidence of co-respondents wifh some reservafions, I was favourahly
impressed, and believed that the co-respondent
in this case was felling fhe frufb. He was nof
cndowed f0 any special degrce wifb brighfness
or intelligence, but was an ordinary, everyday, upstanding, decent young fehlow.
The evidence for the pefifioner was denied
also by the sister of thbe co-respondent, a very
respectable young wvoman who is a nurse, and
who was in cornpany witb the respondent and
the co-respondent at the fime of one of the
alleged occurrences which gave rise f0 the
petifion. If was sworn on one sidýe fbaf this
sister, the nurse, had leff the car and gone
int o the bouse whîle fthe respondent and corespondent remained in fbe car, but if was
sworn by witnesses on the other side that she
had nof left tbe car-thaf the tbree young
persons remained fogefher.
The rcspondenf's father, who is prominent
in the commercial life of Monfreal, and ber
mother, two very respectable persons, also
festified. If fhe evidence of the detectives

MAY 10, 1932
is to be accepted, it simply means that the
father and mother, who have raised a family
of five daughters, are guilty of absolute perjury; and from what I have heard of this
case I ar n ot prepared to believe that.
The petitioner, who was a very bitter
partisan, was supported by two detectives,
one of whom is his uncle and the other a
muan hired by that uncle. The evidence of
'(hase three was contradicted by the respondent, the respondent's father and mother, the
co-respondent and the co-respondent's sister.
What will be the result if this Bill passes,
The petitioner will be relieved of an apparently undesirable marital relationship with bis
present wvife, who will be cast into the diteh.
Her parents and family are; as I have already
.aid, very respectable people, but she will be
branded for ail time as practically a prostitute
and ber wbole future wilI be very seriously
affected. 1 think we shauld hesitate and thinic
seriously before we adopt a report or pass a
Bill that would so scriously affect a young
woman of promise, twenty-five years of age,
wha cornes frorn a good farniIy and who has
a wide circle of friends. If we are going to
err we should err on the side of the wornan
in this case, on the ground that the charge
has flot been iproven, or at least that it has
flot been proven by evidence of a sixbstantial
and credible nature.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable members,
as Chairman of the Divorce Comrnittee I
sihould like it to be distinctly understood that
I hold no brief for either the petitioner or
the respondent. The comrnittee sat for soine
tirne hearing evidence in this case, which is
a very important one, and it made a report
to this Chamber. That report was adopted
and a Bill was based upon it. When the Bill
carne up for second reading my honourable
friend from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) made P
few remarks, but the motion for second reading was pa.ssed, and we are now dealing with
the motion for third reading.
As with a great many other cases in which
there is evidence on both aides, I think this
is purely a matter for a jury. If honourable
members will read the evidence carefuhly aud
weigh it as a jury, they will be able to corne
to a decision as to whether or not the B3ill
should' be passed. 0f course, if the Bill is
passed here it does flot follow that it ilh
become law, for it will go ta the other House,
where it is likely to ha referred to another
committce. There have been, to my knol4ledge, cases, in which a cornrittee of that
Bouse bas repurted against divorce bills, and
these have been dropped. The other House

is virtually a court i which the decisions of
our comrnittee, and Senate bills in divorce
cases, may ha reviewed, and I am advrised
that very keen interest will be taken in this
Bill there.
It is quite true that the committee was not
unanirnous on this Bill. The report was
tabled; sa I arn nat cornritting any breach
of parliamentary rule in stating that the vote
was four ta two for granting the petition.
I think it was very unfortunate that only six
members af the commit tee sat an the case.
In a contested matter of this kind there
should be a full representation, sa that we
may have the benefit of the experience of
every member.
As I said before, 1 do not hold a brief for
the petitioner or the respondent; and I arn not
going ta urge upon any> honourable inember
ta vote for the Bill or against- it. The cornrnittee took the evidence and reported. I
have nothing more t9) say about the matter.
Hon. R. FORKE: Honourable mernbers, I
was asked ta read the evidence in this case,
and on the motion for second readîng I in-tended to express grave doubts that justice was
being done ta the woman, the reispondent. I
thought it would be rather diffieult for a new
member of this House ta say aftything cantrary
ta the findings of the Divorce Comm~ittee, and
while I was trying ta screw uýp my courage the
bonourable rnember from Regina (Hon. Mr.
Laird) rose and stated opinions sirnilar ta my
own. 1 think, though, I arn even a lîttle
more confident than be is that it would be a
rniscarriage of justice ta pass this Bill.
The petitianer, detectives and other
witnesses were f ollowing the respondent ta
dance halls and other places, trying ta find
out sornething again.st ber, and at the Iast
moment they suoceeded, thr.ough trickery,
in working up a case; but in my opinion it
is an unlikely one. I think the waman -was
neglected by her husband and given the cold
shoulder, and, as she was young and fond of
arnusemnent, she -perhaps did somp, foolish
things. I feel perfectly sure that ta pass
this Bill would 'be ta do an injustice nat only
ta the wornan, but ta the co-respondent.
Right Hon. -G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I presume that I shall be considered
prejudiced in what I say, because I arn against
divorce any.way.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Sa arn I.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have read the
evidence of two divorce cases in my life,
and this is anc af thern. The other was a

was a member there, and after having read
the evidence carefully I went into Committee
of the Whole fully convinced that there was
no justification for passing the Bill.
Perhaps I shall not be considered fair when
I say that we cannot judge the conduct of
young people to-day by the standards that
prevailed years ago. Times have changed,
and what would have been thought suspicious and very wrong years ago is considered to be nothing of the kind in these
days. I am for the young people of to-day,
who, I believe, are just as moral and as pure
as we, or our fathers and mothers, or our
grandfathers and grandmothers, were. It is
true that young people step out a little, as we
say, dance in the evenings, haveHon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Cocktails.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: -have a good
time, and al that kind of thing, but I repeat
that they are just as pure as our ancestors
were. But if our fathers and moihers had
done what the young people of to-day do.
the people of that time would have said they
bad gone to perdition and had no hope whatever -f salvation.
: think that no judgment should be given
in favour of divorce unless there is absolute
proof. I have read the evidence in this case,
and to my mind the honourable gentleman
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) is right when he
says that there is no solid proof here. Two of
the witnesses were-to put it mildly-paid for
their work. I do not know what honourable
gentlemen of the legal profession think, but
I should prefer the evidence of one man who is
not a detective to that of seven detectives. I
do not mean to say that there are not honourable detectives. In this case, although the
woman and the co-respondent were running
around to dances and baving a good time, and
the circumstances were such as might aouse
suspicion, I would not take the evidence of
the alleged actual occurrences, by the men
who gave it, as substantial evidence against
anybody.
When I was a member of the other House,
as I have already said, I read the evidence in
a case and I did what some members thought
was not a very creditable thing t do. Fully
bclieving that there was not substantial evidence against the party charged, I called attention to the fact that there was not a
quorum in the House, and the divorce bill
was not passed. Perhaps my evidence was not
very strong there, but my action was very
effective. Afterwards I received a letter from
the woman in that case, whom I never saw
and probably never shall see, thanking me for
Right Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

preserving her from a situation that I thought
was not very creditable to the men concerned
in it, and that would have ruined her and her
daughter, a young lady. The application for
divorce was not renewed, and the woman
wrote me that she was leading, and always had
lived, an hoonourable life, and that ' her
daughter had been given an opportunity to go
through life respectably, without the finger of
shame pointed at her.
I mention this incident to impress upon
honourable members my view that in every
case of this kind involving a charge against a
woman this House, and every other judicial
body, ought to be very careful before granting a divorce and casting the woman out on
the world bereft of ber good name. That is
ali a woman has. A man who makes a mistake may come back, but once a woman is
marked she is usually marked for life.
After having read the evidence in this case,
even if I did believe in divorce, I would vote
against this Bill.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If I am permitted to make another remark, I should like
to suggest that as this Bill bas aroused some
interest-whieh J am very glad to see--the
matter shîouhd stand, so that any honourable
member who bas not read the evidence mav

UNFAIR

COMPETITION BILL

SECOND READING

Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved lIe
second reading of Bill 5, an Act respecting
Unfair Competition in Trade and Commerce.
He said: Honourable members, I have
spoken to the Clerk of the House and ha,
like myself, bas no recollection of our having
had before us in this House the resolution
approving the convention upon which the
Bill is largely founded. That matter is being
inquired into, but I see no reason why the
Bill itself might not be given second reading
now, on the understanding that it will not be
finally passed here until the question of the
necessary precedent resolution is settled.

MAY 10, 1932
The purpose of this Bill is to give effect
to a convention to which. Canada is a party,
the purpose of which convention is to protect
industrial property, especially trade marks and
trade designs. Our Trade Mark Act was passed
in 1869 and stands to-day virtually the sanie
as when it was originally enacted, the subsequent amendments having been comparatively
negligible. The constitutionality of the Act
bas been called in question. The question
bas not been pressed in the courts, but at
various times it- has been raised,. and
authorities have very great doubts as to
xvhether there is nlot sucli an. invasion of
civil riglits as is beyond the power of this
Parliarnent. That feature of constitutionality
will, we believe, be cleared up if this Bill
passes, for it does not include elements which
might possibly becloud its constitutional
status.
In 1883, 1 think it was, there was constituted
a Union ,for the Protection of Industrial
Property, and to that Union a number of
countries adhered.
Canada acceded, long
after, to the convention of 188, and thereby
became a memiber of the uni-on, but except
for becoming a member did flot take part at
that time, nor for a long period. The convention of 1883 *was amended and extended at a
subsequent conference in 1900, and again in
1911. Canada was represented in 1925 in a
conference at The Hague, at which. the principal amendments to the convention were
adopted. Subsequently, by Order in Council
of the 19th of April, 1928, Canada authorized
the ratification on its 'behaif of the Hague
convention of 1925, and it came into force
on the lst of May, 1928. Canada is now a
member of the Union for the Protection of
Industrial Property. It is also a party to
the Bague convention which in 1925 very
materially amended the terms of the convention constituting the Union.
The purpose of Bill 5 is to give effect to
the amendments adopted at The Bague,' and
to bring our whole Trade Mark Act into
conformity with modern practice and with
the principles that are now considered effective and practical in relation to trade marks
and trade designs.
Honourable senators will, of course, be quite
familiar with the fact that a treaty between
this country and any other country or
countries can be carried out and given effect
to by legisiation of the Parliament of Canada,
whatever may be the subjeet-matter of the
treaty. The very interposition of the treaty
gives jurisdiction to the Federal Bouse and
removes any possible objection that might
be raised by the provinces. On that basis
41787-27àj

especially, the constitutional features of the
present Bi-I are, we believe, unassailable. But,
besides that, ail interference with property
riglits in reference to trade marks, except so
far as it is nece.ssary for extemnal and general
trade and commerce, is eliminated from the
measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Bonourable
members, this Bill deals with a subjeet with
which I -have not been very familiar during
my practice at the Bar. Bowever, I have
examined the Bill and have found in it no
cause for any objection. It seems to be quite
compact and complete. I think the document
lias been thoroughly prepared by the officiais
of the department concerned, and very likely
the work bas been supervised by the Department of Justice.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I may add,
honourable senators, that this Bill, it seems to
me, bas been prepaTed with commendable
care, which is not always exercised in measures
proceeding from either Bouse. A select committee of the Commons had to do with its
revision. This committee, which was presided
over by the Secretary of State, paid attention
to its work, and finaliy it gave unanimous approval to the measure as amended there.
There were present the legal representatives
of many large concerns in the country. I
think there were altogether 'baîf a dozen legal
men, representing concemus having very much
te do with patents and trade designs. Tbey
have approved of the measure, and look for
very excellent resuits from it. Further, a leading authority on this subWet in the United
States, Mr. S. P. Ladas, author of a very
authoritative work on trade marks, one of the
eminent counsel advising on this special subjeet, made certain suggestions to, the commnittee, which were favourably considered. Be
has written that he believes it is excellent
legishation in so far as it transfers into Canadian law ail provisions of the International
Convention for the Protection of Industriai
Property, as revised at The Bague in 1925,
and that lie intends sending to ail concerned in
trade mark legislation and trade mark law ini
bis own country copies of thàs measure as one
admirably designed to meet modern needs in
this sphere of law and commerce.

As the hanourable senatar irom Rockcliffe

by this cammittee last year, part of which,
at Ieast, was carried out. Hanourable miembers will recaîl that there was a great deal ai

other disfig-urements.
In an inspection ai the trees it was discovered that many trees, especially the older
ones, were diseased and proceedinig rapidly
towards destruction. A firmn ai tree experts
was engaged ta go over them and perforrm
variaus acts ai tree surgery. This bas resulted
in an impraved appearance ai the trees and
will, I amn sure, add many ycars ta their lufe.
Some changes were made also in the shrubbery about the grounds. Some ai you, no

stronges9t characters who took an active part
in Confederation without including the name
of Sir Charles Tupper. Even. down to recent
times lie lias been a. prominent figure in the
life of Canada. I think it was the unanirneus
opinion cf tlie committee-whicb pcrhaps could
not bring this matter befere the House as a
committee-that its members individually
sbould caîl the attention of the House, and
of the Governmcnt, through our leader here,
te the propricty of crecting a statue of Sir
Charles Tupper on Parliament Hill in the
near future. I invite lionourable senaters,
if they have not alrcady dene se, te tak a
walk around tlie llI and become acquainted
with those wbose memories bave been perpetuated in bronze. I have no objection te
the commemnoration cf any person whose
statue is te be seen, but 1 have ne hesitation
in saying that Sir Cliarles Tupper playcd a
more prominent part in the history cf Canada
than did many cf those wliosc statues are now
erected on this 1Hill. Therefore, as a member
cf the committcc, a member of this buse
from the Maritime Provinces, and one wbe
knew Sir Charles Tuppcr-only slightly, it is
truc-I should very mucli like te sec, as I arn
sure the people of the Maritime Provinces
weuld like te see, measures taken fer the
erection on this ll of a statue in commemoratien cf the man bimsclf and of bis achievements. I feel confident that the whoie
Dominion cf Canada would commcnd sucli
action.
Hen. JOHN LEWIS: Wlicn tbis matter
came up last session and Sir Chiarles Tupper
was mentioncd, I put in a dlaim for Joseph
Howe, of Nova Scotia. It is truc that he was
neither one of the Fatbers of Confederatien
nor a Prime Minister, but lie was ccrtainly
a favourite son cf Nova Scotia, and perbaps
the most picturesque figure in tbe bistery cf
that province, any bistery of whicb would be
incemplcte witbout bim. When tlic putting up
of ?,dditional statues is considcrcd, I boe
the committec will net forget Joseph Howe.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Without wisbing te
exceed my privileges, may I say that the cost
cf the last statue erccted was, I think, about
$18,000. That kind cf work could he donc
te-day mhucli more cbeaply than at any time
in the recent past. I have ne doubt that
310,000 would pay for quite as good a statue as
would have cost $18,000 a few years ago.
In these times cf stress tbe cemmittee docs
net ask that the moncy sbould be spent at
once, but it wouid like te sec something donc

As for Josephi Howe, I may say that in my
opinion the threie greatest men in public life

Tupper. I have read ail Joseph Howe's works.
I have. known and read of Sir Chiarles Tupper,
and Sir John Macdonald's namne was a bousehold word. Ail three were great men. I
sbould like, however, to impress upon honeurable members the importance of getting one
monument at a time. If we ask for too mnuch
we may get nothing. First let us get a
monument to Sir Charles Tupper, and then
let us get one to Joseph Howe.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: This matter
has now corne to my attention for the first
time, and I amrn ot prepared at this moment
to wcigh the importance of those whose names
have been mentioned, and to decide as to
prierity of dlaims. I amn reminded of what
wvas said by Napolcon after the battle of
Essling. The battie had been an indecisive
one, neither side gaining mucb ground, although
the French remained in possession of the field.
Bernadotte, who later became King of Sweden,
and who at that time was lcading the Saxons,
issued an order of the day congratulating
them upen their valeur. As soon as Napoleon
lcarncd of Bernadotte's statement he said:
"Là où je suis, il n'appartient à personne de
distribuer la gloirc"ý-to translate, "Where I
amn, ne one has a rigbt te distribute glory."
I arn net. at the moment in a position to
distribute glory. It is not within my province.
The question of raising monuments should
be very carefully studicd, in order that ne
undue preference may be shown. Some of
the statues surrounding these buildings are in
mcmory cf Fathers of Confederation; others,
rcpresenting Lafontaine and Baldwin, relate
te an earlier period. Some of the Fathers cf
Confederation were dcserving of recognition
quite apart from their action in bringing about
the union cf the provinces. I arn of the
opinion that whcn the question of erecting a
monument arises the Government should appoint an advisory committee, composed of
members represcnting ail the various shades
of opinion. After the departure of a contemperary we Qhould net be too hasty in
raising a monument te his rpicmory, but should
allow time te exert its influence on the perspectýive. The decision cf such a committee
wvould be welcomed by the country gencrally.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourablè
gentlemen, I have not read the contents of
this report and arn net in a position te comment intelligcntly upon it. I take it that
its formai adoption dees net necessitate any
action.
I should like te say a few werds on the
subject treated by the honourable senator
from Wcstmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) and
others who have followed him. It is better

izz

SENATE

in almost every case, no matter what Government may be in office, that some decades
should intervene before Parliament decides
whetbier a monument should be erected on
the grounds of Parliament Hill. There is a
better .perïpective in later years, when
animosities have subsided orpassed away. The
achievement of the great men wbo have gone
cao then be more truly measured, and their
place in history more certainly fixed. Occasionally, but only occasionally, there is reason
for exception. Such an exception was the case
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, whose monument rose
soon after hie departed. Such was his place
in our records, such bis contribution to our
history, that the endorsement was unanimous,
the sentiment universal, and there was no
possibility that time would ever impair that
sentiment.
I have not the slightest hesitation in endorsing fully the recommendation made by the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black). I shall enter into no comparison of the cdaims of Sir Charles Tupper and
Hon. Joseph Howe in se far as their characters, their intellectual attainments or their
qualifications for public life

doubtless
take their place in the forefront of the contributions made to literature, not only in
Canada, but throughout the English-speaking
world. But I think that wben we look upon
those two great men as Canadian patriots
rathpr than as men of intellectual stature, we
ail must agree at this time that he who deserves the more at our bands for being the
greater factor as a maker of Confederation,
nnd for helping Confederation more after it
wvas made, is Sir Charles Tupper. There may
be those who feel that Joseph Howe was the
greater Nova Scotian, but I cannot conceive
of any claiming that he was the greater Canadian . The strong, potent, overmastering personalitv of Sir Charles Tupper played an immense part not only in giving birth to this
country as Canada, but afterwards in the
determination of high questions of policy
uipon which the future history of our courntry
depended. I believe we have come to the
lime when the name of Tupper should hc
recognized as that of one who was among
the very first-I think I would say, with the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black), among the first three-of the outstanding personalities of his time. The other
two are already commemorated on Parliament
1Hill, and I should indeed be glad if a monument to Sir Charles Tîipper were the npxt
one erected.

ROYAL CA-NA DIAN MOUNTED
BILL
SECOND

POLICE

READING

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN moved the
second reading of Bill 63, an Act to amend
the Royýal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of tbis Bill is mainly to provide for the
appoýntment of a De:puty Commissioner of
Mounted Police.
In, recent years, as the
House knows, the duties of tbis force have
been tremendously extcnded . Agreements have
been mnade with the three Prairie Provinces
and tlîe tbree Maritime Provinces for placing
their police supervision in the hands of the
Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. Those
agreements provide for payment by the proviînces on stipulated. terms. The agreement
with Sas~katchewan bas operated for sorne
three years, and with sucb suecess that other
provinces have decided to follow suit. The
activities of the organization bave thus become
.so extensive that a Deputy Commissioner is
dcemed neccssary. In addition, there are some
amendmentý, intended to make the co-operation
with the provinces more effective. Su-ch arc,
in a nutshell, the objects of the measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose that if
this Bill is given second reading it will go to
Committee .of the Whole. The rigbt bonourable leader ýcan .perhaps informn the House
whetber tbe Royal Canadian Mounted Police
come unider the Civil Service Commission, or
are organized separately. I find that section 2
<if Ibis Bill provides for the ap:pointment of
men, somte teniporarily and others perbaps
permanentiy, and there is nothing to show that
tbey will come under the Civil Service Commission. I am not au fait with the organization of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
and that is the reason I am asking the question.
lion. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I do not wisb to precipitate a debate on Ibis
matter, and il is not my intention to say
anything in opposition te Ibis Bill in particular,
whicb. as the right honourable leader says, is
concerned with comparatively small matters.

MAY 10, 1932
He has, however, said samething about which
I desire ta place myseif an record. If I heard
hlm correctly, he said that the duties of the
Maunted Police have been tremendously
extended within the past few years. The
present force is the sixccessor of the North
West Mounted Police, wha were formed for
the purpase af palicing the plains. Shartly
befare the War it was generally said that the
real necessity for this body had almost been
eiiminated, an account of the great inerease of
population in the Narthwest Territaries, and
that the organizatian would either automatically become extinet or be reduced ta a
comparatively small force stationed for duty
in outlying parts of the country. Then the
War came, and not long after it ended the
personnel of the Maunted Police was increased
by the absarptian of what I think was called
the Dominion Police. Since that time the
farce has grawn steadi-ly, untîl naow it amaunts
ta what is nothing more nor leas than a smal
.tanding army.
I view with a good deal of concern the
formation of what 1 should caîl a military
police for Canada. Far be it from me ta say
anything against such a noble body of men
as the Mounted Police, ta whom I believe is
due a very large share of credit for the
orderly growth and establishment of our
Northwest Territories. But, as I say, we naw
see that it is beinýg expanded ta a nationwide body. Its growth is indicated by what
the right honaurable leader bas said, that
there is now necessity for a Deputy Commissioner. A Cammissioner bas recently
been appointed at a salary, I believe, of
$12,000, almost as much as is paid ta the
Commander-in-Chief of the whole British
Army. I think that the services of this gentleman cauld not have been procured for less.
Certainly no man who is better qualified far
the position lives in Canada; sa I am not
finding fault with the appointment; but 1 do
feel that the growth of the Maunted Police in
Canada is something ta be viewed with concern. The farce now numbers some 2,000
mon, the last increase having 'been made by
the addition of preventive officers, a body
of men entirely separate from what I shauld
caîl -police duties, wha are now being given the
general status of the police.
I have referred ta this matter on beh-aîf
of thase wha da nat believe in a military
police system. If there is one thing that bas
made me rejoice in being a Canadian when
I bave travelled through Europe it is our
co mparative freedom from police. There are
sa many police on the European continent that
I always felt-I do not know whether this
was due ta a guilty conscience-glad to get

423

back to Canada, where we have practieally
no police aside from those on aur municipal
forces. I ar n ot speaking from any political
considerations at ail, because the Mounted
Police have been growing under a number of
governments-in fact ever since the War.
1 just wish ta draw the attention of the
Senate to the fact that we are coming
rapidly to the position of being, more or less,
supporters of a military police body. 1 hope
the matter will be given the consideration of
our legisiators, and that before long we may
have happier times, when such a large force
will not be necessary.
I would not oppose this Bill, because the
powers that be must have a great deal more
information than we have, and it may be that
in this matter tbey are acting on good
grounds.
]Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, may I say a few words an this
matter? The history of the Mounted Police
in recent years has been somewhat interesting.
When I was requested by the then Prime
Minister ta arganize the Department of National Defence, the variajis branches that I
was asked ta take in included the Mounted
Police, the Air Force, the Naval Force and
the Militia. It was flot easy ta mix these
variaus ingredients. The Naval and the
Military forces were, of coulrse, on speaking
terms, but not an very goad cansorting terms,
and there was cansiderable disagreement as ta

which of these branches should be the head,
the dlaims of the Navy for seniarity being,
I think, supported by histary.
Shortly a.ft-er the Moun-ted Police were taken
inta the Dicpartment of National Defence they
became dissati.sfied with mïlitary contrai and
asked ta bc returnedi ta the Department of
Justice. They claimed that their duty was
connected with the administration of justice
and not witha military operations, and that
theref are they shouild not be subjeot ta
military finesse. Theîr request was granted,
and a large number of the members were dis
banded. The pravinces at that time insisted
that they cauld manage their awn palice
affairs and they did flot wa.nt the Mounted
Police; in fact, same af them natified me
that they woui1d not have any Maunted Police
within their territary. But that frame of mind
rapidly disappeared, and rio sooner had the
mounted force been decreased in and practically withdrawn from some provinces than
an agitation arase for its return. As a consequence, arrangements were made with a
number of the provinces not only for the return of the Mou-nted Police, but also for their
increased effectivenes. I think this ex1plains

424

SENATE

the expansion of the force, to which reference
has heen made.
If I remember correctly, there are one or
two provinces that do flot make any arrangements with the Mounted Police, but neyertheless members of the force are sent to those
provinces and do a great deal of woýrk there.
Eviden-ce in cases in soine of the 'big cities,
particularly Montreal and Toronto, shows that
a great many criminads are run to earth by
the Mounted Police there. I smiled wvben my
good friend General MacBrien was made Commission-er of the Mounted Police, for hie was
Chief of the General Staff when the Mounted
Police desired a transfer from the mi'litary
brancha of the National De.fence Departmenit.
He will undoubtedly make a very efficient
Commissioner. If anyýtbing is neced to increase the effectiveness of the Mounted Police
force, it will be found in Generaà MaeBrien.
I should not like to say anything in cniticism of the Mounted Police, because I know
from experi 'ence that they were asked to leave
soma of thc provinces and lûter were rEquested
to return to them. Ako, as I have said. the
force does gond, work in a number of provinces
with which it ba, no agreemnent. It does particularly effective duty ado.ng special lines, such,
for instance, as the suppression of the opium
traffic. In this respect, British Columbia might
be in a very bad condition but for the efficient
activities of the Mounted Police. Very effective service of the saine kind is performed in
Mon-treal. And I think I can say with truth
that our Customs Department might be much
less efficient if it bad not the assistance of
tbis saine police force.
We have laarned ta rcspect the Mounted
Po-liýce. Wherever they go thay have an influen.cc, that no other body of police, however

perhaps, in its own sphere, not even exeluding

that our Motinted Police are not more efficient than the New York City police force,
for instance, the whole of wvhichi was turned
on one single case and could not bring it te
a suecessful issue.
Hon. JOHN LEWIS:
I agree with the
remarks of the hionourable member from
Leeds (Hon. Mn. Hardy). I view witli a
great deal of uncasineseý the increasc in the
powers of the Mounted Police. W c have rcad
.n the past few days ncwspaper accounts of
Riglit Hon, MIr. GRIAHAM.

wholesale deportations by the Mounted Police
of persons charged with being Communists,
or with being sympathetie towards Communists. Whether the charges were wvell founded
or not I do not knowv. My view is that if a
person is charged with tbat or any othen
offence against the law of the land, hae ought
te be tried in tbe usual legal way. We had a
trial in Toronto of several persons cbarged
with Communistie activities, and I do net
tbink anvone has alleged that the sentences
they received were toe lenient. However, so
long as mon are tried in the regular way, in
accordance wvith the riiles of British justice,
I shahl bo satisfied. But I do not agee with
the policy of giving enormous powers to the
police, leading up to what. after ail, ks only
the semblance of a fair trial bof ore, I think,
a miember of the Civil Service. I strongly
cbjeet ta sucha a procedure.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
Just by way of information, I would ask if I arn correct in saying that the Provincial Police will be withdrawvn and the Dominion Police will take their
place. I do flot suppose the Royal Mounted
Police Force cornes under tbe Department of
Immigration. That department in the past
had voîw extreme power.ý. N'ýot long ago I
\vas hiable te be deported if I did net bohave
iiysolf. The powens of the department have
been cunîailed, but il still bas some powvers
that, are extraordinary.
There wvas an arrangement witb the provinceS, and I think tbe right honourable leader
can give us some information about if. The
provinces will pay a certain amounit because
the Royal Mounted Police arc doing the
work of the Provincial Police.
Right Hon. Mn. MEIGHE'N:
Yes. The
honourable senator from Toronto las levelled
against the police adverise cemments.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS:
No; I say they have
tee much power.
Rlht Hon. Mr. 'MEIGIIEN: If the hioncurable gentleman has any ground at all for
thec coniplaint, it should ho levelled against
the law. Thie whole function of the police is
te enforce the lawv, and we are the makens
o,: the law; and thec law against which the
seoaton is protesting-at least, wvhich hae is
using as a weapon wvith whieh te strike the
police-is a hîw that nrmains because of
the verdict of tbks Housc particularl 'v. I was
exccedingl 'v pleased te hear tbe remarks of
the right hionounable senator frorn Eganville
(Righit Honi. Mr. Graham). I remember the
phas~e te which he refers. It wvas the great
anti-militair'
reaction
which 1)ass(l
oven
this country~ subsequent te the War. The

MAY 10, 1932
strongest protests were levelled against interference by the police. At that time they were
military police, and people came ta regard
them. as something in the f orm. of a seli-constituted autocracy: they just tdId men ta go,
and they went.
But responsibility bas a great effect, and I
venture ta suggest that if the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis) became responsible for the preservation of law
and order in Canada hie would modify bis
views, just the samne as many of the provincial
authorities modified theirs back &bout ten
years ago.
I desire only to emphasize that the police
are not the makers of our law. They have no
function save its execution or fulfilment. That
police organization is the be.9t which most
cffectivcly ses that the Iaw is carried through.
The reason why the M.ounted Police have
such a fine reputation in Canada is that they
have proven themselves an admirable organization to that end. They are a terror to,
evil-doers in this Dominion. They are the
Scotland Yard of our country, and they are in
no smail degree the reason-the living reason
-why this is Canada, as compared with the
nation ta the south.
The Mounted Police have a tradition; the
Provincial Police have none. That tradition
is a tremendous force, and bas a tremendous
influence on the morale of the staff. It is a
tradition which it is the ambition of each
and ail members of the force to live up to.
When a man fails he goes, because of this
tradition, and as well because of the fact
that local influence bas flot the saine effcct
on the Dominion organisation as it. bas on
the locally constituted organisation, or the
locally appointed officiaI.
Prom those two main causes the Mounted
Police have revived, strengthened, and more
and more held public regard over other forces
of law and order in Canada. The provinces
are recognizing this, and seek to take advantage of this force. Saskatchewan came first,
about three years ago. Other provinces are
now following. Duplication is avoided. The
greater strength, virility and efficicncy of the
Mountcd Police are substitutcd for the more
easily influenced, less proud and less effective
police of cities and provinces. Also. I think,
cconomy is being effected. I cannot give the
figures in detail, but honourable senators will
sec some of them, and I may assure the
honourable senator from Brandon (lion. Mr.
Forke) that if he will look at the addrcss
of the Minister of Justice, at page 2632 of
Hansard, and following pages, hie will find
the figures.

there. is provision for 150 men at $1,000 per
man. We receive from the province-I have
reference now ta Saskatchewan- 150,000. In
addition there are the actual expenses in connection with the transportation of prisoners.
In some cases definite sums have been arrived
at in this regard; in others the amounts represent the actual outlay. Last year we received
from Saskatchewan under this head S25,000.
The definite sum of $W,000 bas been fixed for
Alberta; the saine for Manitoba. A schedule
is agreed on between the provinces and the
Dominion, and as the provinces are entering
into an arrangement at this time, t'hey have
not left the phase of economy (,ut of the
question. Economy bas grown more important than ever it was. I am sure the provinces would flot desire ta came into this
arganization, which is needing the legisiation,
if economy were not a factor. But besides
economy, of course, what tbey have in mmnd
is the better enforcement of the làw of the

If we have any objection ta the present

DIVORCE BILL

MOTION FOR THIRD READING

NEGATIVED

The Senate resumied from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. McMeans
for the third reading of Bill VI, an Act for the
relief of Cordon Alexander Cowan.
Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, as a mile I do flot interest myseif
very much in divorce proceedings. Coming
from the city of Montreal, I happen to know
the father of the lady who is the defendant
in this case, and I can say that he and bis
family are among the very highest and most
respectable people of that city. I have read
very closely the evidence that was given
before the Divorce Committee, and without
casting the slightest reflection whatever upon
the members of the committee I submait, as
a layman, that the case was not proven. We
have on the one hand the evidence of two
professional operators, one of whom was the
uncle of the plaintiff. Against that we have
the evidence of the members of the familymost reputable witnesses-which refutes in
toto every bit of evidence in favour of the
applicant. 1 sincerely trust, honourable gentlemen, for the sake of the reputation of the
lady in question, and for the sake of her
family, which, as I have already stated, is
very well known and holds a high position in
Montreal, that this petition for relief will not
be granted.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

MONTREAL POSTAL TERMINAL
INQUIRY

Hou.. SMEATON WHITE inquire-d of the
Governinent:
I.'Ras
the Government acquired a property
in Montreal for the purpose of building a
postal terminal?
2. Have plans for this building been prepared by the Public Works Department?
3.' How long have these plans been ready?
4. fias the Government any knowledge of a
rumour prevalent in Montreal that certain
interests wish to have this terminal erected on
another site?

5« Dýoes the Post Office Departinent report
that proper mail service cannot be given to
Montreal until this terminal is completed?
6. Is it the intention of the Governinent to
proceed with this work; if so, Tphen; if flot,

Why.

Righ't Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer

to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is as
follows:
1. Yes.
2 and 3. Plans and specifications almost
cornpleted.
4. No.
5. The Post Office Departinent reports that
the construction of a 'postal terminal building

would facilitate the mail service.
6. Under consideration.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: I should like
to remind the right honouraible leader of the
answer given by the Post Office Department,
I un.derstand, on April 12, tha-t the present
conditions in Mon-treal will not ibe remedied
untiil the new postal terminal is completed.
I would ask the right 'henourable leader te cal
the attention of the Government again to the
fact that our postal service in Mentreal is
very bad, and tihat the Poot Office Departinent
says that there can be no improvement in the
service unless we get this terminal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman has stated that plans for
the new terminal are almost comipleîted. I
rthink I arn expressing the sentiment of the
whole city of Montreal wlhen I say th±at we
hope the aspect of the building will be such
as to add to the dignity of the city. The
terminal will stand 'be'tween the stations of the
Canadian Pacifit Railway and the Caniadian
National Railways, and I Vhink that eny extra
eost resuliting froin a&ktntion to exterior design

wouid ibe moniey well spent. Montreal is now
a large oity, with a population beyond one
million, and we must give consideration to the
architecture of our buildings.

be in a position to start the work, but if it
decides to do some construction under the

be just as disastrous financially.
This matter bas been before the Senate on
two occasions. When a similax Bill was hefore us previously our colleague the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), as Minister of Labour, had charge
of it. Now, I say withaut, any hesitation. that

Re
travelled ail over the country, and it seemed
that hie had to, look into the minutest details.
One of the things I would suggest to the right
honourable leader of the Government is that
this work, and the adjudication of the va.rions
phases of it, should be divided a littIe more
among the Ministers, through a cornmittee
or something of that kind, so as flot to impose upon any one man such a burden as was
imposed on our honourmble friend frorn Welland, for no physical frame will bear up for
many months under such a strain.
As to the distribution, there lias been some
change, I believe, in the relationship between
the provinces and the federal authorities,
and between the provinces and the municipalities. Care should be taken that things
done by this Parliament because of the
stress of circurnstances should not be regarded
as -precedents. Constitutionally, I helieveand I refer you to the honourable gentleman
froma Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) if I amn
wrongSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Constitutionally, 1 believe, these things are the care of
the provinces and the municipalities in the
first place. The fact that the Dominion
Government lias corne to the rescue under
present conditions must not be taken as a
precedent for future action. We ail hope
that no such extreme conditions will arise in
Canada again. No person will object to the
federal authorities stepping in to help the
provinces and the municipalities, and, poèsibly,
individuals, but it ought to be understood
that they are doing so because we are ahl
-Canadians, and flot because they have any
constitutional obligation to bear the burdens
,of the provinces. Our provinces are not in
any better condition than the Dominion;
mevertheless, the burden is theirs, not oursunless we assumne it-and in voting for measures
,of this kind 1 shahl always maintain the right
to tell the provinces and the municipalities
that they must lie responsible for their own
affairs, and that when we help we do so as a
matter of grace and not as a matter of law.

I7 arn not enamoured with the departure
from the constitutional practice of stating a
requirement in an estimate and -asking for
an amount to meet that requirement. It was
during the War that we got into the habit
of departing from the constitutional practice,
and I arn not sure that we did not overstep
our prerogative in going as far as we did.
We passed the War Measures Act. I fear
it is by reason nf that legisiation that we are
paying large sums of money to-day. This
Bill is based on that legislation, and is, I
believe, another War Measures Act. Notwitbstanding these objections, however, I
assume that it is our duty under the circumstances to err on the side of liberality towards
those who need help, and from that standpoint, though I would rather have seen this
meaisure brought in in the usual way, I arn
willing to support it.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot rise to oppose the
Bill. On the contrary, I shall support it,
hecause 1 think that under the circumstances
mem-bers of this Upper Chamber shouhd give
a helping hand to their felhow-citizens ail over
-Canada. 1 cannot hehp saying, however, that
the principles advocated by my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and by the
right honourable gentleman f-rom Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Gra'hamn) are very sane
principles. I do not know why the Government
shouhd not have been able to determine a certain fixed amount to go towards aiding the
provinces and the municipalities.
I do not like to heur the right honourable
leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) speaking of an emergency. Let us
drop that termi; let us be a hittie more optimistic. There must be a turm of the whee]
somne day, and we must not accustorn people
to thinking that tbey are in ernergent circurnstances, or that tbey are going to be the
victims of adversîty always. I think that
better days are coming, and I have faith in the
sterling character of the Canadian people. I
read only yesterday in the press that the first
country to show some vitality at the proper
moment will be Canada.
One regrettable feature is that this measure,
and tha;t of hast year, offered somne encouragemient to the -municipahities to spend moneyfor they are given facilities for spending
money-and to overburden the capacity of
the municipal taxpayers by the erection of
public works which sornetirnes are flot needed.
I could cite to the right honourable genthenian many such instances in my province,
especially' in the district which I had the
bonour to represent for almost thirty-five
years in the other House. Expenditures

SENATE
were entered upon by municipalities where
such expenditures were not .required. There
was enough work on the roads and in the
lumber camps, and, generaliy speaking, al
over the distriýct, to justify the expenditures;
yet I saw people coming to Ottawa to pray
for the building of wharves and so onwarks which could well have remained in
abe ' ance for some years to corne. Many
expenditures made duiring the past two years
were the resuit of the facilities offered by the
Federal Government for the spending of
nioney, and couié[ have been avoided.
We must not forget, honourable gentlemen,
that wvehave an appalling debt to meet. Only
thîs morning I receivcd fromn my honourable
friend the senator fromn Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
MeRae) a set of charts showing vividly the
financial condition of our country. Truc, we
are passing tbrough a period of adversity;
but surely, if we are to corne out of the
valiey of adversity, we must think of
to-morrow. Tax bis are much too higb, and
although the C'anadian pýeople are accepting
them wifhout much murrnuring, the time will
corne wvhen they wvill be unabie to face them.
Federal ftax bis, provincial tax bis and
municipal tax hbis bave ail doubled or
trebied. The lime has corne tio call a hait,
.and the Dominion Government miust set tbe
example.
I doubt not that the Prime Minister, who
is a keen man of business, undersfands the
situation perfectly, but I do not like to hear
what is being said currently on the street
about the financial condition of Canada. Wc
have this year a fair budget-I say a fair
budget because tbe Government bas pared
down expendifures; but I believe that it
could be pared down more and more "until,"

1 hope, therefore, wben this blank cheque is
given to the Gov cînmejnt, no ficoisb expenditure wiil be authorized. I can be perfectly
frank with the rigbt, honourable gentleman
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighen), for both hie and
I bave been long enough in the fray to speak
di.spassionately of these matters. There are
miany elections looming up on the horizon.

tbat the time bas corne when we must cal
a hait, when we must not be afraid to be
cven stingy in matters of expendiiture.
I was speaking of coming clections. I see
that there are elections approaching in British
Columbia, also in Manitoba and possibly in
the great province of Ontario. I rely on the
spirit of f air play and Canadianisrn of the
night honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), and of the Prime Minister, to prevent any of this money fromn bcing used to
prornofe the cause of one party or another.
That is ail I have to say. I cannot belp
tbinking that the situation, though not desperate, is very serious, and sbould make us
tbink profoundly before we go deeper info
debt.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable gentlemen,
coming from Saskatchewan, where, I suppose,
the need is greater than in any other province,
I want to say just a word or two in regard
to this motion. It is unfortunate that we
should flnd ourselves in such a position that
%,,e must bave a Bill of this kind a second
time. 1 bad every opportunity hast w~inter
of observing the manner in which this relief
work was carried out, and I can safely say
that there was not the sligbtest indication of
partisanship in any shape or form. The requirernents, of each indivîdual were carefully
scrutinized and gone into. and I assure the
honourable gcntleman (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
tbat there was no waste of money.
In the Province of Saskatchewan we have
a commission in ch-arge of relief work, the
members of wbich are carrying on witbout
any compensation at ail. One of the leading
lawyers of the province, Mr. Gordon, who is
looking after the legal side of the work, is
devoting probably seventy-five per cent of bis
finie to it; and Mr. Black, the chairman of
the Board, is not receiving any reward. Neyertheless, these gentlemen worked night and
day all winter, and tbcy are still carrying- on,
as I say, wifbout the sligbtest regard fo parfisansbip in any shape or form.
As to the outiook for the future, I may
say that only tbis morning I received a letter
stating that the crop prospects in Saskatchewan were neyer so brigbt as they arc at
tbe presenit time. I presume -that the samne

MAY-13, 1932
fairly well assured of a orop, in whioh even.t
that part of Canada, at least, will -not require
fuTther relief.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGBIEN: I arn very
pleased to acknowledge the sane and, I think,
very creditable rernarks of the right honourable senator from Eganville (Rdght Hon. Mr.
Graham). My comment on the speech of the
honoura>le senùtor from. Rougemonat (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) woul not be adverse. There
is only one fetture to which I wish to, refer.
There is notbhing urnusue1 in -the Bill except
that *amounits are not fixed for specific purposes. An aggregate total might have been
fixed, I presume, but for the obstacele to which
1 referred 'before, and tihe désire of the provinces in this -regard, but an ainount for specific
purpposesl in, each indlvidual case could cerbainiy notbe fixed.
As to the arnourits being disproportionate
as between the provinces, I rnay say that the
policy lollowed is exactly the same as that
followed .by the Governinenft of which I was
head in 1921, and by -the suoeed-ing Governmenet in 1922 an.d 1923. There was no attempt
to pro-rate aocc>rding, to, population, though in
those cases bhe-re was an aggregate maximum.
TPhe honourable mernber from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) is right in saying that
there h-as been somte abuse cf the public works
feature of the relieif prograin, though not, I
think, to sucýh an extent, as some people maintain. Such works are expensive, especially to
the municipalities, the consequence being tha)t
there is a steady drif t towaoeds the relief
feature alone-the provision of the nocessities of life rather than the attempt to provide
work. I regret that this is so-we ail regret
it-because for ail 'people work is better than
relief, especially relief extending over a long
period of time. But we must have regard to
national finances.
I have no fear whatever of money being
squan-dered for provincial election purposes. I
do not know of any provincial elections in the
offing in British Cohumbia, Ontario .or any
other province except Manitoba; and ail the
representations thiat corne tVome from Maitoba are to the effeot that anty relief works
endorsed by the Provincial Goverrnnent and
helped hy the Governrnent of Canada would
be entirely to, the advantage of the political
party in power in thast. province. I can assure
the honourable gentleman that I arn not
subjected to any pressure for undue relief
expenditures from those who are in opposition
in that province. They want the necessities
taken care of, and no more, and they feel
that there are influences at work in the other
direction, on the part -of their opponents.

431

However, I do not intend todo more than
merely refer to the point raised by my
honourable friend.
It is earnestly to, be hoped that before we
meet again there will be some liglit on the
horizon. Doubtiess the tide will have been
on the turn some time before we know it.
We cannot see rnuch improvement now, but it
may be that the tide bas already turned. At
all events, it is certain

that a substantial

amount of money will stili have to, be voted
and expended, even in the province of the
honourable senator who bas just sat down.
I agree with h-im and can say I have known
of no public administration more creditable,
more free fromn waste, more whole-heartedly
and singly directed towards the goal for which
the money was voted, than bas been the
administration of the relief expenditure in the
Province of Saskatchewan. There was a time
whep the proportion of people in that province who were being assisted by the Parliament
of Canada was so large that I should not
want to name it, but there is the very coinforting reflection that the organization was
excellent. The men in charge performed a
noble service, free of ail reward, and I do flot
think there are aiiy people in that province
who feel that abuses of any extent were
allowed to interpose themselves.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Will the right hon ourable gentleman shlow me to ask hia !a question? On page 2 of the Bill, section 2, subsection di, reads:
Loan or advance money to. or guarantee the
payment of xnoney hy any public body, corporation or undertaking.
Now, that might be read to mean any public
body, public corporation or public undertaking, or, as it says, any publie body, corporation or undertaking. There is a great
difference between the two meanings, for
according to the second one a private corporation or private undertaking might receive
boans or have its payments guaranteed. - Is
that the intention of the Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is.
I can conceive of conditions where relief administered by any of those means might be
in the public intereat. My information is that
the Bill in that regard is the samne as the one
of hast year. I do not think there was any
necessity for the exercise cf those powers
last year, and it is to be hoped that the ex-

perience this year WiI be the samne.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I was just asking the
question.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My impression
is that the Bill would enable relief to be
extended in that way.

Parliament for the raising of m'oney: there
are borrowing bills, tax bills, and so on. All
the borrowcd money goes into a fund, and
then other bills, such as this, are brought in
to authorize the expenditure of the money.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Can the right

only such amendmnents have been made.
Practically al I think I can say all-were
clerical amendments; certainly there was
nothing that vitally affected the Bill in any

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there is no

STATEMENTS

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called may I
refer briefly to the public finance chart.

433

MAY 13, 1932
which I forwarded to honourable members
yesterday, and which have been so kindly
a1lud'ed to by my honourable friend from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) this afternoon?ý With the consent of the Bouse, I
should like to place on Hansard supporting
explanations and data referring specifically to
each chart, so that the significance of the
charts may be more easily understood.*I
may say that in the memorandum I desire to
place on Hansard there are a considerable
number of schedules which were compiled for
me bv the National Development Bureau of
the Department of the Interior from inthe Dominion
fomation obtained from
Bureau of Statistics, exccpt in one or two
instances, where the information was available
only through the Citizens' Research Institute
of Canada.
I wish to assure honourable senators that
what 1 desire to place on record is flot an
attempted solution of our financial problems,
but merely a compilation of the facts pertaining to each chart. I ask for this privilege today.so that the data mnay appear in Hansard
to-morrow and be available for study by
honourable senators who may wish to give consideration to the matter during the coming
recess.
The past twenty years have witnessed a
momentous increase in the seale of federal
responsibilities and expenditures. This has been
due largely tu thue War and tu its aftermath

of debt charges and veterans' relief, to the
financial necessities of the Canadian National
Railways, and more recently to the exigencies
of unempýoyment relief and other forma of
federal assistance.
CHIAR'r No. 1
This chart gives for the fiscal years 1912-13,
1922-23 and 1932-33, the principal details of
federal receipts and disbursements.
It is interesting to note the great change in
the sources of revenue that hae occurred during
this period. Business, Sales, Excise and Income
taxes which sprang up during the war years
now account for approximately 45 per cent of
current revenue, whereas Customs and Excise
duties. %N-hich accounted for 80 per cent of
1912-13 receipts, are estimated to provide only
about 39 per cent of 1.932-33 receipts. This
condition is outlined in the table hereunder:

MAY 13, 1932
Honourable senators will note that in the last
twenty years our position as to controllable and
uncontrollable expenditures lias been practically
reversed. While in 1912-13 we controlled 63
per cent of our public expenditures, we can
control only 37-7 per cent of the money we
spend this year. The remaining 62-3 per cent
goes to take care of our fixed obligations.
Reference to the details of the so-called controllable expenditures shows them to include
departments whose expenditure cannot be much
further reduced. The extent to which we cao
reduce our federal public expenditures is very
limited.
The foregoing schedule shows that five of our
important departments, namely, Railways and
Canals, National Defence. Public Works, Interior, Indian Affairs and Marine and Fisheries.
altogether are spending $3,300,000 less moncy
this year than they spent twenty years ago.
While in 1912-13 these departnents spent 43.3
per cent of the Government expenditures for
that year, this year, 1932-33, their estimated
disbursements constitute only 15-6 per cent of
our total expenditures. It would not appear
that much further reduction can be made in
these departments.
The Post Office department, after a reduction
of 10 per cent this year, still accounts for 8.7
per cent of the total Government expenditures

43f

for 1931-32, or 23 per cent of the so-called
controllable expenditure this year. In these six
departments we account for two-thirds of what
is termed controllable expenditure.
CHART No. 3
On April 1, in the House of Commons, the
Minister of Railways and Canals, in dealing
with the expenditures of the Canadian National
Railways, quoted current C.N.R. indebtedness to
the public at $1.280,000,000, and to the Government at $1,360,000,000. The debt to the publie
represents the extent of public participation in
C.N.R. bond issues, more than 80 per cent of
which (in value) is guaranteed by the Dominion
Government. The debt to the Government consists of loans, interest on loans and expenditures
covering the construction of the Intercolonial,
Prince Edward Island, and National Transcontinental railways. This chart is based on
comparative figures back to 1919, details being
shown both as to debt to the publie and debt to
the Government.
On the same base and on the same scale is
plotted the net debt of Canada covering the
period 1911 to 1931, an arrangement which
offers over the past twelve years a ready comparison between the public debt and the debt
owing by the Canadian National Railways. The
figures which make up this chart are as follows:

so far as these were provided for by taxation.
The total for 1913 is shown and illustrates by
reference to succeeding years the sharp upward
trend that occurred during the war years. The

It will be observed from this chart that while
federal expenditures have continued approxi-

mately the same for the seven years end.ing
with 1930, provincial expenditures have increased about 40 per cent during the same
period.
7--Combined Per Capita Expenditure-Principal Urban Centres.-This chait is based on
the combined per capita expenditure of the
Federal Government, the average per capita expenditure for all provincial goverriments and
the average per capita expenditure of the principal urban centres of Canada weighted according to population. The last named value, based
on figures of the Citizens' Research Institute,
is computed from the total population and total
expenditures of Charlottetown, Halifax, Saint
John, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
Hamilton, London, Windsor, Winnipeg, Regina,
Saskatoon, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and
Victoria, a combination that approximates 54
per cent of the urban and 27 per cent of the
total population of the country. It can be
accepted as correctly representing the per capita
municipal expenditure.
From the chart it will be observed, as is tbe
case in the trend of bonded indebtedness, that
whereas by far the greatest fraction in the years
immediately following the War was represented
by federal expenditure, subsequent reductions
brought federal costs per capita down to an
even keel for the last seven years; but this
reduction was more than offset by the gradual
and continuous increases in both provincial and
municipal expenditures, until our total per
capita cost of government in. 1930 exceeded that
of any year since 1921.
The comparative
figures are given hereunder:

It will be noted this chart disoloses that
during the past ten years the per capita
expenditures of the Federal Government have
been reduced from $58.80 in 1921 to $38.82 in
1930, a per capita reduction of 34 per cent.
During the same time the provincial expenditures have grown from $11.69 per capita in
1921 to $18.60 in 1932, which is an increase of
59 per cent, while the municipal expenditure
has advanced $8.89 per capita, or 21 per cent
increase in the interval.

from the Secretary to the Governor General,
acquainting him that the Right Hon. F. A.
Anglin, Chief Justice of Canada, acting as

NEW ZEALAND

TRADE AGREEMENT
BILL

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 62, an Act respecting
a certain trade agreement between Canada and
New Zealand.
He said: Honourable senators, this is one
of the most important measures that have
been before the House this session. I know
that all honourable members have been studying the measure, for it has been on the Order
Paper for some considerable time, and in
another place there bas been an extensive
discussion of it, the newspaper reports of which
have been fairly elaborate.
This Bill effects a new trade arrangement
with our sister Dominion of New Zealand.
I shall refer to the main features. Certain
commodities for which New Zealand desires
to create a market in our country are given
special advantages here. They are rather
numerous, but the aggregate of imports of
them up to the present time has not been
large. Similar advantages are given by New
Zealand in respect of a considerable, though
a smaller, number of Canadian goods, but the
aggregate of our exportations covered by that
list of articles is far greater than the total
imports into Canada of New Zealand goods
covered by the treaty.
Another provision of importance in the Bill
is that all articles of trade between the two
countries that are not specifically named as to
duty in the treaty come under the British
preference.
British ý preferential
relations
between this Dominion and New Zealand
have, as honourable gentlemen know, been
disturbed in late years.
Still another important feature is that on
three months' notice the duties fixed by the
treaty in respect of any article, or class of
articles, can be altered to any figure desired
by either party to the agreement. Of course,
any such alteration would naturally induce a
reactive alteration on the part of the other
contracting Dominion, but an elasticity that
bas not been inherent in previous treaties is
imported into this one from the fact that
three months' notice is sufficient to bring
about a change in duty, to any figure desired,
on any number of articles covered by the
treaty.
Another feature is that on one month's
notice any subject of trade covered by the
treaty may be removed from the terms of the
reaty. Of course, if it is removed its position with regard to the tariff becomes the
same as it was before the treaty was made.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: On thirty days' notice?
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: On thirty
days' notice. Honourable members will therefore sec that if it is desired by either party
to the agreement te alter any schedule covering one or more articles-as many as may
be desired-to any specific figure, down or up,
three months' notice is required; but if it is
simply desired to bring any article te the
position in which it stood before the treaty
was made, only one month's notice is necessary. In this way there is given to the treaty
a degree of elasticity which we hope will have
the effect of rendering it less objectionable to
special interests in either country.
This treaty is made on the eve of the
Imperial Economie Conference and comes before Parliamxent shortly before the opening of
The negotiations for the
that conference.
treaty, however, commenced a considermble
.period prior to this time. We feel that the
treaty gathers greater importance from the
fact that its passage by Parliament bas a
significant relation to the general atmosphere
of the conference itself. I do not care te go
any farther than I have now gone.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Would the right
honoirable gentleman kindly state what is the
essential difference between the present trade
agreement and the one we had before?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Weil, I have
already stated some differences, particularly
with reference to the less rigid charaeter of the
terms. Those are very great differences. I
should have added, in that respect, that under
the terms of the treaty, if, for example, the
Government of Canada should find the Canadian market flooded with any commodity, to
the unfair disadvantage of Canadian producers
of such goods, and should give notice of one
month that it desired the removal from the
terms of the treaty of that article which
proved to be coming here in unexpected
quantities, then any of the importations of that
article arriving after the notice may be held
in bond until the old duty that was imposed
against it takes effect. Consequently, there is
a degree of fortification against doubt which
the other treaty did not contain.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Of course, New
Zealand could retaliate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: New Zealand
could retaliate, a.nd would be just as free as
ourselves.
Our advantage comes in a large
number of articles. It is hoped to stimulate
the exportation of automobiles, especially of
those goods that are wholly. or almost wholly,
imanufactured in Canada; not the most expensive, but rather the more moderately
priced. Many of those are wholly manufac-

MAY 13, 1932
tured here, and under the termas of the treaty
they enjoy in the New Zealand market much
greater advantage than those whieh are, say,
only fifty per cent made in Canada.
It is hoped, in fact it is certain, that our
lumber industry will be assisted, and that advantage is of great importance flot only to
those directly engaged in the industry as a
commercial venture, but also to the vast
armies of men who heretofore have found
employment in that sphere.
It is believed that the export of our fish
products wiIl be helped; particularly those,
1 must admit, from the Pacific Coast.
It is helieved also that other lines, manufactured goods as well as natural products,
wilI fiud a wider market. It must be recalled
that we are a f ar larger Dominion than is
iNew Zewland, the other party to the treaty.
We have a population of ten and a haif millions, while it has a littie over one and a hall.
Its sales to Canada are much smaller thagn
our sales to, New Zealand. Hence, looking
ut the matter in a fair perspective, we have
mn the aggregate far more to gain than bas
the smaller Dominion.
It will be the earnest hope of both parties
to the agreemnent that nothing of an arbitrary
or hasty character will be done to alter the
terms. It is hoped that this treaty will lay
the basis for broader termas of trade, which
can be agred to at the conference itself.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The right honourable
gentleman mentioned natural products. I do
flot see very much for agricuture in this
treaty. 1 notice that woo1 comes in free, but
that the articles manufactured from wool are
very much protected.
Rigýht Honi. Mr'. MFIGHEN: Wool wý'ill
comne in free from New Zraland, but for the
finst time some duties are plaeed against wool
from ail other countries.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: 0f course I understand
that a certain quantity of New Zealand wool
is required in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is of
some beaefit to the wool growers. I do iiot
say it is wholly satisfactory to them; I think
they are probably entitled to more; but this
is, as aIl agreements are, a compromise of
claims on both sides.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: What about butter?
On butter
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN:
there is a tariff of five cents, as compared
with one cent, which my honourable friend
unfortunately thought was enough.

on the part of ail governments in Canada. It
is a common proverb, a well-know maxim,
that a governmnent is appoînted to attend to

the affairs of its own country.
couritries also have their goveraments; and
for the first time this Government has gone
out te discuss commercial matters with another country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not the first
time. We had the Australian Treaty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, we had the
Australian Treaty. But the Canada First policy
has met the New Zealand First policy-and
what lias been the result? We have a new
treaty. I think that one need. only read it
rapidly to sec that it is much less to our
advantage than was the old treaty. As my
right honourable frîend has saîd, New Zealand
has but a limaited number of articles to scîl us,
mostly agricultural, while Canada bas industrial as well as agrioultural produets to
selI. New Zealand, considering heresýeIf t.o
have pretty strong claims on thisSountry, bas
wondered why she should open her doors te,
Canada if Canada will take nothing from her.
The result of the discussi;on has been that New
Zealand has levied higher impoats upon
Canadian goods in very many instances, and
bas reduced her irnposts on none. Unlder the
old treaty we had the benefit of the British
preference rates. Now the duties levied by
New Zeeland wilI be mauch steeper than those
under the British preference.

I will give but

a few examples. On socks and stockings the
British preference rate was 28.9 per cent;
under the new treaty the duty will he .39-8
per cent. On plaster, pulp sheets, pla.ster

board and other similar materials the British
preference rate was 24.5; under the new treaty
the rate is to be 42 -8 per cent. On cultivatars,
h-arrows, ploughs, drills, soýwers, seed or grain
separators, the British pTeference, which wts
applied to us in New Zealand, was 12-25 per
cent; iinder the new treaty the duty will be
36.75. On electric cooking and heating
apparatus the British preference was 24.5 per
cent; the rate under the ne'w treaty wiil be
36-75. Passenger cars over £200, under the
British pre-ference could have entered, New
Zealand at 10 per cent; under the new treaty
they will enter at 20 per cent.
While we thus psy more to, enter the New
Zealand market, New Zealand paya less to
enter our market. We have reduced duties on

SENATE
a considerable nuniber of articles. On more
than twenty-five the rates are below those of
the old treaty and below the British preference.
We have raised aur duty an only two articles,
fresh meat and butter, but even on those we
are stili below the British preterence rate. On
fresh meat the British preference rate was four
cents; under the new treaty fresh meat will
corne in at three cents. Butter under the British
preterence rate was eight cents; it will corne in
at five cents. Lt is true, as my right h;onourable
fr end has said, that under the aid treaty-the
trcaty with Au.stralia, which was extended ta
New Zealand-the duty was ane cent, but we
had notified New Zealand that after the
treaty expired we would impose a rate of four
cents. Sa under the treaty n0w betore us the
protection an the item of butter is increased
from what wauld have been the Liberal impost,
four cents, to an im.pust of five cents.
I must express my regret at the fact that
this treaty has been concluded anly naw. Wc
intended, as soon as the treaty terminated, ta
enter into npgatiatians witb Ncw Zealand for
,the purpase ot continuing aur relations. The
result of delay in concluding this treaty has
been very bad for Canada. Our exparts, whieh
amounted ta $19,187,803 in 1930, dropped tao
$3,728,500 in 1932. 1 recagnize, of course,' that
the general world depressian bas hal sanie
effect in bringing about this tremendous ruductian, but the loss of aur advantages in
that market through the retaliatory measures
of the New Zealand Government bas resulted
in the virtual wiping out of aur sales in that
country.
A few details will indicate the extent ta
which aur trade with New Zealand bas talien
off sincu 1930. In 1930 we sold them automrobiles ta the value of S5,507,000; in 1932 ta
the amount of $263.000. In the same years
the sale of pneuimatic tire casings feIl fram
S2.119,000 ta S263,000; ot electrical apparatus,
fram .$764,000 ta S238,000; of canned flsh, from
$63,f00 ta S19000. The sale af iran wvire.
-w.hieh amauntcd ta $448,000 in 1930, fell ta
$48,000 in 1932, and of iran bars and rodq,

Musical instruments w-c sold ta the tune af
$186.000 in 1930, but we sold aone last year.
Hardware and cutlery sales dropped fram
$321.000 ta $23,000; planks and boards, framn
$256.000 ta £31.000; rubbcr foatwear tram
81.012,000 ta $303.000. and farm implemcnts
from £308,000 ta $40,000. 1 only hope and
pray that under this new agreement we may
be able ta recaver that market.

which were negatiated by the late Gavemnment, and of which, it appears, only one, that
with France, has been denounced. I contend
that Canada fared very weIl under those
treatie-g. Our exports increased, and in moý,t
cases the balance of trade was largely in aur
favour. Our toreign trade surprised the worMd.
While it is true, according ta the statement
that bas heen brought dawn, that the treaty
with France is the anly one denounced- it
will end next month-I must draw the attention af this Chamber ta the tact that tLhat
denunciatian will probably have an inmpartant repercussian in most of the othor
cauntries with whomn we have treaties and
who enjay most-tavoured-natian treatment.
Those cauntries wiIl ]ase the advantage ut tbe

ta revise their positions. Unquestianaibl.y, they

It stands ta reasan, theretare, that they wiil

in our external relations. \Ve cannat hope

as the. oId one was; neveatheleoe it offera some

first experienvce of such ta hand-to-mouith form
of agreement. Ail I eau say ia, Jet us hope.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHM: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman two questions?
The flrst is this. Have my right honourable
friend and the 'Governmenat heard anything
fromn the manufacturiers of sole ileather ais to
the effect of this treaty on itheir business? I
may say that representations have been mnade
to me thait under' this 'treaty the mnanufactuers of sole 'leather in Canada will flot be
able -to ggt enough. of the right kind of hides
to carry on ;business efflciently.. The other
question relates to section 5 of the Bill, which
says:
This Act Rhall corne inta force on a day to,
be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in
Council published in the Canada Gazette.
WilI the proclamaîtion be issued before, the
Ecanomie Cionference? The reason I ask is
that the resaJit of the conference might cause
a change in the treaty.
Hon'. Mr. DAN DURAND: The right honourable genîtleman answvers by a movement of
his head. Su-eh -an answer cannot be registered
by the sborthand writer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I neyer have
any objection to .my answers being Tegistered.
I do not think they will rise up in judgment
against me.
As ta the first question: representations have
been made -ta me, through members cf Parliament, that the dýuties on hides were resisted
by manufacturers in Canada, especially the
tanners. This is regrettable, but we 'cannot
have everything aur own way. The producers of
hi-des now have an advantage for ithe ilirst time.
This is just anather instance of our eagerness
ta he -of assistance primarily to agriculiture.
As to the second point: àit l n-ot the intention to wai't for the 'conference before proclaiming tihe treaty; in facot, it la my understanding that it la to be proclaimed almnost at
once. This provision in the Bihi la to enable
the proclamations to be made in the two
counitries at the saixne time. The treaity lasts
for only a year. 'That la a feature 'that I
omaitited to mention in my first explanatiomi.

Hon. W. IL. SHARPE: Honourable members, I wlah to protest against this tree-ty.
An Hon. SENATOR: la that right?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It la. I amn not in
favour of it ait aill, because I think ilt wili put
a large nmber of aur factories out of business.
Furthermore, while it apparentJy gives the
people of this country five cents a pound pro'tection on butter, the exehange wipes out
four cents of that and we are protected by
on'ly one -cent a pound. I do not think that
this 'treaty should have been entered inta until
after the Imperial Conference.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or ait it?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Or et the Imperial
Conference. The whole matter cauld have
been warked out then. I admit that this
treaty is going ta be a fairly good thing for
the manufacturer; 'but ail the 'trealies that
have been made in this country for a good

have averdone it. We have too many menufa-cturing establishments et the present time. I
think lit is tfume that somne government did
something for the farmers of the country.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: As the right
honoureble the leader of the Gavernment la

diversification of agriculture, encauraging the

whetber, in some of 'the legislaýtion that ive
are bringing down, this year, at any rate, we
are not overdooking t-hat fa-ct. If we are
going ta encourage the fermers ta go into
mixed farm'ing, and raise live stock, we must
try ta help them find a ma*rket for their
caýttle, hogs, sheep, and the hy-products of
those anlîmals. I find that under this treaty
we are *making it very difficuJt for the raiser
of wool ta sell bis praduct in Canada at a

1 realize that there is always great difficulty
.n drafting a preferential treaty with any
niation without treading upon the tocs of somne
person in one country or the other; but as
far as wool is concerned, I think we should
bear in m)ind this fact, that the woollen goods
rnanufactureýd in Canada have been given
higher protection of recent years, whereas the
sa7e of raw wool is suffering ve'ry keenly
from ourtside comipetition, and wilil continue

Hon. J. STANFIELD: Honourable senators,

I did not intend to say anything on this

that subject. Wool is certainly at a very

this explains why the sales of Canadian woel

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: How about the ten

Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: No, it was five.
On the other hand, the duty on fine woollen

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Was it not
still on the Statute Book when the honourable
gentleman's party came back to power?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I think not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think so.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: No, it was not. My
right honourable friend has a good memory,
but I feel sure the pact was not let on the
Statute Book until that time. After the
Liberal Party came back to office Mr. Fielding introduced in his Tariff Bill of 1922 a
clause by which Parliament authorized the
negotiation of another reciprocity treaty with
the United States on the same terms. But
the United States had undergone a change
of heart.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It always does.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: How could it do
otherwise a'fter the treatment it had received?
Be serious.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Let me say that I
am very pleased we are reopening trade channels between our sister Dominion of New
Zealand and Canada. But I do not ike the
provision that on one month's notice any
clause or clauses in the treaty may be cancelled. As between nation and nation a notice
of six months is required, and that makes for
stability of trade. This provision for altering the terms on such short notice reduces
the treaty to something of very little value.
However, as I say, I tihink the treaty with
New Zeial-and is a good thing. It means that
we are going back to the pokeicy of the late
Mr. Robb and of Mr. Dunning. The renewal
of the treaty with New Zealand is a compliment to 'that Dominion on the part of
Canada, the big brother.
But there arc more important trade channels
to b found for Canada, if this country is to
forge ahead as it should. At the present
time there is considerable agitation in the
United States in favour of a new trade arrangement with Canada. I was privileged to attend
lately a couple of sittings of Congress at
Washington, where, by the way, I was
addressed as "Colonel." I protested that I
had no such title, but that made no difference,
and I was given a good seat, from which I
heard a debate on tariff matters by leading
members. I may say to the right honourable leader of the House that a very influential
section of the Democratic Party is eager to
arrive at a new trade pact with Canada. In
the American press there has been a gencral
discussion on reciprocity. Not long ago a
prominent Republican sent a lettor to PresiHon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

dent Hoover calling his attention to the fact
that Canada is the best customer the United
States has, and urging that a new agreement
similar to that of 1911 be arrived at.
I hope that the Imperial Conference will
be a success, but I am always afraid of such
family gatherings, for sometimes they end in
family quarrels. I read the English press,
and I know that John Bull is not going to
be bullied this time. He will ask for his fair
share.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is he not entitled to
his fair share?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Certainly he is. He
lias opened his ports to Canada for almost one
hundred years, and in return we have taxed
British goods all that time. Now we have
invited him to the conference, and we cannot
exact from him all the sacrifices, making none
ourselves; ho will expect us to make some.
Honourable senators will remember the recent
speech of Sir Josiah Stamp, in which he gave
some good advice to the right honourable the
Premier of this country and his high protectionist friends. He said that it was all very
well to bargain, but that friends should try
to make as equitable terms as possible; that
one friend should not try to get the lion's
share. I sincerely hope that the conference
will turn out well, but we must not forget
that at a very short distance from us are
the American people, who perhaps are ready
to open up more friendly channels of trade
than we have at the present time.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: May I ask the honourable member a question?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Did we ever make a
treaty with the United States which that
country did not want to change, just as soon
as it had been put into operation?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: My friend's question is based on a misinterpretation of history. We had a Reciprocity Treaty from
1854 to 18ý66, which was the golden era of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The American Civil
War had much to do with making that successful.
Hon. Mr. LEMEIUX: My own father, who
lived not far from the international border
at the time the treaty was in effect, told me
that those twelve years were the golden era
of Canada; and that statement will be corroborated by reference to figures in the bluebooks.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: That was at the time
of the American Civil War.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who cencelled the treaty?
Han. Mr. LEM JEUX: In aur Canadian
legislatures-I amn sorry ta say, even in the city
of Montreal, in rny own province, on the occasion- of the trial of the St. Alibans raiders-the
sentiment was in favour of the South agairist
the North, and Southern victaries were
occasions of cheering. Af ter the War ended,
was it ta be expected that the United States
would be desirous of renewing the treaty with
us? In Toronto the powerfuh voice of George
Brown was almost alone in favouring the
cause of the North. We ail know what
happened in the Mother Country. Sa if
the United States did not renew the ElginMarcy Treaty, it is nat due ta thern as much
as it is ta us and ta the Mother Country.
This is ancient history, but let us not forget that the teachings of history shauld guide
us. Now, a word about this Imperial Conference ta be held this summer. I wish it
wehl. But remember that in 1849 this Country
pretty nearhy became annexed ta the United
States. The great movement for the annexation of Canada ýta the United States took
place in 1849-why? Under the arrangements
between the Colonies and the Mather Country Canada had enjoyed a preference on the
British mnarket. Our wheat, aur humber, aur
cattle had been given a preference there. But
England decided ta have free trade. It
meant the ruinatian of many of aur business
men and industries. In Toronto and Montreal, amangst Liberals and Conzervatives,
French and English, rnastly English, the
As
manifesto for annexation was signed.
they said, "If we enjoy no preference on the
Mother Country's mnarkets, and if the Amenicans can seîl as freely ta Britain as we did
before free trade, we rnay juat as well join
our fortunes with the United States,.I Thet
movement in favaur of annexation stopped
as soon as aur Governor General went ta
Washington. He had obtained fromn the
Mother -Country the authority ta negotiate
the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854. It was called
the Elgin-Marcy Treaty.
Now, ahi this is an abject lesson for us, and
we ought this summer ta get the best arrangement possible; but let us neyer farget that
the natural market of the Canadian farmers
is ta the south.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to any clause of this motion, but I
desire to tell my honourable friend from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner> that I learned
this morning that the printing of 400 copies
would mean the translation and printing of
400 pages. I understand that the type of the

are at this time trying to effect economies, 1
wonder whether it is worth while to order
the printing of 400 additional copies in
English and 200 in French- I do flot raise
any objection, but simply wish to point out
that this printing will entail the expenditure
of a few hundred dollars and it seemns to me
doubtful that this expenditure is necessary.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Senate some

the report, and I have been informed bY the

AMENDMENTS

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved concurrence in the ameodments made hy the
House of Commons to Bill El, an Act respecting the Department of Insurance.
Has the right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman the amendments they
are proposing?

MAY 24, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
amendments are as f ollows: Clause seven,
which prohibited officers or clerks of the Department of Insurance from being interested,
directly or indirectly, in any insurance company doing business in Canada and registered
or licensed under any of the Insurance Acts,
has been struck out, and a new clause inserted
which goes the same length, but also f orbids
the same officers or clerks fromn being interested in any trust company or loan company doing business in Canada and licensed
under any of the Acta. The senators who were
present will recall that the Superintendent of
Insurance, when before our committee, was
quite ready to have this amendment inserted.
He sucoeeded in the other House.
The further amendments concern money
clauses, which clauses wprc initiated in this
House, but omitted fromn the Bill. They are
now inserted by amendment made in the other
House. Over these money clauses, as is well
known, we have very limited authority.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Was there not an
amendment passed in the Huse of Commons
restricting the amount of common stock that
any insurance company might invest in?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; that is nlot
in this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It will be in
one of the Insurance Bills.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was a restriction made in one of our own committees.
The motion was agreed to.
COMMERCE AND TRADE RELATIONS
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE-CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN moved that the
third report of the Standing Committee on
Commerce and Trade Relations be now taken
into consideration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would respectfully suggest to the honourable senator
in charge of this report that it might be proper
to allow it to stand until the long liat of Bills
from the other House which we have to conaider are deait with. I should not lîke, at
all events, to run the risk of a considerable
delay by the possible carrying over of the
consideration of these Bills until t.o-morrow,
because we shall have abundant work tomorrow, as we are fast approaching the close
of the session.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Though I did nlot
intend to cause any considerable delay hy my
remarks, I arn quite content to accept the
right honourable leader'% suggestion.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was not

afraid of.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Order might
be placed at the end of the list for to-day.
The Order stands.
PRIVATE BILL

IN

COMMONS

AMENDMENTS

Hon. G. V. WHITE moved concurrence in
the amendments made by the bouse of Coinmons to Bill 32, an Act respecting the Ottawa
and New York Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: What are the amendments to this Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill provides for the building of approaches to and
a right of way over the bridge of this railway company at Cornwall. A company is to
be formed to performn this work, and the
railway company is empowered to transfer its
rights in this regard to the new company.
In the committee of this bouse an amendment was inserted to the effeet that should
the Government of Canada, because of contemplated improvementa to the St. Lawrence
river, find it necessary to expropriate or remove the bridge itself, it should not be called
upon to pay to this company any compensation on account of expenses incurred in providing an automobile and passenger track over the
bridge, or in other construction work. The
Commons has amended that provision to the
f ollowing effect: Should the Government of
Canada require the removal of the bridge
within eight years, it cannot be called upon
to pay in respect of this new construction
work-the approaches, the work on the bridge,
the lumber between the rails and so forthmore than the actual cost thereof, lesa depreciation; and after eight yeare it can be
callcd upon to pay not more than the cost, lesa
depreciation, but this shaîl apply only to the
construction work on the bridge itself, and
shaîl not include the approaches. The idea,
apparently, is to provide against complete
confiscation, or early confiscation, such as
would make impossible the financing of the
enterprise.
bon. Mr. BUREAU: Are we to understand
that the Bill as passed by the Railway Committee of the Senate has been amended so that
the company shaîl be recouped the coat of
planking the bridge, and shaîl receive no
money for the approaches or whatever means
have been provided to get to the bridge?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It says, not
that the company shaîl be recouped, but that
it shaîl not be entitled, to anything more

than the cost of the planking if the expropriation takes place after eight years, or the
cost of the planking and the approaches if
expropriation is within eight years; in either
case, less depreciation.

House of Commons to Bill C2, an Act te
amend the Winding-up Act.
Right Hon. Mr.
Senate Bill?

GRAHAM:

That is a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. This
Bill originated in this House and was considered fully in committee. It is a rather
lengthy Bill, and the Commons have made but
one amendment, namely, the insertion at page
seven, line fifteen-that is te say at the very
end of the Bill-of the following:
3. Section twenty-three of the said Act is
aiended by adding thereto the following subsection:"(2) In the case of any company except
building societies incorporated, banks, saving
banks, insurance conpanies, trust compaies,
loan comupanies and railway companies, the
court shal not appoint as liquidator any
person who is not licensed as a trustee under
the Bankruptcy Act."
The amendment speaks for itself; and it is
not uncomplimentary to the committee of this
House that this amendment should have been
the only one made in the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is provision in one of the Acts for the appointment
of these trustees?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. This
provides that only a trustee who is licensed
under the Bankruptcy Act can be appointed
in these cases.
The motion was agreed te.
FISHERIES BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 10, an Act to amend
and consolidate the Fisheries Act.
He said: This is a Bill of some importance,
and after the second reading I should like
te have it referred to the appropriate committee. The Bill has been reviewed before
a committee of the other House, and perhaps
the Committee of the Whole could deal with
it here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

The chief purpose of the Bill is to amend
the Fisheries Act so as to bring it into conformity with a decision of the Privy Council
in 1929, which rather damaged several provisions of the Fisheries Act as now in force.
In conformity with the Privy Councils judgment, provisions of the old Act relating to
the licensing of fish canneries, reduction plants,
whale factories and so on are omitted, such
provisions being declared ultra vires by that
verdict. In addition, some provisions which
were regulatory in character are also omitted
from the present measure. Apart from the
changes necessitated by the Privy Council's
judgment, certain definitions are improved so
as to remove doubt.
Section 8 of the Bill amends the existing
Act so as to authorize the cancellation of
fishery licences where there has been nonconformity with the law. Under the present
Act, according to my understanding, there
can be no cancellation of those licences except
after an adverse report of the commissioner
under the Inquiries Act. This provision is
cumbersome and unnecessary.
Then there is a change with respect to
section 31 of the existing Act, which has to
do with the construction of fishways in power
dams and other obstructions. Under the law
as it stands, the Minister has power, I understand, in the case of a dam or obstruction
in a river or a waterway, to compel the constructors of the dam to provide a fishway;
but inasmuch as dams are frequently so high
that even if a fishway can be provided,
enabling the stronger fish te rise against the
current, the younger fish are killed by the
fall from the upper levels. This Bill provides
machinery to require the installation of
hatcheries to protect the younger fish. Members of the Senate from more maritime parts
of the country than that from which I come
will probably appreciate this section better
than I do. It provides that in such instances
as I have described the owners of the dams
may be required to establish such fish
hatchery facilities as will, in the opinion of
the Minister. meet the requirements for maintaining the fisheries.
This very briefly outlines the effects of the
measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill seems
to be somewhat important, inasmuch as it
not only amends the Fisheries Act, but is a
consolidation of that Act. The modifications
are not so formidable as they would at first
appear to be. I confess that I have net had
much experience in regard to the application of this Act, nor have I followed the

MAY 24, 1932
various amendments to the Bill. I thought
at first that we could perhaps send it to
a committee, but, -as time is somewhat pressing, we might sit this evening and asic the
experte of the depart.ment to appear before
US.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know the
honourable senator from Aima (Hon. Mr.
Ballantayne) has given this ineasure some
consideration. I have souglit as best I could
to under.stand ail its terms, and 1 wouid
suggest that we refer it to Committee of the
Whole Huse. If honourable senators prefer,
we -can postpone consideration until this evening, so that -honourable gentlemen who wish
to make a careful rcview of the Bill before
it is taken up in Committee may have an
opportunity to do so. I amn prepared to have
the Bill considered in Committee now and to
send for the proper officiai, so that we may be
better informed. I .think, however, I can give
a fair expianation of the different sections.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ail right.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

REPORTED

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Mcighen, the
Senate went into Committec on the Bilh.
Hon. Mr. L'Espérance in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-interpretation:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: These are the
same as in the oid Act. There is a new
definition of "fishing," and aiso of "iawfui
excuse."
Section 2 was agrced to.
Sections 3 and 4 were agreed to.
On section 5--appointment of fishery officers:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Are these officers
new?
Right Hon. Mr. MEI(IHEN: I do not think
so. The existing section provides foor the
appointment of officers by the -Governor in
Council. That is as it wtas prior to the
adoption of the Civil Service Act. AppaTentiy
it was by error that that section was ieft as
it originaliy stood when the statutes were
being consoiidated. The effect of this provision in the Bill is to bring the appointîments
under the Civil Service Act.
Section 5 was agreed to.
Sections 6 and 7 were agreed to.

On section S--Minister rnay cancel licence:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This is the
section .to which the right honourabie leader
of the Government referred?
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: Yes. This is
the section .which provides that the power of
canceilation shall he in the Minister, and
that he does not need to have the authority
of the inquirer under the Inquiries Act before
exercising the power.
Section 8 was agreed to.
Sect-ions 9 to 14, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 15--as to spawning rivers:
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Wiil that prevent
a person from angiing in one river where
another river runs into it? I think it wiii.
I do not think iA is intended to do that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The way the
Act read was this:
No salmon shall be fished for, caught or killed.
otherwise than by angling with hook and Uine
within two hundred yards of the mouth of any
tributary of any creek or stream which salmon
frequent to spawn.
That is quite chear. One cannot fish for
salmon, otherwise than by angling, with-in two
hundred yaids of the mouth of any tributary
of any creek or stýream.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: For instance, you
couid not fish in the branch of the Réstigouche'
I do not think that is observed at aul.
Right Hon. MT. MEIGHEN: No doubt,
what the Act was intended te mean was within
two hundred yards of where the stream opens
into the sea.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is, no doubt,
what is intcnded.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The section
reads:
In the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec no
salmo;n shall be fished for, caught or kilied
otherwise than by angling with hock and line,
within two hundred yards cf the mouth of any
tributary of any creek or stream which salmon
frequent to spawn.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.- I do not think it is
intended to mean that.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It is the same wording
as section 18 of the present Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oniy that the
prohibition is con6ined to the four provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The expianation
given is:

452

SENATE

This section is the same as section 18 of the
existing Act, with the exception that its application is restricted to the Atlantic Provinces.
It was clearly intended so to apply, and bas
never been enforced in British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Should not the
words "during the spawning season" be inserted, so that fishing would not be prohibited
after spawning has taken place?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Only two
hundred yards are covered; so it does not
seem to matter much in that respect. But
what bothers me is the objection raised by
the honourable senator fron Moncton (Hon.
Mr. Robinson). The section appears to forbid
the fishing at the mouth of a tributary. I do
not know much about fishing, but I should
think that what is necessary is the forbidding
of ifishing at the mouth of a river where it
enters into the sea.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I think that is the intention. That is the practice in the Maritime
Provinces, at all events.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is not observed.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Not observed so far as
tributaries are concerned; that is, where one
river enters into another. It is intended to
apply only where a river enters into the sea.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The practice in
Quebec is-unless there has been a changethat people are allowed to fish as far as the
tide goes, but no farther. For instance, in
the Bonaventure river the lishing was free
for anybody at the mouth of the river; and
the sanie with the St. John river. Wherever
the tide goes the fishing has been considered
open to anyone.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: This does net say anything about that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: No. I suggest
that the clause stand, and I shall send for
an official.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: After reading over the
section, I think perhaps it is all right. It
simply means that no seine or net fishing
shall take place within two hundred yards
of the mouth of a streani, but fishing with
the fly and line is permissible. I think that
is proper.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But what I
do not understand is why the prohibition to
fish otherwise than with the line applies only
within two hundred yards of the mouth of
any tributary, and not within two hundred
yards of the mouth of the main stream.
According to my understanding of fishing,
which is very limited, salmon come up from
the ocean through the main stream.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not know the
habits of Maritime Provinces fish, but in
Scotland during the spawning season salmon
will go up a very small tributary, and in some
places it is possible to catch salmon with the
bands.
During that season, however, the
taking of them is prohibited.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:
to New Brunswick.

That does not apply

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I think the right
honourable leader of the House knows considerable about fishing, judging by his remarks.
It seems to me that the section should be
rewritten in plainer language, to provide that
the fishing of salmon, otherwise than by
angling with book and line, shall be prohibited within two hundred yards from the
mouth of any river. A tributary runs into a
river. You cannot stop fishing where a
branch of a river runs into a main stream.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
see why the prohibition should apply to the
tributary. I suggest that the section stand.
Section 15 stands.
Sections 16 te 19, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 20-construction of fishways:
Riglt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
of this is now.

A good deal

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is new
from line 21 to the end of subsection 2. This
is the umost important section of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Have there
been any expressions of objection or approval
by any of the companies or individuals who
are engaged to a large extent in fishing?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I bave read
the discussion in the other House and I
think I am safe in saying that no assurance
was given there of such consultation having
taken place. I am satisfied that there are
members of this House who know whether
or not the clauses of this section are practicable. Undoubtedly they are pretty drastic.
I should like to have the opinion of senators
from the Maritime Provinces and Quebec on
this section. It will be observed that this
section enables the Minister to construct,
operate and maintain, in fishing streams where
there are dams, fish hatcheries of a type that
will in his opinion meet the requirements
for maintaining
the annual
return
of
migratory fish, and he may require the owner
or occupier of the dam or other obstruction
to pay such sums of money as are required
for this construction, operation and maintenance.

MAY 24, 1932
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: That is only
where fishways are flot feasible.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That weuld apply te
places where there are dams as high as eighty
or one hundred feet, as there are in some
rivers. In such instances the fishway is se
steep and the volume of water se great that
only the strongest of fish are able to get Up,
and the resuit is that the supply of fish in
such streams is not kept up to normal. The
section would apply, I think, only te those
rivers on which there are power stations for
generating electricity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is
meant by providing a fish hatchery establishment? I thought a hatchery was for hatchmeg out fish. How would that get over the
difficulty of fish not being able to get over
an 80-foot dam?
Hon. Mr. BLACK:
Suppose there arc
50,000 small fry that cannot get over the
dam: the owner or occupier of the dam would
have to pay for the hatching of 50,000 fry
te be placed in the river above the dam.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is a
clause which says that the Minister may
grant one-haîf of the expense incurred by an
owner or occupier in constructing and maintnining a fishway or canal.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I think that is vcry
reasonable, too.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: What clause
is that?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Subsection 4,
at the top of page 7.
Section 20 was agreed te.
Section 21 M'as agreed te.

On section 25-killing fish when passing

last line.
Section 25 was agrecd te.

On section 26--use of explosives prohibited:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Why should it be
necessary te allow explosives to be used
against an animal ne bigger than a hair seal?
It appears to m .e te be an extremely unpleasant sert of death for any of these animals
te undergo. A hair seal is net a very large
animal; net like a whale or a walrus. I
should think hair seals might be left eut of
this section.
Right Hen. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I neyer saw
a hair seal, and I do net knew what the
average size is. The section is the same as
it was befere.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: A hair seal might
possibly be a little larger than the ordinary
seal that Newfoundland fishermen hunt. They
apparently go aS Lez thlem with a club, and
kill them by knocking them on the heads.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hair seals are
net listed in the cepy oS the Bill I have.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The section
reads:
No one shall hunt or kill fish er marine
animals of any kind, other than porpoises,
whales, walruses, sea lions and hair seals, by
means of rockets, explosive materials, or
explosive projectiles or shelîls.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is net
in the Bill I have.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Nor in the one I have.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The. Bill was

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The words
"sea lions and hair seals" are only in the Bill
as passed by the House of Com!mons on the
2Oth of May. I understand the Bill was
amended in committee, and objection was
raised in the ether House te geing on with
the measure until it wae reprinted. As reprinted, it contains the additional words I
have mentioned, and it is worth while for the
Committee te decide whether it desires te
permit the use of explosives against sea liens
and hair seals. I must decline to off er any
opinion.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Can the right honeurable gentleman tell us the difference between
a sea, lien and a walrus?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Ask the ex-Minister of Marine (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: I neyer saw
either animal, but I have brought with me my
expert from Alma (Hon. MT. Ballantyne).

of the existing Act, except that subsection 2
of the existing Act, which provides that anv
British subject may take bait or fish in :my
of the harbours or other waters of Canada
subject to regu-ation, is dropped, as obvioiusly
bait or any other fish may be taken in accordance with the regulations. The omission of

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Section 57 was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

R-ight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a

dimensions; otherwise there is an offence.
Section 59 was agreed to.

On section 64-confiscation of all fishing
property used, and all fish taken, bought, or
sold, in violation of Act:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a
change here. This section replaces section
82 of the existing Act, and the amendment
strikes out the provision relating to confiscation
of fishing property for violation of any international regulations. Section 90 of the existing Act ,provided for bringing international
fishery regulations into force, but the regulations under the treaty with the United States,
signed in 1908, never beca.me effective. Section
90 is therefore omitted from this Bill.

one who violates or prepares to violate any
provision of this Act ...
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There are
similar clauses in the Code. Any one who
prepares to make -counterfeit coin is guilty.
Section 66 was agreed to.
Sections 67 to 75, inclusive, were agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not prepared to go on with section 15. I have word
from the department that they have nobody

to the Committee. I move that the Committee Tise and report progress. fl will not
move the Huse into Committee again until
they have somebody *who can exiplain these
sections.
H1on. Mr. LITTLE: Section 15 would be
more intelligible if the words "stream or"i
were added, so that it would read:
In the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec no
salmon shall be fished for, caught or killed
otherwise than by angling with hook and line,
within two huadred yards of the mouth of any
8tream or tributary of any creek or stream.
which salmon frequent to spawn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: That may be
necessary. I do flot see why the triibutéiry
need be protected unleas you proteet the
whole strea.m.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I should like to hear
the explanation of the department on that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We will wait
until we see somebody who can give the
explanation. I do not like the wording of the
ast section:

76. Chapter seventy-three of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, entitled the Fisheries
Act, with ail amendments thereto, is repealed.
I týhink the amendments should be distînctly repealed. It may be that this wording
was adopted befure, but I du not recali that
it ever was.
I inove that the Committee rise, and that
we leave sections 15 and 76, the preamble
and the tîtie, as flot fully considered.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: We can take
it up in Committee of the Whole if that is
desired.
1 do flot think there have bcen many, if any,
important changes in the Bill itself. What
bas given rise Vo the press reports is this.
The Bill as introduced provided for a ten

455

per cent reduction of ail salaries or other
increments in the nature of salaries or revenue
received by men and women in the public
service of Canada, but it did not cover the
salaries of judges, lieutenant-governors or
members of the permanent force. There may
have been amendments in Lhe other House,
but they were not important. Subsequently
in the other bouse another Bill was introduced to provide for a taxation on income
or salary received by judges and members of
the permanent force who are not enlisted men.
This was not in the nature of a change in the
Bill now before us; it was a supplementary
Bill. It was criticized as being a variation
from what had been the intent of the Govern.ment when this Bill was introduced. But thîs
Bill as passed by the Commons stands pretty
much as it ww~ when originally brought before
them.
Except that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
those who receive a salary of less than $1,200
are allowed by the Goverament their superannuation. payments, and this allowance brings
their deduction down to live per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. But the
Bill was inîtroduced in that form. There bas
been no change in that respect either.
Hon. JACQUES BUREAU: Since the discussion is taking place on the second reading,
time may be saved, instead of going into Committee of the Wholc, if I m-ay, by leave of the
Senate, combine with my rcmarks on this
Bill what 1 have to say on Bill 92, which
puts a tax on the judiciary. Bill 19 defines
what is a member of the public service of
Canada, exclucling the Governor General of
Canada and the lieutenant-governors of the
several provin-ces. It also exicludes the judiciary and memnbers of the military, naval and
air forces of Canada, and of the Royal Cana.ý
dian Mo.unted, Police. 1 wonder wby they.are
excluded. Naturally we are not going to say'
to the representatives of the King, "Wc regard you as ordinary public servants, and
want to deduct a certain percentage from
your salary;" but if we have the -power Vo Vax
them we also have the power-I do not say
we have the right-to make deductions from,
their salaries. Parliament can do almost anything; anything that is noV immoral. Why
not do away with the second Bill, conccrning
the judiciary, and in defining the members of
the public service of Canada in paragraph b
of section 2 of Bill 19 say:
"'Member of the public service of Canada"
means every officer, clerk and employee in any
bra&nch or portion of the public service of
Canada, to whom any compensation is paid,
either directly or indirectly, out of the revenue

of His -.
%Iajestv ini respect of his Government
of Canada, other than the Governor General of
Canada and the Lieutenant-Governors of the
several provinces of Canada, and includes the
members of the judiciary, the maembers of
military. naval aurd air fores~ of Canada, the~
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. miembers of
the Senate and House of Commons of Canadaand so on?
I have read in the press, and have heard it
stated in various places, that certain members
of the judiciary in the rural districts, particu]arly in the Province of Quebec, werc
opposed to any deduction from their compensation or salaries.
During the recess 1
made it rny duly to interviewv ns rnany judges
in the rural districts of Quebec as 1 could. I
may say that I know nearly ail of thern, and
I interviecwed n.early every one I kno.w, and
in justice to, thern I rnust say that every one
to whorn I spoke expressed a willingness at
any lime te, contribute to the public exchequer, eiîher by way of deduction or otherivise, to help in the present crisis.
The exclusion of the judiciary from this
Bill means that w"e want 10 exempt thein f-com
the clediietion bc-cause we have no rigýht to
include them. If the proposition thýat w-e want
to exclude thero is correct, then why do ve
corne along with Bill 92 and say that we are
going to impose a tax on thern? I arn speaking from the point of view of the judiciary.
Bill 92 is sirnply a devious rnethod of accomplishing the sarne end. The judges on the
Bcnch are the very inen whose duty il is
to discourage and prevent others, who corne
before thern, frorn taking devions ways in trying to, circumrvent the law'..
We have the
power, I take it, to make a deduction. Why
not do il in the regu]ar way instead of
adopting the roundabout rnethod of exempting thern by one Bill and taxing lhern under
another?
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) will answer by saying that we
exclude them frorn the meaning of "mernber
of the public service of Canada." I may
say that I do not think lhey would be at ail
hnrniliated by being includcd in that definition. They are public servants, rnen in whorn
we have confidence. and to wvhom xve look
for justice. Our fate is in their hands. We
depend upon their integrity and irnpartiality
to give us the rights we desire to assert.
Would it not be we]l t0 consider the two
Bis together in order t0 see whether it
would nlot be beller 10 avoid taking devious
ways 10 attain our end? If we adopt such
rneans of reaching men who are in a position
10 appreciate what is being done, they will
say, "Those people place us on the Bench
Hon. Mr. BUREAU.

and make laws to prevent circuitous and
devious ways of doing business, yet lhey
adopt sirnilar snethodis thernselves in dealing
with us."
We have heard a great deal about the
dignity of the Senate. I do not lhink il is
dinified on our part 10 act in this way.
Eilher we have the righl 10 rnake a reduction
or we have not. If we have not tlie right,
we should say in the prearnble of the Bill,
"Whereas there are douibîs' in regard 10 Ibis
malter, "nevertheless it is expedient that we
sbould" do so and so, and "wve cannot do
otherwise." Put "whereas" in as rnany times
as you like, in order to show that we cannot
help ourselves.
My purpose in rising was sirnply 10 proteat
against the injustice thiat is being donc t0
these men, twelve or tifteen of whom have
expressed t0 me their willingniess 10 contribute
in this lime of need.
Tbere is another point. The judges are not
ail paid equally. I know how tbey are paid
in the Province of Quebec, and I understand
that iii the Province of Ontario payrnents are
made 10 the county court judges for rex ising
voters' lists, and 10 the judges of the Supreme
Court for sitling in cases of contested elctions. The important point is Ihat they are
l)aid for that by the Provincial Government,
not by the Dominion Governmcnt, and whalever they recetive in that way sbo-uld not hýý
taxe d.
As I have said, we look 10 the judiciary
to discourage circuitous rnctbods and dubious
practices, 10 net fairly and openly, and 10 sec
that justice is done without evasion or equivocation. I think 1 have said enough 10 make
you understand that I do not believe it is
right that men xvbo are expected 10 keep
people straight should be asked t0 swallow
a Bill which reduces their compensation by
circuitous and devious wnys.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
I do not
wish 10 allow the remarks of the honourable senator frorn La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau)
10 go unanswered. I tbought there would be
s0 many eager 10 rcp]y 10 hirn that I shou]d
flot bave t0 do so, but in that I bave been
disappointed. Il is tnie tbal as respects the
judges and rnembers of the permanent force,
other Ihan enlisled men, tbe sarne object is
being altained by a method different from
tbe one adopted in 'the Bill before us. Il
does not follow, however. because one route
is taken in tbe case of civil servants generally,
and another route in the case of the judges
and members of tbe permanent force, that the
second route is circuitous or devious or

MAY 24, 1932
crooked while the first is straight. One is
just as straight and direct as the other. In
the case of the Civil Service the method
adopted is that of deduction; in the case of
the judges and others, it is a tax. There is
nothing devious about a tax; it is nlot a
back-door or side-stairs method; it is perfectly direct and open, and I do nlot think
it will engender in the mind of any iudge any
sinister thoughts or feelings that will affect
bis conduct in the future.
The question is, which is the better method
to adopt? It was thýouglit by the Government-I do not know that the reaoons behind it are very formrid'able-tbat there shoruld
be a distinction drawn betwecn rnembPrs
of the judiciary, meimbers cf the perma2nent force and lieutenant-governors, on the
one hand, and members of the Civil Service
on the other. Certainly no judge would
object to being called a public servant-no
onc presumes that he would-but I do believe
1hat he would object to being called a civil
servant, or being classified with civil servants
when bis salary or any other feature of bis
relations with the Govern.ment is under reviýýw.
A civil servant is a man who, is uzider the
direction of the Governient; a judge is in no
sense under the direction o>f -the Government.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would flot senators
be in the same class as judges?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps so,
but we are quite ready to be classified in
any way at alI, as long as we are known as
servants. We do not care whetbe-r we are
called civil servants or public servants or any
other name, but wben we are treating of
others we observe a punctiliousness that we do
not observe wîth relation to ourselves. The
judge is in a place apart. It is true that be
is appointed by the Crown, but he is in
no sense a civil servant.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
He is a public
servant.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, but the
Bill before us refers to civil servants only.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: It defines "member
of the public service."~
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
It deals
generally with those known as civil servants.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: We are not civil
servants.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no, and
that is why the term "member of the public
service" is used, but I do not think it is well
to include the .iudiciary in that sphere and
group. The .iudiciary decide between the

457

Crown and the subject, as well as between
subjeet and subjeet. Their course of conduct
and their duties are defined by statute and
tradition. They are under no superior authority save that of the superior courts, and even
as respects those snperior courts they are
subject in no way to direction, but only to
review. It was with this in mind that the
Governnxent felt that while perhaps it was
justifiable to make a deduction in the case
of the judges, it ghould be done by way of
a tax rather tban by withholding part of the
salary fixed by law. In the carrying out of
this principle only as mucli as is paid by the
Crown in the right of Canada is subi ect to
taxation under the Bill, not what may be
received from other sources.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What about the
military?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: They are
placed in the same position for the reason
that a certain quasi-contractual relationship
exists between the force and the Government.
There are differences of opinion *as to the
exact nature of that quasi-contractual relationship.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: 'It is the force of the
Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the force
of the Government, because it is with the
Government that the men enlist.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Not with Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: With the Government, as constituted by Parliament.
Because of th-at distinction they are put in
the same class. There is no Bill to apply the
tax to the lieutenant-governors, for reasons
which are quite distinct, but it does apply
to judges and mednbers of the permanent
force other than enlisted men.
There may be considerable question as to
the propriety of even a tax in relation to
the Benceh. It was argued in another place,
and very aibly argued, that the judge is not
represented in Parliament, that he has no
vote, that he is not a citizen in the ordinary
sense of the term, and that lie should not lie
su'bject to taxation without re.presentation.
Well, lis salary is increased by Parliament,
and I do not know why it should not be taxed
by Parliament under very special circumstances-and the only justification for this
Bill is that the circumstances are very exceptional. It i.s not wise to interfere lightly
with judicial emoluments; certainly it is very
unwise so to legislate that the judge will feel
that lie is in some way subject to the favour

SENATE
of either the Government or Parliament. His
position must be above interference from
either. But many judges were of the view
that they ought to share in the common
sacrifice at this time. Had it been left entirely to voluntary action, many would have
shared, but the sharing would not have been
universal and a sense of unfairness would
have remained. Hence, this method is taken.
I think the explanation I have given is adequate. At least, it is the best I can give. I
would not have objected to the measure had
it been in the first place as outlined by the
honourable gentleman from La Salýle (Hon.
Mr. Bureau).
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Why not make it like
that now?
I do not
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
think it should be made so now, for the reason
that it would be only running back to another
road leading to the same goal. Both Bills
Lave been passed through one House now.
Furthernore, they are taxation measures, and
I think this House should be very carefulit has to be very careful, in fact-in dealing
with taxation measures. I think it would be
most unbecoming on the part of the Senate
to refer taxation measures back to the other
House in order to reach, not a different or
bigher goal, but the sane one, by a method
which is no better than the one proposed, if it
is indeed as good.
I have seen it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stated somewiere that although Parlianient
has the right to increase the indemnities or
salaries of judges, it is questionable whether
it has the right to reduce them. Has the
right honourable gentleman any clear answer
to that contention?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not
understand that the former Minister of Justice in the other House argued that Parlianient had not the legal right either to reduce
or to tax. He did argue against the propriety
of either course; he took the- ground that
there should be no taxation or reduction.
Certainly be would never take the ground that
there should be no increase, because he has
been a member of Parliaments, and I think of
Governments, which have granted incrca.-e.
As to Parliament's legal right, I do not think
there is any question. We can tax as we like,
and we can discriminate as we like. There
rmay be ground for questioning the wisdom of
what we are doing, but there is no ground
for questioning the legality.
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was not personally questioning the legality, for in 1922 I
brought in a Bill, which emanated from the
Department of Justice, giving the Minister of
Justice the right to suspend the salary of a
judge in certain circumstances.
I do not
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
recall that legislation. I think that would be
a pretty dangerous enactment.
I shall give my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable friend the reference in a
minute or so.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: While the honourable
gentleman is looking up his reference, may I
point out that if we pass this legislation we
shall be making it possible to levy an interest
charge against a judge, and, if he does net
pay, to have lis goods and chattels seized,
and sold by a sheriff. I think it would be just
as polite to the judges to call them publie
servants as to nake them subject to such an
indignity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But such an
indignity oould be suffered by any judge, or
anyone else, under the Small Debts Act of
any province.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: If the judges were
called public servants the Government could
retain the money, and there would never be
any possibility that the judges might default
and be sued.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

That is right.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Very humane.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The legislation
to which I referred is chapter 29, 12-13
George V, an Act to amend the Judges Act.
Section 26A, subsection 1, reads:
Any judge of the Supreme Court of Canada
or of the Exchequer Court of Canada, or of
any superior court in Canada, or any Local
Judge in Admnira!lty of the Exchequer Court of
Canada. or any judge of a county court, who is
founi by the Governor in Council, upon report
of the Minister of Justice. to have become, by

reason of age or infirmity. incapacitated or disabled from the due execution of his office, shall,
notwithstanding anything in this Act contained,
cease to be raid or to receive or to be entitled
to receive any further salary. if the facts
respecting the incapacity or disability are first
made the subject of enquiry and report in the
manner bereinafter provided, and the judge
is given reasonable notice of the time and place
appointed for the enquiry and is afforded an
opportunity by himself or his counsel of being
beard thereat and of cross-examination of
witnesses and of adducing evidence on his own
behalf.

MAY 24, 1932
Provision is made for a commission of
inqlîiry, in subsection 2, and subsection 3
reads:
Nevertheless His Majesty shall by Letters
Patent under the Great Seal of Canada grant
unto any judge who bas been so found by -the
Governior in Council to be incapacitated or
disabled by reason of age or infirmity as aforesaid, and who resigns bis office, the annuity
which hie might have received if hie had
resigned at the time wben hie ceased to he
entitled to receive any further salary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will forgive
the honoura-ble senator for being a party to
tbat legislation, for 1 think it is ail right.
It prcvides that in case of infirmity or age,
where a judge is found by judicial inquiry to
be incapable, his salary is to be discontinued.
However, tbat applies onily to certain classes
of judges, because Parliament is poweriess to
do anytbing of the kind with respect to the
judges of certain higher courts, exclusive of
tbe Supreme Court of Canada.
Wbat I have stated is, I tbink, a ve¶'y good
principle. The fartber we can keep judges
away from the iminediate interference of either
governments or Parliament, the better for the
Bencb and the nation.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I should like to
ask the rigbt honourable leader whether rural
mail carriers or contractors are affected by
this Bill?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEL': Tbe defmnition
wijil govern. 1 th-ink tbat tbey operate under
contraet, and, that there wilî ibe no deduction.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND READNG

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second readîng of Bill 41, an Act to amend
tbe Banlcruptcy Act.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Are we going into
Committee?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I think we
should. There are very extensive amendments.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: The amendments are so numerous that it is bardly worth
while to give a general explanation on second
reading.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I will attexnpt
to give a summa-ry of the Bjill, by .way of an
historical review. HonouraJble members, of
course, know that under the British Nortb
America Act the suibject of bankruptcy and
insolven.cy is exclusively .within Dominion
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that, no bankruptcy or insolvency legisiation was passed in

459

the Dominion for a very considerable time
after Confederation; or, to be more aocurate,
certain legislation was *passed, I believe in
1876, found to be not acceptable, and repealed.
F'romn that date on, the provinces made certain
provisions which were known under various
namnes, but were really bankruptcy legisiation.
This provincial assuxnption of jurisdiction was
generally acquiesced in on the part of ail' concerned, and the Dominion, by lassitude,
surrendered to tbe provinces wbat was really
its own jurisdiction. In 1921, however, bankruptcy legisiation was passed by tbe Dominion
Parliament for the second time-týhe first time
in many years. It had, of course, a Dominion scope. It has been under trial now for
ten or eleven years. There are differences of
opinion as to how tbis Dominion legislation
has operated. The cbief objection to it bas
been that it is too expensive, that in too
many cases the residue of the bankrupt's
property bias been absorbed in tbe fees of
trustees, inspectors and lawyers, and that tbe
creditors bave had very bare bones by the
time those three classes of persons have got
through.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hear some
of the perennial creditors in the House say
"Hear, bear." As a debtor, I of course know
nothing about that.
The object of the Bill is to overcome those
features and to, render the Act more simple
and inexpensive in operation. One of the chief
objects of the Bill is the establishment of the
position of Superintendent of Bankruptcy.
Wbether it is the intention to have a separate
man fill this office, or to add the work of the
office to tbe duties of an officiail such as the
Superintendent of Insurance, I do not know. I
hope there will not be any substantial increase in tbe servi-ce, or in the cost, in that
regard. It is felt, however, tbat the existence
of the office and the supervision by this
incunibent will be such as to exercise over
trustees in bankruptcy, inspectors, and the
like, a control tbat wilh result in diminution
of the costs that have been entailed in the
past.
Quebec farmers are wholly omitted from the
measure. There are provisions with respect to
the omission of otber farmers, w-here the
residue of the estate is less tban SMO.
A special committee of seventeen members
of tbe House of Commons was appointed to
consider tbe Act. It beld sittings at which
were 'beard many who are interested in the
legislation, including representatives of wholesale and retail associations, boards of trade,
and tbe like. Tbe committee made a unani-

SENATE

460

mous report, which is realiy the present Bill.
Consequently,. fot only was the Bill passed
by the other House, but it received the
unanimous support of a committee which, I
must say, did exceedingiy careful work.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
rigbt honourable gentleman how far hie thinks
we should go in diseriminating with respect
to farmers in one part of the country? I
thought the laws werc supposed to be made
to apply to cverybody.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Prior to the
coming into force of the Bankruptcy Act in
1921, the Quebec statute relating to insolvcncy
excluded from its operation non-.traders, that
is, farmers and wage-c-arners. As I st.ated a
littie wh'iie a-go, provincial legisiation controlled the whoiýe subje'ct of banknsptcy for a
long period up teo 1921. The Bankruptcy Act
of 1919 permits farmers anýd wage-ea-rners te
make assigniments, but exeludes thema from

from the Act. These representations were
made by the provincial Minister of Agriculture and by representatives of one or two

however, were made with reference to wageTherefore, the committee decided

against adopting the old Quebec rule of
excluding non-traders. An alternaitive suggestion was made to the chairman of the
to empower the Lieutenantcommittee
GovernoT in Council of any province to
exelude farmers in bis province. This suggestion, bowever, was flot approvcd by the
chairman, and was flot presented to the committee. I am flot able to say whetber the
provision of this clause is generally acceptable, bu-t I bave heard that, notwithstanding
the unanimous representations that were
made, some dissatisfaction bais been express-ed.
Honourabie members will therefore see that
Quebec farmers are excluded in deference
to the desire of the Minister of Agriculture
of that province, and of certain societies
specially interested in the matter. Also it
will be borne in mind that, as I bave stated,
prior to the Act of 1919 both farmers and
non-traders were exempt, and that under the
1919 Act they were exempt from the compulsory provisions, but were permitted to
assign.
1 think it was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
very unfortunate that this modification was
put into the Act of 1919, and that tbe word
"trader" was made to include farmers and
even members of the liberal professions.
Riglit Hon. 'Mr MEIGHEN.

Prior to that time our farming people in
Quebec-and I am quite sure the sanie is truc

thought of themselves as business people who
might in certain circumstances reauh a point

wonder to what extent it was safe to advance
money to farmers, and the credit of fairmers
generally was restricted. Many people wondered why this was so. The explanaliÔn was
that the new iaw enabied those who were
pcrhaps less conscientious than thcy should
be, to, obtain a discharge of their dehts and
make a fresh start. This created considerable
perturbation in the Province of Quebec, and

from the operation of this Act.
My rigbt honourable friend has said that
the costs were mounting, and when liquidation
was eompletcd there remained very little for
the creditors. That is quite truc. I do not
k-now to wbat extent this legisiation wvill cure
that evil; but there is one cvii that it wil
not cure, and that is the immorality. It ailows
a number of people to free themselves of
their obligations with a view to regaining their
virginity.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
rend tbe second time.
ÇONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate ivent into Committce on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Gillis in the Chair.
Section 1 xvas agreed to.
On section 2--dcfinitions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That jlist extends the definition of a creditor to include
the hoider of a negotiable note.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course I do
not know liow this would work in its daily
application to the operations of persons who
have obtained credit fromn their banks. Such
debtors will bave given collateral to the bank.
The clause now rends:
"Secured ereditor" means a person holding a
mortgage, hypothec, p1ledge, charge, lien or
privilege, on or against the propcrty of the
debtor. or any part thereof, as security for a
debt due or accruing duc to him from the
debtor, or a person whosec daimn is bascd upon,

MAY 24, 1932
or sectired by, a negotiable instrument held as
collateral security and upon which the debtor
je only indirectly or secondarily liable.
That person or institution will have to
appraise the value of the security in hand,
which may fluctuate from day to day.
Riglit Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. That is
the way it was in Manitoba. The definition
of a secured creditor is amplified to include
the holder of a negotiable instrument held as
collateral. Hitherto such a holder has ianked.
as an ordinary creditor, but with the additional
riglit to recover on a negotiable instrument.
The difference is that now hie is ta be placed
in the rank of a secured creditor.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Can hie as holder determine the value of the security?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHE.N: I arn afraid
1 cannat answer that. In Manitoba, wbere 1
practised law, he had to put a value upon
that instrument.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And that value held?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That value
held, but the other man-that is, the assignee
-could say, "Very well, I will take it at that
value"; so he had every reason not ta put it
too high or too low.
Han. Mr. BUREAU: While we are on section 2, I desire to add an amendment to
paragraph y, after iii. For two cansecutive
sessions a Billlias been presented here, and
has passed the Senate unanimou'sly, providing
that the locality of a debtor in the Province
of Quebec should be the locality within, the
judicial district in which lie carnies
on business.'
Fallowing the discussions in the other House,
I see that exception was taken on the ground
that, under authority of the Act, the Province
of Quebec had been divided by the Governor
in Council into banikruptcy divisions. In the
.argument that took place the speakers ail said
that twenty.4lve, complete urginizations would
have to be created if the locality of the dehtor
-were the judicial district wherein lie carried
on bis business. In the course of the discussion it was stated by the Minister of
Justice that in the framing of 'this Bill it had
been borne in mind that the Province of Quebec was divided into twelve bankruptcy
districts, and these were aIl fully organized
and equipped with the proper machinery with
-whieh to carry on ail necessary proceedings,
bath in receiving petitions and in administering bankruptcy laws.
I desire to submit an amendment substituting for the "j udicial district," of which
there are twenty-five in the province,' the
wards, "bankruptcy division." I wauld therefore move that after the figure 2 the fallowing
be added:

In the Province of Quebec the bankruptey
division wherein the debtor carnies an hjs business, as defined by the Governor General in
Cotuncil.
T-hat doas away with all the objections which
have been raised about making it the judicial
district wherein the debtor carnies on bis business.
May 1 be allowed ta quote the explanation given by the Miniater of Justice:
Mr. Guthrie; If I understand correctly, I
amn afraid the suggestion will rather complicate
the operation of the Bankruptcy Act.
It lad bcen suggested at that time that the
prothonotaries of the variaus Superior Courts
sbould act as registrars. He thouglit that
would coniplicate the Act. He went an:
This Act bas been drawn in pursuance of the
idea that thent, were in the Province of Quebec
tivelve bankruptcy divisions.
Now, I suggest that instead of making tlie
judicial district, as defin'ed by the statutes of
the Province of Quebec, the basis of my
,amendment, as heretofore, we insert the words,
"bankruptcy division as defined by the Governor General in Council."

Honourable gentleHon. Mr. LITTLE:
men, the provisions of this Bill undoubtedly

creditors than they have had in the past, yet
I think that this question of the taxation of
costs might very well roceive further conAs the procedure runs at the
sideration.
present time, a final statement is prepî1r.d
and submitted to the inspectors of the estate;
a copy is then sent to all creditors. The
inspectors may refuse to sign the statement,
or any creditor may raise objections to the
court. The inspectors, being in close touch
with the character of the business which is
being handled by the trustee, are surely in
a position in the great majority of cases to
say whether the costs of winding-up are
reasonable. If the bills must be taxed in all
instances, the cost undoubtedly will be increased.
Does the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
honourable gentleman suggest that there
should be taxation only in certain cases?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: If there is no objection the taxation should not be compulsory.
In many

lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
The remuneration is fixed by the court, and the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Little) thinks that
in certain cases where the inspectors agree
there should be no application to the court.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: To have the costs
taxed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: An appropriate amendment rnight be ail right there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would have

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: There mnight

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In many cases
within my knowledge the inspectors were
appointed because they were creditors, or
represented institutions that were considerably
involved, and after the parties whom they
represented had been satisfied they showed no
further interest. There is perhaps not as
much assurance of security as my honourable
friend thinks in giving that discretion to the
inspectors.

On section 2 -definitions (reconsidered):
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: The honourable senator from La Salle (Hon. M.r. Bureau)
suggests an amendment. A reference to the
original Act will show that section 2 is a
long series of defiuitions, and section 2 of the
Bill contains a number of amendments to
section 2 of the Act. We have already considered the definition of "secured creditor,"
which is to be -paragraph ii of section 2 of
the Act. The honourable gentleman from La
Salle wishes to amend paragraph y, which
precedes paragraph ii, and whiech reads:
"Lo-a-lity of a debtor,"' whether a bankrupt
or assignor, mneans
(W the principal place where the debtor has
carried on business during the year immediately
preceding the date of the presentation against
hima of a bankruptcy petition or the making by
him of an authorized assignment;
(ii) the place where the debtor has resided
during the year immediately preceding the date
of the presentation against him of a bankruptcy

petition or the making by him of an authorized
assignment; or

(iii) in cases flot comaing within i or ii, the
place where the greater portion of the property
of such debtor is aituate.
I arn reading slowly, for I find it a little
difflouit Vo f ollow. Now the honourable

gentleman from La Salle desires to add the
following as paragraph iv:

In the Province of Quebec, the bankruptcy
division iwherein the debtor carnies on his business, as defined by the Governor in Comncil.
That is Vo say, whereas in other provinces
the "locality of a debtor" will mean cither
the principal place where he bas carried on
his business £or a year before his assignment,
or where he has lived a year before his
assignment, or if he bas not donc either, where
the greater portion of his property is situated,
in the Province of Quebec it will mean the
bankruptcy division in which he ýcarrnes on his
business, such division being defined by the
Governor Gieneral in 'Council. I suggest that
this clause stand, along with other clauses
which have been allowed to stand, until
I
can explore the whole effeet of it. One would
need Vo read that amendment in association
with a great many clauses before one could

SENATE

feel quite safe in adopting it. I do net know
just what difficulty the honourable gentleman
wishes to overcome, because as the law stands
the locality of a debtor is clearly defined as
being either where he lived for a year before
his assignment, or where lie carried on business
for a year before bis assignment, or if he
did not either live or carry on business at any
place during the preceding year, then within
the province where the greater portion of his
property is situated. I am not clear why that
would not apply to Quebec as well as to any
other provinece.

On the hearing of the application the court
shall take into consideration the report of the
trustee, and may either grant or refuse an
absolute order of discharge or suspend the
operation of the order for a specified time, or
grant an order of discharge subject to any
conditions with respect to any earmngs or incone which may afterwards become due to the
bankrupt or autborized assignor or with respect
to his after-acquired property.

In the meanHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
time I may tell my riight honourable friend
that it bas been suggested that it would net
be a bad thing te amend the Bill in such a
way as te postpone the bankrupt's right to
discharge for from twelve to twenty-four
months. There are people, and they are quite
numerous, who have abandoned their property
and paid ten cents on the dollar, or nohing. and have then gone to their creditors
and succeeded, sometimes through a third
party, in obtaining their consent te a discharge from bankruptcy. They then appear
a few months later fully selvent, only to become bankrupt again within a year or two.
This has occurred more than once in the
good. but not pious, city of Montreal, and
the suggestion bas been made that it might
be well to keep the bankrupt waiting some
twelve or twenty-four months for his discharge.

That is a very wide discretion.
2. The court shall refuse the discharge in all
cases where the bankrupt or authorized assignor
lias committed any offence under this Act or
anv offence connected with his bankruptcy or
assignment or the proceedings thereunder, and
shal: on proof of any of the facts nentioned
in the next succeeding section, either
(a) refuse to discharge; or
(b) suspend the discharge for a period of
not less than two years: provided that the
period may be less than two years if the only
fact proved of those hereinafter mentioned is
that his assets are not of a value equal to fifty
cents in the dollar on the amount of his
unsecured liabilities; or
(e) suspend the discharge until a dividend of
not less than fifty cents in the dollar bas been
paid to the creditors; or
(d) require the bankrupt or assignor, as a
condition of his discharge, to consent to judgment being entered against him by the trustee
for any balance or part of any balance of the
debts provable under the bankruptcy or assignment which is not satisfied at the date of the
diseharge. such balance or part of any balance
of the debts to be paid out of the future earnings or after-acquired property of the bankrupt
or¯ assignor in such manner and subject to such
conditions as the court may direct; but execution shall not ho issued on the judgment without leave of the court, which leave may be given
on proof tbat the bankrupt or assignor bas,
since bis discharge, acquired property or incorne
available towards paynent of his debts.
Then the court may modify that after a

gentleman opposite is that the discretion be
taken away frem the court, and that the
bankrupt be absolutely disentitled until a
specified time. I should not like to take the
responsibility of admitting such an amendment, because it is clearly out of harmony
with the principle of the Act. I should think
the discretion of the court is good enough,
because any absence of bona fides would
undoubtedly disentitle the bankrupt te a discharge, and the court would exercise the right
te withhold it. I know that the abuse is
tremendous. Honourable gentlemen may have
heard of the partnership agreement under
which it was provided that in the event of
bankruptcy there should be an equal division
of the profits.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: At the present time the court has power to defer the
granting of the discharge. Section 142 of the
Act reads as follows:

I know of cases

in which the circumstances, and the representations te the court, have been such that

in granting a discharge. But those who are
in the very centre of things, creditors who
appear on many listsI might mention the
banks generally-have seen the performances
of men who succeeded in getting their discharge very easily. Such creditors have been
wondering whether what I have suggested
would not cure the evil.
Have I not heard that there would be a
general revision of the whole Bankruptcy Act
shortly?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. This
revision is pretty general. It has been brought
about in the following way. The Canadian
Bar Association appointed a committee composed of men specially interested in bankruptcy law. That committee, if I remember
rightly, was headed by Mr. Grundy, of Winnipeg, who, as everyone knows, is exceedingly
well versed in this subject. A report was
brought in, making certain recommendations,
and, on the acceptance of those recommendations, the Bar Association prepared a
Bill and submitted it to the department.
This Bill is by no means a transcript of the
Bar Association Bill, but in the main the
suggestions were adopted. I do not think
there is any general revision in contemplation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is a very
great improvement on the Act as it stood.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The suggestion of the honourable senator from La Salle
(Hon. Mr. Bureau) is to add to the definition
of "locality of a debtor." It now means the
place where he did business for a year before
his bankruptcy, or the place where he resided
for that year, or, third, if he did not either
reside or do business in the province, the
place where the greater portion of his property is situated. The honourable senator
desires to have added a proviso that the
locality of the debtor in the Province of
Quebec shall mean the bankruptcy division
wherein the debtor carries on his business, as
defined by the Governor General in Council.
Clearly, the purpose of his amendment is to
retain the business of administration, especially its legal features, in the loèality in which
the debtor did business or in which he lived,
in so far as it is circumscribed by a bankruptcy division. I am told that the County
of Gaspé, for example, is a bankruptcy division. The purpose of the honourable gentleman is to see that the business is done in
that county, and to combat the tendency
towards centralization in Quebec, Montreal,
Sherbrooke, and, I presume, Three Rivers.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
Three Rivers.

465
Unfortunately, not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I feared not,
because of the interest of my honourable
friend. The honourable senator will remember that an honourable gentleman in another
House, in whom he has very great confidence,
the former Minister of Justice, argued strongly
the other way.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I think he only asked
if there had been any petitions against it
from Montreal and Quebec.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am informed that he argued quite strongly. I do
not know very much about it. My opinion
is that locality is significant principally from
two points of view. As I proceed to discuss
them I would ask the House to remember
that this is pretty largely a question of the
patronage of lawyers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt it. Of
course there is a tendency towards these large
centres; but a man who fails in an outlying
district kas most of his creditors around him,
and they complain very much of being obliged
to travel a hundred miles or two hundred
miles to reach the court to attend to their
interests. I think that is the main argument,
but as the honourable member from La Salle
(Hon. Mr. Bureau) is here, he can speak for
himself.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: It is provided by the
Bankruptcy Act that you cannot sue a man
who has presented his petition; but if, before
putting in his petition, he runs away from the
bankruptcy division or the district where he
carries on business, rumors are circulated, and
three or four actions may be taken against
him. Those actions are dismissed with costs,
and the poor creditors, who did not know the
man had assigned, have to pay the costs. If
he had assigned within either the bankruptcy
division or the judicial district, they would
be in a position to know it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand the present Act, a man cannot make an
assignment effective outside of his own bankruptcy division; but if a majority of the
creditors so elect, the administration may be
transferred elsewhere. It is not a matter of
choice with him. In the case of Boilly vs.
McNulty, in the Supreme Court of Canada,
it was held that Quebec comprises one bankruptcy division, and that for the purposes of
a petition in bankruptcy the whole province
constitutes the locality of the debtor. In that
particular case a creditor in Montreal had a

41767-30
REVISED EDITION

466

SENATE

petition against a dýebtor in Roberval, and the
Supreme Court held that the judge in Montreai had jurisdiction. That was flot a voluntary assign-ment, but a case in which the
creditor had to petition against the debtor.
In the case of a voluntary assignment the
debtor has to assign in his own district.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: In any case you have
to, amend section 4.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You are defining the locality of a delytor, and you say
that for ail purposes you want that te be in
his own bankruptcy division. That does flot
give much consideration to the creditors.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: But I intýend te move
that seotion 4 be amended as follows:
In the Province of Quebec, subject te the
conditions hereinafter specifled, if a debtor
commits an act of hankruptcy a creditor may
present te the court having jurisdiction over the
lecality of the debtor a hankruptcy petitien.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is how
the henourable gentleman would amcnd section 4 of the preseet Act, but that has ne
regard for the creditors at ail. The creditors may ail be in Montreal and the debtor
in 'Gaspé, and I arn told that they may wait
six months for a judge.
Baekrupt cy is
different from a case of an ordinary dlaim
by one man against another, wherc each party
is solvent. There the time of disposition is
net se important, but where one of the parties
is bankrupt it is very important te get an
early disposition. 1 think it is asking a great
deal to expeet the creditors, ne matter where
they may be, te go te tbe debtor's rcsidence
and wait for a .iudge before they can get
disposition of their case.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: This is special legislation. When a man wants te get a petitien
in bankruptcy he bas bis agent at the locality
of the debtor, just as he bas a representative
there for the sale of goods. The right benourable gentleman cited a case in peint, Beilly
vs. McNulty. This man Boilly lived in
Chicoutimi and ail bis creditors lived there
aise, but he had one creditor in MontrealRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How could
he have one there if they ahl lix ed in Chicoutimi?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

split hairs; I will say the majerity of them
lived there. One of them toek action in
Montreal and those in Chicoutimi made a
motion te have the matter brought back

application the case was decided. It was held

purposes. I think we may feel sure that
if this amendment were made te section 4,
restricting the .iurisdiction to the court having
jurisdiction ever the locality of the debtor,
the big creditors in Meetreal would have
agents in every bankruptcy division. Ceesequently there would be ne delay in disposing of cases. If the bankruptcy divisions were
made and defined by the Governer je Council we could assume that alI the machieery
te do the work quickly would be in each
division. I think the ameedment is fair aed
I should like it te go through.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
You dannet have the machinery unless there is a
judge, and my information is that there is
often net a judge available at ail.
My
henourable friend's ameedmneet would compel
crediters, ne matter where they are, te satisfy
the local feeling of the district wliere the
debtor happens te reside, even though there
may be ne facilities of a court in that
district.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
There is a judge
in every district.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: 1 know there

how often dees a judge sit in Gaspé?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Whenever there is
reason for him te sit whcre he is assigeed
lie does so. If the lawyers xwant himî for
chamber work or anything else, they write
him and he gees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And there is
ne delay at ail?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: No delay.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: One bas te he
ie praetice in a province te be familiar with
what gees on there, but I am told it is net
always possible te get a judge quickly. There
is an immediate application for an interim
receiver after the assigement. Now, it would
seemn te me a most ineconvenient thing te
have te get inte ýcommunication ýwith the Chief
Justice te ask for a judge te hold court, at
some time in the futureHon. Mr. BUREAU: That is net necessary, for the Chief Justice weuld already have
assigned a judge te that district. There is
always a judge a.ssigeed te every district.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that
eut in .some smadl places in the West you
cannot get a judge te sit on a minute's notice,
or on a day's or week's notice--SI doubt if
even on a month's notice, in some instances.
I do net see how expeditieus disposition of this
nisi prius work can be obtained if this amendment is iesisted upon.

MAY 24, 1932
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: I may remind the
right honourable leader that the principle
advocated by my honourable friend from La
Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) has already been
sanctioned by this House twice-at least
onceHon. Mr. BUREAU: Twice, unanimously.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: In addition to the
two large judicial districts of Montreal and
Quebec, there are in the Province of Quebec
the districts of Sherbrooke and Three Rivers,
to which permanent judges are assigned.
All the other districts receive visits from
judges who are assigned by the Chief Justice,
and when they have completed their work
there they go to Quebec or Montreal, where
there is of course more judicial business to
be done. It is not fair for the debtor that he
should be dragged from his district to, let
us say, Montreal or Quebec. The debtor is
entitled to be judged by his peers in his own
district. I may tell my right honourable
friend that Sir George Etienne Cartier-of
whom he is rightly so great an admirerestablished in the old Province of Quebec
the system under which judges resided at the
shire town. It was a great thing -for the people
to have the bishop, the seigneur and the judge
residing at certain places, where naturally
they became the leaders of socipty. But now
that system has been abolished and instead
judges are sent around from one district to
another. I am not sure that justice has not
suffered on this account. I have already
spoken on this matter on another occasion.
Of course, I know there are arguments in
favour of the present practice. People say
that if you have the same judge in one district
all the time there will be no improvement in
the jurisprudence of that district. On the
other hand, there is the social order of things,
which ought to be considered. Under the old
regime, the one established by Cartier, we
had a splendid administration of justice in our
province.
What is being asked by my honourable
friend from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau), who
has one of the largest practices in our province,
and has had a great deal of experience, is that
we revert in the matter of assignments of
judges, in bankruptcy cases, to the old regime.
If we did so, every debtor would appear before
the courts of his own judicial district. I
appeal to the sense of justice of the right honourable leader of the House, that it is not
fair thait a debtor, whose creditors are mostly
in Gaspé, should be dragged to the far-away
district of Montreal or Quebec, at great expense, simply because a large creditor happens
te be there.
41767--3O

467

There is another point worthy of consideration. When the question was debated in
another place, a member who has a large
practice in a rural section of Canada appcaled
to the Government to respect the prejudiceyou may call it prejudice if you wish-of the
rural sections of the Province of Quebec, as
well as of those of other provinces, in favour
of decentralization. There is to-day a cry
all over the country to get back to the land,
and we must do something to support that
movement. But if we take away from the
rural sections what is necessary to keep them
in harmony with the rest of Canada, we defeat
that movement. If we take the business from
rural districts and concentrate it in large cities
like Montreal or Quebec, we do an injury
to the rural sections. I rise in support of the
amendment proposed by my honourable
friend, not because I was a member for Gaspé
for so many years, but because I believe the
principle of the amendment, which has been
adopted twice by this House, is sound. The
honourable gentleman has brought the matter
before us on two previous occasions in the
form of a Bill, which was passed unanimously
here, but was defeated in the other House.
Now we have a chance, by amending this
Bill,-to have the principle incorporated in the
law.
Hon. G. PARENT: I desire to support
what has been said by the honourable gentlemen from La Salle (Hon. Ir. Bureau) and
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux). I have
been practising law for a number of years,
and apparently I have advised my clients very
well, for none of them have gone into bankruptcy. It does seem to me that it is unfair
to bring a person from Gaspé, for instance, to
Montreal to protect his interests. I sincerely
believe that if a debtor is sued he ought to
be tried in his own judicial district. To a
certain extent it is possibly true that judges
are not always promptly available in some of
the districts, but that is not so generally true
as to be of very much importance. Every
time that a judge is needed for an important
matter, one is available.
I repeat that it seems to me unfair that a
man whose locality is in the district of Gaspé,
or any other judicial district, should be tried
in Montreal or Quebec, for instance. Any
legal matter concerning him should be fought
out in his own judicial district. I sincerely
believe that the amendment proposed by the
honourable member from La Salle is sound,
and I submit it ought to be accepted.

is correct, and the bonounable senator from
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) will understand
my reluctance te place my views aga.inst those
of that bonourable gentleman in a matter
concernng the administration of law in the
Province of Quebec. I know it is against the

MAY 24, 1932
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On whaît section?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: On seiction 29, particularly in view of the fact bhat there are 90
many bright legal luminaries on the whole
Bill. But 1 do feel that srnne means should
be found. Possibly 'I could empliasize rny
point by suggesting a hypothetical case
before the bankruptcy courts. A general
merchant in a smati town fails, with assets
of $4,000 or $5,000, and liabilities within a
thousand dollars or so of th-at amount.
There are wliolesale jobbers of grocerles,
dry goods, boots and slioes and possibly
hardware intcrcsted, along with several smaller
creditors in specialty lines. A meeting of
the creditors is held and in the ordinary
course of business thrce inspectors will be
appointed, representing the grocery bouse,
the hardware and tbe dry goods house, or
the boot and shoc bouse. As a rule, these
gentlemen are in a good position to judgc and
advise as to what sbould be done fer the best
realization on the assels of the business. When
the 'business is finalHy wound uip .the officiei
recoeiver or trustee prepares a statement; this
goýes to, bhe inspeotors, and either i~tis signed
by them, or it may be reipudiaited by one or
more of them. W'bether it is agreeable f0 the
inspeetors or ofherwise, a copy of the statement goes to aIl 'the creditors, anid notice is
given that on a 'certain date the receiver wilil
appear before the 'court for bis release. It
seeme to me th-at in such a 'case as this there
is a.mple pro-teotion for the credifiors, and when
the amendmcnts which are proposed in this
Bill are put înto effeot there will be further
protection througb the appoinitment of the
Superintendent of Bankrup-bcy; and I think
that it is ra4her unreasonable to insist tbat
adi', these bisl of cets be taxed. I believe thaf
in such an instance as I have cited nothing ia
gainc.d thereby, but 'on the contrary the expenses are piled ur,, anid the creditors receive
less dividend t.ban t)hey wouhd otberwîse. I
would respectfuily requesf, therefore, thst the
ri-gbt honourable leader give some consideration to this point, in order -to Se if som-ething
cannot ba done.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The suggestion of the honourable senator from London
(Hon. Mr. Little) is received witb more favour,
I think, than he expects. As the law stands
now, every frustec's bill must be taxed unleas
the taxation is waived by the creditors or
the inspectors. If this Bill passes there must
be taxation in every case. That taxation will
entait more expense, of course, and will put
an additional burden on the taxing officers.
The only advantage of it will ha that if will

469

do away with the possibility of collusion between the trustee and the inspectors; and if
can be argued that that collusion is likcly to
be donc away with by reason of the presence
cf the Superintendent, who bas this control.
On the merits, I do not think there is very
much difference bctwecn the old measure and
tbe new one in this regard; but if the honourable senator from London will move that subsection 1 of section 29 be struck out, he will
affain his objeet. As long as honourable
senators understand clearly wbat is being donc,
I am prepared to take tlic judgmcnt of tbe
Committee on tbe question whctber we sbould
compel taxation in evcry instance as a means
of preventing collusion, or sbould trust to the
Superinfendent to sec that there is none.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should be disposcd, not to strike out the clause, but rather
f0 consider tcmpering it. The case tbe bonourable senator from London lias in mind is
one of a small estate where the costs could be
settled befween thec inspcctors>and the trustee
in order to avoid wbat the honourab-le gentleman regards as a large expenditure in fthe
taxing of the bill. Generally speaking, I sliould
be favourable to the taxing of bills, but I
should be sympathetie to an amendment excepting the smaîl estate, if we could draw
the line.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It secms f0
me thaf if the ides, of the honourable senator
from London (Hon. Mr. Little) werc carried
out, tlic matter would stand just about wbcrc
if sliould, be-cause then the buis would have
to be taxed unless flic inspectors waived the
taxation. I do not sce that we can get anytbing better than thaf unless we have compulsory taxation.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: There are two other
points fliat I should like te make. Tbc first
is tliat the great maj ority of assignmcnts are
assignments of small estatcs. Tlie ofber point
is thaf with the appointment of a Superintcndcnýt tliere will undoubtedly ho a very greaf
improvcment in the caliber of tlic trustees
liandling the estates.
IRigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the lionourable senator move te strike out?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: I would move that
subsection 1 of section 29 ho struck ouf.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has fthc riglit
bonourable gentleman the section of the Acf
as it stands?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The honourable senater from London. moves fo strike
ouf the first, four lines of section 29 of flic
Bill, which read as follows:

470

SENATE

Subsection 5 of section eighty-five of the said
Act is repealed and the following is substituted
therefor:"(5) The disbursements of a trustee shall in
all cases be taxed by the prescribed officer."
If the motion to strike out is carried, the law
will be as it was before, namely, that the disbursements of the trustee shall be taxed unless
taxation is waived by the inspectors. If we
are ready to leave the waiving of taxation to
the inspectors and to run the risk of collusion,
the motion should carry.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Little was negatived: contents, 14; noncontents. 14.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Yes. The
framework of the Act contemplates, not
one association with branches, but rather individual associations recording a certain
species, like hogs, for example, and all affiliated in the general organization. Provision
is made for the general organization to take
over the records and assets of any individual
association that fails to comply with the Act.

then there is the affiliated organization. The
registration is with the individual association,
but the organization is Dominion, not provincial.

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-short title:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
At the beginning of the session we seemed to have a
number of members who were interested in
the breeding of race-horses. I suppose they
will now enlighten us as to this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I may say,
in opening, that the explanatory notes to this
Bill are the best that I have seen in any Bill
submitted to the House since I have come
here.
The work has been carefully and
thoroughly done. I wish that all Bills were
accompanied by as carefully prepared notes
as this one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose the
right honourable gentleman knows that it was
this Chamber that insisted upon explanatory
notes to Bills. We had considerable difficulty
in bringing the House 'of Commons to a like
state of mind, but I think it is now admitted
by everybody that the innovation was a good
one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.

On section 4-limitation :
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- I eall the
attention of the honourable senator from
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke) to this section.
He will eee frorn it the general scheme that
bas been in operation. It says:
(1) NKot more than one association for each
distinct breed or a number of breeds of the
same species shall be incorporated under thie
Act.
(2) Save as provided by this Act when an
association for a distinct breed is incorporated
under this Act it shall be unlawfuI for any
other person, in respect of such breed, to conduct a book of record or to issue a certificate
of registration or any document purporting to
be a certificate of breeding.
Section 4 waa agreed to.
Sections 6 to 11, inclusive, were agreed to.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 should think
that if a judge had been retired between the
time of the taking effect of the revision as
haw, which was some date in 1M2, and the
pre.sent tîme, the effeet of this amendment
would be to ratify the payments that have
been made to him on the understandýing that
he was compelled to TeSign at seventy-five, the
same as oCher judges of the ss.me standing in
the other provinces. The fact is that every
such judge has been treated the same as
other judges of the same standing in the
other provinces, and the Bill simply validates
what has been done.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

On section 12-inquiries:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: These subsectiens are niew.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It provides for

upon the judges a special taxation? It seems

SENATE
ta me not so. It seems ta me rather a more
discreditable thing that Parliament should
seek ta accomplish by a roundabout, devious
method something which it is not willing ta
try ta accomplish openly and in a manly,
outepoken, straightforward way. That is to
me a sufficient objection ta justify my protesting against the passing of this Bill.
I do not know what to say upon the general
question of whether or not a judge is appointed under what is substantially a contract that he shall, as long as he continues
in office, receive a salary of not less than the
amount which is fixed by statute at the time
of his appointment. It is not exactly a contract in point of form. I suppose it amounts
ta that substantially, but whether or not it
is in point of law an actual contract, it certainly is something upon the strength of which
as an obligation of honour, if nothing else,
the judge accepts his position. And it is of
vital importance ta the country, ta every person in the country, that the position of the
judges should continue to be what for centuries it has been, a position of absolute independence of the Crown, and, in a sense, of
independence of Parliament.
Think for a moment wha't this Bill proposes
ta do. It is dealing with a very small minority
of our taxpayers. Out of a population of ten
millions, with hundreds of thousands of taxpayers, it is asking the Parliament of Canada
ta turn upon a trifling minority, in number
a few hundred, and say ta that minority,
"Because we are in a vast majority we
are going ta tax you ten per cent in addition
ta all the other items of taxation we put upon
you." It is anything but a manly thing, and
ta my mind it is a course of conduct so little
creditable that I protest against it and intend
ta vote against it, if I am given the opportunity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
senators, reluctant as I ama ta take responsibility as a member of the Government for
even this special taxation on judges, I must
dissociate myself from the fervour of opposition expressed by the honourable senator
who bas just sat down. An analysis of his
remarks will fail, I think, ta reveal in the main
the soundness of his reasons, certainly of the
reasons for the bitterness of his protest.
His argument is, first, that it is a roundabout
way of taking money from a salary. I do not
see anything roundabout in it. I do not sec
anything circuitous nor backhanded. It is
choosing a method of direct 'taxation rather
than of direct deduction. One is just as
straightforward, as frank and open, as the
other. The first method is chosen merely because it does seem more appropriate treatHon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

ment of those occupying a position on the
Bench, that they should bc asked ta contribute by way of taxation rather than that
we, at the source, should deduct from their
remuneration as fixed by statute. I do not
know that I have any preference for this over
the other method. At all events, I have no
preference that amounts ta anything worth
emphasizing. This method is as good as the
other. The result is the same, in any event,
and I fancy that anyone who takes umbrage
is really much more opposed ta the result
than he is ta the method.
The zeal of the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) is
mainly exercised because of the relation which
lie says was established by virtue of the
statute and the judges' acceptance of their
positions on the basis of the statute, though
he says that acceptance by the judges does
not amount ta a contract in form. His argument is that the relation is one of honour,
binding the state not ta make, by any means,
the remuneration of a judge less than it was
at the time he accepted office. There is a
degree of force ta the contention unless we
proceed ta ransack experience a little. If we
do that we find that this obligation of honaur,
if such it be, bas very often been invaded.
The whole argument about which the honurable gentleman from North York appears sa
enthusiastie would apply with equal force
against our income tax law. When a judge is
appointed his remuneration is stated ta be
a certain sum, but Parliament comes along
and imposes an incame tax on that remuneration, and thereby reduces the amount that the
statute fixed as the salary. Sa the imprecations
that the honourable senator hurls against this
Bill should first have been hurled against the
income tax law, for which many eminent men
in this country prayed before it came into
force, and which was opposed by no one who
claimed ta bc a champion of the Bench.
Then be says it is uninanly. Why? Because those who«n we are pursuing are only
the few, and we are many. We represent the
majority; they are a mere inconspicuous minority of our country, and for us ta chase them
down and tax them specially is unmanly, lie
says, on our part as legislaitors. Well, we did
nat pass unimanly legislation this afternoon
when we passed the Bill, which all applauded,
taking ten per cent off the salaries of the civil
servants; yet it was open ta 'precisely the
same argument. It is true that the Civil
Service represents sixty-five thousand, while
members of the Bench are perhaps less than
one; but the sixty-five thousand constitute a
negligible portion of the population of
Canada.

MAY 24, 1932
The fact is 'that the Bill merely places the
judges in the sanie position es ai those others
Who for ail thesle years. have been ini receiipt
of a cert.ain definite aimount from the Gaverament of Canada. It aske thems at this time,
when flnanciâl distreas prev>ils the world over,
and especially when reduoed living ooets really
add toi the value of their reiuuneraition, fia
share in, -the co<mmon sacrifice for the benefit
of their country. It asks them after many
have signifled a desire to do so, and, it asks
them because we believe the Bersch of this
country wil'l stand not. less seourely or less
authoritatively, but more securely and more
authoritatively, if they share in this sacrifice,
than if by any &eotof theirs, or weakness of
ours, they fail to do so. It is my flrm belief
thait tihe position of tihe judgee in the eyes
of the people of Canada wil be betâter because they have taken bheir part under legis.
lation tha-t applies to. ail in receipt of goverfiment salaries, than it would be if they stood
apart and occ&rpied a preferred -position
through this tume of distress.
Now, I have stated the case for tihe Bill
briefly, and I think fairly. There« are arguments against it. It is with reluctance tihat
the Bill ds brought ini. Certainly both Houses
of Parliament and certainly the people of
Canada would prefer flot to, interfere, hy
income tax, by deduction, or by special tax,
with, the position of the j'udges, because of
their reilationship to the body politic and to
our great poditical systera. But special o-ccasions bring apecia;l duties and special responsibilities, and I humbly submit this question ta tihe House.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Just one word. My
right honourable f riend tries to get &round
the point made by the honouraible senator
from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth),
that the legisiation we are now asked to pass
is unmanly, by stating that the senator from
North York has based his contention on the
fact that the judiciary are but very few. I
have discussed this question quite often with
my neighbour ta the right (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth), and have seen lis objection. H1e
objeots on this ground. This afternoon we
pa&-,ed a law wherein the judiciary and thie
military are exempted, and the reason for the
exemption, if we are ta believe rurnour, is fhat,
the Governanent felt it could not impose that
deduction decenfly or legally. This afternoon
my right honouraible frienid led us ta believe
bhat it was undignifed to classify tbeni as
public servants. But, whatever msa' have heen
the reasons for the exemption, those who presented. the flrst Bull, which we passed this
afternoon, ehould have known whetiher they

473

had the right ta a.pply that deduation or not,
and if they erred they ought ta have acknowledged the error by amending the Bill we
passed this afternoon, and not by hringing in
new legîsiation under the titIe of a war tax
measure.
The motion was agreed. ta, and the Bill was
read -the second time.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Carried on division.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: With the leave
of the Hbuse, it is movcd by Right Hon.
Senator Meighen that this Bill be now read

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Before the question is put, I bave an objection ta offer. 1
thought we were gaing inta Committee of the
Wholc House. 1 have no objection ta the
effeot that is sought in this section, but 1 take
objection to the phrasealogy wh!ich is used in

Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN: We are gainug
into Committee.
COINSIDERED IN GOMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went inta Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. L'Esperance in the Chair.
On section 1, new section 9A, subsection 1special income tax on certain salaries:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My objection is
flot ta the intention of this section, but ta the
phraseology, the form and the drafting of it.
An expression is used in the twelfth line ta
which I abject. Perhaps I should preface my
remarks by saying that amending legislation
should synchronize with tbe legisiation which if
affects, and should run mare or less true ta
form. Here we have in fhe fwelftb line the
expression, "other than enlisted men." I submit that nowhere in our legislation would this
phrase le found. This is an Americanism,
applicable only in the American army, neyer
used in our legislafion, and nof ta be f ound
in any of the regulations based on any of aur
legislation. The phrase is unnecessarv if fhe
word "members" is struck out of the fenth
line and fhe words "commissioned officers" are
substifuted. The section would tIen rcad:
The members of the judiciary and the coinmissioned afficers of the military, naval and air
forces oi Canada.
TIen we should strike ouf the words, "other
flan enlisted men." I abject to that pbrase
because it is nof used in any of our services.
1 would also amend the section by inserting
affer the word "salaries" file words "or pay."
We*have a Militia Act and a Naval Service

SENATE

474

Act, and such amendments as provide for a
flying service. Under these legislative measures there is a provision for the enactment
of regulations, and it is under the regulations
that those services are carried out. I submit
that the legislation should have regard for
the phraseology of the regulations. The word
"salaries" is not in any sense applicable to
men in the military, naval or air forces. The
word used is "pay," and that word has a
distinct legal meaning, and should be inserted
here. The word "salaries" applies to judges.
If. as I suggest, there are inserted after the
word "salaries" the words "or pay," the
amended Act would read:
Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Act or in any other statute or law, the members
of the judiciary and the conmissioned officers
of the niilitary, naval and air forces of Canada

and of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police shall
be liable to pay a special income tax of ten per
centun upon the salaries or pay paid to them
by the Dominion of Canada.
The effect is exactly the same, but the phraseology would follow the regulations, all the provisions of which are based on legislation.
There is also this fact to be borne in mind.
In our military and air services a warrant
officer is an enlisted man, a man enlisted under
a definite contract, and under definite conditions of service for a definite period of years,
and he is not a commissioned officer. But,
curiously, in the navy warrant officers of the
higher rank are considered as officers, though
they are not commissioned officers.
One curious result of this legislation will be
that a detective-sergeant of the Mounted
Police, who is a man enlisted and will not be
subject to taxation, will draw more pay than
a junior inspector, who is a commissioned
officer. I suppose the persons who drafted this
section did not know that, but it is a matter
of very great importance.
I do think that the section should be
properly phrased, for the reasons that I have
given. I therefore move to strike out the
word "members" in the tenth line, to substitute the words "commissioned officers," and
to strike out the words "other than enlisted
men" in the twelfth line, and to insert after
the word "salaries" in the thirteenth line the
words "or pay."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable gentleman is probably right, but
I do not feel sure enough to say anything
more on the subject at present. I should like
to hear from some others who have been more
closely allied with the militia than I have
been. Perhaps the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) could tell us something about this.
Hon. Mr. GREISBACH.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I do not quite understand the explanabion of the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
in regard to the position of warrant officers.
They are not commissioned officers. What
position would they be in?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: A warrant officer
in the military forces is an enlisted man; be
is not a commissioned officer. The same is
true of a warrant officer in the air force. In
the navy warrant officers of the higher ranks
are regarded as officers; they mess with the
officers and are treated as such. By the use
of the words "commissioned officers" you do
away with confusion in relation to any warrant officer. I am pointing out at the same
time that this clause as it stands, and even as
it will be if amended as I suggest, will have
a rather curions result, in that a junior inspector in the Mounted Police will draw less pay
than a detective-sergeant, because he will pay
a tax, whereas the detective-sergeant will not.
If my amendment is accepted, the effect of
the Bill will be precisely the same as it is now.
I am merely objecting to the phraseology.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is no
doubt that the language used by the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) is the language to be found in
militia legislation and militia regulations. I
cannot recall ever having heard the emolument paid to a member of the militia called
a salary. It is always called pay. I should
not care tu take the responsibility of saying
that the amendment is all right, or of having
the leader of the Government think that I
know. I arn speaking from my knowledge of
the statutes governing the militia and the
regulations under that legislation.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: We have the same
distinction in French. We never speak of
the "salaire" of the soldier; we speak of the
"solde."
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I have not had
as much experien-ce in military matters as the
honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach), but having had some experience in the militia and in the overseas forces,
as well as having been the Minister in charge
of the naval forces, I may say that everything the honourable senator has said is perfectly correct, and I should like to see effect
given to it.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

Carried.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is there anyone who can add to the assurance that the
term "commissioned officer" will include all
whom the words "members of the military,

MAY 24, 1932
naval and air forces of Canada and of the
Royal Canadian Moun'ted Police, other than
enlisted men" are intended to, cover? I arn
not at ail worried about inserting the words
"'or pay" after "'salaries"; but I should like to
be sure on the other point.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The draftsman
uises the words "enlisted men," which should
flot be used at ail. If I may venture an
opinion as teo what lie meant, I should say
that he intended Vo exelude from the eifect
of this taxation ail enlisted men. Enlisted

The words
"Ccomimissioned offleers" -have precisely the
saine effect, but are, I submit, plain English
and flot Americanese.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

I will accept

the amendrnent.

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourabie members, I want Vo say another
word about this measure before it is reported.
IV seems Vo me that the unmanly thing about
this legialation is the shape it takes, the refusai to make a deduction from salaries
directly and openIy, and the acoomplishment
of Vhe samne end in a roundabout fashion by
a speciaI Vax. To illustrate that, I want to
refer Vo the concluding clause of Vhis Bill.
Trhe clause provides in substance that the
arnount of Vhs special tax, whatever it may
be in the case of each individual, is Vo be
deducted or deductible fromn his income for
the current year in the computing of his incorne tax next year. That is ail very fine for
the purposes of the Dominion income Vax, but
what about the provincial and municipal incorne taxes? As a result of the Iegislation taking this circuitous route every j udge, every
man who is Vo suifer a Ven per cent reducVion
under Vhis Bill, will have Vo pay a provincial
income Vax next year on that ten per cent.
IV is noV any mere trifie that I arn Valking
about. Take a judge who suifera a reduction
of $1.000 in his salary for the current year
by reason of Vhs Bill. If Parliarnent had
gone ahead in a straightforward, rnanly
fashion, and put hirn into Vhe class of civil
servants, who have a Ven per cent reduction,
his income for the year would have been
$1,000 less for ahl purposes of taxation; but
under Vhs Bull lie will have Vo pay Vo the
municipal and the provincial authorities a Vax
upon his full incorne, including the $1,000, just

as thougli lie had received and enjoyed every
cent of it. That illustrates the iniquity of Vhis
measure in the accomplishment of its purpose
by this roundabout method.

MAY 24, 1932
For some time our principal exports of cattle
have been to the United States. That trade
has the advantage of giving quick returns.
For instance, cattle are shipped from Alberta
and disposed of at Chicago in about one wcek.
0f course, a much longer time is required
for getting our cattie on the British and
European markets. In addition, the overseas
business suffers from various disabilities, such
as the uncertainty of the supply, and the dislike of Western producers ta take cargo space
for a season when they do not know what
results will be obtained. We expressed the
hope that a pool, marketing board or some
other means might be devised by whieh the
whole risk would not fall on the individual
shipper, and the loss, if any, would be borne
by the pool or hoard, through a system of
taxation of individuals; and it was understood
that wh'atever might be done should be without expense to the already overburdened taxpayer. We did not presumne to work out any
seheme, but I feel sure that some such thing
will be necessary in order to bring about a
complete revival of the trade. Our report in
this respect was limîted ta Western cattle,
since most of the evidence we heard duait
with Western conditions.
We had not the privilege of hearing from
the third expert whom I had in mind a little
while aga, the honourable gentleman from
South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly). He is
thoroughly familiar with conditions in the
cattle trade in Ontario and other eastern provinces. I understand that these conditions
apply fairly generally to the whole country.
The Hon. Mr. Weir, Minister of Agriculture, was good enough ta, attend before the
committee and make a statement. I may say
that we were much impressed by ail the
departmental *officials, as weil as by the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and
the Manufacturers' Association.
It is intercsting ta note that the Committee
on Commerce and Trade Relations of Canada
came into being, as one of a braod of apparently healthy committees, as long ago as
1908. Along with. most of the others, it feUl
into a state of suspended animation, being
revived for a few moments once a year for the
purpose of organization, fixing of quorums,
and sa on. The members of aur committee
decided ta try not; merely ta revive it spasmodically, but ta make it a really active
committee during every session of Parliament.
It is not for me ta iay whether we have
entirely succeeded in aur attempt at this
session. We did aur best, and we certainly
got together in a canvenient form a great
amount of interesting information. I conclude with the suggestion that meinhers of

477

other dormant committees might, by reviving
them, perfarm a great and valuable service
for the good of Canada.
I move the adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does the motion mnclude the evidence?
Hon. Mr. McLF1NNAN: Yes.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY; Hon ourable
member.s, 1 did not have the privilege of
attending sittings of the committee, and I
did not see the report until this afternoon.
With the bulk of the report I am in hearty
accord, but I should like ta go on record as
dissenting from an inference that may be
drawn from one short section of it. I refer
to that part of the report under the heading,
"Western Beef, Bacon and Barley"':
The evidence given by the officiaIs of the
1)epartment of Agriculture (namely Honourable Robert Weir, P.C., Mînister, and Messrs.
G. B. Rothwell, Live Stock Commissioner, and
L. H. Newman, Dominion Cerealist), and aur
colleagues, Senat&'rs Burns and Riley, indicates
the difficulties of establishing what is in reality
a new trade.
I wish, 6irst, ta dissent from part of the
heading, "Western Beef." I notice that the
committee reconamends the printing of the
report, and I think a fair infercnce from this
heading would be that the West has a
monapoly of the production of beef and beef
cattle. 1 camne £rom a section of Western
Ontario which specializes in the production of
beef and beef cattle, and with &Ildue respect
ta aur Western ranchers, 1 contend that there
is no finer class of beef or beef catt;e produced
at any place in Canada than in that section
of Western Ontario ta, which I refer, naxnely
the counties of Middlesex, Wellington, Perth,
Huron aud Bruce. And I venture to make
the assertion that no other section of Canada
of the same size produces an equal number
of high-class beef cattl 'e. I desire ta make
this matter clear, in the interest of the section
of the country from which I came. I am not
a cattle dealer, but in my cominunity I have
been as.sociated for the pa.st forty years with
men who are largely interested in cattle. In
passing, 1 might say that forty-two years ago,
in the year 1890, I had four loads of cattle
on the Liverpool market for .my brother, who
made a business of exporting cattle. Sa I
have some knowledge of the subject.
The part of the report that I read says the
evidence "indicates the difficulties of estabiishing what is in reality a new trade." I
think it would have been better ta say "the
difficulties of reviving or re-establishing what
has been a very important business for the
people of Canada for many years." I have

SENATE

478

before me a table showing the number of
cattle that have been exported from year to
year from Canada to the United Kingdom,
from the year 1890 to the present time. I do
not purpose to weary honourable members by
putting all the figures on record, but I intend
to give a few of them, to show how at one
time the trade grew. In the year 1890 we
exported to Great Britain 66,000 head of
cattle. I am quoting round figures only. By
the year 1900 that trade had grown to 115,000
head, and in 1910 to 140,000 head.
The cattle business fluctuates. Like every
other business, it seeks to get the best returns.
In the year 1915 we did not ship any cattle to
England. The reason was not that we had no
cattle to ship, or that there was not a fair
market in Great Britain, but that the prices
here were very high and our people could get
a better return on the home market. The
same conditions applied in the years 1917, 1918
and 1919, when we did not export any cattle
to Great Britain. In those years business was
very good, particularly in the northern part of
Ontario. There was a great demand for meat
in our mining and lumber camps. At that
time the tariff on beef and beef products
going to the United States was not high
enough to prohibit our sending them over
there. There was really what was called a
beef famine over there at that time, and we
had the benefit of shipping to the New England States, which raised the price of beef
in this country so high that it would not have
been profitable to export cattle to Great
Britain.

are shipped to Great Britain. As you will
all realize, an ordinary freighter is not prepared to load cattle, and when the cattle are
not going over, there are really no cattle
boats coming in. When it is seen that the
market in Great Britain will justify sending
our cattle over there, we find the steamship
companies willing to go to the expense of
installing facilities. The expense of installing
for one animal would be more than the freight
for carrying the animal across. So the ship
companies maintain that we should guarantee
them three shipments before they fit up their
ships to carry our cattle. That is one of the
difficulties that the present Minister of Agriculture found. I wish to commend him for his
efforts; I think he is doing everything possible
to improve our export trade.
The reports from Great Britain show that
the market there, as compared with the low
market we have here at present, would justify
us in sending our cattle, provided we had
some assurance as to exchange.
I desired to make these few remarks as to
the cattle trade, in elaborating the contents
of the report.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: In what year was that?

Yes. I noticed
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
that the two senators, whose evidence would
naturally relate to Western Canada, dealt
with the value of live stock to the people
of Canada as a whole.

In 1917, 1918,
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
and 1919. Then again there was a revival of
the trade. In 1922 we shipped only 418 cattle
to the United Kingdom; in 1924, 59,000; in
1925, 86,000; in 1926, 117,000; in 1927, 61,000;
in 1928, just 1,000 cattle; and in 1930 we did
not ship any cattle. The figures I am now
giving are for the twelve months preceding
the 31st of March in each year. Previously
the figures were for the calendar year.
For the twelve months preceding the 31st
March, 1931, we had shipped 6,224 cattle to
the United Kingdom; so there has been some
revival in the trade. The latter part of 1931
was even better than that: I think that in
the calendar year of 1931 we shipped something like 13,000 cattle.
I have tried to explain how it was that our
shipments fluctuated so much. It is a matter
of supply and demand. That is one of the
main difficulties that we have to overcome
-the fluctuation in the number of cattle that
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

I want to say
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
that we put the word "Western" in the
original report when writing about beef, etc.,
because the evidence we received was almost
exclusively about the West. Although much of
it would carry over, we thought it was better
to say "Western" in order that there should
not be a mistake. But I should be very glad
to elimiinate the word "Western," and I think
that deletion would meet the case.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Is the honourable
gentleman who has just spoken of the cattle
trade in a position to state whether the cattle
from his district, say the counties of Bruce
and Middlesex, could be landed in Great
Britain in competition with those from the
Western Provinces?
Well, we have
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
been doing that. I am not a cattle dealer,
but in connection with my lumber business
I handle a good many cattle, and I shipped
one carload to Glasgow and another to
Liverpool from Ontario, and got quite satisfactory results.
I think the object of this report was
to place before the public some facts that
would assist us in dealing with this matter
at the Imperial Conference. I think we do

MAY 24, 1932
know that what our people are endeavouring to secure at that conference is that our
cattle should be placed on the same footing
as cattle from Ireland. It is a fact at the
present time that we are permitted to send
cattle to England for beef purposes only.
From Ireland milch cows and heifers are permitted to enter Great Britain. Our milch
cows and heifers for breeding purposes are
not permitted.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: It is getting late, but as
Western cattle have been mentioned I would
place on record a few figures for the information of honourable members. These are
Prairie exports for 1931; that is, exports from
the Prairies to Ontario or any other place.
The total animals exported numbered 668,000.
I want to impress on you those figures, because

we hear so much about wheat farming and
almost nothing but that.
There were
109,000,000 pounds of meat; 10,000,000 dozens
of eggs; 33,000,000 pounds of butter. If it were
not for the surplus supplies of produce on the
Prairies, not only would Canada have large
deficits of pork, lamb, butter and eggs, but
the people would have to import large
quantities of those products.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Where are those
figures from?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: From the Guide, published in Manitoba. Those figures mean the
exports to outside points from the three
Prairie Provinces.
On motion of Hon. G. V. White, the debate
was adjourned.

THE BEAUHARNOIS PROJECT
PRINTING OF COMMITTEE'S REPORT-MOTION
ADOPTED

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved:
1. That the proceedings of the special com-

mittee of the Senate appointed to take into
consideration the report of a special committee
of the House of Commons respecting the Beauharnois Power Project in so far as said report
relates to members of the Senate, be printed
as an Appendix to the Journals of the Senate.

2. That 400 copies in English and 200 copies

in French of the said proceedings be printed in
bluebook form.
3. That the exhibits produced from the
records of the House of Commons be returned

to that House.

4. That all original documents produced as
exhibits before said committee be returned to
the witnesses producing same.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
May I ask the
right honourable gentleman if he is agreeable

to that expenditure?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not see
any reason for taking exception to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is not settled.

But the amount

Hon. Mr. FORKE: I want to protest
against this, w(hich I think is a needless expenditure.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I wish to protest.
I do not know what good it will do to publish
this bluebook and send it abroad. We have
heard a great deal about this matter, and not
ta the credit of this House. We are adopting, and rightly so, the policy of retrenchment and strict economy, and we are reducing the salaries and stipends of even the lower
classes of the Civil Service, yet here it is
proposed to print these reports, although we

have had them from day to day and every
member of the Senate have received copies
of them. I appeal to my honourable friend
not to press his motion. The newspapers

SENATE

180

have been full of reports of this matter. We
have had the evidence before us, we have
heard the very interesting debate on the
whole question, and the House has given its
verdict. Now, when we are cutting, pruning,
retrenching, from top to bottom and from
bottom to top, I do not see why we should
spend any additional amount, especially when
we do not know what the cost will be. I
appeal to the honourable gentleman to live
up to his old reputation for economy and
retrenchment.
Honourable memHon. Mr. TANNER:
bers, on the 15th of March-that is some time
ago-the Senate ordered that a French translation of the proceedings of the committee
should be made and published. Now, in order
to stop that, some honourable member would
have to move, if it is proper-which I doubtto rescind that order.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

We can do that.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: This present motion
only follows that former one. If any honourable member on the other side of the House
would like to move that the French translation be not printed, he is at liberty to do
so. So far as I am concerned, I intend, not
to make any such motion, but to abide by
the resolution passed by the Senate on the
15th of March, and that is why I make the
motion that is now before this House.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I quite agree with the
statements in regard to economy. I think
very little useful purpose would be served by
the printing of this long report of evidence,
and it does seem to me that, if the motion
is in order, we should rescind any action that
the Senate took some time ago in authorizing
the printing of this report.
We need only

to revert to the previous order and rescind

Honourable
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
members, I wish to make my position clear,
so that there may be no misunderstanding.
The chairman of the committee came to see
me, in the absence of the honourable senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), and
stated that there had been so much demand
for these copies, as the clerk had informed
him, that he suggested a certain additional
number should be printed. I acquiesced,
though only for myself, but when I acquiesce
I acquiesce. I am not going to present any
argument. The House may do what it likes.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

As a matter of principle, I agreed to have the
report printed. But that need not influence
any person.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I can say, with the right
honourable member from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), that the chairman of the
committee came to our room the other day
with the proposed motion. He gave the reason
for the printing, and I agreed. But I am inclined to think that the printing of this
lengthy evidence is hardly necessary, though
it is perhaps pardonable, as carrying out the
same procedure as was followed by the House
of Commons committee. I think that that
part of the motion dealing with the return
of exhibits to the House of Commons should
carry. I feel, however, that the expense of
printing the evidence is really not warranted.
When my honourable friend from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) was speaking to me the
other day I thought the matter was merely a
formal one.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I will support the
motion, for the reason that I believe there is
a demand on the part of the public of this
country for the information contained in these
proceedings. I should have thought that a
very much larger number of copies would have
been printed. It seems to me that it would
be unwise for this House to refuse to publish
information that the people really want: that

conclude that the public have an interest in
the subject and want to know what went
on.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I am in somewhat
the same position as the honourable gentleman from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp).
When the honourable gentleman from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) showed me the resolution
and asked me if I thought it was all right,
and I said I thought so, I regarded it as a
matter of form. Of course the exhibits should
be returned to the House of Commons, but
I think that it would be a waste of money
to reprint the proceedings. Therefore I should
be glad to see clause 2 of the motion stricken
out. All the evidence was printed and circulated while the inquiry was going on; every
member has a copy, and I presume there
were a number of surplus copies made. So
I do not see anything is to be gained now
by reprinting the evidence.

On section 15.-as to spawning rivers (reconsidered):
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I have an explanation which makes
this clause intelligible sto me at least. It appears 'that the habit of salmon in spawning
time is to come up tide-water rivers, in search
of the river of their birth, and to linger
around the mouth of the river of their birth
for some time, always lingering until close

enough to the spawning period for them to
ascend the river. The consequence is that
there is a congregatdon of salmon in the
neighbouýrhood, of the mouth of the tributary
for a considerable period of time, and therefore it is necessary to proteet the mouth of
the tributary. It appears there is no necessity
for protecting the mouth of the main river,
for the reason that the waters are of large
dimensions and no matter what fishing may
be done in that vicinity -there is ample opportunity for the fish to ascend the river. But
when the fish get to the tribu.tary they remain still, they congregate aro.und the mouth,
and that mouth must he protected se that the
fish may be able to ascend and spawn. As the
Bill reads, it protects the mouth of any tributary for two hundred yards. I had in mind
that the distance of two hundred yards was
up the tributary only. The protection does
apply to that area, but the principal object
is the protection of two hundred yard's. on
either side of the tributary, on the main
stream. The reason for the section is apparcntly quite sound.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: The protection

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I neglected to

In the first place, as to the English, if the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I rise with hcsitation to speak on a point concerning the
English language. I would suggest that the
intention is to repeal the Act, but the amendie nt that have been inade are incorporated
in it, and the whole thing is known as the
Fisheries Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Act appears as a single Act in the Revised Statutes
which Parliament made the law of Canada in
1927. But the amendments that came subsequently are subsequent Acts, and there must
be a repeal of every one. I take the liberty
of suggesting an amendment to this effect:

RADIO BROADCASTING BILL
SECOND READING

Ricit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 94, an A-ct respecting
Radio Broadcasting.
He -aid: Honourable gentlemen, this is one
of the important Bills of the session, and is
one, possibly, in regard to which controversy
might be expected. The House will recall that
about three or four years ago a commission
was appointed by the Government of that
day to inquire into the whole radio situation
with a view to advising what policy should
be adopted by the Parliament of Canada with
respect to radio ownership or control. Subsequently to the report of that commission the
question of jurisdiction in radio as between,
the federal and the provincial authorities was
submnitted to the courts, and the Privy Council
gaive a decision in faveur of Dominion jurisdiction. This session, in the other House, a
special committee reviewed the whole question. That committee had before it the report of the royal commission headed by Sir
John Aird. If heard evidenco from all portion- of the Dominion and from all interested
parties. including those having investments
in radio broadcasting stations, and presented
to the other House a unanimous report, upon
which this Bill is founded. The Bill has
passed the Cominons and is now before us.
This Bill contemplates the Dominion control of radio. The jurisdiction is established,
and both investigating bodies have rqported in
favour of the principle of the Bill. This
imeasure does nat authorize the acquirement
from the present owners of the broadcasting
stations or the channels, as they are described,
but it contemplates control by a commission,
the establishment of which it authorizes, that
ontrol going to the extent of determining
how the various channels of radio transmission may be shared and how such properties
as maV be necessary for the exercise of control may be acquired, but only upon the express authorization of Parliament. There
naturally was no need of putting into the Bill
a clause to provide that stations might be

action. because the Bill would still be of
exactly the same effect as if such a provision
were nat contained in it. The only effect such
a clause would have would be to indicate
the scope of policy. It is apparently the
intention to control the radio facilities of this
Dominion without at once assuming ownership thereof; possibly in the hope that it
will net be necessary to do that at any time.
The terms of the Bill are quite clear. I

to review therm, but I do not know that any
of them require special attention or explanation now. I should say that the proposed
commission is to consist of a chairman, a vicechairman and a third commissioner, their
salaries to be $10,000, $8,000 and $8,000 respectivelv. They are to have the assistance
of nine assistant commissioners, each of whom
will be a representative of one of the nine
provinces. The nine assistant commissioners
are not to be paid a salary, but are to receive such honorarium as may be found
adequate to the services given. The other
officials of the commission are to be under the
Civil Service Act of Canada.
The Governnent of each of the provinces
is to be consul'ted as to the appointment of
the assistant commissioner for the province
concerned. These assistant commissioners are
to give their services in order that the private
stations within their respective provinces may
work in harmony with the general policy of
the central commission.
Provision is made for conferences between
the commissioners, the assistant commissioners
and euch advisory bodies at each station.
ereated under the termis of the Act, as it nay
be deemed wise to have attend such conferences.
The Act is elearly of a more or less tentative character. It can be observed from its
terms that it is desired to gain experience
bfore any very stringent or definite powers
are extended to the commission. That is
probably the wise course. Radio is a new

radio bas been exceedingly rapid. It is intended that radio should pay its way as far as
the Government is concerned; in fact, there
is a provision in the Bill that Parliament
shall not appropriate for radio purposes anything in excess of the receipts of the commission. I ar not just clear as to how Parliament can be restrained in advance, but doubtless that provision indicates the general line
of policy which the Government has in mind.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members, I have given very little attention
to the various contentions that have appeared
in the press in recent years on the nationalization of radio. I have kept an open mind
on the subject. The inquiry in the other
House was thorough, and I commend the Government upon the form of this Bill, which
sets up a whole organization, but does not appear to give it wide powers. It is not

my right honourabie friend bas said, the project seems to be oniy a tentative one. I

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I ar not opposing this Bill, and yet I want
to express a dou.bt and a regret. I followed
the debate in the other House, and was very
miiuch surprised to notice the almost complete
unanimity with which this Bill went through
that Chamber. The Bill involves additional
expenditure at a time when any additional
expenditure does not seem to be warranted. That
is one ground of doubt. We are setting up
another bureaucracy of high-salaried men, with
higher salaries, I think, than the positions
would justify. I should like to see the men
selected prove their qualifications and justify
their appointment before salaries of that size
were proposed. That is another cause of my
feeling of doubt and regret. I notice from the
debates in another place that the probable
snnual cost of this commission will be half a
million dollars. It is quite possible that in
his matter, as in the past with other government-controlled industries, we may hear
.uggestions or charges of extravagance and

soie of us who sit here may see a radio inquiry
which may be somewhat like the recent railway
inquiry. These are doubts which are in my
mind, and they are reasons why I should
very much prefer to see no action taken at
this present time.
There is. to my mind, a very strong reason
:or the appointment of this commission for the
control of radio by the Government, and that is
the propaganda and publicity that corne over
the Canadian radio, not Canadian or British,
but from the neighbouring republic. Unfortunately, however, we are not going to prevent
that by any radio control suggested in this
Bill, or in any other way, because the republic
to the south of us has no Government control.
Radio broadcasting across the border is entirely independent and is so organized that
there is no indication that there ever will
be Government control. Radio listeners in the
rural districts of Canada now hear what cornes
from the various United States broadcasting
stations. I can speak about the rural districts
in New Brunswick, and I know from experience
and observation that there they hear Boston,
New York, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, Hartford, Schenectady and
various other stations, and hear them very
clearly. Nothing in this proposed radio control
will prevent that. We shall continue to hear
those stations just as readily as now. Their
programs wilil come in, and people who
have radio sets will tune in on any station
they desire, either Canadian or foreign. The
great advantage which inight result if we could
control broadcasting is very largely lost because

those who have radio sets can and will make
their own selections.
I have talked economy in this House
whenever I thought it necessary, and I intend
to talk it when I think unwise expenditures
are being made or proposed. I feel that the
present is not the time to .bring in legislation
of this kind. I shall not oppose the motion,
but I should have felt much better pleased if
this legislation could have been passed over

say we are starting out in a small way, but
we are not doing so in the matter of salaries.
I think the salaries proposed are excessive.
I appreciate the need of legislation with respect to radio. It bas been in the air so long
now that we should decide on definite action;
but I concur in the sentiment which has been
expressed, that we should make progress
slowly. A few days ago it was stated in the
press that someone might be brought out
from England to head this commission. I
think I am expressing the views of most
honourable senators in saying that the time
has .come when we should run our own commissions. Canadians were not found wanting
in war, and I do not think they will be
found wanting in peace. If we find it necessary to call in some outsider in connection
with the administration of our affairs, let us
call on him as an adviser and not as a
permanent -manager. It is a reflection on
Canadians to call in outsiders, and I hope
that when the time comes for making appointments to this commission some of the very
well qualified Canadians who are now in more
or less junior positions will be given an opportunity to show what they can do. If this
were done, it would not be necessary to pay
salaries as high as $8,000 and $10,000. These
are times demanding economy in the public
service, and I think that when the Government is starting on a new branch like this,
the necessity of which is questioned in certain
sections, it should start on a proper basis
as to economy.
I hope the Government wili appoint the
commission at an early date and thus get
along with the organization, so that in this
respect there will be someone to represent
Canada at the Imperial Conference, which
will be under way within a couple of months
and at which, I hope, consideration will be
given to the Imperial All-Red Radio System
that I suggested before the House of Com-

mons committee. [n October wii'1 be held the
Madrid Conference, ta which it is important
that Canada should send a capable rapresentative.
Huwever, it does seem ta me that the
salaries which it is proposed to pay ta the
commissioners at the outset are too high.
I fear there will be a correspondingly high
expenditure in the administration and operation of this new department.
Hon. J. BUREAU: In view of the opinion
that this 4ill wiil resuit in large expenditures,
and of the fact that our people are .being
called upon ta make many sacrifices, would it
flot be well ta let this Bill stand until next
session? We now have in concrete form the
Government's proposai for the constitution
of the commission and the administration of
radio. In the meantime the people would
have a chance ta study the actual legisiation
wbich the Government wants put through,
and I do not tbink that if the measure were
postponed for six months any harm would be
done ta the broadcasting system that bas been
developed since radio bas become popularized.
I ar n ot speaking in opposition ta the
Bill, although as a matter of principle I arn
opposed ta contrai by the state of any public
utility. I fought against Government awnership of the Canadian National Railways, when
I was in another place, as the rigbt honourable
]eader of 'the flouse may remember. I tbink it
is not proper for the state to take hold af any
public utility and operate it. ýIt may be contended that this Bill provides for control, but
the powers of tbe commission are very broad.
The commission will have the right ta license
stations, to "regulate and control broadcasting
in Canada carried on by any persan whatever,
including His Majesty in the right af the
province or of the Dominion." The commission shall determine the number, location and
power af stations required in Canada, and the
proportion of time that is ta be devoted by
any station to national and local programs.
The commission may niake recammendations
ta the Minister with regard ta the issue,
suspension or canceilation of private broadcasting licences. In short, the commission will
virtuaily have absolute contrai over broadcasting. It may exprapriate every existing
station, and do anything it pleases.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN'D:
It must corne
ta Parliament for authority.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It can recoinmend ta Parliament, and Parliament will act.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: According ta section
9, the commission may:

(b) acquire existing private stations either
by lease or, sabject ta the approval af Parliaaent, by purchase.
Rigbt Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is rigbt.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU. And:
(c) subject ta the approval of Parliament,

and sa on. The pawers are very wide, and
virtually give the commission absolute contrai.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Probably tbe contrai
is not wide enaugb.

How can the commission

contrai American stations?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: We cannot legislate
for matters beyond aur own frontier.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: We bave not gat contrai and we cannot get con! -rol. We cannoýt
control what aur own people shall listen ta;
we cannat prevent anyane from listening ta
American prograins.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: W9e aire not legisiating
for listeners sa much as for broadcasters.
Hon. Mr. FORRE: We cannat cantrol the
programs of listeners. Tbat is tbe difficulty
that appears ta me. and I wonder if the right

bonourabie gentleman can say anytb;ng
about it.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The anly thing we
ean contrai is broadcasting.
If I want ta
listen ta a station in Chicago, New York, or
Schenectady, I arn perfectly free ta do Sa.

But if we postpone this measure until next

session, we may in the meantime be able ta
get into touch with the United States and see
what arrangements can be made.
Han. SMEATON WHITE: I sbouid hike, ta
add a few words in support of what the honaurabie member fruni La Salle (Hon. Mr.
Bureau) bas said. I think this is hardly an
opportune time ta spend sa, mucli money on
something for which there is nat an immediate
need. I understand that wve rnay possibiy

from naw, and it seems ta me that if the
Governinent could see its way clear to bave
this Bill held over until that time, no one
would suifer very much injury. In my opinion,
the commission is going ta cast a great deal
more money than has been stated in any
estimates we have had Sa. far.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, hear.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable senators,
it strikes me that the twçp honourable gentlemen wbo have just spoken have not a true

SENATE
conception of what this Bill involves. Those
of us who are in the habit of listening to
radio programs-and I assume we all arecan easily understand how conflicting interests
in the United States and Canada have led to
the introduction of this legislation. There
are bound to be conflicting interests with regard to radio channels, wave lengths, and so
on. in the two countries, when the powerful
stations in the United States and Mexico
completely overshadow the smaller stations
that we have in this country. For this reason,
some system of protection to Canadian broadcasting stations bas become necessary.
Of course it is clear why neither the present
radio interests nor individual owners of broadcasting stations in Canada can make effective
representations to the authorities in the United
States. We can understand, that the Canadian
Government would be much more influential
in making submissions to the United States
Government, or to whatever authority has
control of radio in that country, with
respect to radio channels, wave lengths and
other matters of that kind, with a view to
getting a broader scope for the operations of
the smaller Canadian stations. I think that
the necessity of having in this country some
central authority to represent Canadian interests in dealing with radio interests on the
other side of the line was one of the reasons
that led to the introduction of this legislation.
It being evident that there is necessity for
some such commission as is provided for in
the Bill, the question naturally arises whether
the present is a propitious time for bringing
in the legislation. I do not agree with my
honourable friends who say that the time is
not propitious. The fact that we are passing
through a distressing financial period does not
mean that we should sit down, fold our hands,
and make no progress whatever. There is no
reason in the world why the radio users of
this country should not have the best facilities
that it is possible to afford them, provided
that the facilities do not result in an onerous
tax upon the public treasury.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Will my honourable friend allow me to ask him a question?
Have the smaller broadeasting stations, to
which be refers, asked for this legislation?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I am not sufficiently
well posted to say whether they have asked
for it or not. I doubt very much, though,
that they have asked for it, because I think
owners of local broadcasting stations in Canada have a very valuable franchise, out of
which they are making a great deal of money,
and I imagine they would be the last people
to seek legislation of this kind. If they did
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

make such a request, I should look upon it
with considerable suspicion. I am not speaking from their standpoint at all, because there
are only some fifteen or twenty such stations
in the whole Dominion. I am speaking on
behalf of the hundreds of thousands of radio
users throughout the Dominion, who are not
satisfied with the buncombe, bosh and advertising rubbish sent out over the air through
varions smali stations for private gain.
If there is a necessity for a central radio
authority in Canada, and if this is a proipitious
time to consider the establishment of it, the
question then arises whether the presenht legislation meets the situation, or whether it involves too large an expeniditure of money.
From observations that have been made in
the House, one might think that the Bil
would result in a very large outlay of public
funds, that it would commit the country to
embarkation upon another costly publie
utility. I must confess that our experience
with public ownership in this country-not
only in the field of railways, but with eilevator
systems and other things for which we are
being very heavily taxed to make good the
large defioits-has not been such as to cause
any public ownership program to appeal to
very many people just now. We have had
a surfeit of public ownership schemes, so that
our people might well hesitate about adding
to the list of them. But if honourable mcmbers will read this Bill they will find that the
estimated expenditures will not be a charge
upon the public treasury. The commissioners
will have power to charge and collect licence
fees. In the past these fees have not been
colleotedHon. Mr. TANNER: Some of them have.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Some people have paid,
but there has been no systermatized, intensive
program for collecting licence fees, and consequently the sum received in this connecion
has been much smaliler than it might have
been. It will be one of the duties of the commission to impose and colleet licence fees,
and to take advantage of penalities assessed
against radio users who do not take out a
licence. I thinki we shall find that there will
be ample revenue coming in from these
sources to nraintain the organization that the
BilI provides. In the past the radio licence
fee has been one dollar a year. That is an
insignificant amount, which has not been a
burden to any listener.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It is two dollars now.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The commissioners will
have power to fix the licence fee, which they
-uay make two or thece dollars, and if they

MAY 25, 1932
have an efficient system of collection. the
revenue from licence fees should be ample
for the carrying on of their work. To obtain
funds to meet the capital expenditures necessary in acquiring stations now in existence it
will be necessary to corne to Parliament, and
then the whole question whether the money
should be provided will be under consideration; but for the expenses of the commission's administrative work, as outlined
within the four corners of this Bull, I do not
sec that there should be any tax upon the
people of this country.
To sum up, it aqppea.rs to, me that there is
necessity for a radio comjmission, tihat the
present time is propitious for bringing in
legislation for the estaiblishment of a commission, and that the proposed legislation that
we have before us in this Bill is good, especially when we bear in mind that any expenses
entailed should be provided for out of the
revenue received from licence fees paid by
people who receive benefit therefor. The
best evidence. I think, that the legislation is
proper is to be found in the una-nimous adoption of -the Bill by the members of the House
of Commons.

plete possession; so the demand for control
has not corne as soon there as in other
countries. Great Britain has had Government
control and ownership for a long turne, as
honourable members know. However, I do
say that. in Canada, whether we shoulci have
Government ownership and opeiration or not,
we must control and share in the limited
facilities which nature bas granted, and for
the disposition of which we must be responsible.
The Bill is tentative; it is feeling its wvay.
It may be that the salaries are too high. As
to that, I am not sure. I certainly should
have supporteci the Bill if the salaries had
been Iower. But every person thinks that
everything is easy, except what he does himself. I do net pretend to know very muchi
about radio. It may be that a degree of expertness, sucb as very few persons possess, is
necessary, and that the proposed salaries arc
nc.cessary in order te obtain that. The Bill
provides that the whole business of radio, so
far as the public of Canada are concerned,
must pav its own way. 0f course it is arguable
that the radio fee is a tax. It is a tax on the
radio public. I would neyer attempt to justîfy

I want to impress upon honourable gentlemen again the fact that the Bill is only tentative, and that though there may be leasing,
i specifically provides that there shall not b
Government ownership of radio until Parliament so decides, and that the moneys voted
by Parliament are net to be in excess of the
earnings of the commission itself. I know
thxat provision is ineffective. but it expresses
the policy of the Bill, and there should be no
ieason to fear that in these difficult times we
are launehing into something we cannot
afford.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 95, an Act to amend
the Customs Tariff.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
has just two features, one of which has to do
with certain provisions of the New Zealand
Treaty. The changes called for by the New
Zealand Treaty are contained in clauses 3
and 4 of the Bill. They refer only to wool,
of which a very lengthy description is appended, and to hides and skins, which are
similarly enlarged upon. The other feature
of the Bill has te do with the extension of
the period for the importation of implement
parts. Honourable gentlemen will remember
that under the Customs Tariff Act of 1930 it
was provided that implement parts could be
introduced into this country for a certain
period under a very low schedule. This Bill
extends thalt period by, I believe, another
year.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I want to point
out just one thing. Pointing it out may not
do any good, but it will do no harm. I have
received more complaints about the New
Zealand Treaty than I ever received about
almost any other treaty that the Parliament
of Canada has passed in years. The objections
in regard to the importation of hides, for
example, seem to be almost unanswerable. It
is a mistake to say that this treaty will be of
great assistance to the Canadian producer of
hides. I am told that Canada does not produce hides for a particular trade in any great
quantity, and that even if all the hides of
this kind produced in New Zealand could be
secured by Canada there would not be nearly
enough. The Canadian consumer is prepared,

that we are protecting the Canadian producer when he does not produce, and we are
not giving any great benefit to New Zealand
when that country produces only about five
per cent of the requirements of the Canadian
trade. It is pretty late, of course, to raise
this point; but I raised it the other day.
Then dairymen of a particular class are objecting strongly to the benefits given to New
Zealand on certain of its products, and they
say they will close up their establishments.
If we were benefiting the agriculturist or anyone else, I would say amen to the treaty,
but, as far as I am able to ascertain, it is
injuring several industries and is not helping
any person. Of course, we should consider
Canada as a whole, but the protests coming
from one part of Canada are very numerous
indeed, and the objections raised seem to me
in many cases to be unanswerable.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should say,
of course, that the New Zealand Treaty is not

All I want to add to what I said before is
that we have been taught for many years, and
soundly taught, that we must buy in order
to sell, and similarly, that we must give in
order to take. We certainly take very substantial advantages under the New Zealand
Treaty, advantages which ought to increase

the volumýe of labour employed in Canada.
Therefore we should be prepared also to give.
If hardship sucli as is apprehended by my
riglit lionourahle friend should ensue under
the treaty, the old duty on any article or any
number of articles mey be restored on one
month's notice, and modifications may lie
made, nlot necessarily restoring the old scale,
on three months' notice. If the former conditions were restored on one month's notice,
it would of course be done at the peril of
reteliation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is the very
feature thet mey paralyse ail the operations
of the treaty. How people wiIl start doing

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think fhey

honoureble senator from 'Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. ýGraham), at least, will be highly

Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: Not at aIl.
But I shall not be very much disappointed,
because I have discovered in this treaty some
defects the resulfs of whîch, I arn efraid, cannlot lie avoided. I egree that a treafy must
be flexible and that there must lie advantages
on bofli sides. Somefimes the advantages
appear to be mostly on one side, and this, I
feer, is an instance. The treaty has been proclaimed, and I suppose that any suggestion
we might make for the rejection of the changes
in the tariff resulfing from the acceptance of
the treaty would be futile. While I believe
in treaties and know thaf there must be some
give and teke, and thaf we must buy if we
are going f0 sell, still I think that if we are
losing it is the duty of members of either
House to point out the fact. I have so much
confidence in the consistency of my righf
honourable friend (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen)
that I hope he will be sfrongly for buying
as weIl as for selling. On any other ground
it will lie impossible to make any trade
arrangements even within the Empire. If
this is the basis that is going fo lie adopted

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The definition

I sec that the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Bill abolishes the family corporation.
A
Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
personal corporation is a corporation created
for the purpose of holding the personal assets
of someone. The device was adopted shortly
after income taxes came into being. The man
who created a personal corporation transferred
his assets to it, held the stock in that corporation then drew such amount annually as he
required for his living purposes, leaving the
rest in the corporation. Therefore he was
subject only to the corporation tax and not
to the high income tax which his income
would have 'warranted. While I cannot give
the actual definition of a family corporation,
I can state it generally. There was a special
taxation rate applicable to such a company,
a certain percentage of the control of which
was in the hands of members of a single
family. The idea was that such a corporation
stood in a special position. because it was
formed for the purpose of dividing an individual's property and income among his
family. On that account there were certain
limitations of taxation, the taxation being
less than it would have been had the corporation been a personal corporation, but
more than if it had been an ordinary corporation. A family corporation was something in the nature of a stepping-stone between a personal corporation and an ordinary
corporation. I am not sure, but I think the
whole idea of the family corporation originated under the late Government. This is not
said by way of criticism, for I do not know
just what was behind the idea. However, the
family corporation is now to be abolished.
When Hon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Mr. Robb was Finance Minister there was, I
think, an amendment with respect to personal corporations, and the owners of stock in
those corporations were made to pay just as

INTERNATIONAL PEACE PARK BILL
SECOND READING
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 97, an Act respecting
the Waterton Glacier International Peace
Park.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
Bill which declares the Waterton Lakes
National Park of Canada to be a portion of
a park of an international character, to bo
called the Waterton Glacier International
Peace Park. In the United States there is
a park known as the United States Glacier
National Park, and this adjoins the Canadian
Waterton Lakes National Park. The international park is established as one unit and
called the International Peace Park by common consent of the governments of the
United States and Canada. The Canadian
section of this park will continue to be one
of the national parks of Canada. The purpose of the Bill is principally of a publicity
or courtesy character, for the legal effect
might have been reached by adminihtrative
methods, without a legislative measure. The
United States, however, adopted the plan of
putting a Bill through both Houses, and
thereby bringing home to the people of that
country the international aspect of the institution. In Canada we are following the
same plan. It seems peculiarly appropriate
that this international park should be established at this time, and particularly so because
of the identical nature of the interests of the
two countries in the property.
The honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) undoubtedly bas a
great deal more local knowledge of the situation than I have, and he could give the
Committee any further information that may
be desired on the subject.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I might explain that the proposal
to create an international peace park by
Lakes
combining the Canadian Waterton
National Park and the United States Glacier
National Park emanated among Rotary Clubs
in the State of Montana and the Province
of AIberta. My honourable friend the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Smeaton White)
knows something about Waterton Lakes Park.
He was there not long ago, looked down on
the stretches of the lake, and learned that

MAY 25, 1932
part of Waterton Lake is in the State of
Montana, in United States Glacier National
Park. Glacier National Park runs for twentythre-e miles along the border of Waterton
Lakes National Park. Except for the boundary lines-, tihey are really one park at the
present time, for the trails and the highways
run through themn without interruption. The
thought of the people interested in this
measure was that it would be a good thing
to give these two parks the namne "Waterton
Glacier International Peace Park," without in
any way interfering with the administration
of Waterton Lakes National Park by our own
federal Parks Department. I do not think
this proposai interferes in any way with other
peace projects of a similar character, such
as the Peace Gate in British Columbia, the
Peace bridges in Eastern Canada, and the
proposed Pence Garden on the boundary between Manitoba and North Dakota. This
will be a distinct Peace Park, and the only
international one in the country. I think it
was a very happy idea to, bring forward the
suggestion that this park should be termed
an International Peace Park.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
wvas read the second time.

me that in 1913 the United States and Canada
were organizing for the celebration, in December of 1914, of one hundred years of peace.
Committees had been formed in Canada and
in the United States. 1 was one of the
delegates, and, with Sir Edmund Walker and
Mr. Travers Lewis, of Ottawa, attended conferences in New York and in Washington. We
met with a British delegation headed by Lord
Weardale. A representative of the city of
Ghent was also there, for we were to celebrate
the Peace Treaty of Ghent. signed in an old
abbey building at Ghent, which it has been
my pleasure to 'risit. The oelebration, which
was to bave been held on the Eve of
Christmas, 1914, neyer took place, because
the War intervened in August of that year.
During that visit to the United States we
were received by the President, Mr. Woodrow
Wilson. On that occasion I told himi that we
had missed President Taft at Murray Bay,
because hie could not leave the United States

during bis terni of office. Mr. Woodrow
Wilson said to me then: "I will confide a
secret to you. There is on the upper St.
Lawrence an island which everybody in the
United States believes to ha on the American
side, and, wbether it is on the American side
or not, I intend to repair to, my bungalow
thera for the summer." 0f course he did not
know at that time that fate had decreed that
he should cross to Paris, thus leaving the
United States, during his terra of office.
The motion was agreed to, and tha Bill was
raad the third time, and passed.
MONTREAL HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS' BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second reading of Bill 98, an Act to amand
the Montreal Harbour Commissioners' Act,
1894.
H1e *said: The purpose of this Bill, honourabla gentlemen, is to convey to the Crown, in
the right of the Dominion, certain properties
purchased or expropriatad by the Montreal
Harbour Commission, but lying outside of the
territory delimited by the original Act as
coming within the purview of that commission. The original Act declared that the
Montreal Harbour should be deemed to embraca alI the land witbin the description containad in the Act, and that the land to be
purchased or expropriatad by the Harbour
Comission within those boundaries should be
the property of the Crown in the right of
Canada. Subsaquently, as t>he business of the
commission expanded, it became necessary to
utiliza land beyond those boundaries, and
power to purchasa or expropriate beyond those
boundaries was given. But the property so
expropriated or purchased bacame the property of the commission. The purpose of this
Bill is to make it the proparty of the
Dominion, the sama as tha other harbour
properties.

by the commission, but owned by Canada.

CIVIL SERVICE BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 99, an Act to amend
the Civil Service Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill is to ca.rry into effect most
of the recommendations of the special conmittee of the House of Commons which d'uring
the present session heard evidence at very
great length in respect of the working out
of the Civil Service Act, especially in relation to that portion of its administration
which comes under the Civil Service Commission. I understand that the greater part
of the recommendations of the committee, but
not al, are embodied herein.
The features to which attention might be
called are these. Provision is made that all
appointees to local positions in the outside
service shall, wherever practicable, be persons
vho have been not only residents of Canada
or five years, but residents of the locality
'or one year. Provision is made for the removal of post offices of limited revenue, which
come under the nomenclature "Revenue Post
Offices," from the operation of the Civil Service Act as respects the commission. When
retirement takes place, the practice has been
to give the retiring officer six months' leave
of absence before he becomes entitled to
pension. This Bill provides for the payment
of a six months' gratuity instead, thus making
it possible to fill the position at once, as of
course it shold be filled, in order that the
work may be carried on. There is also provision that if a member of the Civil Service
is appointed to the commission bis pension
rights shall be left undisturbed by the appointment.
I think I have run over the principal elements of the Bill. It is probably a Bill
which should go to Committee.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: One feature
of the report of the committee that studied
this subject is not to be found in the Bill.
Section 60 of the Act made it the duty of
the commission, when a Minister left office,
to appoint bis secretary to a permanent position in the public service classified not lower
than that of Chief Clerk, provided that the
said secretary had been acting for a period
of not less than one year. The report of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

committee suggested that that obligation
should not continue, and that part of the
Act was eliminated, and all that remained in
the Bill as presented to the House of Cornmons was the following:
Subsection two of section sixty of the said
Act. as enacted by chapter thirty-eight of the
statutes of 1929, is repealed and the foHowing
is substituted therefor:
"(2) If such person holds a permanent position in the Civil Service he may be paid an
additional salary not exceeding six hundred
dollars a year wbilst so acting; but if he does
not hold a permanent position in the Civil
Service, lie nay be paid such salary as the
Governor in Coneil may prescribe."
The rest of the clause, which entitled the
secretary to be absorbed into the Civil Serv ice,
was struck ont. But now the Bill cones to
us with the clause in another form:
Subsection two of section sixty of the said
Act, as enacted by chapter thirty-eight of the
statutes of 1929, is arnended by striking out
the words "one year' in the last line of the
said suîbsection and inserting the words "tlhrec
years" in place thereof.
This means that the private secretary of a
Miniser will still be entitled to be absorbed
into the Civil Service, but only after hax ing
been engaged as a private secretary for three
vears.
I know that some reasons have been advanced for the change that has taken place
between the first reading and the third reading, but I am net yet quite reconciled to it.
I thought that the committee that had stndied
Civil

servants, being recruited on the basis of merit
and with the expectation of promotion, naturally felit aggrieved at the assignment to rather
high positions of ten, twelve or fifteen outsiders
who had come in, not on merit, but by reason
of the fact that they had served as prix ate
secretaries. The grievance of the civil servants
was caused not only by the violation of the
merit system, but also by tle disturbance of
the line of promotion. We all know that
public servants who have been appointed on
menrit have but one hope of bettering their
positions, nanely, promotion, and it is somewhat disheartening for men who have been
working for a number of years, and are in
line for promotion, to find that they are
superseded.
It is not only the civil servants of Canada
who resen-t undue preference. I have noticed
that in large corporations the system of promotion is sacred, and only in a very exceptional
case is a stranger brought in and the line
broken. The men who are expecting to be
advanced naturally resent the preferment thus
given to a stranger.

MAY 25, 1932
The principie adopted by the committee wus
that the menit system of promotion sliould be
respected, and private secretaries were to be
debarred bencefortli from being -taken into the
Civil Service except through examination. The
amendment before us is one that permits the
absorption into the Civil Service of any private
secretary who bas served as sucli for three
years. I mention this fact because I know that
the Civil Service bas streniuously protested
against sucli an advantage being given to
private secretaries, whatever the ]ength of
service.
One tbing that surprised me in my latter
years, when I was dloser te governmental
administration, was that Ministers did net look
for, or succeed in finding, secretaries who were
already in the Civil Service. We have such an
army of employees in the various departmients
of the Government service in Ottawa that I
cannot reconcile myself to the idea that
incoming Miisters cannot find responsible
civil servante with the requisite qualifications
for secretaryships. The engagement of such
persons would to a large degree obviate the
complaint of the civil servants, for they
would themselves furnish the material for
those secretaryships, and the secretaries thus
appointed could subsequently return to their

ductions to compensate for these high charges.
The soldier settiement schemne was the only
thing that could be devised at the time. It
was a great undertaking, f or which. I think
the right honourabie leader of the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was largeiy responsihie. A great many of the men were flot
accustomed to farming, and consequently
couid hardly be expected to carry on successfuiiy. However, taking the situation geiierally, 1 think we rnay aay that soldier settiers can show as good a record of success as
can many of our experienced farmers. 1 arn
glad that this Bill bas been brought in to
adjust the tax situation.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIG3HEN: Honourable
senators, may I express appreciation of the
remarks of the two honourable gentlemen
who have just sat down? I could flot have
expresséd my feelings on the general subject
of soldier settiement better than they have
been put by the honourable gentleman frorn
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke) and the honourable gentleman from -Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Gilhis).
With regard to soldier settiement, it is
true the darkness of the day lias flot quite
borne out the fine promise of the morning,
but many tbousands of men who otherwise
wouid have had a very liard and discouraging
struggle were taken care of through critical
years. That is one accomplishment. Secondly,
the percentage of failures is, I believe, not
greater than the percentage of failures among
farmers as a whole in Western Canada over
the'corresponding time. It is only the most
exceptional mnan who lias been able to keep
lis head above water, under the conditions
that have obtained in the iast four years.
In the third place, the soldier settiement
administration lias been without spot or
blemish from the beginning, aithougli it operated in a field where the danger of scandai
was exceedingly great. It so happened that
on the retura of these men from overseas
farm lands were at a high price. I do not
know that we thouglit they were at the time.
We knew they were higlier than they had
been, but the earnings of farm lands justified,
or nearly justified, the market quotations. We
could flot say to the soldiers: "Wait. We
think these farm lands are going to corne
down in price." Honourabie inembers will
realize instantly the position in which a Goverfiment would have been if it bad taken a
stand of that kind. in the first place, we did
flot know wbether prices would coftbe down.
In the next place, what would the soldiers
have done while we were waiting? Tbey were

tlier, the tirne to do it was then. And s0 it
was. Tbey lad no occupation and no resources. Whatever the policy of Canada was
to be, that was the time to inaugurate it.
Thousands of farms were purchased, in a
period extending beyond the tirne that the
Government of which I was a member remained in office. 1 have neyer heard a word
of criticisma of the administration of the plan,
except in one instance, and that turned out
to be notbing but a false alarm. An investigation sbowed that the conduct of the Board
was honourable and efficient in every way.
It is something to be said for this country,
with respect to an administration which las
extended over a period of about thirteen
years and whicl lias had to do witb purchases
of lands in ah] parts of this Dominion, running
into many millions of dollars, with individual
instances of purchases running into tens of
thousands of dollars, that the whole thing las
been accompiished without a single stain
being left behind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn glad to, be
able to corroborate what the riglit lionourable
gentleman lias said, in so far as my own
experience goes. We bad in the Senate a
committee of inquiry with respect to, one of
the bills that I mentioned, and we were most
happy to find that the officiais at the bead
office of the Board, in the Departrnent of the
Interior, were efficient and giving very good
service to the country.

whole question, in the 1930 session. I find
on reference to records of that tirne that apparently about $50,000,000 was the total investment in the soldier settiement enterprise.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Up to wlien?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Up to 1930. The statements show that some $M0,000,000 of capital
indebtedness bad been wiped out up to that

$27,000,000. That was two years ago.

with respect to section 1, new section 16, subsection 1, clause b, that the word "fifteen"
in the second line on page 4 be stricken out
and the word "ten" substituted therefor.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I move that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purpose
of the amendment that I suggest is to reduce
the tax on companies that are not registered
in Canada, and not licensed in any province,
and do not maintain offices in Canada. Under
the Bill as it stands, the taxaition on such
companies is fifteen per cent. My understanding is that hitherto it has been five per
cent. If the proposed amendment carres, it
will 'be ten per cent, instead of fifteen per cent
as provided in the Bill. The principal, if
not the on-ly, company that will be affected is
Lloyd's. The reason for the alteration is that
fif tecn per cent may be considered too high,
and that the ronpetition effected by Lloyd's
bas a restraining influence on the level of
rates. At the sane time I think that, regard
being had to all its factors, it cannot be
argued that the taxation is too severe at ten
per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Ten per cent
on the premiums?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. It is a
taxation on the person paying the premium,
which in effect is on the company, I presume.
As the company does not maintain offices in
Canada, it cannot expect the sane nominal
taxation as companies which do maintain
offices here. Companies that have Canadian
offices are taxable otherwise. and companies
of the kind affected by this Bill must expect
a somewhat larger tax. On the whole, it
is felt that the rate should be ten per cent
instead of fifteen.

camne to us as it had left the hands of the

that we had to interpret had been made in

On the preamble:
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Ever
since we have liad the statute requiring the
placing of starnps upon cheques, a great deal
of irritation lias been caused by the Canadian
banks insisting upon United
States
when presented for collection, deposit,cheques,
or nny
other purpose, bearing stamps in the arnounts
required by the Canadian law. Ten or twelve
years ago, when the tax was on a percentage
basis and the starnps affixed to cheques rnight
be of a substantial arnount, I was spoken to
by a client who frequently had United States
chieques of a considerable size. I looked at the
statute and thouglit it abundantly clear that
it did not apply to cheques other than those
drawn upon Canadian banks. Then 1 was told
that ahl the banks in the country had been
ordered by the Department of Finance to,
.exact Canadian excise stamps upon United
States chieques, and that in accordanoe with
the order they liad been doing so. The only
redress for my client, or anybody else who
thought the banks werp doing wrong, was
to litigate the matter, and litigation about the
stamps on a cheque, even if the cheque were

for a large amount, would not lie a paying
operation; so 1 advised my client to sulimit to
the ruling. That practice lias continued up to
the present time, and is stili going on.
We are now increasing the amount of the
stamps to lie placed on clieques-doubling it
in tlie case of clieques over $100. Let me
dernonstrate how plain my point is. Paragrapli
b of tlie proposed section 44, which is the
one in question, provides that no person shahl
present to a bank for payment a clieque
without a stamp upon it. Wliat does the
word "chieque" mean there? Wlien you go
to the definition in the immediately preceding
clause, you find that a clieque is defined as
being "any order drawn upon or addressed
to a bank." Then,' if you refer back to find
wliat tlie word "bRnkà" means, you will find
that under tliis statute it is a bank to whicli
tlie provisions of tlie Bank Act apply. So
it is only a chieque upon a bank to whicli
the Bank Act applies, namely a Canadian
bank, tliat requires a stamp, and 1 arn utterly
unable to see the sliglitest autliority in law
for compelling the liolder of a United States
clieque to stamp tliat clieque before lie cashes
it in a Canadian bank. It is perfectly clear,
I think, that tlie Act applies only to cheques
drawn upon Canadian hanks. The mnan to
stamp the cheques is the man who draws
thern, not the payee. In tlie case of tlie
United States cheques, of course, this duty
falîs upon tlie payee. Tliat is just an additional nuisance, one of the pinpricks that
make taxation of tliis sort very annoying to
business men. Ail I can ask is tliat the riglit
honourable leader of tlie Government will
caîl this matter to tlie attention of bis colleague the Minister of National Revenue,
under whose administration this part of the
Act is placed, and sec to it tliat tliese instructions to the banks are cancelled. Our Canadian banks, 1 sulirit, ouglit not to lie told
by a departrnent of tlie Canadian Government
what tliey mnust do about United States
chieques.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I can see
no flaw in the reasoning of tlie lionourable
senator frorn North York. It appears to me
that his law is good and that the Act as it
stands intends that a stamp shah lie aflixed to
a clieque issued on a Canadian bank. I will
comply witli the honourable gentleman's request and bring lis argument to the attention
of tlie Minister of National Revenue. I do
so because of my conviction that tlie Iaw,
wliatever it ie, wlien concurred in by the
three branches of Parliament, should lie observed precisely as it is written.

SENATE

600

I feel, though, that when the law comes
to be revised it should be amended so as to
include American cheqtes when they are
presented to Canadian banks for payment.
A man who is fortunate enough to get an
American cheque in these times can afford to
put six cents in stamps on it when he utilizes
any of the banks of Canada for its collection.
He bas to pay for collection, but the banks
receive advantages from the state, and there
is no reason why the state should not get
something out of it too.
Furthermore, if I had my way, I would
not have any five-dollar exemption. It seems
to me that all cheques, even down to those
of the lowest amount, might well pay a threecent tax, exception being made in the case
of the ordinary milk and cheese credit slips
which go to farmers in the various provinces,
and which are in a different category. Why
we should make an exception of a cheque of
less than five dollars I do not know. 'It is
really the lazy man's cheque, and, further,
it is the cheque of the man who is trying to
defoat the revenue tax. Men will multiply
the number of five-dollar cheques they issue
in order to avoid paying the three-cent tax;
and when a man wants to use the banks for
payments of less than that amount there
is rio reason why he should not pay. I have
bad a computation made which shows that
.f all cheques under five dollars bore a stamp
there would be an increase in revenue of
$1,000,000 a year.
That is, assumHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ing that the same number of choques wero
issued.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; that is
making an allowance for a contraction in the
number of cheques. There would bo a revenue
of $1,000,000 a year. If I were Minister of
Finance I would sec that it was secured.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Last year the budget
did contain a provision, I think, that all
cheques should bear a stamp; but owing to
representations made to the Government at
that time by a number of co-operative
societies, more particularly farmers' societies,
the Finance Minister reconsidered the matter
and made an exemption in the case of cheques
of less than five dollars.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those classes
should be excepted.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I think I am the one
wh1o was responsible for having the exemption raised from five to ten dollars, and I was
very proud of that fact. However, I think
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the five-dollar exemption is all right. I was
thinking of cream cheques to farmers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are not
in regular cheque form. They should be excepted.
The preamble was agreed to.
The title was agreed to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.
THIRD READING
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
INTERNAL ECONOMY AND
CONTINGENT ACCOUNTS
REMUNERATION OF RESERVE REPORTER
Hon. Mr. DANIEL, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Internal Econony and
Contingent Accounts, moved the adoption of
the third report of the committee:
The Committee recommend that the remuneration of $3,000 per annum paid to Mr. Thomas
Bengough be discontinued as fron the first
of October, 1932; and that thereafter his
renuneration as a Reserve Reporter be at the
rate of $100 per month.
The motion was agreed to.
DEBATES AND REPORTING
REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS moved concurrence
in the third report of the Standing Comminttee
on Debates and Reporting.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have net
had any communication with the committee,
and, as this recommendation involves an
added expenditure, J should like to ask the
chairman of the conimittee just what consideration moved it to niake the reconmendation at this time.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is the right honourable gentleman referring to the cominittee on
Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I understand that this is a recommendation of the
Standing Cormmittee on Debates and Reportng.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I notice that
the committee recommends that the Civil
Service Commission be requested to take the
nocessary action to fill the position of Parlianentary Reporter, Senate.
The position iS
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS:
vacant.

MAY 25, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There has
been a vacancy for some time. We should be
assured that there is need of filling it.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE. The position
bas nlot really been vacant; but there is a
vacancy now to be filled because the man who
bas been doing the work is going out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I see.
The motion was agreed to.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. CAIRINE WILSON moved concurrence in the third report of the Standing
Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want to
caîl attention to the third clause of the report.
I arn not altogether clear myseif, because of
inexperience, as to .Iust wbat the effeet of
the recommendation is, or to whom the
recommendation is addressed. If it is merely
te the officers of this House as an integral
part of Parliament, then it might have final
effect, and, if so, I think we should consider
it carefully before launching on a plan for
further beautifying the grounds by obtaining professional advice at this time. If there
is' room for discretion after the adoption of
the report, I have no objection to its adoption.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: The committee,
in making this report, felt that in consideration of the importance of the grounds surrounding this building, to which. very little
attention scems to have been paid, not one
of us was qualified to spcak authoritatively.
Personally I made a few suggestions last
autumn, which were carried out, but ail the
members considered that if we could obtain,
professional advice it would not involve any
additional expenditure at the moment, but
the plans could be carried ont as the funds
became available.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The most expen.sive thing 1 know of is expert advice.
That is what I was worrying about.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: I think any
landscape architect would be. very pleased to
d-raw up plans,. and the expenditure would
be slight. We might even have a competition.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As long as
the matter is at the discretion of the Government, as I presume it is, I have no
objection to the passing of the recommendation. I say this without reflecting at ail on
the recommendation. I do not want to be
responsible for a definite commitment if there
is no discretionary margin lef t to the Governiment after the resolution passes.

501

Hon. Mr. BLACK: This report is not at aIl
out of line with previous reports that have
been submitted by týhis committee, if I remeiber rightly. I have nlot the report before
me, but it says that the pl-an, if aqpproved, may
be carried out if and when funds are available. It should be borne in mind that we
were not speaking *of legal advice when we
referred to consultation on architectural
features, which we hcope would be not se
expensive.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
reliable.

And more

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Since I have been on
this committee we have made recommendations for ohanges in the arrangement of
shrubbery and lawns and that sort of thing,
but I have 'found 'by exiperience in such
matters clsewhere that that is a poor way of
working. We should have an objective, and
a Iandseape gardener or architect, or even
an ordinary man with common sense, could
make some plan towards which the work of
the future could be directed. T-hat is what
the 'chairman and aIl the members of this
cornrittee had in mind-that there should be
some plan or arrangement towards which this
committee oould work when money was
available, so that we should not be ýwasting
money by taking some shrubbery away from.
Queen Victoria's monument, let us say, and a
few years later putting shruhbery back ini the
samne place; or by having some flowers placed
near the retaining walIls, and a year or two
afterwards perhaps taking them away. Such
has been the history of the work done 'by a
similarly constituted committee in the past
thirty or forty years. The ides, therefore,
wa.s to have a plan that could be worked on
and g.radua'lly put into -effeet as the years
went on, so that in after years this Parusament Hill would be a beautiful place which
every-body would want to sce.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I understand that
if the report is adopted a copy will be sent
te the «Minister of Public Works, for him to
act on it as hie sees fit.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable members,
should the committee not be a joint committee of both Houses? The -report from the
Senate committee goes to the Department
of Public Works, as I think sîl the work of
the committee has to do with that department, and I suppose that ini ninety per cent
of the cases that is the last that is heard of
the recommendation. If we *had a joint
committee of both Huses we might get
some action.

SENATE

502

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable senator from London (Hon. Mr.
Little) is absolutely right. I cannot understand why this should not be a joint committee. We have no distinct and separate
interest in the grounds. Has the committee
taken into consideration -the possibility of
having this responsibility transferred to the
Federal District Commission? That commission has the organization, it bas architectural
assistants, and I should think it could administer the grounds much better than they could
be administered by the Department of Public
Works separately. My information is that
the Rideau Hall grounds have lately been,
or are very soon to be, transferred to the
supervision of the Federal District Commission. I earnestly hope that this is correct. I
think nothing is more absurd than to have
the Rideau Hall grounds subject to the alternating whims and views of temporary occupants. The same may be saidi of these grounds.
I would suggest that next session we should
go about getting a joint committee, and that
the present committee should at once take
into consideration the wisdom of turning over
these grounds to the Federal District Commission.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It was suggested at yesterday's meeting of the committee that it
would be an excellent thing to do something
of that kind. While I have been on this committee, ever since I have been in this Huuse,
the Deputy Minister of Public Works has
always been available and has done what he
could. It can be readily seen that a committee of this kind cannot carry on satisfactory work unless it has a plan. The Federal District Commission bas an organization,
and the work might well be handed over to
that commission.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: This committee
is supposed to have jurisdiction at the
moment over the grounds here and at Major
Hill Park and at the Museum. It does not
Eeem to be a very pra'ctical way of working
that the man in charge has to cover so much
rround at the three places.
The motion was agreed to.
COMMERCE

AND TRADE

RELATIONS

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The motion of Hon. Mr. MeLennan for the
idoption of the third report of the Standing
Committee on Commerce and Trade Relations was agreed to.
PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can the right
honourable gentleman inform the Senate when
we are likely to prorogue?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a
variation in the opinion that has reached me.
This afternoon I infonmed some honourable
gentlemen opposite that we probably would
prorogue at 11.30 to-morrow morning, but in
the meantime I have had restored the hope
that we may finish some time to-night. My
suggesition now is that we calif it six o'clock.
The Supply Bill has to come over from the
other House, and if it is sent over to us this
evening it may be possible to prorogue a
short time afterwards.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: From the informaition that I have, which is very sketchy
and unauthoritative, I think there is no
As soon
chance of prorogation to-night.
as I am assured of that, I intend to move
that when the Senate adjourns it do stand
adjourned until tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock. As far as one can sec now, prorogation to-morrow morning is a moral certainty.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The Royal Society
meets at 10 oclock to-morrow morning.
Manv of the members of both Houses belong
to that society. Could not the right honourablIe gentleman say 11 o'clock, or half-past
eleven?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Is there no chance of
prorogation to-night?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall know
probably in the course of two or three, or
maybe five minutes.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: We will wait for an
heur.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In the event
of there being no chance to prorogue to-night,
I suggest adjourning till 10 o'clock to-morrow,
for the reason that the hour usually set for
forenoon prorogation is Il or 11.30, and I
should not like to have the Supply Bill come
in just a few miinutes before that time. It is
not fair to the Senabe. I am expecting word
every moment. . . . .
I have word that prorogation has been
arranged for 11.30 o'clock to-morrow. I therefore move that when the Senate adjourns it
do stand adjourned until to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
10 a.m.

COMMERCE AND TRADE RELATIONS
PRJNTING 0F EVIDENCE--MOTION
NEGATIVED

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
I cast myseif
upon the indulgence of the House in order
to move:
That 600 copies in English and 200 copies in
French of the evidence adduced before the
Standing Cornmittee un Commîîerce and Trade
Relations of Canada be printed for general
distribution.
I understood that ibis was included in the
motion for the adoption of the report, but
I now find that I was in error.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend had notified us that he intended
making a slight modification, I would have
suggested that in the comparison he makes
respecting our foreign irade he should have
shown the peak year. H1e has indicated two
years afier which there. was a considerable
expansion of trade.
May I ask, does this
motion refer to the report only?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
No. The report
was adopted, but by misiake I did not include
the evidence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The motion
covers only the report, flot the evidence?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: 'The printing of
the report was authorized previously, but the
evidence was omiited from the motion. This
motion envers the evidence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has it been considered by the committee to be of sufficieni
importance to justify the priniing of it?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I should like to say a
word or two before the motion is put. The
principle involved in the motion now before
the House was raised and discussed in regard
to a motion yesterday or the day before,
and I have since been giving the maiter a
luttle furiher consideration.
I think we
perhaps made a mistake the other day in
ordering the printing of ail those copies in
English and in French.
In view of the
depressing times througb which we are passing,
and the absolute necessity for economy, I

503

thînk this House is probably going too far
in emharking on such an expense. I was very
much impressed hy the remarks of my honourable friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) and others in this regard, and I
have nu doubi they will support me in the
contention that it is questionable that this
printing should be ordered. We must remember that the proceedings of the committee
have not attracted a great deal of attention,
and while the content of the report might be
of general înterest, it is a question wheiher

it is of sufficient interest to j ustify the expense
of printing ai this particular time. For this
reason I suggest that in the interesi
of
economy my honourable friends to whom 1
have referred should come to my support in
objecting to the printing of the report under
present conditions.
Hon. R. LEMIEUX:
Honourable senators, I was sincere when, yesterday, I made
my objection, on the ground of economy, to
the printing of a certain report. Alihough I
appreciate very highly the work of the commitiee presided over by my honourable friend
from Sydney (Hon. Mr. MoLennan), I believe, wiih my honourable friend from Regina
(Hon. Mr. Laird), that we should not overlook
even small economies ai ibis time.
1 carry wiih me a statement by one of the
besi informed men in the country, a former
civil servant, Mr. Lambert Payne, which was
published the other day in the Montreal Star.
The figures he quoied are simply appalling.
hey show the cnormous extent of the
horrowings hy our federal, provincial and
municipal governments.
For the benefit of
the House I will give the totals, in round
figures.
The Dominion funded debi is
$2.544.000.000; Canadian National Railways
debt, $2,235,000,000; provincial funded debis,
$919,000,000; other provincial debis, $299,000,000; municipal debts, $1,209,000,000. The huge
aggregate of these debis to whioh. Canada is
commitied, and which the taxpayer mnusi
face every day, every week and every monih,
is $7,207,790,028.
It seems to me ihat those figures impress
upon us the warning that we must begin
somnewhere, some day, to practise economy.
I was pleased to see that my friend the Minisier of Finance, Mr. Rhodes, had used the
pruning knife on the estimaies, even ai the

risk of becoming unpopular. H1e could have
gone further, but whai he did was done
heroically, and I congratulate him upon it.
We must not discourage those who advocate
stringent economy, for, as I say, we must
make a beginning in curiailing our expenditures, and thus set an example to the country.

SENATE
May I say to honourable senators--and in
this I shall be supported by those who know
the facts-that many of the municipal governments of this country are unable to solve
without assistance the existing financial problems. The unemployment conditions last year
created a situation which it will be difficult
to surmount. Many municipalities that have
spent money, in conjunction with the federal
and provincial governments-much of which
money could have been saved-will be unable to meet the interest charges on their
bonds. The result will be higher taxation and
a general dislocation of municipal affairs, and
the federal and provincial governments will
suffer in consequence. I appeal to my fcllow
members to support a policy of strict retrenchment.
I must say that in my opinion the report
made to the House by my honourable friend
froni Sydney (Hon. Mr. MeLennan) is suffirient for the purposes of the committee. I
was pleased to read that report, but I submit
that it is not necessarv to make of it another
bliuebook. Since Confederation there has been
an expenditure for bluebooks that is totally
unwarranted. Canada is the only country
in which such a practice is follo wed. In
iEngland the bluebooks that are published
siunder the authority of the Government are
not given away, but arc sold. If you want
1o get one you must go to Marylebone Street
or to Paternoster Row, and you will have
Io pay the price that is set for it. The same
thing is true in France, in which country
official publications are reduced to the lowest
possible number. But here we publish tons
of printed matter, which we spread all over
My honourable friend from
the country.
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) and I, who,
about the
liku poor miîfgrant birds, trax
rural districts of Quebec, often sec copies of
bluebooks in sonie of the old general stores
that still survive. Once more let us set an
exarniple to the rest of the country so that
the people will say that at least the Senate
has made a moxe in the direction of economy.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: The report of
this coimittee represents about the only
effort that bas been made to compile, for the
use of the coming Imperial Conference, valuable information on Canadian trade. I think
the honourable senator from Sydney (Hon.
Mr. MeLennan) and his colleagues are to be
the
congratulated uponb work they have done.
Their report is not very long, and I think that
the proceedings should be published, at least
in English.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

Honourable
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
senators, it strikes me that if we adopt this
motion we shall be departing from a long
established rule of the Senate, that unless
committee proceedings deal with some outstanding matter and publication is essential,
they are not printed. If we print this evidence we shall be establishing a precedent. J
greatly appreciate the material that is contained in the evidence, but, after all, most of
the facts stated are of a statistical nature and
they will bc, no doubt, compiled on a much
larger scale for the benefit of the conference.
Th e refore, I feel that we should not order the
printing in this instance.
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable senators,
I agree with miany of the rema-rks of the
honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieumx), foc no one believes in economy more sincerely than J, and particularly
at the present time. But I remember that
some years ago, in a discussion in another
place, my honourable friend was a very
enthusiastic supporter of the project to build
what is now the National Transcontinental
Railway. I heard him make an eloquent
speech in which be attempted to justify the
cositruction of that road, and I can still picture hin as he said that in a short time we
should require four, and even five, transcontinential railroads.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I fear the honourable gentleman is mistaking me for the Hon.
Mr. Blair.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No; I remember the
occasion. That was the time when cconomy
should have been practised. We all know now
that the National Transcontinental shouild nol
have been built for at least twenty-five ycears
from now. if exten then. A large part of the
ieavy diebts that the honourable gentleman
s lie preare a ttribstable
ha, referred Io
iature constriction of that road. The printing iten that we are considering wouild mean
ais expendture of possibly $300 to $400, and
in my opinion we should not refuse to order
the printing after the good work that bas been
donc by the committee of which my honourable friend from Sydney (Hon. Mr. MeLennan) is chairman. If the information was
worth getting. it is worth publishing, and I
think the motion should be adopted.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
honourabie gentleman from Sydney (Hon.
Has any of
Mr. McLennan) a question?
the cvidence been printed already?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:

No.

MAY 26, 1932
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The evidence of
the Beauharnois committee was printed from
day to day, and the type remained set.
H-on. Mr. MoLENNAN: I shouid like ta
say ta the House, in whose hands my col]eagues of the committee-and I are, that the
report and the evidence were carefuliy designed ta interlock and make a compiete
picture. Further, I want ta emphasize that
every bit of the evidence we heard was given
by experts of the highest standing in the sublects an which they spoke. I feel that if the
proceedings are flot printed a distinct loss
wvili be suffered. In the mail this morning I
reoeived a letter from the secretary of an
important organization asking for copies of
this report,, which he was good enough ta
describe as a very valuable one. But I think
that the report, whioh already has been
printed, does flot carry the weight that it
would if the evidence were published. I
rnig'ht say that the evidence was revised and
condensed by the variaus witnesses.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
HonouTable senators, I ar n ot of the same mind as my honourable friend from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird).
I have flot been convinced that the motion for
printing of the Beauharnois conmnittee's proceedings was erroneous. In the present in-.
stance, I understand the Hanse has. already
d'erided ta print the Teport in Englioh and
French.i
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
Yes. But 1
neglected ta add the word "evidence" ta the
prcvious motion.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The proposai now is
to pýrint the evidence?
Hon. M.r. MeLENNAN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I presume it is naot
vcry lengthy.
Hon. Mr. McLENNLAN: No.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The honourable gentleman from Sydney (Hon. Mr. MaLennan)
has told us that the repart and the evidence
interlock. I think the ýcommittee deait with
matters in which. we are ail greatly interested,
and for my part I arn going ta adhere ta
the principle 1 fallowed the other day, and
vote for the printing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: Lest hanourable members may vote under a inisapprehension, may I say that my information from
officiais is that the printing in English would
cost about $300, and the translation and
printing in French would cast an additianal
$700. The whole amount is not large, but
with great reluctance I must express the view

5

that the ýprinting -of the repart itself ought ta
meet the requirements. I know that the
chairman of the committee, in common with
most of us, is greatly interested in the subject
on which evidence *was given, but I venture
ta say that the public are flot nearly a.s
interested as they ought ta be. The multitude of reports bas rather choked the puiblie
appetite, and many officiai publications are
neyer looked at. H.owever, I ar nfot going
ta ask anyone ta follow me in this matter.
I should think, thougb, that in view of the
consideraible opposition ta tbe prînting of the
proceedings, the Hanse migbt well be saýtisfied
at this time ta -order the publication of the
report alone.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: May I cawll the
attention of the Hanse ta the fact that a large
part of the translation casts is made up of
the salaries of the French transiatars, wha, I
understand, are .paid by the year?
Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN: If that were
so there would be virtually no extra cost, but
my information fram the officiaIs is that the
translation wauld mean an expense of $700.
The motion of Hon. Mr. McLennan was
negatived.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4
FIRST READING

Bill 101, an Act for granting ta His Majesty
certain sums of money for the public service
of the financial years ending respectively the
3lst March, 1932, and the 3lst March, 1933.Right. Hon. Mr. Meighen.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable membeýrs, inasmuch as
we cannot amend this Bill, there would be no
purpose in gaing inta Committee upon it,
but there are anc or two features ta which I
may caîl attention by way of explanation. I
may say that it is the usual Appropriation
Bill. Fractions of the amounts required for
certain purpases have previousiy heen voted,
and clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill appropriate
for these purpases the balances nat hitherta
authorized by legisiation. To particularize,
clause 3 of the Bill refers teo the balance of
the appropriation required for 1931-32. Clauses

The remainder of the Bill consists of the
schedules.
This Bill is strictly a money Bill, and
subject only to rejection; therefore I see no
object in going into Committee upon it.
May I call attention to an error in the
marginal note to clause 4, which reads,
"$8,440,000 granted for 1923-33." It should be
1932-33. I do net think we should imper-il
the constitution by seeking to amend even a
marginal note. Possibly calling attention to it
will result in its being corrected.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose the
Supply Bill includes all supplementaries.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Is it provided that
any borrowing will be done via the banks, or
will it be through the issuing of bonds?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would be
by bonds, in the usual way. The clause rends:
The Governor in Council may, in addition to
the sums now remaining unborroed and negotiable of the loans authorized by Parliament by
any Act heretofore passed. raise by way cf
loan, under the provisions of The Consolidated
Revenue and Audit Act, 1931, by tle issue and
sale or pledge of secuirities of Canada, in such
forim, for such separate sums. at seih rate of
interest and upon such other ternis and conditions as the Goverior in Council nay approve,
such sun or suis of money as may be required,
not

to exceed

hundred million dollars, -for public works and
general purposes.
I presume that is a stereotyped clause that
has come down through the years.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, I understand that considorable effort has been made to reduce the
expenditure authorized by tbis Bill. I was
struck with the figures placed upon Hansard
the other dax by the honourable gentleman
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRao), in which
ho showed that, in comparison with the expenditure that could not bc controlled, the
controllable expenditure was very seall. Of
course the query in all cur minds is: How
can we reduce that expenditure? The question may be approached from many angles.
I suppose that expenditures on public works
could be tested in every item; also the expenditures for purposes of defence. I have
seen somewhere a rather large figure for military aviation-a figure which bas somewhat
surprised me. I am not absolving the Government of wxhich I was a member from all
blame for the increase in that expenditure,
which, I will now confess, struck me as being
of a somewhat doubtful character. I have
to accept my share of the responsibility.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I have in mind chiefly, however, the Civil
Service of Canada. I do not know what is
the total expenditure under that head, but I
know it is very large. We have an army of
civil servants. Yesterday I spoke of the
heads of the departments or branches and the
various experts as highly qualified men. Upon
But
that point I will not dilate further.
there lingers in my mind a thought that came
to me some years ago when a Senate committee was engaged in an endeavour to
ascertain whether or not the Civil Service
was really overmanned. We examined the
heads of all departments and of virtually all
branches. One or two of those in authority.
deputy ministers, admitted at that time that
they took it for granted that a man entering the Service entered it for life, and that
it was not their business te do anything, even
to lift a finger, to oust him from his position.
That was a very important statement, and indicated a very dangerous situation. In the
organization of the staffs of all large institutions in the country there is some elasticity:
they may be increased or reduced. But according to the statements we heard, once a person enters the Civil Service he is convinced.
and his superiors are of the same conviction,
that he is tliere for life, whatever changes or
transformations may occur. Such is the tradition.
Now, if that is the opinion of the deputy
ministers and the heads of branches, I would
ask whose business it is, when one, two,
five or ten employees in a department or
branch have become useless through changed
conditions, to soe that they are transferred
to other departments or branches. We went
into that question with the Civil Service
Commission at the time, and the commission.
it seemed, was not empowered to go to the
lengtlh of examining into departments to ascertain whether any departient had too iiany
employees, some of whom should be transforred to other departments.
In view of the situation which confronts us,
I wonder whether my riglit honourable friend
would not ask his colleagues te ponder over
the situation that I have outlined and to consider this state of mind of the heads of
departments. It may be that a very large
saving could be effected in that sphere. I am
not asking for the retirement of hundreds
This is a matter for the
of employees.
Government to decide. The Civil Service
Commission or some other authority might be
asked to deal with the matter, and men wlo
could be dispensed with might be placed at
their disposal for transfer to other departmonts. I think that if this were done a considerable saving could be effected.

MAY 26, 1932
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I should add
one point, which bas just been suggested to
me by the honourable gentleman from Moose
Jaw (Hon. Mr. Ross), namely, that the opportune time for reduction in a staff is when
a member of that staff dies or is pensioned.
The Deputy Minister might then examine
into his organization and see whether he could
not, by rearranging his staff so as to distribute
the load, get along without a new appointment.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
done.

It can easily be

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was going
to express pleasure at the enthusiasm of the
honourable gentleman -opposite for Civil Service reform, now that he is out of the Government. I know that he realizes what a
difficult problem it is. The whole Civil Service situation has appealed to me for a long
time as one worthy of a great deal of attention-very rigid and drastie attention-at
the hands of governments, but nothing bas
impressed me so much as the diffieculty of
handling just that phase of government. The
Administration of which my honourable friend
was a member did not take very great chances
with its popularity in the city of Ottawa
by adopting any drastic policy with respect
to the Civil Service. The present Administration can at least point to the results of a
drastic policy, whether it gets credit for it or
not. The conviction within a wide radius of
where we stand is that economies have been
exercised to the distress of the Civil Service.
Certainly I do not think I should be a very
successful candidate in the city of Ottawa.
Honourable gentlemen opposite who have
been in governments decided that in this
respect they would not suffer a handicap, and
they never did. I admit, of course, that the
situation to-day is different. Financial conditions are much more stringent than they
were. There bas been a great contraction of
several departments. The Interior Department, for instance, bas been very much reduced.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Have some of
the officers of that department who were in
charge of the natural resources been transferred to the Western Provinces?

507

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. So
far as the Government can promulgate orders,
it bas not failed to see that persons who have
become unnecessary because of a contraction
of services are pjaced first in line for vacancies
as they occur. Of course, the machinery
of the Civil Service Commission interposes
itself at all times, and to that machinery, as
the law provides, we must submit. Under it,
the permanent heads of departments have
more to do with selections and appointments
than have the political heads, and they are
very fertile in reasons why the person whom
they prefer should be appointed, and not someone from somewhere else. However, on the
whole, I fancy that those who have been
more closely associated with the subject than
I have been agree that they have had very
good co-operation from many of the permanent
heads. All I can say is that I think the people
of our country who suffer least in these
anguishing times are those in the employ of
the Civil Service of Canada or its provinces.
I am inclined to think that there bas been
too much protest on the part of some, at
least, by reason of the measure of contraction
that bas already taken place. I must not sit
down, however, without admitting cheerfuily
that, generally speaking, that contraction of
pay bas been very well reiceived; and to those
who cause me to make the admission I desire
to pay tribute.
I do not want what I say to be construed
as opposition to what bas been said by the
hpnourable senator opposite. I merely regret
that it was not given executive force a few
years earlier.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We were then
in times of prosperity.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: May I take a few
moments to give my views with respect to
a matter which may or may not be involved
in the legislation before us, but which is
financial in character? I refer to the system,
which bas come into being very recently, of
making loans to the different provinces which
have found it necessary to obtain assistance
from the Federal Government. The right
honourable leader of the House will know
that such a practice bas come into being in
the last year or two on account of the exceptional conditions, and that formerly no
province had found it necessary to call upon
the Dominion Government for assistance in
financing. I think the principle behind such
assistance is wrong; that it rather tends to
lessen the self-reliance of the provinces in
solving their financial problems. I believe
that some of the provinces that have found

SENATE

508

it necessary to ask for aid from the Dominion
Government would net have had to take that
course if greater care had been exercised with
regard to certain capital expenditures that
those provinces made. Many of the public
works in those provinces have been of the
kind that does not produce revenue, and the
result is that the governments are compelled
now to seek federal assistance. I should like
to point out that the Legislature of the
Province of New Brunswick, from which I
corne, has been very careful in supervising
the capital expenditures of municipalities.
When municipalities came to the Provincial
Government for authority to issue bonds for
eapital outlays the proposals were very carefully scrutinized by the Government and
members of the Legislature. with the result
that to-day the municipalities of New Brunswick are in good financial shape. My personal opinion is that, if some provinces must
come to the Dominion Government for aid
in financial matters, some supervision should
be exercised Iv the Dominion over capital
expenditures of the provinces. Great care
should be taken in approving the public
works of those provinces, and before they
are undertaken the sanction of the Dominion
Government ought to be necessary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I desire to
express appreciation of the speech of the
honourable senator fron Saint John (Hon.
Mr. Foster), with whose remarks I wholly
agree. The Government has lately come to
the assistance of provinces, but only becaujse
of the principles that apply in extremis; although after assistance has been rendered and
the other parties te the contracts have been
able te breathe more freely, they have not
bren eager to explain to tiheir people that they
have been in extremis. Of course, we have te
realize that anything in the way of a crash,
or serious embarrassment, resulting in something that I should net like to name, would
have a bad effect not only on the Dominion
but on every province. It lias been a case
of choosing between the Iesser of two bad
resuilts. I am net sure yet that the chastening effects of what bas happened have been
such that any province would be ready to
submit to supervision of its expenditures.
Supervision of payrnents is more acceptable.
I believe the governments of New Brunswick
and, in more recent times, of Ontario, have
succeeded in establishing a system of supervision of capital outlays by municipalites.
But it must be remembered that the munieipalities were created by the provinces,
whereas the provinces themselves are sovereign
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

states within the limits prescibed by the
British North America Act.
I am glad the honourable senator from Saint
John bas made this speech as to the attitude
of his province, and I sincerely hope that
what he bas said will be read with care by
those in authority in other provinces.
I suggest to the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable leader that, since we are becoming creditors of some provinces, further
consideraition should be given to the proposal,
which was put in the form of a Bill this session, to establish a system whereby annual
payments due by the Dominion to provinces
may be set off against provincial borrowings
from the Dominion.
Hon. R. H. POPE: I suggest that if honourable members on the other side of the
House will look up the record of past expenditures, under Conservative and under Liberal
administrations, they will see where Canada
landed when led by their party.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But-

Hon. Mr. POPE: The honourable gentleman is hopping again, but he cannot hop
with me. Just take the time to look up the
records and make a comparison as to the
financial condition of the country before and
after Sir Wilfrid Laurier came into power.
Under Liberal administration we landed in a
deep diteh.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

On a pile of gold.

Hon. Mr. POPE: No, in a dismal ditch.
The honourable gentleman's party led us to
that place referred to recently by his leader,
the valley of humiliation. Yeu cannot get
away from that fact, and there is no use in
naking a big noise. Let us have a little peace
and harmony.
Is the honourable
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
gentleman a dove of peace?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Give us a little peace
and harmony. Shoulder your own load. Sir
Wilfrid Laurier said that the Grand Trunk
would cost only $12,000,000 to $15,000,000, but
look up the record and sec what it costhundreds of millions.
The
No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
$13,000,000 or $14.000,000 was for interest.
But what is that in
Hon. Mr. POPE:
comparison with the present figures? Honourable members should net talk nonsense
to this country. They should shoulder their
own load and let the people of Canada know
who led us into the present difficulties. I am

prepared to support measures of economy,
but honourable members opposite should not
try to create the impression that they are
flot to blame for our present difficulties, for
they are.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: We are flot.
lon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I should like to
ask the right honourable leader what is the
total amount provided in the Bill for the
reception of the delegates at the Imperial
Economic Conference?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I could look
it up inl the Bill, but -I arn told the amount
is $350,000.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
IMPERIAL ECONOMIC
ACCOMMODATION

CONFERENCE

FOR DELEGATES

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: May I take
this opportunity of saying that it is the
purpose of those in charge of the Imperial
Economic Conference that this Chamber, the
cornmittee rooms of the Senate and also the
private rooms of members of this House
shahl be placed at the disposai of delegates
to the conference. Therefore, ail senators
should see to it that their desks and rooms
are cleared and left in a condition satisfactory
to themselves, knowing that others are to
make use of thern.
I arn not certain where the main meetings
of the conference will be heid, but I am
advised they rnay possibly be in this Chamber.
in that event, if At is decided to aliow the
galleries to be used-personally, I hardly think
they will be, for 1 know such a procedure was
not foliowed in England-the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod shouid sec to iA that
members of the Senate are given tickets
entitling them to preference in admission to
the galleries. Any Imperiai Conference meetings that I was privileged to attend were not
opened to the public, and I presume those
of the coming conference will flot be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable leader has told us that not only the
Senate Chamber and committee roorns, but
also the private rooms of senators, wiil perhaps be made avaîlable for the use of delegates. It seems to me the matter should
have heen put before this Chamber in the
form of a suggestion, but I accept the statement as made. That being so, as some honourable members have gone away, taking their
keys with thern and leaving papers in their
desks, I suggest that the Clerk of the Senate

should write a circular letter to senators asking
that if they wish any papers forwarded ta
them they should. send in their keys.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
Alter which the Riglit Hon. the Deputy
Governor General was pleased to close the
Third Session of the Seventeenth Parlianent
of the Dominion of Canada with the following Speech:

Honourable Menbers of the Senate:
Menbers of the House of Commons:
I desire to thank you for the careful attention you1 have given to the various measures
submitted for your consideration during the
present session of Parliament.
The zealous
disiaige of your duties nanifests alike, a deep
concern for the welfare of Canada and an
unshaken confidence in its future.
It is gratifying to observe that the program
of econoniy for the current fiscal year wil1
ensure relative equalization of revenues and
expenditrres, and that the additional moneys
necessary to provide for the publie service will
be obtained without adverse effect upon the
rost of living or impairment of the national
credit.
My Government's policy of unemploynent
and farm relief, consistently and vigorously
pursued, bas already achieved an amelioration
of conditions and forecasts steady and continued
improveient in both agrarian and industrial
communities.
The means by which a larger area of
distribution has been secured for the coal
production of the Maritime Provinces will do
munch to relieve conditions heretofore prevailing
in that part of the Dominion.
The nieasure for national ownership and
control of radio broadcasting provides the
necessary assurance against foreign interfer-

ence with broadcasting from Canadian sources,
and ensures to our people, without regard to
class or place, equality of service from the new
broadcasting system to be inaugurated as soon
as practicable.
The commercial agreement negotiated with
the Dominion of New Zealand and ratified by
Parliament is a further step towards closer
empire econoniic association based upon the
principle of reciprocal benefits.
The enquiry by a committee of the House of
Conmmons into the operation of the Civil Service
Act prepares the way for a reorganization of
the Civil Service Commission and the better
administration of matters pertaining to the
Civil Service.
Aioong other important measures enacted
were Bills respecting the Patent Act, Unfair
Coipetition in Trade and Commerce, the
Export of Gold, Insurance, the Fisheries Act,
the Judges Act, the Excise Act, the Companies'
Act, the Soldier Settlement Act and the Railway Act.
Approval las been given the British Commonwealth Shipping Agreement, the International
Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the
Field, the International Convention relative to
the Treatment of Prisoners of War, the International Convention for Limiting the Manufactbre and Regnlating the Distribution of Narcotic
Drugs.
Members of the House of Commons:
J thank yon for the provision you have made
for the publie service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
J do sincerely commend the fortitude and
patience with which the Canadian people have
endured the trials and hardships of these
troubled times. Those attributes have equipped
thein to surnount whatever difficulties nay yet
be
encountered
before
prosperity
returns.
Recurring disturbances in world conditions have
hindered our progress.
The prosperity we
rightly expected before this time bas been by
them delayed. For no nation can alone resist
the influence of the universal disruption of
financial and industriail conditions.
Near at hand are the means by which this
country, organized and prepared, may hasten its
Within two months' time
economic recovery.
an Economic Conference of the countries which
compose the British Empire will meet at
Ottawa.
Froni that conference may arise a
power which will bring enduring harmony out
of econonic chaos, and provide the wise and
courageous leadership which in other times of
universal stress, the world looked for and
obtained from the British peoples.
Canada
believes that the closer economic association of
the British Empire will herald the dawn of a
new and greater era of prosperity both for
ourselves and for all the nations of the earth.
In relieving you from attendance upon your
duties, I
pray that Divine
parlianentary
Providence may guide and bless you.
