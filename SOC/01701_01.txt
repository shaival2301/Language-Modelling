SEPTEMBER 9, 1930

wvas born. For these reasons I have accepted
with pleasure and gratitude, and I thank the
Government for having honoured my people
in conferring this privilege upon my humble
self.
The pleasure that I experience is enhanced
by the satisfaction of observing that my old
native province has returned to its past
traditions, and that it will have a considerable
part in the deliberations of a Government
in which ail national elements and all provinces are normally represented, according to
the spirit of Canadian iConfederation.
On this occasion, when we are assembled to
deal with one of the tensest of financial and
economic situations, it is encouraging to observ e the assurance given by each Province of
the Dominion that it xvill co-operate with the
central Government in a common endeavour,
and the attitude of the people as a wholp
leaves no doubt as to what is expected of the
legislators in the way of prompt and united
action. The time seems opportune, then, for
ail men of good-wvill to join together in seeking a solution of the distressing and most
urgent problems that confront us.
Wh'atever dep-ressiýon rnay exist in. other
parts of the world, Canada as a young country
overflowing with. resources that are still almost intact, free from the crushing burdens
with which older countries are laden, should,
it seems, escape from the general situation
and advaoce untrammeled in her natural develýopment.
The fiscal laws occupy a place in the foreground among the remedies sought, and
to-day, as at ahl times of great economnic
crisis, the Canadian people as a whole have
rendered an irrefutable verdict in favour of
the traditional Canadian policy of protection.
Manitoba, the province to which I arn proud
to belong, has particularly acclaimed this
policy and once more taken a place in the
front rank in giving expression to its patriotism.
If the axiom that lias been laid down,' and
repeated throughout the length and breadth
of the country, "Canada first," has been received everywhere with enthusia;sm, it must
be added that the Canadian people have also
declared their deep conviction that the best
method of maintaining and strengthening
the ties that bind us to the British Empire
is for each Dominion to insure first its own
prosperity. Nor has public discussion left
any doubt as to, the desire of the Canadian
people that the British Preference should be
13995-lê

revised in a way that shahl be net only more
Canadian, but at the same time fairer to,
aIl concerned.
My remarks on the Speech from the Throne
will be brief, like the Speech itself. It carnies
a lesson tauglit by the present situation as
wehl as by recent events, namely, that this
is a time, flot for words, but for action.
Our common and most pressing obligation,
therefore, I venture to say, is to faoe frankly
and in broad daylight the conditions at
present prevailing in our country. We must
find the quickest and most effective remedy
for the unemployment that has resulted from
stagnation in agriculture and in our industries generahly.
The Customs Act amendments announced
and the various modifications in the tariff
wîlh be such, let us hope, as will encourage
the developmcnt of our natural resources by
Canadians -and for Canadians. That they
mnay restore confidence in business, may stimulate our foreign trade, and on our own
markets prevent unfair competition from
foreign countries-this, I venture to assert, is
what is expected of us by the people of this
country.

As you know, I amn a Western farmer. The
problems of the Canadian farmer are the same
everywhere, "and the protection needed by
him, as well as by pensons engaged in other
industries, should cover the entine country.
The failune to sell the wheat crop at satisfactory prices has been one of the causes

encouraging. It will pnobably yield less than
the cost of production. As a farmen I thenef ore make a special appeal for the good-wihl
of all honounable senators to aid and expedite the combined effort to find an outlet for our wheat-a senlous problem, which
bas confronted us for a long time, and the
non-solution of which has caused so much
miseny in the West and throughout Canada.
Assured beforehand of the patriotic spirit
that animates ahl who are members of this
honourable Senate, may I once more urge
them to take that prompt action which the
present situation demands.
1 desire to express, honourable senators, my
sincene thanks for youn kind attention, and
beg to move:
That the fel'-lowing Addreffs be presented to

We, His Maijesty's most dutiful and loyal sublects, the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled. beg leave to offer our humble thanks
to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech
whiuh Your Excellen.cy has addresed to both
Houses of Parliament.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable members,
may I be permitted tu congratulate the bonourable member from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr.
Bénard) on the eloquent address which he
has just delivered. If our friend bas been in
appearance merely a consenting member of
this Chamber, it is quite obvious to us now
that the reason has been his native modesty
rather than any lack of facility when he has
an opportunity to make use of the beautiful
language of his and of my native province.
May I join him in congratulating Mr.
Speaker on the well deserved honour which
has come to him. His Honour and I came
to Parliament on the same day, twenty years
ago, and from my knowledge of his course in
connection with public affairs during that
whole period-a trying period in many respects-I cean frankly say that I know of no
one more deserving of the honour that bas
been conferred upon him than is the honourable gentleman who presides over this House
at the moment.
I desire also to congratulate this honourable
House on the restoration to us of the dignity
of the presence bere of a member of the
Cabinet in full charge of a Department and
with full responsibility, and having the close
connection with ministerial affairs that comes
only to those who have full charge of a
Department and sit regularly with their
colleagues of the Goverrnment. This I say
without any disrespect to the honourable
gentleman across the way (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who bas represented the Government so
ably and affably for su many years. For him
I have the highest respect and unfeigned
admiration; but I an sure that every member
of this House recognized that we were severely
handicapped when we were dealing with affairs
as we have dealt with them during the past
several years, in that the honourable gentleman who spoke for the Government had not
the close connection with ministerial affairs
that bas been restored by the presence here
of the Minister of Labour.
It is not many months since we had another
Speech from the Throne in this Chamber. I
Hon.

Mi.

BENARD.

remember it very distinctly. It was in the
early part of this year. In the maze of words
shrouding the few thoughts that the Speech
contained-in fact, the thought the Speech
contained-we found but one bright spot of
apparent congratulation on the part of the
Government, namely, that there remained unsold in Canada 250,000,000 bushels of the
wheat of the previous year. We were asked,
in a sense, to give cheers for this unusual
condition of affairs; a request to which I
noticed no response throughout the country,
no response on the part of the shipping interests, whose vessels were tied up for want of
cargoes, or the railway interests, who were
silent while the employees of the railroads
worked two or three days a week instead of a
full week. There was no response. And there
is no response to-day from the owners and
growers of the wheat, who instead of having
any cause now to cheer or to repeat the phantom cheers of a few months ago, find that
the standard of value of their wheat bas been
redueed from the dollar of last year to the
sixty cents of this year. As I say, that was
the one bright feature held up to us by the
Government of the day responsible for the
condition pictured in the rest of the Speech
from the Throne-a picture of falling revenues, of the total disappearance of the balance of trade, favourable to Canada, of which
we had heard year by year ever since the inception of the late Government. All those
things had disappeared, and we were told
that there were 250,000,000 bushels of unsold
wheat.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Whose fault was it?

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
Now we have by
contrast a Government that takes another
view of the situation. I think it is no exaggeration to say that the fortunes of the
wheat crop are the prime factor in the fortunes
of Canada, and that when the position of
wheat is depressed the position of industry
and labour from end to end of Canada must
be affected, and it has been affected, as we
know. Fortunately we now have a new Government, which comes to Parliament not congratulating us that we have added to the
reserve of last year certain other millions of
bushels, but recognizing that there is sorne
duty under the circumstances, and which has
promptly redeemed the promise made to the
people of Canada that, given the opportunity,
it would call this Parliament to enact legislation to put an end to the condition of poverty
and apprehension which has been experienced
in Canada.

SEPTEMBER 9, 1930
Let me say in passing that I do not speak
of the experience of Canada as anything
peculiar to us, as anything discouraging to
this Dominion. As I see it, this Dominion
is the most prosperous place in civilization.
I say that without any reservation. Thanks
to the courage and enterprise of the Canadian
people, as a people, our prosperity has been
and continues to be unexampled, particularly
in comparison with that of the United States,
Australia, or the Mother Country. I have no
words of gloom or discouragement to speak
about the Canadian situation, but I do say
that amongst ail British people we are alone
in having had up to the present a Government that failed to recognize it had any duty
in the circumstances, and that was content to
allow us to drift, in the hands of Providence
solely, and ignored what we have ail been
taught, and, I think, believe-that Providence
helps those who help themselves.
We have now a Government determined
that Canadians, through their Parliament, shall
help themselves, and in the Speech from the
Throne we are promised legislation that will
enable Canadians to be put to work, and will
give to industry of ail kinds in Canada the
courage that will prevent the further displacement of staffs--a displacement that can easily
be blamed upon the late Administration, because it has been caused not se much by any
actual hardship on the part of employers as
by the widespread feeling of uncertainty that
prevailed as to the future so long as we
drifted without a controlling Government.
I have no intention of going into subjects
that would be proper to the debate on the
Address on an occasion other than this, where
Parliament is called for a special purpose. If
the occasion were different I should like to
take the recent heads of a number of departments for a "ride," and make plain to them
something that many citizens of Canada think.
But those are subjects that can be dealt with
on another occasion. I should like, however,
for a' few minutes to recall how closely the
incidents occurring in country and Parliament
to-day are following those that took place
when I first had any knowledge of public
affairs. I came into the precincts of this Parliament-in a very humble capacity, it is true
-fifty-two years ago. Let me say that I was
not a member or a senytor; 1 was a messenger
boy for a then member of Parliament, and my
duty was to act as liaison officer between the
press gallery and the printing room of the
establishment where I drew my twenty-five
cents a day. As a small boy I looked over
the heads in the press gallery at the great men

assembled on the floor below, and I wondered
that the Almighty, with the powers that He
possessed, permitted men so great-in my
estimation, of course-to exist without showing His jealousy of them. They were very
great men indeed. On the side of Parliament
opposite te where my immediate attention
was centred I saw the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie, who was then directing the fortunes
of his party. I never heard anything te
the detriment of the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie. Even as a boy, and ever since,
I had nothing but admiration for the
man and his sterling character. It was often
mentioned that he was Scotch, and close in
the expenditure of money. Anything more
harsh I think I never heard. We had a great
respect for him. But, as I remember it, the
criticism of his Government was that its members had announced publicly-I was going te
say shamelessly, but that is net the proper
word-publicly, that, although they sat in the
seats of the mighty, they were mere flies upon
the wheel. That was the expression coined by
one of its own members: "We are mere flies
upon the wheel and cannot control the course
of nature." The course of nature of that day
had necessitated in the city of Ottawa, as
well as in other cities of Canada, soup kitchens
where men just as good as any of us were
.carrying down -their little pails, and were
given soup and a loaf of bread to take te
their starving families. Other men just as
good as any of us were sitting on stone piles
breaking stone at sixty cents a toise, in the
middle of winter, and the Government of the
day said: "We are mere flies upon the wheel
and cannot control the course of nature";
just as the late Government said a few months
ago, "All these things are so; the revenue is
gone, the trade is gone; but we have
250,000,000 bushels of unsold wheat."
The Conservative party of that day took
exception te that ideal of government, and an
appeal was made te the people of Canada,
and then, as now, the Conservative party
succeeded in having placed in power a Government that promised to do something te try
te change the condition of affairs and te
put those idle men at some work other than
their daily wanderings from home te the soup
kitchens. I well remember the result.
I hear people say now that the leader of
the new Government has made very lavish
promises throughout Canada, that he will put
te work every person who desires te work;
and they ask, "How is he going te accomplish
it?" The same idea prevailed fifty years ago.
I can give you in a few words an illustration
of how quickly the idea of prosperity bore

SENATE

fruit. The Conservative Government came
into power in the fall of 1878, and so quickly
was confidence restored in the country that
in the spring of 1881, a little over two years
afterward, Canada had courage enough to
embark upon the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Prosperity had been
restored to the country; everybody was working; we were in a position to take up and
carry to a successful conclusion within five
years a project upon which the same Government had gone out seven or eight years before and which meanwhile had lain dormant.
So promptly did Canada recover from the
depression which the false ideal of the Liberal
Government of 1873 to 1878 had fostered in
Canada. Realizing what the Canada of today is in contrast to the Canada of fifty
years ago, I see no cause to doubt that the
Government of to-day can carry out its
promise to the people of Canada to set all at
work, just as the Government of Sir John
Macdonald did fiftty years ago. I think I have
said sufficient for an occasion like this when
I draw this parallel.
I congratulate the Government on having
been so prompt to redeem its promise to the
electors of Canada to institute action at the
earliest possible moment; and I hope that,
having started in this way, it will keep right
on to the end of the road.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members, it is with great pleasure that I .oin
with my honourable friends on the other
side in
oungratulatiing His Honour the
Speaker on his elevation to the seat which
hie now occupies. I kno that his long parliamentary experience will avail him much,
and I assure him, speaking for this side of
the House, that we will do all in our power
to make his tenure of office as pleasant as
possible.
I desire to congratillate also the two members of this Chamber to whom we have just
listened, the one proposing and the other
seconding the motion which is now before
us.
The honourable gentleman from St.
Boniface (Hon. Mr. Bénard) we have not
beard as often as we should like. He represents an important clement in Canada. We
arc all thinking of the fortunes of the West.
We know that he cft the East to become
a pionceer in Manitoba, and we have heard
wilth pleasure of his success. We shoulTd like
him oftener to give us the benefit of his
experience since he has been in Manitoba.
He has spoken of the farming eommunity,
which lie represents in this Chamber. We
are all aware that farming is perhaps the
Hon.

Mi.

TAYLOR.

most important industry in Canada.
We
feel sonewhat apprehlensive when we hear
that i is not doing well, and we join with
him in hoping for better days for the farmers
of the West, for we know the situation has
not been all that it should bc.
I heard with pleasure my honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor).
When he rises in his place I am always prepaued to heaïr some pointed arguments which
perhaps may be hard to answer. This time
hie has not been asHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Aggressive.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I will not
use that word. He has not been as stern.
He always speaks wi'th conviction, and I
admire lis sinScerity.
The honourable gentleman from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Bénard) has said that he was
the first French-speaking Canadian to move
the Address in reply in this Chamber.
I
an under the impression that lie is in error
in this, but I -am happy to see him proposing
this motion to-day.
The honourable gentleman from New Westminster has told us that last spring there
were 250,000,000 bushels of grain still in our
elevators, but that now, under the new Government, we have the promise of better conditions. I should like my honourable friend
to read the short Speech from the Throne.
I think he will have some difficulty in finding any allusion whatsoever to the solution of
that problem. There is the question of unemployment, but I have yet to hear of any
measure to bu brought before this Chamber
or the other one which will help to sell whatever grain remains in the elevators of the
West or at the head of the lakes. We all
are agreed upon the necessitty of finding
markets, and although the Government which
I represented in this Chamber did not succeed
in opening new markets, it hoped to bu
able to du so if it sent a delegation to the
coming Imperial Conference. The Dunning
Budget was framed with that object in view.
It will now bu for the present Government
to secure-perhaps through means which will
be disclosed to us at this short session-the
British market. It is not an easy thing to
do. The late Government adopted a policy;
the present Government may formulate a
different one, of the results of which we shall
bu better able to judge at the next session
of Parliament. I sincerely hope that the
Government's delegation will succeed in bringing about a larger purchase of our grain in
the British market.

SEPTEMBER 9, 1930
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The late Government dissolved Parliament when it eould
have retaîned power for another year. It
appealed to the people, a.nd I am happy to
find that although it lias lost power it lias
not bast the confidence of the counftry. It
is a rare circumstanoe for a Government to
appeal to the people and to receive an inereased vote in, I believe, every province
of the Dominion, without securing the majority of the members eleoted to Parliament.
It is a consolation for the late Governnent,
after having carried on for eight years, to
find that it received the support of a larger
number of citizens thian ever before. The
Government that I represented had a right to
rely upon a repetition of the vote of 1926.
It fared better: the vote for 'the candidates
of the Liberal party was increased by some
hundreds of thousands. I am not quite sure
that the present Governmnent received a
majority of votes of the whole electorate.
If one were to count the votes given to the
various candidates, including thoee who were
defeated as weli as those who were elected,
I helieve it would be faund that a mai ority
of the people ddd not express themsýelves in
favour of the present Government on the
28th of July. However, I do not intend to
stress this point. In this coun'try we have
not proportional representaition; so we must
bow to the inevitable and accept what is
supposed to bie the will of the majority.
The late Government directed the aiffairs
of this country for eight years.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Misdirected.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not recal
in detail the situation we had to face in 1921.
That is well known. The Governinent was
charged with the responsibility of operating
a railway systemn which had large deficîts and
a mounting debt. I suppose no one will deny,
that in the eight years that followed we
rehabilitated and extended that railway
system. What had been a heavy financial
burden, a liability, was converted into an
asset. I rcmember that an honourable gentleman facetiously asked in 1925, "Why don't
we selI the whole thing for a dollar?" Weli,
no syndicate, Canadian, British or American,
would have accepted that railway systemn in
1925 for nothing.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: In 1921.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Iii 1925, 1 say,
no syndicate would have accepted it as a
gift. I wonder if any syndicate could have

been f ound to take it even if we had thrown
into the hargain an annual bonus of 325,000,000 for five or ten years. Honourable senators
who were here in the spring of 1925 will
remember that there was a Committee of
this Chamber which tried to find a solution
of our railway diffieulties. Those difficulties
were so great that we feit they were imperilling our whole financial situation. The
Coinmittee's unanimous report was adopted
in this Chamber, and at that time ail honourable senators were agreed that our railway
system was ini a bad condition. But flot long
after that date-within twelve or twenty-four
months, I think-the railway was showîng a
clear operating surplus of 340,000,000, which
gave the systema a value of 380,000,000. Today, I think, it would be easy to find a
syndicate willing to pay a billion dollars for
it. The 1railway's income now justifies the
valuation of a billion dollars; and, indeed,
in view of Canada's present position and
immediate prospects, it is possible that if the
road were for sale we might secure a bid up
to two billion dollars, which. it appears to
have cost.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor) would perhaps
tell me that it was not the Government alone
that brought about the difference; that the
people also are entitled to credit. That is
undoubtedly so, but the late Government
selected the chief director of that railway
system. If the systemn had been a financial
failure, I suppose the former administration
would have to bear the responsibiity; therefore, it should receive some commendation
because of the success that was achieved.
During the last eight years the late Government enormously strengthened Canada's
financial condition, and as a result there were
surpluses running into the millions. Those
surpluses were not spent blindly, without a
sense of responsibility, but were applied to
the reduction of the national debt. Many a
year-I think every year that the Liberal
party was in power-the Minister of Finance
was able to report that bonds totalling f orty
millions, or fifty millions, or seventy-five
millions, had matured and hie had redeemed
themn with surplus funds. I thînk that is a
laudable policy.
The Liberal Government also reduced taxation. I will no.t go into figures, for honourable members have been present when, from.
time to time, measures providing for reductions in taxation came before this Chamber.
Surely the bringing about of lîghter taxes
merits praîse rather than criticism. Moreover,
during the lifetime of the former Government

SENATE
the annual value of our export trade was
almost doubled. By means of agencies abroad,
of improved transport facilities and of comnmercial treaties-some of which treaties have
been criticized in this Ohamber-our yearly
export trade was built up from $740,000,000
to more than $1,300,000,000. 'Certainly there
is nothing to disapprove of in that.
As honourable senators know, while the
country's debts were mounting, while our railway systemn was totally disorganized and producing formidable deficits, there was widespread pessimism throughout the country. At
one time certain Conservative newspapers carried on a campaign which became known as
the "Whisper of Death." The late Government can boast of having done much to
restore confidence in Canada. It is true that
here too the people co-operated with the
Cabinet, which is but the executive of Parliament, but at any rate the Government
should be given credit for what it did in this
connection. If there had been an election in
the spring or summer of 1929, the then Government would have received a general endorsement. In the autumn of last year and
in the following winter industrial conditions
looked less favourable. But the situation that
then began to develop was not the fault of
the Canadian Government. My honourable
friend frora New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Taylor) will admit that the Federal Government is not responsible for the fact that wheat
did not sell at $1.30 or $1.40 or $1.50 in September or October last. It was a world-wide
condition that forced the price down to the
danger point of $1. The price of wheat is
determined by conditions not in this country
alone, but in a world-wide market. I have
yet to hear of any indictment against the
late Government for omitting to do anything
which would have better enabled the farmers
of the West to sell .their grain.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Taylor)
says that the price has gone down to sixty
cents. I do not agree with that. That figure
has been fixed as the basis of an advance to
the farmers, and I hope and pray that the
selling price will go beyond a dollar.
In any event, who is responsible for the
existing situation? I will not dare to accuse
the Government which has been in office
since the 28th of July of having caused the
price of wheat to go down firom $1 to sixty
cents. The present low price is due to a falling -off of demand in a wotld-wide market.
There are countries in Europe, such as Italy,
France, Germany, and some countries on the
Mediterranean, which night appear to be
possible markets for our surplus wheat. Yet
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

those countries are trying to beaome selfsufficient.
There is Great Britain, but she
has other associations and interests desirous
of making the best possible bargain. It is a
question whether we shall be able to secume
and permanently metain the British market.
This brings us to a consideration of the
coming Imperial Conference. I can express
no opinion of what the present Government
mnt.ends to do with a view to securing the
British market for Canadian wheat. Possibly
we shall hear a statement at this session as
to
the
Government's
proposed
modus
operandi.
I should be surprised if this appeared in the forra of a Bill, for I cannot
imagine any kind of legislatilon within the
power of this Par'liament which would solve
the wheat probem. We cannot control the
markets oulside our own country. As I said
at the outset, if the Govemment does suooceed,
through some arrangement
with Great
Britain, in securing a privileged situation for
our grain in that country, no one will be
happier than I.
The late Government was assailed mildly
by my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor) for being what
he teirmed a replica of the Alexander Mackenzie Government, which he likened to flies
on the wheel.
D.uring the last eight years
many a difflcult problen bas been tackled
and solved in the East and in the West. I
have yet to heair of the Maritime Provinces
complaining of the treatment they received
at the hands of the last Liberal administration. We yeaî1 ly heard from the East complaints and recriminations, with which we
shall no longer ha.ve to deal. On this aacount.
too, the late administration is entitled to
credit. Then the Western Provinces were at
last satisfied by the transfer to them of thei
natural resources. The late Goverment,
in
that connection, solved a problem that had
baffled many previois administrations.
Canada's position during the last few years
has been the envy of the whole world.
Publicists, economists. men who know what
statistics mean, have been proclaiming that
Canada is a happy and prosperous land, one
whose 'lot is to be envied. Well, I claim that
the King Govermment, by its diligent and
intelligent efforts during the last eight years,
shaned in the work of bringing Canada to
that enviable position.
Last autumn we encountered an economic
crisis.
My honourable friend from New
Westminster has admitted that it did not
arise in Canada, but was world-wide. The
National City Bank Review of New York,
for the month of July, which was commented

SEPTEMBER 9, 1930
upon by the important newspapers of this
country, explained how it had arisen and
developed. The world crisis began in the
United States. People found from the reports
of the industrial institutions that they were
increasing their production and their sales,
that their profits were large, and their reserves
abundant; so the stock mounted. A six-,percent stock went up to 200, which made it a
three-per-cent stock. But that did not suffice,
and there seemed no reason why the stock
should not go higher. Would not the country
develop from year to year, with an increasing
population? So the stocks crept up to 225
and 250. But all of a sudden the men who
were watching the monthly returns of those
industrial companies began to find that there
was a little 'lackening in production, and
many foresaw that the quotations had
reached the peak, and the time had come to
sell, and rapidly the stocks tobogganed down
to the figures we al know.
This had its reaction on this side of the
line, and we aflso had our Black Friday.
People by tens of thousands, looking at the
stocks rising, were becoming prosperous and
rich overnight, on paper, and were spending
lavishly, and enlarging their domestic budgets.
This increased our own production, but when
all this excitement ,died down, and at the
same time our crop remained in the elevators,
the danger-flag appeared, and the crisis was
with us.
The National City Bank Review, speaking
of the United States, said that its purchasing
power diminished rapidly, and the result was
that the Americans curtailed their buying,
and those countries that were manufacturing
for them had to reduce their prices because
of over-production. Now, mark this situation.
Here were the people of the United States,
highly protected, who had been exporting
$2,600,000,000 worth of manufactured goods,
and yet importing $1,800,000,000 worth, and
who found that the reduction of their purchasing power prevented them from buying
in foreign markets the quantity of manufactured goods which they usually purchased
abroad. As a result, the crisis which had
started in the United States deveaoped until
it reached the confines of the outside world.
Canada was soon in the same situation as
the United States, and its purchasing power
diminished through the financial crisis, which
wiped out hundreds of millions of profits, and
through the 'lack of markets for our Western
wheat.
Now the present Government claims that
it tan reduce imports by increasing the tariff.
It has -one about the country asserting that

the $900,000,000 of imports into this country
could be materially reduced by the raising of
the tariff. I would point out to the Government that the high tariff in the United States
has not prevented the slump. The Government wiHl find that its nostrum will not bring
to this country a return of our prosperous
days. My honourable friends want to stop
the imports of manufactured goods to as large
an extent as they can, but they will noticeI hope not for too long a time-that, regardless of a higher tariff, the conditions that now
prevail in this country, which will continue if
our wheat sells below a dollar a bushel, will
bring about a natuIal reduction in imports,
because imports, as well as the domestic trade,
are influenced by the country's purchasing
power. As I see the matter, my honourable
friends will find that the deerease in purchasing power resulting from the reduction in the
price of our great Western commodity, wheat,
will be reflected in the reduction of our imports. The Government claims that it can
provide our manufacturers with more work
because, when foreign goods are prevented
from coming to this side of the line, a larger
quantity will be purchased from our manufacturers in Canada; but this expectation will
not be realized if the purchasing power of the
people is not increased. It will increase if
we succeed in finding a market for our large
Western crop.
I will not dilate upon the question of unemployment. I am under the impression that
the situation is not ïs bad as some people are
apt to think. I know that in proportion to
our population there is less, very much lees,
unemployment than in other countries mentioned by my honourable friend from New
Westminster. A census has been taken, but
I do not know its exact value. People who
are making a record of unemployment are apt
to include all grades, and I should not care
to run through the gamut of what certain
people may regard as unemployment. There
is always a certain amount of unemployment
in the land. My honourable friends know
that industries sometimes suspend operations
in order to reduce their production, and start
again a few weeks or a few months later.
Some institutions take a holiday and dismies
all their workpeople for some weeks every
year. We have also seasonal unemployment,
though this would not be the case at present,
as we are now in the hardworking days of the
summer. The late Government was of opinion
that there was not such a degree of unemployment as could not be coped with through
the instrumentality of the municipalities and

SENATE

the provinoes, and, if it became more than a
provincial problem, through the help of the
Federal Government.
Let us hope that the legislation to be
brought before us will deal with the requirements of the situation in such a way as not
to involve an expenditure larger than is necessary. We all know that money given is
We must all
apt to be given lavishly.
realize our duty towards those who are unemployed, but there should be very close
surveillance over that kind of expenditure.
That is why the late Governmert thought
that those nearest the people-the municipalities in contact with them-could best judge
what ought to be donc, and with the help
of the provinces, and later on, if need be,
of the Federal authorities, coýuld cope with the
problem. I will defer any comment I may
have to make on the measures to be brought
down by the Government. They are not sufficiently indicated for us to have any inkling
of what they are, because there is but one
phrase in the Speech from the Throne speaking of unemployment. I will nereiy, in conclusion, express the hope that those measures
will be such as will neet with the approval
of Parliament.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, it is not my intention to make an
address in reply to the speech of the honourable gentleman who has just taken his seat.
I am really of the view-and I think many
members of this House will share it-that we
in this Chamber are not much interested in
post-nortem inquiries into the cause of the
defeat of the late Government. When the
tine cornes to introduce in this House the
measures proposed by the new Government,
and to consider whether they should or should
not be adopted, and what will be their effect,
even if we eau only speculate on that, there
will be opportunity for argument on both sides
of the House. Naturally, I shall be delighted
to see that whatever measures are brought
down in this House respecting unmployment
arc fully discussed on both sides, as to their
adequacy and their probable success. In that
discussion I may or may not take part, according to the development of the debate.
The honourable gentleman opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) alludcd to a little slip made
in the renarks, I think, of the mover of the
Address, when he said it was forty years since
the Address had been moved in French. I
am reminded that the honourable gentleman
from DeLanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) some
thirty years ago performed a simiPar function,
doubtless in his own excellent wav. I hope
Hon.

MIr.

DANDURAND.

it will not be thirty years before there will
be a repetition of the event that has taken
place this afternoon.
I congratulate both the mover and the
seconder of the motion on their excellent
speeches. It was gratifying to myself te be
able to understand the very eloquent address
delivered by the mover (Hon. Mr. Bénard)
in his native language. The more comprehensive address by the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Taylor) was replete witih fact and argument,
in which, as we all know, he excels.
I desire to associate myself with what has
been said in the way of congratulation to
His Honour the Speaker. We are all delighted
that after a considerable interval a French
Canadian again presides in this Chamber.
The honourable gentleman who has just been
appointed comes to occupy a difficult position
after the brief, but very satisfactory, regime
of the honourable member from Leeds (Hon.
Mr. Hardy), following the death of Senator
Bostock. We all, on both sides of the House,
recognized that Senator Bostock took his
position most seriously. I am not going to
laud him now-for this is only a passing
reference-but I do net think that any
Speaker could have taken more seriously than
he did the position which he occupied with
such distinction, or could have endeavoured
more, in season and out of season, to make
the work of this House proceed harmoniously
and expeditiously.
If any other member wishes to take part
in this debate to-morrow, I am going in a
moment to move its adjournment, in order
to give a further opportunity for discussion.
I think that we may be able to-morrow to
make an announcement as to an adjournment
of this Chamber; for I do not suppose anybody anticipates that this House will sit
until the end of the week. If I am in a
position to-morrow to make an announcement
I shall be happy to do so. It is quite within the possibilities that to-morrow we shall
be able to adjourn till next week.
On this occasion, the first opportunity to do
so, I wish to allude to a matter to which the
honourable the seconder of the Address (Hon.
Mr. Taylor) has directed your attention-the
fact of a Minister of the Crown holding a
portfolio and having a seat in this House.
That situation meets with my entire approval,
and I hope that nobody will think that my
feelings are injured in the slightest degree by
reason of our having in this House during
a special session, called to deal with a special
subject-the solution of the unemployment
problen-a gentleman than whom there is

an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In 1908, ini the
palmy days -of 'the benign reign of our dear
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was not easy for a
Conservative ta be elected in Quebec. There
muet have been saine peculiar charmi about
our new Speaker, for hie managed ta carry
that county, whieh had been Liberal for a
gaod while. In 1911 hie was easily elected.
On that occasion the Conservaitives from the
Province of Quebec, or those who sided after

SENATE

the election with the Conservative party,
numbered no less than 27-three more than
the number of Conservatives returned by that
province in the last election.
The honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) told me a few minutes ago
that we have pienty of time at our disposal.
When a member becomes old, he never knows
whether he will have another opportunity of
addressing his colleagues; he has no guarantee
that he will be present at a later session.
Even if one were sure of it, there is no
certainty that one would be physically and
mentally able te make an address, or that
one's memory would be sufficiently good. So
I crave the indulgence of this honourable
House in occupying some time this afternoon.
But every honourable senator should feel perfectly at ease, and free to go out into the
beautiful sunshine if he so desires. I am
always sure of an audience here, and cannot
be sure of getting one elsewhere. I know
His Honour the Speaker will stay right in the
Chair, the Clerk of the House and the Deputy
Clerk will be here, and the Hansard reporters
will be present taking down my words, whieh
I hope will be read beyond the limits of this
Chamber.
A seion is like a law suit or a war: you
know when it begins, but you never know
when it will be finished.
As the legislation
we are expecting froin the other House is net
likely te come te us before Friday, and I
think I can finish before then, I will refer
back te 1911.
That was the time of the
wonderful Laurier navy, the time when our
opponents were going about the Province of
Quebec frightening the people with the
picture they were painting. It was a picture
of war, and the theatre of war was the China
Sea. I never knew why they chose a sea so
far removed from Canada, unless, perhaps, it
was to frighten the people more.
They
painted a picture of poor French-Canadian
boys being disembowelled on the decks of
Canadian warships, and their bloody bowels
hanging from the masts and yards of the warshipsSome hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -and vultures picking the flesh from their bones. The honourable member for Rouville (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
tried te explain that there would be no masts
on the modern warships, and consequently no
yards, se that the bloody bowels could net
be hung upon them.

were again displayed on the masts, and all
the eloquence of the honourable gentleman
from Rouville could net convince the people
that their children would net be sent te the
China Sea. Why -the China Sea, I do net
know, except that there are typhoons there,
and that if one were net killed he would be
drowned anyway. I see in his seat the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster). He was
told about that campaign and was asked if
ho approved of it, and he is reported te have
said, "Anything to beat Laurier."
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Now, honourable
mermbers, I do net want you te believe that
my countrymen are cowards and easily
frightened. If they had been coweards there
would be no Canada at all. When the thirteen Engliish-spealking -colonies rebelled there
was one colony that did net turn traiter.
Which colony was that? It was the only
French-speaking colony. The people of that
colony remained faithful and were not afraid
te take up arms against the thirteen Englishspeaking colonies and thus save Canada tc
the Empire. That is history, and I challenge
any honourable gentleman te contradict me
on that. It took place in 1774, when the
Quebec Act was betfore the British Parlýiament. Wh'at I say can be easily verified, because in the Library there is a verbatim
report of the speeches; net ontly the speeches
ma.de in Parliament, but also those made in
committee. Strange as it may seem, there
m'ust have been shorthand writers in those
days.
Lot me say in passing that those
speeches were in beautiful English, dar
superior te the English used in the British
House of Commons to-day, and perhaps
superior also te the English used in this
Parliament.
On that occasion Sir Guy Carleton was a
witness before one of the committees, and he
was asked how many English-speaking people
there were in Canada. Canada did not include the Maritime Provinces, because at
that time they were a separate entity. In
answer he said, under oath, that in 1773 he
had taken a census and that there were the
large number ef 360 Englislh-speaking people
in the country. If anybody has sufficient
curiosity he can verify this also simply by
reading Hansard of the British House of
Commons of that time. He said that, as one
year had clapsed since the ceesus, there
might then be at best 400 English-speaking
people in Canada. Yeu do net believe that
they could have saved the country! He added
further that they were net a very desirable

I amn straying a bit from my compliments man wbo defeated Mr. Lemieux; which lie
to bis Honour the Speaker. As I said, he did in bis absence. D'Iberville, having taken
had been elected easily in 1911. In 1914 he Hudson Bay and eleaned out ail the Englîsh
was called to the Cabinet, and I suppose he posts on several occasions, wrote to Louis
must have been elected by acclamation. I XIV: "Sire, I arn sick and tired of taking
-do flot know anyone in the Conservative party Hudson Bay. Give me some other emiploywho better deserved a reward than our ment." Like D'Iberville, I suppose, our new
Speaker, because he stuck to his guns the member for Rougemont wrote to Premier
whole time. H1e was hounded from piliar to King, "I arn sick and tired of taking counties
post in the Province of Quéec; he and in the Province of Quebec; sa you had better

SENATE

send me to the Senate." So here he is with us,
and I sincerely hope that he will take part
in the debates, after having achieved so many
successes in another place.
During his
occupancy of the speakership, having some
leisure, he went to France and lectured on
the history of Canada at the Sorbonne in
Paris. Those lectures, I am told, were very
well attended, and after their delivery he was
made a member of the Institute of France,
succeeding the universally-known Cardinal
Mercier. After all those successes he was
satisied with a call to the Senate. I hope we
shall hear from him often in this House, and
il ne s'endormira pas dans les délices de
Capoue.
Now I want to speak, if I may be permitted, of the Hon. Richard Bedford Bennett,
for whom I have had the highest admiration
for the last sixteen years; and I will explain
w-hy. In 1914 Right Hon. R. L. Borden
decided to make another gift to Mackenzie
& Mann of $45,000,000, purchasing half of the
worthless stock of the Canadian Northern
Railway, as it was then known. Mr. Bennett
was then 44 years of age and had been in
the House of Comimons only three years, but
he displayed wocnderful courage. I am generally pretty free in talking, but I must confess that I do not know whether I should
have had such courage. Mr. Bennett rose in
that Hiouse and made a wonderful speech,
covering 28 pages of Hansard, occupying
several hours, and delivered with that incomparable vocabulary that he possesses, and his
argumentation was excellent. He was followed by the Hon. W. F. Nickle, who was no
mîean speaker, and although the speech of
M.Ir. Nickle did not perhaps create the senation that the other one did, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier said that Mr. Nickle's argumentation was even stronger than that of the present
Prime Minister. On that occasion Mr. Bennett displayed great independence, and one
of his present colleagues told him that he
would ruin himself with the Conservative
party by adopting that attit.ude. I ask any
member of this House, did he rein himself
with the Conservative party? Now he has
arrived at the leadership.
Mr. Bennett was born on the 2nd of July,
1870; consequently he was sixty years of age
last July. Sir John A. Macdonald became
Prime Minister at the age of fifty-three, and
Sir Wilfrid Laurier at fifty-five. The Right
Hon. Arthur Meighen, when he succeeded Sir
Robert Borden as Prime Minister, was fortyfour. The present leader of the Opposition
lion. Mr. CASGRAIN.

in another place was thirty-two years of age
when he was first elected to the House of
Commons, and forty-seven when he became
Prime Minister. So it will be seen that Mr.
Bennett is a little bit older than the average
Prime Minister on first taking hold of the
reins of office.
Time will prove whether
he will be wiser.
Mr. Bennett was a lawyer at the age of
twenty-three. He went to Calgary shortly
afterwards, and was twenty-eight years old
when he was elected to the Assembly of the
Northwest Territories.
He sat in that
Assembly from 1898 to 1905, and afiter Sir
Wilfrid Laurier createcd the two provinces of
Alberta and Sask atchewan, in 1905, Mr. Bennett was clected to the first Legislature of
Alberita. He was then thirty-nine years old.
He resigned his seat in 1911, at the age of
forty-one, and was elected to the House of
Gommions. He was forty-four when he made
that wonderful speech that I referred to a
moment ago, about the $45,000,000 loan. That
speech has remained in the mincis of the
people because the then Solicitor General
kept nagging at him about it, and Mr. Bennett, perhaps in a fit of temper, said, "I
ivill not repeat what I have already said for
the benefit of the gramophone of Mackenzie
& Maln."
Now, after having paid my compliments to
a number of persons, I will get down to more
serious business. I want to talk about wheat,
one of the most important mitters with which
we are concerned to-day. and the source of
much of our financial trouble. In the Atlantic
Monthly of March, 1929, there is an interesting article by Bernard Ostrolenk concerning conditions in the United States. In
referring to it I shall not be in danger of the
criticism that I am running down our own
Northwest. The article points out that during
the war the price of wheat rose to a high
level, and the immense demand resulted in an
immense production. It was easy to increase
the crop by the use of fertilizers and scientific
methods of agriculture, and for a time the
year's production was eagerly bought up and
turned into flour. But after the war the
demand fell, and, according to this article,
there were too many farmers engaged in production. That situation resulted in increased
migration to th cities. The article indicates
that seven out of every eight farmers in the
United States are just one jump ahead of the
sheriff.
Another reason for the fact that fewer
farmers are required now is that their gasdriven machinery is replacing human labour

SEPTEMBER 10, 1930

in many ways. This might be a convenient
place to refer to an advertisement by the
International Harvester Company to illustrate
the way in which they claim one of their combine machines will save labour. They cite the
case of a farmer who is cultivating 160 acres,
without any hired help. The wife does the
household work, gets the meals for the family,
and attends to light chores.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I understood the farmers
in the West do not work.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They do not do
much, as will be plain before I get through.
The machinery does it nearly all. By the
use of this wonderful machine known as a
combine, this farmer does the actual cutting
of his harvest in 20 hours. He begins work
early in the morning, and at breakfast time
his place on the machine is taken by his
daughter. When he has finished eating and
had a smoke, te goes back to the machine,
and his daughter returns to the house, where
perhaps she helps ber mother until it is time
to leave for school. At dinner time there is
a similar proceeding. The work is carried on
until late in the evening. The combine is as
easy to drive as an ordinary motor car, says
this girl. Not only is the machine a substitute
for much manual labour, but it releases for
the production of grain for human consumption a large area of land which formerly was
used to supply fodder for horses. Unfortunately for the grain growers, there is a limit
to the quantity of bread that human beings
can eat. What is the use of increasing production when there is not a similar increase in
demand?
In the article to which I have referred, the
author says that there are about 6,500,000
farmers in the United States, and that oneeighth of that number would be sufficient to
do the niccessary work. In other words,
800.000 farmers, aided by modern machinery,
could produce alIl the wheat required in the
United States, and sell it at a cheaper price
than now obtained. The only solution would
be for all the farmers to get togeither and out
of every eight select the one who is best
fitted to oarry on the work of cultivation.
The cost of overthead and agricultural implements for opemting eight farms could then
be divided among the eight owners, in accordance with a plan like that suggested a few
days ago by Mr. Beatty. It is easy to see
how much expense would be saved in that
way. For instance, if a combine will harvest
a farm of 160 'acres in 20 hours, surely it can
be used on more than one fanm; perhaps on
as many as eight farms. Co-operation among

the farmers would lower production cost, and
stabilize the plant, output and personnel.
The United States is producing about 800,000,000 bushels of wheat, an average of 13
bushels to the acre. A large part of that is
consumed by the 120,000,000 people in that
country, or an average of about 5 bushels per
capita, but there are left available for export
some 200,000,000 bushels. By the use of
scientific methods of agriculture the total production could easily be doubled. Thirteen
bushels an acre is certainly not a large
average. Around Edmonton the wheat growers
have produced twice that quantity, and sometimes three times as much. If the total production in the United States were doubled,
there would be another 800,000,000 bushels.
Add that to the 200,000,000 'bushels now available for export and there would be 1,000,000,000 more produced in the United States than
could be consumed there. That is more than
Canada, Australia and Argentina together
could ship abroad. Who would consume it?
The efficient farmer succeeds. Why? Because his neighbours fail. If they aU- succeeded, nobody would finally succeed, because
there would then be a catastrophe. Remember Georgia's experience with cotton, and
Maine's with potatoes. In Maine and New
Brunswick during and aiter the war potatoes
were selling for $1 a bushel. What happened?
In the United States the normal potato
crop was increased very largely, the price
consequently dropped, and notwithstanding
the waiving of anti-trust laws, the surplus
potatoes could not be disposed of abroad.
There has been a flood of competition from
Canada againat the surplus wheat crop of
the United States. Now France and Germany are paying subsidies on wheat exported;
so the farmers in those countries undersell the
Americans.
The Soviets have engaged, at large salaries,
a number of experts from the United States
to run faris on a modern basis in Russia.
They have farms, I am told, of 30,000 acres,
or 5,000 acres larger than a township. They
are using the very latest machinery, and I
understand that wheat is, at this very
moment, arriving in England from southern
Russia. The rates of wages and hours of
work for farm labourers are determined by
the Soviets, and if any of the hired help try
to run away they are shot.
To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and
I think it is only right that my honourable
friends from the West should know how
serious the competition is going to be. We
have too many farmers now, and too much
land, under cultivation. We are facing de-

SENATE

creased consumption, aocording to Mr. Ostrolenk's article, although I cannot follow him
in that connection; but I agree with him
when he says that we have to meet eutthroat competition abroad.
I should like to refer now to an article
written by the Hon. Frank Oliver. If there
is anyone who should know about conditions
in the Norbhwest, it is he. He was a pioneer
in Edmonton. The house that he had when
he first went there was so small that one
would not think it possible to get a Cabinet
Minister out of it. He was Minister of the
Interior for some five or six years, and it was
under his regime that the Northwest filled
up se extensively, thanks to the spade work
that had been done by Sir Clifford Sifton.
Mr. Oliver wrote a remarkable article, which
I arn sorry to say I have lost. It was published in 1929, at about the same time as the
other article to which I have referred. He
said that no more wheat growers are required
in the Northwest, and he warned that if we
kept on producing wheat in increasing quantities there would be a surplus of which we
could not dispose. He referred to the cornmon cry that we must have more population-that we must puit more people on the
land, and he quoted the words of that famous
railway builder, James J. Hill: "Land without people is a wilderness; people without
land are a mob; therefore put the people on
the land."
That might have been good logic thirty
or forty years ago, when J. J. Hill was in his
prime, but to-day the conditions are greatly
changed, through the use of gas-driven implements. Mr. Oliver pointed out that if
population would make a country rich, China
should be immensely wealthy, for it has a
population of some 400 millions. For the
same reason India should be one of the richest countries in the world. But it is quality
of population rather than quantity that is
needed. If we bring people from other lands
to this eountry it should be te make Canadians happier and not to provide Canadians
with keener competition in labour.
On the 22nd of November, 1929, the Montreal Herald published an article which has
been widely quoted, especially in the Northwest. It was entitled, "Wheat Pool Defies
Creation." I should like to place on Hansard
the thoughts it expresses.
Let no man imagine that this mighty
drama of the wheat now being staged by the
Canadian Wheat Pool is a harmless little byplay between sellers and buyers, of no particHon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

ular consequence except te those immediately
ooncerned. It is something more than that.
It creates a situation packed to the brim with
dynamite, which in the fulness of time may
explode with catastrophic effect. The inference of the leaders of the Canadian Wheat
Pool is that Canada has attained such a
position in the wheat-growing industry that
she permanently
dominates the
world's
markets, and that as the Pool is the sole selling agent for a majority of the Western
growers it can henceforth diotate the world
price of wheat. Both assumptions are the
vainest of delusions. The Wheat Pool can
no more permanently achieve its object than
it oan stay the planets in their courses.
Momentarily the Wheat Pool has given a
delusive demonstration of its power by holding up the natural flow of wheat to Europe.
It bas reduced the mightiest river of its
kind to a trickling stream. But back of the
dam it bas erected, the great flood of wheat
is gathering power, and not one watershed
alone, but the watersheds of all the earth
are contributing to the ocean of wheat which
will sweep away this man-made barrier. Let
them keep that barrier intact a day too long,
and Canada will be strewn with wreckage
by the devastating torrent thaÀt the Wheat
Pool is creating.
At this very moment wheat is germinating
in the spring in otber lands; it is approaching maturity in the summer suns of others;
it is beinig harvested in still others where
autumn is approaching. The stoppage of the
flow from Canada has but stimulated the
flow from elsewhere, and should that flow from
other sources suffice, as conceivably it can
be made te do, the Wheat Pool, preparing a
feast, will be confronted by a tragedy.
This thing has been tried before. "Corners"
in wheat have been effected, but Nature has
always defeated them in the end. There is a
story, "The Pit," by Frank Norris, founded
on actual bappenings when speculators in the
United States have donc just what the Wheat
Pool is doing-dammed one of Nature's great
life-streams in order to force prices to a higher
level. Listen to this about the leading character in Norris's story-a man who bad
effected a corner in wheat and set a price
below which he would not sell-a man who
had his actual couaterpart in life:
First in one place, and then in another, the
new harvest was coming on the market. It was
the brokers, traders and speculators who foughlt
him now; it was the very E.arth itself. Demand and supply, these were the two great laws
the wheat obeyed. Almost blasphemous in hie
effrontery, he had tampered with these laws,

SEPTEMBER 10, 1930
and had roused a Titan. He had laid his puny
grasp upon Creation, and the very earth herseif,
the great mother, feeling the touch of the cobweh that the human insect had spun, had stirred
*mi
tene
at ]ast in her sleep and sent her
moving through -the grooves of the w,.rld, to
find and crueli the disturber of her appointe
courses. The new 'harvest was coming in; the
new harve.et of wheat, huge beyond possibility
of control; so vast that no money could buy it,
e0 swif t that no strategy could turn it.
The avalanche, the undiked Ocean of the
Wheat, leaping to the laeh of the hurricane,
struck him fairly in the face. The wheat had
broken from his control. For months lie had,
by the night of his single arm, held it back,
but m1ow it rose like the upbuilding of a colossal
byillow. Ilt towered, towered, 'hung poised for an
instant, and then, with a thunder as of the
grin-d and crash of cheotic worlds, broke upon
hirn, burst through the Wheat Pit and raeed
past him, on and on to the eastward and to the
hungry nations.
Yes, it ie a rnighty, a murderous drarna that
is being played by the Wheat Pool in Canada.
And even if, within the few short weeks in
which it is possible, the spectre of famine
overseas sende prices rnounting to the Wheat
Peol's mark, the mornentary surcess will he
dearly bouglit, for higlier prices will precipitate
a flood of plan-ting in other lande, and coinpetition on a mightier scale will face the
Wheat Pool in the corning year.
That article was prophetic, and I arn only
sorry to say that the prophecy has apparently
corne true. The Western Wheat Pool bas decided on an initial payrnent of sixty cents
per bushel on this year's wheat crop. This
very camne wheat the farmer ean seil in the
open market for nînety cents or a dollar. It
is a bard test of loyalty that the Wheat Pool
je giving to its members, a teet the reeult of
which wiIl make or break the organization.
Why conceal it? The brokers, the traders,
the epeculators, have rnade up their minds
-that as -long as there ie a Pool, they will get
their wheat elsewhere if possible. We cannot
get over that situation. I dare eay the banlcs
rneant weIl, but in their an.xiety te secure the
business of the Pool, 1 think they did the
Pool a veoey great wrong by advanring il
money with which to speculate and keep up
the price of wheat. Would not the Pool and
the meinhers of the Pool have been better
off if the banks last year had said, "Take
S1.40-nay, take $1.30 for your wheat"?
Then the provinceý came to tho recue and
made matters stili worse.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Ie the honourable
gentleman sure thet they would have got
11.30 or $1.40?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.
whcat was selling et $1.30.

At that tirne
They have had

to pay the storage and insurance, and they
have lost the interest.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I think: the honourable gentleman is mistaken.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is a free
copntry, and one enu tbink as one likes.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
friend ehouki not misinformn the House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Now I turn to
South Africa. I do not know whetber honourable members of this House are aware of thp
prodigious developrnent thaît bas taken placi?
'in that country. As you know, the equator
dîvides South Africa juet about in haif, and
-in the southern part of Africa the Empire lias
increased its area by one-e.ighth within the
-past few years. Lord Maiehett said the other
day that there were 14,000,000 square miles in
-the Britishi Empire--I had aiways thouglit
there were 15,000,000-but that since the war,
through the accession of the Gernian colonies
end. soute other lands that have been taken in,
including Tanganyika and Western South
Africa, some 2,000,000 square miles have been
added. Therefore, since the war, the Britishi
Empire, I arn proud to say, has actually
increased. its area by one-eighth. Sr with the
sinking of the German fleet at Scapa Flow
the war ended pretty well for the Britishi
Empire, although at first it was said the British
had bungled.
To give you corne idea of the wealth of
South Africa I may teil you that haîf of the
gold of the world, g0 per cet of the diamonde,
and ail of -the radium used in the world today, corne fromn South Africa. It may ha
interesting for you to know that nîthougli the
cost of production hec been millions, there
je to-day just a littie over one pound of
radium in the whole world. Haîf of the
cobalt of the world cornes fromn South Africa;
the other half frorn Canada. People have a
wrong impression of South Africa because they
generally sec only the seashore and the shores
of the rivers. Natal, Mozambique and Angola
are the places whcre the jungles are locateci,
and the tropical vegetation grows, and they
are only the fringe. The central plateau is
about 3,300 feet high. On that plateau there
is beautiful land and the dlinate is cool; in
fart, in winter it is mnucli too cool for the
negroes.
The cause of the change in South Africa
was the finding in 1870, by a child, of an
alluvian diamond on the shores of the Orange
river. People were attracted to the place
by the opportunity to secure most valuable
stones, and in 1871 Kimberley was founded

13995--2

SENATE

and a dry mine established. Since then 90
per cent of the diamonds of the world have
been extracted in that district. Kimberley
grew very rapidly. The output of that mine
being regulated, the shares of the de Beers
Company, which controlled the mine, were for
sale on the stock exchanges of Europe, and
also, probably, of the United States.
In 1886 gold was found near the site of
Johannesburg, and a city grew up with mushroom rapidity. The camps were replaced by
good buildings, and within a little while there
were a race-track, golf courses, fine hotels, and
so on. In forty years more gold has been
mined in South Africa than had been extracted from the earth since mining first commenced. That wili give you some idea of
its value.
I draw attention to these things so that we
may be prepared to ment that competition.
Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda are splendid
areas in which to grow tobacco. The British
Government has granted a preference on
tobacco of two shillings a pound, which is
nearly double the price at which tobacco sells
anywhere. When the Hon. Stanley Baldwin
was in this country he was reminded of this,
and was told about Canada starting to grow
tobacco. At that time there was a considerable
boom in the tobacco growing industry on the
shores of Lake Erie. Tobacco growers were
brought from the United States, houses were
bought for them and their families, and good
wages were paid; but somehow or other the
tobacco growing was not a success. To-day
I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Tolmie,
Prime Minister of British Columbia. I told
himi of this preference. which would bar out
of England ail the tobacco fromn the United
States. There is no fear of too much tobacco
being grown for years to come, and if the
Government is looking for something to help
employnent and farming. the Minister of
Agriculture would do well to look into this
matter. I renember that twenty-five years
ago L. P. Brodeur, who was Minister of the
Interior, started a caumpaign for the growing
of tobacco in the county of Montcalm. Would
you believe that good land increased in value
to $2,000 an acre. and tat
even with land at
that price money was being made in the
growing of tobacco?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tobacco was 7
cents a pound then. Now it is 35 cents.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
And the growers
were making money.
In Katanga, in South Africa, huge deposits
of copper have been found. But copper is
not of much use vithout transportation, and
lon.

Ir. CASGRAIN.

it is not easily transported; so a railroad was
constructed into that country. Then it was
found that coal could be got &t Elisabethville, near by, and the copper could be smelted
right there.
To-day there is railway communication from Elisabethvil'le to Capetown
and Beira, on the strait of Mozambique, which
separates East Africa from Madagascar, and
to Dar-es-Salaam, which is in Zanzibar. Zanzibar is the colony that Germany exchanged
with England-much to her regret, I amn sure
-for Heligoland. Then there is communication by rail with Angola and the Belgian
Congo. So to-day Elisabethville is really a
railway centre, whereas in the old days when
Stanley and Livingstone went there we thought
that they were absolutely lost in a wilderness.
Furthermore, Africa possesses the Victoria
Falls, which are 400 feet in height, where
power can be developed for the operation of
its stamp mills.
If you look at the map of South Africa today you will see none of the white spots
that used to appear, which were the joy of
school children because it was easy to study
the geography of those parts. Now nearly
the whole of South Africa is painted red, the
colour in which our great Empire is shown
on the map, and that is where this increase
of o.ne-eighth in the acea of the Empire has
taken place.
The yearly output of the mines of South
Africa is some $300,000,000, and of agricultural products about the same amount. Wool
a!lone brings in $80,000,000 a yeer.
Now
asbestos has been found in South Africa; also
potash and phosphate. In the Witwatersrand
thfere has been produced over five billions of
gold, almost twice the amount of the debt
of Canada; or $700,000,000 yearly. The diamond industry has been well regulated so
that the market would not be glutted. Radium
has been kept a dark secret. The price of
radium is kept up, even at the risk of preventing the cure of people suffering from
cancer.
A wonderful pamphlet was published by
the Canadian National Railways a year or
two ago, in which it mas stated that our
mines would probably bring in more money
than our crops.
I cannot say as to that.
Though there is coal in South Africa in large
quantities, it is not as good as the British
coal, as if contains only 50 to 70 per cent of
the calories contained in the British.
Now, leaving South Africa, I should like to
deial for a few momcnts wvth the subject of
immnigration-and with this I will conclude.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1930
I must say that I approve entirely of the
present Administration's new policy of preventing any more immigration to this country.
We have not work enough for our own people.
Why bring in more people at the present
time? When conditions improve it may be
all right to bring in immigrants again, but
for the moment I think the Government is
absolutely right in keeping them out. I know
the Minister of Labour will not disagree with
me in that.
Here are some suggestions that I should
like to make.
(a) Suspend all immigration from Central
Europe and from the so-calied preferred countries, except in the case of a wife rejoining
ber husband who has settled in Canada, or of
children going to their parents, or of aged
fathers or mothers to their children living in
Canada. Of course the Immigration Department would have first to ascertain by an
investigation whether the men asking for a
permit for their wives and children to come
out to join them are in a position to keep
them.
(b) There is no need whatever of importing
farm hands for the Western harvest, and
especially nowadays, with the labour-saving
farm machinery in -use. We have in the East
an ample supply of men who are only too
willing to go west for the harvest, and then
return to their homes with a good sum of
money, which remains in the country. The
practice of bringing in farm- hands, whether
from Central Europe or elsewhere, for the
Western harvest, has in a large measure contribute& to create the present crisis. It is
obvious that farmers, once their crop has been
gathered, have no further use for these
strangers. who, having no homes to go to,
necessarily crowd into the cities and become
public charges. The Canadians, on the contrary, when their work in the West is completed, either become settlers themselves or
return to their homes, so that the Western
harvest benefits both East and West, including
the railways, who transport 40.000 to 50,000
harvesters fromn East to West and return.
(c) In view of the legislation which is to
be introduced regarding old age pensions, etc.,
it is highly desirable that some system of
identification should be devised, whether by
issuing identification cards or otherwise.
Every country finds it necessary to protect
itself by insist.ing on the registration of its
inhabitants, and Canada has reached a stage
when some similar protection has become
necessary. It is no secret that there are
some dangerous elements in this country, and
a system of registration or identification would
considerably hamper their propaganda.
13995-21

(d) It would also greatly facilitate the deportation of undesirables. The present procedure for 'deportation is too complicated. The
sentence of the judge, condemning an undesirable to imprisonment, hnould suffice to
cause the deportation of the prisoner, without
any further proceedings.
(e) Lastly, with regard to British immigration, it has been conclusively proved that
assisted immigration is a failure. It was an
expensive experiment, which I trust will not
be repeated. Far better to have but a few
immigrants who corne of their own accord,
and with sufficient means to make a start,
than to import thousands who become a
burden to the country, many of whom have
to be deported, and return to their homes in
England to give Canada a very bad name.
Let the 'transportation companies charge a
reasonable fare, and let every one pay it in
full. This limited immigration would cause
a considerable saving in the Immigration Department. One branch alone, the Womens
Branch, which is costing an enormous amount,
could be greatly reduced, for it was created
solely on account of assisted female immigration. The Land Settlement Department, with
its numberless officials, field inspectors,
appointed to shepherd the assisted British
immigrant, as if he were a helpless child,
could be practically done away with, for the
unassisted immigrant would need no shepherding.
When an immigrant becomes a public charge
he should be deported without delay, whether
he is in a public hospital or in a private institution, such as l'Hôtel-Dieu, or other institutions that are not public. As long as
immigrants are in a private institution they
are not considered a public charge. The
Immigration Act at present requires that the
immigrant must be a charge to a public
hospital; he is not deportable if in a private
hospital. This is manifestly unfair to private
institutions. Orphans should not be admitted
unless over 17.
I should have liked to speak of some
other things, but, as I think I have
occupied enough time, I shall take them up
on some other occasion. One of these topics
is the increased cost of the League of Nations
to us in this particular year. Another subject
is the stopping of the importation of gasoline,
and the manufacturing of our own fuel for
our motors, which can easily be done. I
should have liked also to discuss the wonderful
tour that the honorable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) made in the
Maritime Provinces, especially in New Brunswick, where he seemed to upset altogether

that it will succeed at an early date in gretly

exists in this country at the moment.
It is net my purpose at this tirne te discuss

tbat in the meanwhile, as xve are net burdened

should givo a brief outline of the conditions
that led up ýte the presont situation, and
'Sheuld discuss the pelicy of the present Gevernment and its predecessers of the saine
political complexion in dealing witb the preblem of uneniployment. The poliey involves
the Government's responsibility te the people,
the interest of the people being placed first,
and the rights of proerty second.
Tbe poliey wbicb is being pursued is based
on the solernn undertaking that was enterod
inte by the Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden
and signed on June 28, 1919. On the plodge
thon given on bohaîf of Canada the attitude
of the Governrnent over which ho prosidod
was based, as is the attitude of the presont
Government. I would call the attention of
honeurable gentlemen te the fact that after
thie great world cenfliet tbiere wvas formed a dotermi-natien. whicb was empbasized at the
Poaco ýCenference by the troaty that was
made, that huinan rigbits sbeulcl receive, interu-atienallv, a larger share of attention from
publie nien than they had previeusly been
given. Perhaps it is net generally known,
even among our own people, but it is true
that our then Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Borden. played a leaing part in bringing
about that decision and in negetiating the
ternis and tbe wording of Part 13 of the
TreatY of Peace. The task was undertakon
by another gentleman within the British
Enmpire. and the tlifhmutltic,. seemed insurmountable at first, uintil Sir Robert undertoek
te follow up the proposfIl. Finally hoe mot
witb suecess. Iu the course of bis romarks at
the Peace Conferenco Sir Robert said:
It is possible that some of us would have
franied the dispos~itions of the proposed Convention seiimewhat clifferently, but the main
purpese. an 1 after ail. the great purpose, in
respect cnf this Convention, as in respect of the

SEPTEMBER 10, 1930
League of Nations, is te secure the adhesion of
the different states te an arrangement whieh
will tend to the welfare of humanity in the
future.
The amended text of the Labour Part of
the Peace Treaty was submitted by the Canadian Prime Minister, and was unanimously
adopted, and under this wording the High
Contracting Parties recognized that the wellbeing-physical, moral and intellectual-of
industrial wage-earners is of supreme international importance. They recognized that
differences of climate, habits and customs, of
economie principle and industrial tradition,
make strict uniformity in the conditions of
labour ditiicult of immediate attainment, but,
holding as they did that labour should not
be regarded merely as an article of commerce,
the wording of the Peace Treaty as proposed
by Sir Robert Borden and adopted in the
Peace Conference, declared:
There are methods and principles for regulating labour conditions which al industrial communities should endeavour te a.pply, se far as
their epecial circumstances will permit. Among
these methods and principles, the following
seem te the High Contracting Parties te be of
special and urgent importance.
Perhaps it would do no harn to put on
record a few clauses, because it is some time
since that document was negotiated. It declared:
First.-The guiding principle ahove enunciated, that labour should net be regarded
merely as a commodity or article of commerce.
Second.-The right of association for aIl lawful purposes by the employed as well as by the
employers.
Third.-The payment te the employed of a
wage adequate te maintain a reasonable
standard of life as this is understood in their
time and country.
Fourth.--The adoption of an eight-hours day
or a forty-eight heurs week as the standard te
be aimed at where it bas net already been attained.
Fifth.-- The adoption of a weekly rest of at
least twenty-four heurs, which should include
Sunday wherever practicable.
Sixth.-The abolition of child labour and the
imposition of such limitations on the labour of
young persons as shall permit the continuatien of their education and assure their proper
physical development.
Those were the first six recommendations,
which were made at the instigation of the
gentleman whom I have named, and which
were unanimously adopted and became part
of article 13 of the Treaty of Peace.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
children of his own?

Did he have any

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: He had sympathy
for those who had children. Now, having
signed that important document on behalf of

Canada, Sir Robert returned te Canada and
proceeded te implement the promise by several
early actions. The first one, which bore fruit,
was that in September, 1919, after an inquiry
had been conducted by a royal commission
into industrial conditions in Canada, there
was held in this city, on the invitation of the
Goverument, a conference participated in by
employers and employees, by representatives
of the Dominion Government and the Provincial Governments, representatives of Caïnadian agriculture, and the Union of Canadian
Municipalities.
Some 200 men sat down
together and remained in session for five days,
and several interesting and useful results
flowed from that conference. At its opening,
to indicate the attitude of the leader of the
Government of that day towards this great
question, Sir Robert Borden sent the follow'
ing brief message:
Induetrial development and supremacy have
sometimes been purchased at a price greater
than any people can afford te pay. I am speaking not of conditions in this country, but of
those which, te my knowledge, have prevailed
elsewhere. The physical degeneracy of a considerable portion of the population is too high
a price te pay for domination o? the world's
markets. If in any lines of industrial development we cannot hold our own without se terrible
a sacrifice, then such lines ought te be abandonet and our effort directed elsewhere. Labour
is something more than a ceommodity. The
physical well-being and the moral welfare of
the people should go hand in hand. Standards
of living which are regarded as satisfactory in
some industrial communities of the world cannet be tolerated in this country. The employer,
if he is wise, will concern himself with all the
recommenda-tions and suggestions laid down
in the Peace Conference as te heurs of labour,
sanitary conditions, protection of women and
children, and the general welfare of the labouring man. There can be no permanent or satisfactory industrial development which is net
founded on the welfare of the labouring population which maintains it.
That brings us to the point where a policy
touching the Government's attitude towards
the welfare of the people, particularly the
wage-earners, was laid down, nearly eleven
years ago. Then the Government took other
steps to carry out and implement that policy.
I remember very well that in the fall of 1919,
I think it was, the Government of the day
appropriated some $20,000,000 for a particular purpose. What was the purpose? To
assist in providing employment through aiding the provinces and encouraging them to
build highways. That amount was to be
spent over a period of four or five years, I
think, and was the beginning of a splendid
system of good roads, which has gone far
towards completion and perfection during the
last ten years.

SENATE

Further steps were taken-such as providing funds in substantial amount for the promotion of technical education, and so onall based on the principle that a new era had
arrived when the Treaty of Peace was signed.
The nations who participated in and signed
that treaty have decided that the policies
on these questions should henceforth be somewhat different from what they had been before.
In the fall of 1920 there swept over Canada,
succeeding a similar movement in the United
States, a vave of industrial depression, and,
having in view the star toivards which Canada's eye had been set when it signed that
document to which I have referred, the Government voluntarily came forward, pointed
out to the various provinces that there was
likely to be a rather serions unemployment
situation in the approaching winter, and offered
to them, in advance, co-operation and aid to
cope with the situation when it arrived. On
the 14th of December, 1920, such an offer was
put into writing, and on the 24th of January,
1921, half a million dollars was available. Provision was at once made for the distribution of
that sum through provincial and municipal
channels. as needs arose, and serious suffering
was thereby averted.

delegates sat down together to consider and
discuss ways and means whereby employment
might be stabilized and unemployment avoided.
At the close of that conference a number of
recommendations were drafted and unanimoutsly adopted, but, for sone reason unknown
to me, they were never acted upon.
At that time the post-war depression had
come to an end practically all over the world
and there followed a general wave of prosperity, upon which Canada was borne in common
vith most other conetries. But in the fall
of 1928 the tide began to slacken. In 1929.
while we were still receivîng a constantly increasing flow of immigrants from Europe, there
was a slowing up of the emigration that had
been going on for nearly ton years frem
Canada to the United States. Thus there was
being created here a steadily inereasing supply
of labour for which tlwre was no demand,
nnd this naturallv brouuht about a serious
*ituai uon. Then in the summer of 1929 the
whea t crop was not very good in the West,
and. to mako thinas worse, it did not flow
to the markets of the world as it had done
in previous years; with the result that the
Western farmers soon had their purchasing
power reduced, and before long the whole of
our population was affected in the same way.

and the savîngs of many of the unemployed
became exhausted, the resources of numerous
municipalities were being strained. ta the
danger point and the demand upan federal
and provincial authorities for aid became
à,cute. I do not think that tie federal authorities realized the seriousness of the situation
until long after the time for aiction had
corne. My reasan for saying s0 is that the
right honourable gentleman who leads the
Oppositiâon in another place intimated a day
or so aga th.at he would be unable ta proceed witli tie discussion -on the Addre-es ia
reply to the Speech from the Throne until
certain information had been laid on tie
Table. H1e asked for copies of ahl the correspondJeoee tiat 'led passed between the
Federal Gave-rament and the provincial and
municipal autharities, and others, on tie subject af unempînyment.
In passing, I aniglit pay my respects Vo that
riglit hanourable gentleman, for I do not want
ta be discourteous and f ail ta reciprocate.
I believe lie paid his respects to me yesterday, and expressed Vie opinion thait it was
a very serions matter *for a Goverament Vo
have a Minister, holding a portfolio, in the
Senate. My only observation is tliat 1 believe the right lionourable gentleman, who
was Prime Minister for about eight and a haîf
ye-ars, ne-ver liad. the support of -a majority
of tlie electorate of Canada, and the first
Minister of Labour whon lie appointed was
not elected by the people. If it is impraper
tiat a member of the Senate wlio previously
adaninistered the Department of Labour for
a fe-w years during a rather difficult period
should accepV a similar responsibiiity at this
âime, whea. there seems to be anotlier
e-mergency, I must plead guilty. But I shahl
continue ta try ito do my bit ta ielp Canada
and ber people thro'ugh this period, in spite
of the criticism. of my riglit h-onourable friend.
The staff in tlie Departinent of Labour
immediately set ta work, aad in tweaty-four
hours had the information which I laid on
the Table to-day and which lias be-en, laid
on the Table in another place; so we hope
tiat lio delay wihl oocur in thie coasideration

with the present unemploymeat situation, he
would perliaps be interested in having placed

his regime. So I in'quired for the records and
one of the staff brouglit in tliree big bundles
of papers, altogether a bulc -as large as a mani

what it was, and wss told it was the correspondence of st year on unemploymnent.
Thereore it is difflouit for me to understiand.
how the right honourable gentleman oould
haVee been unfamiliar with existing conditions -when lie stated in Parliaimeat, and
afterwards, when he repeated throughout the
country, that there was no serions unemployment.
I spent about an hour last night examining
part of one of the bundies, and althougli 1 did
flot go througli ail the papers, I found a few
things of interest. For example, 1 learned
that the Canadian Legion on February 15,
1930, sent a strang appeal Vo the Goverament
for aid, because of unemployM*ent; and that
the Province of Manitoba on December 30
last made representations in the same regard.
A similar plea was made by the Manitoba
Association of Unemployed Men on Mardi
19, 1930, and the City of Niagara Falls on
January S. The Corporation of Chathiam,
New Brunswick, on April M5 appealed ta the
Government for assistance, and attached ta
their appeal was a public notice taken from
tbe Chathiam Gazette of April 14, which read:
A Special Meeting of the Chatham Board of
Trade will be .held in the Town Hall on Wednesday evening, April 16, at 8 o'clock.
The objept i6 ta again acquaint the Federal
and Provincial Goverismeints of the dire necessi-ty of doing necessary publie warks that

I found other appeals-1 will not bother ta
give the dates of ahl of them, but they are
here available if any honourable member
desires the information-from the Town af
Cobalt, the City of Saskatoon, the City af
Windsor, the City of North Bay, the Municipality of Islingtoa, the City of Sault Ste.
Marie, the City of Toronto, York County,
Fort William, Regina, Edmonton, Brandon,
Calgary, another one froin Toronto from the

the large church arganizations in that citythe Manitoba Associated Boards of Trade,
the Calgary Presideat of the Amalgamnated
Wamen's Organizatian, the Mayor of Calgary,
the Calgary Presbytery, the City of Hamilton, and the City of Montreal. Ia addition,
I found that an February 3 the Gave-rnment of Ontario offered ca-aperatian ta the
Federal Goverament, but there is na indication that any reply was sent ta this offer. IV
appeared also that thirteen labour organiza-

SENATE

tions petitioned the Federal Government for
aid between December 16, 1929, and March 4,
1930.
I was particularly struck with one communication that appeared in the file, because
it came from the metropolitan city of Montreal shortly before the date on which the
Prime Minister of the Province of Quebec
declared that there was no serious situation existing there. The Prime Minister of
Canada had intimated the same thing, but
it seems that the people of Montreal did not
believe that was true. I think I pointed out
in this House at the last session that within
about three days of the time the Federal
Prime Minister had made his statement on
the subject I personally saw 1,300 hungry
men being fed in one of four institutions that
were providing aid to the unemployed in the
city of Montreal at that time. * Certain organizations in the city of Montreal took exception to the general statements that had
been made, and after having sent many communications to the Department of Labour
they communicated by letter directly with
the Prime Minister himself and bitterly complained against the Minister of Labour. Now,
I want to say to this House in all justice to
the Minister of Labour of that day, the Hon
Mr. Heenan, that there is ample evidence
on those files to indicate clearly that he did
not share the opinion that was spread abroad
by the head of the then Government respecting unemployment. I saw in the Minister's
own handwriting, on some of the documents,
a comment tiat indicated he had made different representations to his colleagues. What
I want to emphasize bere is that there was a
departure in permanent poliey from what
should be the attitude of government, according to the pledge given by Sir Robert Borden
on behalf of Canada when the Peace Treaty
was signed, with regard to the paramount
question of human interests and rights. I
cannot find the Montreal letter that I wanted
to read, and perhaps it is just as well, because it was a scathing denunciation byv peopla
from mv honourable friend's (Hon. Mr. Dandurand's) city, and signed, I think, by the
representatives of four or five organizations
there.

I have said to the House, and I should be

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Did my honourable friend find a copy of that letter in
the Department of Labour?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, yes. I might
say to my honourable friend that the Prime
Minister's secretary forwarded it to the secretan of the Minister of Labour, and apparently it was placed on file without even an
acknowledgment having been made from any
source.
To my mind, honourable senators, it was
an amazing thing that in the light of reports
on unemployment received from citizens and
municipalities all over Canada, and even
fromr provinces, the Government should have
taken the attitude it did at the last session.
The late Government stated that it was not
responsible even if there was unemployment.
I should like to reassert here my contention
that the Government was obligated, under
the Treaty of Peace, to take notice of a
serions situation of that sort; that it should
have rendered aid to municipalities and others
who were caring for the unemployed, and not
have stood by without attempting to alleviate
the suffering that existed last winter.
There were more men unemrployed in Canada in July of this year than there were in
Januaryv, and I ask You to appreciate the situation that, now faces the Governuent. Because
of uneiployment during lat
winter many
people have exhaustcd thrir resouretes-many
have also exhaursted their credit-and they
c
find themselves facing another winter withount emiplovment. Furthermore, some of the
municipalities who tried to do tiir
bit and
keep their unemxployed froi suffeiring last
year find their resources so deplctetd that they
are in se-rious difficultiers. So I ask you in all
earnestness to consider most carefully and
sympatietiilly

the

measures

at least a temnporary alleviation of distres,.
in the hope of ultimxately finding, through

cseareh and observation and study,
a more permanent cure for this terible calamxity. I say eaiamity" becanuse it is a calamity
to the men affected. There is nothing in the
world that is of such concern to the wageearner as his job. If a man has employmient
he can muet his obligations to his de-pendents;
if he bas not, he soon becomes quito a different
citizen. He feels that he bas a grievance,
and turris against society, against the Governient and against industry, and before he
or his dependents suffer seriouisly he is apt

SEPTEMBER 10, 1930
to take steps to try to remedy the situation
himself. Now that a second winter is approaching, through which thousands of people
in Canada may have to pass without employment, the situation must be met fairly, not
only in justice to the couple of hundred
thousand people who are to-day without
work, but in justice to Canada, if she is to
discharge her obligations and duties. Therefore if the documents which have been laid
on the Table to-day are not sufficiently complete to give honourable gentlemen opposite
all the information they require, I shall be
delighted to submit to them for inspection
this volume of appeals that came to the late
Government, in order that they may be convinced that the need is genuine and that the
situation must be met, and met promptly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend has invited requests'for further information. I have net had time to peruse
the documents thait he has laid on the Table.
He presents two aspects of the situationthe past and the present. Of course the past
is history, and as such may have its value,
but to me the present needs and the ways
and means of meeting them represent the
task of the .day. As to the past, my honourable friend would have given us a fairer
picture of the whole situation if whiie speaking of the responsibility of the Federal Government he had given us some statement of
the aption of the municipalities, who are
primarily interested in the weifare cf the
people within their borders, and the action
of the Provincial Governments, who should
be the first authorities to be eailed upon to
help the municipalities of their own creation.
I said in my speech of yesterday that the
first duty of the municipalities is to attend
to the naeds of their people, and, if they
-cannot cope with the situation, to call upon
the province for help; then, if the problem
becomes a national one, and further help ls
needed, the province shou'ld turn towards
the federal authorities. This is the principle
that governed the action of the late Government. This principle was reiterated before
It was followed in the
the 'last cleaction.
crisis of 1921-22-23, and I think it is a sound
one. If it is represented that the situation
is such that the federal authorities shouid
intervene, I am ready, of course, to consider
the matter with very great sympathy. We
are all agreed, I think, as to what we should
do in such a case. I rose merely to say that
a partial statement as to the undischarged
,obligations of the Federal Government is not
entimely fuir or satisfactory, beoause there are
two other authorities, namelly the munici-

palities and the provinces, thaît have a primary duty to perform. I know what we did
in 1922, when the late Administration came
into power. My honounable friend said that
we followed the lines laid down. Probably
action was suspended in 1924 because unemployment had largely disappeared. I simply
reiterate that whatever proposal is presented,
based upon fact, will receive the greatest
measure of sympathy when it is brought
here.
Hon. J. S. MeLENNAN: Honourable members, I should like to take a moment or two
to suggest that it would he well for honourable gentlemen to read over very carefully
what bas been said about Russia by the
honourable senator froin De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain). ;I have no first-hand knowledge of the subject, but recently I came into
contact with more persons than one who had
that knowledge, and I was amazed at what
I was told of the industrial revalution that
bas taken place in .Russia. Experts have been
brought in from other countries, and farming
is being conducted on the grandest scale, with
unlimited money and unlimited machinery.
Under the peculiar system of government in
vogue in Russia, it has a control of labour
such as no other country has, such as no
other country at the present time wants to
have, and such as no other people would
tolerate, and within the next few years they
will produce vast quantities of wheat.
Furthermore, the great forests of Russia,
which were the private property of the Grand
Dukes, have been admirably cared for and are
now available for the production, by forced
labour, of great quantities of pulpwood. Some
of this has already reached our shores. Also,
in the neigh'bourhood of the Black Sea, new
coal fields have been discovered, which produce coal that I am told is of the highest
quality. That coal, as we know, Uas, I regret
to say, already come into the Canadian
market to some degree.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Six hundred thousand tons in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I did not know it
was as much as that. I do not say that we
should try to stop this production of coal or
anything else, but the people of Canada shouli

Government to the advisability of keeping in
touch with what is going on in Russia, by
whatever means are available, se that the
competition which is sure to cone will do
us the minimum of harm.
On motion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans, the
debate was adjourned.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I had promised
te make a statement to-day, if possible, with
regard to the work of the current week. I
know we should net like to have anything
sent to this House while we were not in
session. I cannot promise anything definitely,
but the best information I caÀn secure is that
there will probably be some legislation that
will require our atfention on Friday. For
that reason I will not move, as I had otherwise intendcd to do, the adjournment to next
week.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I suppose we shall
know definitely to-morrow. This is Wednesday.
Will the other House sit this evening?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

No.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: So they will have
only to-morrow to make progress. I am informcd that there is going to be considerable
discussion, and if the honourable gentleman
could see his way ciear to move the adjournment to-morrow, it would be appreciated.
While I am on my feet, may I ask whether
there is any arrangement as to absentees during
this short session?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: When the time
arrives the question of pairs will be taken up
and considered. It is possible that I shall
have some news to-morrow. We want to
show a willingness to expedite any legislation
'hat may come in at this very urgent session.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumied from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bénard for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable senators,
one of my main reasons for moving the
adjournment of the debate was that I might
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

have an opportunity to congratulate His
Honour on his preferment to the high office
of Speaker of this House. As has been said
by the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), you, sir, represent
the best traditions of the French Canadian
race. You have been persecuted and have
suffered for your opinions, and now you have
your reward. I venture to say that among
the many prominent men who have occupied
the Chair in this Chamber you will rank in
one of the first places.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I desire to congratulate the mover of the address, my
(Hon. Mr.
colleague from St. Boniface
Bénard). He has been well known to me for
a great muany years. The city he represents is
sometimes called the Holy City, but whether
that is on account of his connection with it,
I am unable to say. It was a pleasure to listen
to his speech in bis native tongue. I should
also like to tender my compliments to my
honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Taylor). He is an old member of
this House and always delivers a speech full
of interest and information.
May I extend my congratulations to the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain). He certainly has earned
the reputation of being a walking encyclopedia,
for if there is anything you want to know he
is always able to supply the information. I
regret, however, that be should have taken
occasion to allude to some doubtfuil points in
I
connection with the siege of Quebec.
t hought his -eference to them was in bad taste.
He intimated that some English settlers left
the city of Quebec because a fight was going
on, and that the French people remained to
face the enemy.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Those who lieft had
been asked to go.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not know what
the honourable gentleman meant when he
made that statenent; whether he desired to
re-introduce into this House the question of
race. As I say, I thought it was in bad taste,
and especially so since we all know that very
different explanations are given by different
historians with regard to some of the things
that took place around the period to which
my honourable friend was referring. However,
we will let that pass.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

You had better.

I believe that the

late Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Right Hon.

SEPTEMBER 11, 1930
W. L. Mackenzie King missed a great opportunity when they omitted to take the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière into their
Cabinet, because if hie could advertise Canada
as well as hie advertised South Africa, we
shou]d certainly be the gainers.
SAs we are nlot very busy in this Chamber
for the tirne being, it may nlot be amiss to
review briefly the recent election, for it is
possible that we may thereby Iearn something
that will guide us in the future in legislating
for the benefit of the country at large. In
my opinion, the election wvas one of the most
important that ever took place in the Dominion of Canada. Important issues were at
stake. and the then Prime Minister announced
that we were at the parting of the ways. Well,
I arn one of those who rejoice that there has
been no parting of the ways, but rather a
joining together. The late Government opened
its celebrated campaign in the city of Brantford, with an add*ress by the ýlate Prime
Minister, whieh was broadcast by radio
over the whole Dominion. Ail our people
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie had an
opportunity of hearing it and many other
speeches in the weeks that followed, and great
interest was manifested throughout the country. Great crowds packed the halls wherever
important meetings were held, and the people
who were unable to gain admission went to
their homes, or the homes of their friends,
and listened in by radio, in common with
their fellow citizens all over Canada. The
issue was clearly stated to voters in every
city, village and hamlet. and on the farms.
The right honourable gentleman who was then
Prime Minister opened bis compaign by stating that our people generally were prosperous
nnd that the only unemployment existing was
of a temporary nature. Lt did not Lake long
for him to have bis opinions changed when
hie xvas travelling through the Western Provmnces and on the Pacifie coast, for lie then
learned that hie was not well informed as to
industrial conditions in our land. So hie
changed bis tacties, and in a desperate effort
to secure votes hie finally made promises entirely contrary to bis declaration in Parliament
that lie would not give a five-cent piece to
aid the unemployed in any province that had
a Conservative Government. Before lie concluded bis compaign lie offered to give dollar
for dollar from the Federal Trea-sury to any
province that would assist in taking care of
the unemployed. 0f course, the people of
Canada did not swallow that sort of thing.
The farmers, ma.nufacturers, miners and la-q
bourers apparently knew the true circumnstanceo

much better than did the leader of the Liberal
party. Wben the last speech was radioed
throughout the country from the city of
Ottawa, the result of the election was a foregone conclusion.
In common wibh a large number of Canadians I was astonished-and, I think t.he
people of Quebec were more astionished than
those of any other part of the country~
when the riglit honourable gentleman who
was then Prime Minister aaked with a great
deal of gusto, "Who-m wil.l you &end to the
Imperial Conference if you do flot send Mr.
Lapointe and me? Let Mr. Bennett naine
the man whom. he will send from the Province of Quebec who is fit to represent Canada at the Imperial Conference." I do nlot
know just how the people of Quebec faIt
about tihat statement, 'but surely they did nlot
conclude the. in the whole of their great
province the lieutenant of the then Prime
Minister was the only man fit or capable to
go to the Imperial Conferance as Canada's
representative. The right honourable gentleman lias now received lis answer, and I
think hie bas received it from the Province of
Quebec. No wiler statement was evar made
on a public platform in Canada than that
made by Mr. Mackenzie King wlien hie defieýd the Conservative party to tell him what
man in Canada, apart from hirnself and lis
lieutenants, was fit to go to the limperial
Conference.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
C'fit"?

Did lie use the word

Hoen. Mr. MeMEANS: No; I arn merely
summarizing wliat I concluded lie meant.
What other conclusion can one draw? Can
my lionourable friend suggest any?

I understood you

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I amn quoting, in

tell you whom lie will send from the Province
of Quebec to tlie Imperial Conference." I
hope my honourable friend is satisfied that
that matter is settled, and that t.he people
now know who will go to the Imperial Conference.

they will not be misled into thinking that
this Chamber has come to the conclusion that
the Wheat Pool refused to accept $1.40 or
$1.30 for its wheat. I think the honourable
gentleman will pardon me if I urge him to
be a little more careful in that respect.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
I have no objection. The honourable gentleman says he does
not know anything about it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not think my
honourable friend does either. Now I should
like, with the permission of this House, to
read a letter from a farmer. It was written,
not with any idea of political effect, but just
in the ordinary course of corespondence that
took place between this man and myself. I
wrote him about a farm, in reference to some
business, and told him I thought the country
was prosperous. I may say that this farm is
in Saskatchewan, a long way out. The first
part of the letter probably does not affect the
matter. The letter reads:
In answer ta yours of the 16th, I will certainly do my best for the land. I am endeavoring to get you a customer but there are so many
around that it makes it a hard
vacant
proposition. They are advertising faras within
five and six miles of Davidson for $600 to $800.
This district bas suffered the last four years
from drought and frost. We have to close our
school after this term, as the council has no
money. Times are very bad around here; seldom a day passes but one or two men come and
ask for a meal. I really cannot afford to give
them, but I will not turn a Rnan away hungry
as long as I have a bit to eat. My brother
wrote me from England. He told me he would
finance me for seed and feed for another year
if I wanted to try. As you say, it can't go on
forever. One good crop would put me on my
feet again, as I do not owe, only hospital and
doctors bills. I have kept every expense down
to what I could pay for, and have done without
that I could not pay for.
I think that the Liberal Government are to
blame for the country's condition at the present
time. They have brought emigrants from Europe and dumped them on land that nobody can
get a living off. There is a family a few miles
from 'here; they are on a fara with only about
10 acres of good land on it; the rest is a big
alkali patch-will not grow even grass. I was
a Liberal for 16 years, but I cast a Conservative vote in the Provincial election, and I certainly will on the 28th. It's only the foreigner
what can't talk English around here what's
voting Liberal. When the farmers are all so
hard up as we are, the country is bound to be
having hard times. All we have to sell ls low
price; all we have to buy is higha. Sir, I do
not know whether you are Liberal or Conservative, but I state that the Liberal policy is
simply rotten. If you are a Liberal, I do not
say this to insult you. I really believe that Mr.
Mackenzie King is a gentleman, (but) his administration is lacking the foresight which is
necesary for the progress of Canada. There is
no need for men to be begging for bread and
work in this, the richest country in the world.

ifarms

The resources and raw material which this
country possess are tremendous. We only want
a Government big enough to realize that Canada can lead and hold ber own with the world.
Canada don't have to toady to U. S. A. or any
other country. Sir-excuse me, but I had to
get this off my chest because of what you said
in your letter. I will now conclude, hoping you
will cast your vote for a Coneervative Government and help the cause of the farmers.
I am getting some work to do and will try
to pay taxes. Thank you.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is bis name?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Would you like bis
name?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I will give his name.
but I do not know that I need put it on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Put it on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: His name is Charles
Haden; lie lives at a place called Bladsworth,
Saskatchewan; and I am glad to say that his
hopes were realized.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He must have been
very ignorant when he did not know which
side the honourable gentleman was on.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: He did not know
me as well as my honourable friend knows
me.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: A Liberal member was
returned from that constituency.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Then the foreigners
all voted for him.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: No; the Liberal member was defeated. He was the Deputy
Speaker of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I think the late
election, which, as I have said before, was
the most momentous in the history of Canada, has taught us that the people of Canada
are true to their traditions. In the late Parliament, with the exception of the member
for Calgary, there was not one Conservative
member of the House of Commons from any
of the Western Provinces. To-day there are
Conservative members from
twentythree
those provinces. We now have a stable Government, a Government that has amongst its
supporters representatives from every province in Canada. We have a Government that
is not dependent upon any claiss or group,
that does not have to consider whether the
Progressives want this or the Labourites want
that. It does not have to throw a sop here
and a sop there in order to remain in power.

SENATE

It need not set up a cry that the people
should vote for it on any ground other than
that of the policy it has laid down.
I think the result of the election in Quebec
has been, above all, a great triumph for the
Canadian people. I say the Canadian people
because the rest of Canada was looking to
Quebec. Quebec had a solid bloc, and, I am
sorry to say, the cry of race and religion was
raiscd there; but, thanks te the good sense
of the people of the province, the late Government was net sustained. When the results
were announced it was found that there were
twenty-five Conservative members elected
mcd that the Province of Quebec, which had
areviously sent to Ottawa a solid Liberal bloc,
had returned to its old allegiance. I think
that the election has taught us that there is
a feeling of unity in Canada. If Canada is
to be prosperous there must be unity among
all the provinces. Quebec has shown by its
vote that it is not again to be swayed by
racial or religious issues, but will retain its
place as one of the leading provinces of Confederation.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER: Honourable
members, I will not felicitate the mover and
the seconder of the Address, although they
deserve to bc complimented, because that
part of the programme is left to the leaders
of the Hoise, who have performed it well
I have only a few remarks to make, and they
will be generalities. The Speech of His Excellency deals more or less with generalities.
In that regard it differs net very much from
other Speeches from the Throne since Confederation, though perhaps it may be said
that it comes nearer than any of them to
stating the purpose for which Parliament
has been called. Our present purpose is to
help those who have no job on hand; in
other words, to come to the rescue of the
unemployed.

From the statistics lately given by the
Minister of Labour we learn that there are
200,000 mon in Canada who are out of work.
Well, there is nothing very alarming about
that; nothing that I know of to cause us to
wail or cry blue ruin. In all ages there have
been. throughout the world, men who were
unemployed: and to-day Canada stands in
a better position in this regard than any other
country, with the possible exception of
France. The Gospel says, "The poor you
Lave
wavs with you." Possibly the word
.poor " is meant to include the unemployed.
J compliment the Govermnient upon having convoked s in special session to try to
givo relief to the unempioyed. Not that I
Hon.

Mr.

NIMEANS.

believe we can find work for everybody.
Great promises were made, and many of them,
but honourable gentlemen know as well as I
do that when a general election is approaching
many promises are made that are too great to
be fulfilled. In this respect the Conservative
leaders have done no better and no worse
than had been donc before. It is not believed
that this Parliament can give work to everybody, but it certainly will come to the relief
o? many. That is about all that we can claim
oi hope to do. No one is perfect, but everyone is bound to make efforts to reach perfection. No one believes that this Government
can relieve everyone in need, but we have
tangible proof that concrete efforts are to
bc made towards improving the situation, and
that some results have already been attained.
One feature of this session that strikes me
particularly is the good-will of Canadians
generally.
It is a wholesome sight to sec
municipalities and governments of all shades
or colours that are willing, or apparently
willing, to join hands with the Federal Govcrnment. There is a deep meaning to that.
It means that the inhabitants of Canada are
really Canadians; that we are cultivating a
Canadian seul; that though one province is
Liberal and another Conservative, though at
Ottawa Tory succeeds Grit, or Grit succeeds
Tory, nevertheless the idea of the weal of
Canada prevails. We are making progress,
honourable members-possibly healthier progress than we realize. Take the late election
for instance. That election was conducted on
gentlemanly lines. I have been a witness of
all the elections since Confederation. It is
not very many decades ago that votes were
bought, liquor was circulated in large quantities, rough tactics were employed and fights
took place. None of these things were conspicuous in the last election. If there were
fisticuffs, they were the aftermath. This is a
bealthy feature, and, in my estimation, shows
real progress, greater progres than that repreby any monetary gain. or any increase
in the wealth of the country. We are building a solid Canada.
Net very many years ago, and even reecntly,
I read in the papers that there was danger of
the West seceding from Canada. Honourable
inembers, I do not believe any such danger
exists. I do not apprehend it froin immigration of the proper sort: that is gold that
is fused with our Canadian patriotisi.
The
Americans who have come here in large
inmhers are to-day Canadians in their souls; or,
if they are not, their children are or will be.
The more we grow tbe more the Canadian

soul wiil develop and the more we shahl turn'
towards what I believe is our destiny as one
of the greatest nations of tbe world.
Hon. ROBERT FORKE: Honourable inembers of tbe Senate,,i isd with some misgiving
th'at I risc to offer a few remarks, because I
bave no speech prepared and I reaily ought
to bhave made some preparation before daring
to address this assemibly. But during tbe
debate some remarks 'have been made to
whicb I ithink I ought (to,make some reiply.
I may be permitted to say just a Word in
regard to the Wbeat Pool, and in Teply f0 the
bonourable senator fromi De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain). The bonourable mem'bcr for
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) bas made
the stafemenit that the Wheat Pool is not a
proper subject for tbis assem!bly to discuas;
neverfhelcss I think if may nof be ýuninteresting f0 deai with this siibjet and some other
features of fbe grain situation in Western
Canada. I boid no brief for the Wheat Pool.
I was a member of the Pool for, five yeawrs,
and wben .my contract ran ouf I did not renew
it.
Hon. Mr. ýCASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FORRE: But I bave no criticism
nor complaint, to make regardîng Itbe treaitment I received from tbe Wheat Pool, or my
expericnce witb it. I did have some faulf to
find wif certain extravagant stafements made
.by some of the officiais; statements that I diid
not believe had a good effect upon 'the operafions of the Pool in the worid markefs; but
that bas nofhing te du witb the principies for
which the Pool was organized.
Anyene wbo bas read the hiâtory of the
marketing of the farmers' gra.in since 1882 will
re-alize that one ra.mpart a-ffer another biad
f0 be scaled before the farmers were able to
get anything like a square deal in *marketing
tbeir Wbeat. Wben I look bwck to those early
years I somefimes Wonder wbat tbe farmers of
to-day wouid tb.ink if tbey had to go fbrough
the experiences that we went Vbrough in the
eighfies and the early ninefies. At tbat time
a farmer simply took bis load of wbeat te
the village, wbcrc if was dumped inito an
elevator. He had very littie choice in the
matter of wbat bie should. do. If there was
onl'y one cievafor he had to accept the price
that was offered, and bad no recourse cdfany
kind. He could not market h.is wbeat upon
the cars; tb*ere wcre ne loading piatforms;
and if be bad àny unpleasantness witb the
local wbeat buyer bie might be told to go
somewbere else. Hie was entiredy at tbe mercy
of the trade. I do net find any more fault
witbh that frade t-han witb any other busines,.

but when one party to a transaction bas al
bhepowerin bis bands tbings do flot work out
very weIl.
Then came the loading platforms. If we
did flot like the elevator we could load over
the platform into the car. That was the first
great liberty the wheat grower enioyed in the
marketing of bis wheat. I do flot want to
folIow ail the transactions that took place
from then on. I tbink that conditions were
more satisfactory than fbey bad ever been
before.
Stili there was dissatisfaction-a feeling on
the part of a great mnany that too large a
profit wvas taken by the middieman, and that
tbis couid be saved and conditions bettered
if the farmers themseives bandled their wbeat
io large quantities. So the Pool was organized.
It was organized flot for the purpose of fixing
a price at which wbeat sbould be sold, nor
with the object of. controlling tbe market,
but simply as a means wbereby the year's
product migbt be disposed of on a more satisfactory basis. Formerly, as soon as farmers
had threshed their wbeat tbey rushed it to
the elevator, and the combined wheat crop
of the three Western Provinces was offered
for sale at one time, witb the resuit that the
market was depressed. The purpose for wbich
the Pool was started wvas to regulate the marketing of wbeat se that the supply would more
nearly keep race with the demand. Tbat purpose, whicb I think was a good one, bas been
foliowed down to the present time, and it was
successfully carried out until last year.
A good deal of misapprebension seems te
cxist in the public mmnd wîth regard to wbat
happened last year. I might mention bere
a fact that is now pretty generally known,
that the British Government had entered into
an agreement wvitb the Argentine Republic
to buy their wheat and make payment for it
witb British products. It was felt by tbe
Pool officiais that tbe prevailing price was
tee iow, and there is no doubt that wbeat was
hcld back to a certain extent. But were tbe
Pool officials the only people who toek sucb
a line of action? Business men, private individuals and speculators did exactiy tbe samne
sort of thing. A number of farmers in Western Canada wbo are not members of the Pool
soid their wbeat and bougbt futures, expecting,
like evcrybody else, that the price would rise.
Unfortunately everybody, including the Pool
officiais, guessed wrongly. Tbere is no doubt
that if the Pool bad acted differentiy and
tbrowo the wbeat on the market, tbe price
would bave dropped and the Pool officiais
wouid have been criticized just as severely as

SENATE

they have been. As a matter of fact, the
officials have declared that at the time they
were charged with holding back the wheat
thev were endeavouring to get rid of it at
a price that would show a profit to the
growers.
I do not think that ·the Pool can properly
be criticized for trying to market the wheat in
a satisfactory manner. Some farmers may have
been under the delusion that an organization
like the Pool can defy the fundamental law
of supply and demand. So long as a brisk
demand continues it is possible not only to
sell goods but to make a profit, but you
cannot sell goods for which there is no demand. I do think, however, that the officials
and some of the organs of the Pool made
extravagant statements concerning the benefits
that a farter would receive by becoming a
member, and it may be that perhaps those
statements created in Great Britain and some
other European countries a sentiment that
worked to the disadvantage of our wheat
growers and sellers.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Will my honourable friend permit a question?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Certainly.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I have been greatly interested in the frank
and clear statement that has been made by
my honourable friend. He has told us that
after having had the experience of one contract period of five years with the Pool he
decided not to contract for a second period,
but in future to do his own marketing. My
honourable friend is a responsible and intelligent farmer and we should like to know why
he thinks he will do better by the change.
Many of us have a certain degree of sympathy
with the Pool. I for one have a strong
sympathy.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: In reply to my right
honourable friend I might say that I have
never on any occasion, publicly nor privately,
criticized in any way the Pool's actions.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: No.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: My reason for deciding
not to continue with the Pool is a purely
personal one. At the end of my contract
period I did not like the statements and
actions of some officials of the Pool and some
growers in Saskatchewan who were suggesting
a compulsory pool, an organization which
farmers would be forced to join if they did
not join voluntarily. I disagreed with that
attitude, and that is the only reason why I
did not renew miy contract. I had no dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Pool.
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

'I may say that I am a member of the Coarse
Grains Pool, and my barley and other products go there. I have simply reta.ined my
personal liberty in selling wheat. I thought
that some of the people who belong to the
Pool were trying to infringe on personal
liberty.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: That is the Conservative view, and I absolutely agree with the
honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I think my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) is a little
too greatly alarmed over the future of the
small farm, and unduly optimistic about the
prospects of mechanized agriculture. If honourable senators will pardon me, I should
like to make a brief reference to my own experience. I use both tractor and horse-power
on my farm, and I am inelined to believe
that horses furnish as cheap power as tractors do, and that, at least for many years to
come, tractors will not entirely supplant
horses. As long as the price of gasoline remains at its present high level, I think Dobbin will continue at work on Western farms.
From the time I was first elected to Parliament I have been of the opinion that large
farms would gradually be done away with;
that the trend was towards smaller acreages
and more intensive cultivation, with the
people living more closely together and no
longer having to contend with the disadvantages that result from isolation. I take
exception to the picture that is now often
painted of a future wherein only large farms
will have a chance of success. I believe that
farmers will go back to the smaller units,
and that wheat growing in Western Canada
will be permanently successful only so long
as it is carried on with other activities on the
farm.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I believe that there is
a good future for the farmer who operates
in a businesslike way a stall unit, say of half
a section, and, in addition to growing wheat
and other grains, carries on a certain amount
of mixed farming. It is my belief that we
shall always have that type of farm in
Canada, and that if we had not we should
be in a bad way.
I have read something about large-scale
agricultural operations in Russia, where as
many as 450 tractors are used on one farm
and great forces of men are employed in the
spring and at harvest time. These men, i'

1899"REVISED
EDMTON

SENATE

In 1926 there was a strong demand all over
this country for immigrants. Many of the
mayors, manufacturers and publications that
are to-day so outspoken against allowing
immigrants to enter this country were at that
time proclaiming that Canada needed immigrants to help pay our taxes and to make
business for our railways. I think that the
only classes among our citizens who did net
have mueh to say in that regard were the
labourers and the agriculturalists. There was
an insistent demand that the volume of immigration should be increased, and for a time
it was increased.
Will honourable senators excuse me for making a personal remark? May I say that from
what I learned on two trips through to the
Pacifie coast, when I interviewed the Governments of the four Western Provinces, I
soon realized tht the demand for agricultural
labour had about reached the saturation point.
In 1928 I passed a regulation- that during that
year the numbe-r of immigrants coming to
Canada from Central and Eastern Europe
should be restricted to 30 per cent of the
number that enterrd in 1927. If honourable
senators will cast their nemories back to the
session of 1927 they will recolleet that the
Department of Immigration was subjected to
strong criticisi on the ground that it failed
to bring in a sufficient number of immigrants.
It was charged that it was almost impossible
for a B3ritisher to get into this country; that
the cliief object of the Department seemed
to be to exeluide desirable applicants, and that
absurd questions had to be answered before
entry was pernitteI. I may be excused for
feeling a little heat wln I think of the
criticism I had to endure at that session,
while I was aware that we were receiving more
immigrants than the country could absorb.
In 1929 a further regulation was passed that
during that ycar we would admit only 25
per cent of the number of immigrants from
Eastern and Central Europe who had entered
in 1928. In other words, for every 100 that
we admitted in 1927 we would admit only
seven in 1929.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Continent of Europe?

That is, from

Hon. Mr. FORKE: From the Continent
of Europe. Now, if that was not shutting
off continental immigration about as fast as
possible, I do not know anything about it.
As I read the proposal of the present Government, I have no fault whatever to find with
it, because I believe the Government is going
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

just a little bit farther in the direction in
whicn I was attempting to lead the country
at that particular time.
I have read in the papers very strong
criticism by some public men about the character of the immigrants who have been
allowed to come into Canada. I quite agree
with some of their statements, but I would
ask honourable gentlemen to bear in mind
that I was severely criticised for the questions asked on the examinations thaýt those
immigrants had to undergo before they were
allowed to enter Canada. I know that one
member in another place, one of the prominent leaders, made the statement that no
self-respecting Britisher would answer such
questions as were being asked. Those examinations were intended to shut out persons
who were unfit, or were unable to make their
wav in this new country. No doubt, even
with all those precautions, a good many came
to Canada who should not have come.
Now conditions are altered. They have
changed so rapidly that it has been pretty
difficult to keep marching with the times. In
regard to the employment of labour, changes
are taking place every day. I have already
spoken about mechanized industry on the
farm. Even on the smaller farrns the mechanizing of agriculture has reduced the number
of labourers required. In 1928, I judge, onethird fewer labourers were required on
Western farms than in 1927; and fewer men
were needed in 1929 than in 1928. So did the
demuand for agricultural labourers decrease
until it fell off completely and there was
sufficient labour in the country to meet all
requirements. A similar condition bas developed in manufacturing-in industrial life. We
know that one machine will do work for which
ten men were required only a few short years
ago. Such changes have entirely altered the
labour situation. I have great sympathy with
those who are trving to solve the difficulties
that have arisen, but I do not think it is in
very good taste to turn around and condemn
the action that was taken a couple of years
ago. when the demand was in the opposite
direction.
I have heard of no solution of the problems
that are facing the world to-day. Unemployment is a world condition. Take the present
situation in Western Canada. On the whole,
we have had a good crop in the four Western
Provinces. While, no doubt, there are spots
where there are crop failures and consequent
hardship, we have a land overflowing with the
products of Mother Nature. The trouble today is that we have too much. I have on
my own farm a really good crop this year, and

SEPTEMBER 11, 1930
I have no complaint ta make, though I amn
zot prepared ta aay that we had a proaperous
year. Sa it has bep-n ahI along the line: the
farms -have produced in abundance. Yet we
are up against hard tines, and poverty, and a
situation that is very diffleult -Vo meet.
While I have great sym.pathy with the praceedinga that are going on in anather place,
I must repeat in alh seriousness, honourable
gentlemen, that I sec no solution for aur problems at the present tinte. I have acen no

continue; the world cannat suifer because of
phenty. There would really be no aver-praductian if we had praper distribution. It is

but there are to-day in the world hiingry

UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN
NEW BRUNSWICK
DISCUSSION

Bef are the Order of the Day:
Hon. G. D. ROBERTISON: Bef are the
Order of the Day is proceeded with, may I
say a f ew words? A telegram came in a short
time ago which ýconcerna a couple of honourable members in another place, and in regard
ta which they suggest that I might make an
explanation for the information of the people
directly aifected. The telegram is from one
of the prorninent newspapers in Saint john,
New Brunswick, and says:
False report emnanating from office of
Minister of Labour to eifect that only five
hundred unemployed in New Brunswick. Loaks

SENATE
like attempt on part of someone to withhold
our share of twenty million dollars voted to
relieve unemployment. We are advised on good
authority that at least two thousand unemployed in Saint John alone. Will you please
co-operate in having false figures corrected?
Would appreciate having assurance from you
by wire that everything possible being done
to sec that Saint John and New Brunswick
obtain share of relief at hands of Government.
Would like to have your answer in time for
publication this afternoon's paper.
The facts are these. On the 12th of August
last every community of more than 10,000
people was invited through its Mayor to give
the Department of Labour a picture of the
existing unemployment situation and a forecast of what it miglit be by about the end
of this year. Returns were received from the
cities of the Province of New Brunswick, and
the best information obtained from the city
of Saint John was that the number of unemployed was 300 in the city and 500 in the
province, but that as the season advanced the
number would increase to about 2,500. This
information, which is now somewhat questioned, was obtained froi the Mayor of the
city.
A telegram arrived vesterday from the Acting Mayor of Saint John, which reads as
follows;
According to newspaper report estimate of
nempiloyment in province is 500. This absolutelv incorrect as after careful survey, we
estinate there are at least 2.500 in this city
:alone. This will be very much increased by
vlosing down of many public works, also of
cotton and pulp midls, which will add materially
to this number.
So if the information given out in another
place as emanating from the Departinent 'of
Labour is incorrect, the Department must
disclaim any responsibility for it, because it
was obtained in the proper way, through the
chief magistrate of the city concerned.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What would the
honourable gentleman consider te be the
extent of unemployment in New Brunswick,
from the information lie has at hand?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no right
to consider: I ask for the information froin
the people in the locality or the province,
as the case may be. The provincial representative who attended the Employment Service Couneil meeting in Ottawa on the 21st
of August practically confirmed the information we had at that time. In my judgment, what is happening is that, as fall
approaches, a substantial number is being
added daily to the number of the unemployed in the Province of New Brunswick,
and that the estimate which they gave, of
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

roughly 2,500 this faili, is approximately
correct.
My honourable friend knows, of
course, having been Minister of Labour, that
it is not possible for one at this distance
aceurately to estimate the situation, but I
should say that 2,500 is probably th miniimium number of unemployed in that province
now.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I suggest to the
Minister that the number of unemployed
ascertained by the inquiries made does not
approach anything like the total number. The
inquiries went out to towns or cities having
10,000 or more inhabitants. I know of small
towns and villages in which there are large
numbers of unemployed.
For instance, in
Nipissing, in ail the smail towns between
North Bay and Sudbury the popudation is
composed largely of men who work in the
woods, either Jogging ipine or cutting pulp
for the paper mills. Most of these men, who
are now idle, would not come within the scope
of the inquiries that have been made. This
class of labour, of course, is unorganized. I
wouid suggest to the honourable Minister tha.t
he send out inquiries to all the small towns,
if possible. If he does so he will find, I think,
that there are several thousand more unemployed besides those of whoin lie now has
knowdedge.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand it,
the unemployed my honourable friend from
Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) spealks of are
men who are waiting to go to the woods for
lumbering operations in the winter, and whose
condition to-day is no different from what it
is any year at this time.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No. On the contrary,
I may say te my honourable friend, to be
specific, that the miintis of the Abitibi Paper
Company, which are situated at Sturgeon
Falls, Esprncla and Saul't Ste. Marie, wiil
not take out one ord of pulpwood this year.
We all know what that means. It means
fthat these men are left at home idle. The
pine operators this year wil1 not lumber to
the extent of more than 50 per cent of what
ftheir operations have been heretofore.
Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
Froma the
phraseology of the telegram that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has read,
it wourild appear that fthe correspondent is
somewhat afraid that New Brunswick may
not get its share of the $20,000,000, the granting of which this Chamber is to bc asked to
a,pprove during this session. I woufld point
out to my honourable friend that the pro'vincs must turn te the Federall Government

SEPTEMBER 12, 1930
and daim that they cannot cope with the
situation; that it is no longer merely provinciail, but has become a Federal concern.
If New Brunswick is really in -the happy
position of having on-ly 2,500 unemployed, it
will not turn to the Federal Government and
claim that it is unable to tope with the situation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did not intend
to start a discussion at this time, buit perhaps
I shall be pardoned for making some further
observations. I am quite sure it is net the
Govemment's intention that the grant which
is being made for the relief of unemployment
is to bu distributed on the basis of population.
Assistance will be given according to the need
as it may exist and appear in any part of
Canada.
So far as the rural situation is ooncerned.
it was quite impossible within the short time
available to secure definite information from
all the smail municipalities. The Government desired to get as accurate a picture as
possible in the few days within which the
Department liad to act, and that picture has
been obtained. It has been represented that
there is a great deal of unemployment in
rural constituiencies as well. That is unfortunately truc in many instances, but there is
also this feature, that the situation fluctuates.
May I point out, along the line on which the
honourable senator for Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Gordon) spoke a few minutes ago, that in
certain parts of Canada 6,300 men were released from the lumber woods this past summer. I have in mind particularly the Province of British Columbia. Most of such men
were absorbed in highway construction work
within that province, chiefly in the interior,
which they are attempting to penetrate with
new roads. Bu-t that work, as also the appropriation under which it is carried on, is
rapidly coming to an end. Therefore, while
unemployment is bad enough in the city of
Vancouver at the moment, thousands of men
will be drifting into that city shortly, because
there is no place in the interior of that great
province for those. men to stay through the
winter months, and they will naturally gravitate to the coast. It may well be that in a
centre like Vancouver there will develop a
situation which will justify aid perhaps out
of proportion to the population. The city of
Winnipeg is another centre that in winter
gathers men from the country districts all
around. Rural municipalities may be practically cleared of unemployed people, who
may drift into municipalities a hundred miles
away, and may render more dificult the prob-

37

lem with which we are trying to deal. In my
humble opinion, as I think honourable members will appreciate, it is net practicable to
distribute relief for unemployment on the
basis ef the population throughout the country.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS

IN

REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governer
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Bénard for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
before I go on with the few remarks I propose
to make on the subject-matter of the Speech
from the Th-rone, may I add just a few words
with regard to the situation in New Brunswick,
because they may clarify the matter in the
minds of some honourable gentlemen. I had
already seen a topy of the telegram that was
read by the Minister of Labor, and I think I
know what it means. The information which
we had, and which was contained in the
telegram, in regard to numbers of unenployed, was no doubt correct at the time that
information was given. Up to a very short
time ago the employment situation a-Il over
the Maritime Provinces was fairly satisfactory,
I think, but about the middle of August a
deputation of the lumbermen of New Brunswick, particularly those operating on Crown
lande, appeared before the local Government
and made the statement, which they substantiated pretty well-I happened to be there
and listened to the argument-that unless
some very material relief was received there
would be 10,000 men unemployed this winter
in New Brunswick; men who have ordinarily
been employed at work in the woods. The
reason why the Minister of Labour has been
communicated with is because that information appeared in the press down there, and he
has been advised that the situation is looking
very much worse than it did a while ago.
I do not wish to go into the reasons, but
anybody who follows the lumbering industry
of this country from coast to coast knows
that no company can operate on Crown lands
with a profit; that a lumberman does very
well if he gets the cost of his operation and
does not lose his capital.
Honourable gentlemen, I want to join those
who have already spoken in most hearty congratulations to the honourable gentleman who
now occupies the presidential Chair in this
Chamber. He deserved well of his country
and his party, and my wish is that he and

carried on mixed farining, with neyer less
than five crops on the 600 acres, and I have
neyer suffered a total failure; for while in
some years the crop in one or two particular

be good. One always seema to be able to
strike a pretty fair average with a diversity
of crops, 'but I feel sure I should flot have
been able to continue farming if I had been
producing only one commodity.
I should like to touch upon one other subject that was mentioued by my 'honourabie
friend from De Lanaudière (Hon. MT. Casgrain). Referring to the eleistion caqmpa.ign
of 1911, hie said represeritatives of the Conservative patty made statements derogatory
to iwhat was then called, the "Laurier uavy."
My honourable friend did fot teli1 us whether
hie had any proof that the persons alleged to
have made the statements aetually did so,
but I suppose no 'honourable senator would
say auything in this House that hie was not
prepared to substantiate. Therefore I shall
assume that the stailtements were made, an'd
I vau only say that I regret very much that
any Couservat-ive campaigner was -a party to
such tactics. Unfortunately, however, that
sort of thing was noit a'bolished in 1911, for it
was very much in evidence in the Province of
Quebec during the last campaign. It seems to
me that the receurt election teaches uothiug
more plainly than that we -are a united people,
and that if we on the northeru hall of this
continent desire to continue to live in barmony we must see to it that differences of
racial origin are not emphasized.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Hear, hear.

Hlon. Mr. BLACK: In this country we
olLght flot to ý'y1e ourselves French Canadýians,
or Acadian French. We do not eall ourselvee
English Canadians, Scottish Canadians, Irish
Canadians or Ital-ian Canadians. Let us bear
in mind that we have a common heritage and
a common duty, and Éhat we can truly enjoy
that heritage and pcrformn that duty ouly if
we regard ourselves above ail as Canadiaus
and ,discard racial sud parochial differences.
I have before me, honourable senators, a
number of -papers, some written in French and
some in English, containing quotations froan
speeches made by three or four honourable
gentlemen who arc sitting in this Chaanber
to-day. So deep is xny respect for my hanourable frieuds that I shall no;t read those quotations as I had formerly intended' te do, for
I fear that serme emnbarrassmnent mîght result.
However, I shouldi like dt known that I did not
corne uuprepared to substantiate my state-

meut that the recent clection campaign in the
Province of Quebec was anarked 'by appeals to
racial prejudice. I sincerely hope that in
future no honourable senator who sits ou
either aide -of this House will make in auy
election enanpangn remarks like those recorded
in the papers before me; and the restait of
the recent vote in Queibe, which goes to show
that it is not worth while to indulge in such
remarks, augurs well for the realization of my
hope. I think that no feýature of the receut
elactiou gave me, as a Canadian, greater pleesure thau the &ivision of the votes 'hetweeu the
two parties iu -the Province cd Quebec. That
was a tangi-ble proof of the souuduess of the
people, sud a warninýg that they would not
shlow themselves to ba longer misled by false
cries of race. lt showed that Quebec realized
that it is a member of the coruzuon brotherhood of -provinces that 'make up this great
Dominion.
Some Hou. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May that sentiment
long prevail, sud may we neyer again sce on
the pages of any paper in Canada such
statements as were published by La Presse
sud The Gazette sud other newspapers-statements which are a disgrace to thîs country of which we are so proud.
Honourable senators, 1 know you will be
pleased to hear that I shall not detain you
longer. It is a matter of regret to me, though,
that I arn uuable to coutinue, for 1 have a*
good deal of material prepared; but I arn
sufferiug fromn an exceediugly bad cold sud
sore throat, so much so that every word I
utter is very painful to me.
Iu closing, may I say I arn not one of
those who hold that the party that bas gone
out of power did uothiug for Canada. It is
a pleasure to say that; it did some great thiugs
for our country. But I ain equally sincere
when I say I believe that the Liberal-Conservative party has doue still greater things
for Canada, sud I have au aflidiug faith
that the Liheral-Conservative party will do
far more for this country in the future than
it has had au opportunity of doing in the
past.

that auy remarks I make this afternoou will
be without prejudice. May I congratulate

SENATE

fiuently speaks the t-wo officiai languages. I
desire aiso to compliment the mover and the
seconder of the Address, whose remarks were
instructive,
and
expressed
in moderate
language.
It seemns to me that Canada shouid be
congratuia.ted on the elimination from Parliament of class groups and the virtual return
of the two-party system. May I not aiso
congratulate our country in now having at
its head elle who inspired the Speech under
consideration, a Speech which appealed to the
ordinary business man as commendable in
simply caiiing for quick action to suive an
in*herited probiem of transcending importance
to the country at large? The present Prime
Minister is one whose vision is equaiied oniy
by his courage and business capacity-three
o'"teibutes which. are the fund'anentals of
leadership; one whio realizes that we have
within olir own country not oniy natural resources of great magnitude, but aiso a
tremendous potentiai market for products now
being purchased from other countries to the
detriment of Canadians; one who, to use a
simple illustration, understands tha.t the
making of a wagon in Canada from Canadiani
materiais resuits in henefit to labourers, farmers, manufacturers, mierchants, and, indeed, ail
classes of our country, directly or indirectly,
whereas the importation of a similar vehicie
means the spending of our mioney in another
countrv, with a consequent loss to the cmpiovees of this country and a weakening of
the purcehasing power of Canadians as a whole.
The expectation that changes in the tariff
wili give Canadians an opportunity to secure
their home market on a basis of competitive
equality with the producers in other countries
is a direct incentive f0 action which wvili resulf
in increased empinyment and better bu.siness
conditions. 1 think the people of Canada in
genr'rai, and Canadian labour in particular,
are to be congratui-ated on securing the services as Minister of Labour of oiir levelheaded colicague <Hon. Mr. Roberfson), Who
lias consented to undertake a very difficuif
task at this time. He is endowed by nature
to an unusual degree with all the faculties
neccssary for the performance of the heavy
duties pertaining to his office, and I am saýtisfied that his abilifies wiil be reflected in his
wvork. We ail are deepiy initcrestcd in trying
to find a solution of the unempinyment problcm, and I helieve thaf the simple measures
whic*h are to come before us wiil receive the
sympathetie support of honourable members
of this Husse, regard1ess of the necessariiy
heavy expendifure wliicb wlvi be invoived.
Hon. Mr. GORDON

Considerable referenee was made vesterdav
to the Wheaf Pool, and, as there seems to be
some disagreement among honourabie mcmibers concerning this question, 1 thoiight if
might be in order for me to make a few
remarks upon the subject. The Pool slipped
iasf year because of an unwarranted optimismi
based upon its abilitv to obtain credit ta
huid a commodity with which the world
market wvas overstocked. The Pool met the
fate of the newiy-rich man who imagines hie
has "the world by the tail" su long as bis
substance and credit are in evidence. If overlooked the fact that some peuple do not
believe it is gond policy to withhoid products
fromn sale, even at prices whicha for the time
hieing mnay appear tu be unreasonabi 'v low.
But ail human beings have te, learn in tbe
sehool of experience, and sonner or latfr
every man wvho remains in business discovers
that as a general rule if is a gond principie
to dispose of a cummoditv af the market
price (luring the year it is produced. In nine
cases out of ten the withholding of any coininodity fromn the market bevond its normiai
seliing time rst
in lusses through accumuiilative charges which cannof be avoidcd.
These remarks are nof made in a spirit of
erifieisni of the Pool's management, for I believe the officiais were cntitied to use their
own judgmcnt. My oni.v regret is that their
anticipations were nut reaiized, and that I
ain unable to sav to my friends now. 'I told
vou su." As wvas remarked by une honourabie
gentleman vesterclay, the Pool officiais- wereý
ot the only unes who made errors of judgment iast year. In the early part of the Vear
the whoie coulntry was filied with optimiiism,
and peuple who supposed fhemseix es clever
thought thaf the top of the markct in anv
commodity wouid neyer bc reaehed.
The
w'isc business man, as weil as the unwise, lias
suffere(i because of that over-uptiimistie spirit.
Jn my opinion the Puni officiais mnight have
inarketed severai million bushels of whcat
at gond prices had they not. in commion wvith
inany other peuple, beiieved that prices on
the world market wvould continue to rise. As8
I have aircady said, ail business nien musf
iearn tbrougb experience.
After aIl. the
management of the Puni is young in experienre, for its system is a new one, and the
lesson it has nuw learned at a tremendo'is
price. ot onfly tn ifself, but aiso to its manv'
sh.rehoiders, is one which to them., at least,
wiii in future be very valuable.
As I intimated before, the wholc failure is due f0 the
fart that the Pool is composed of human
beings, and for my part I aftach to thom
no blame whatever.

SEPTEMBER 12, 1930
It is a greaf pleasure to find that after an
clection whicb bas turned this country upside
down-for the better. I think-all our old
friends are still lef t witb us. It is a pleasure to
come back bere again and to see thbe present
leader of the Opposition and all the good
friends that hie bas around bim. We in this
Chamber have always fried to conducf our
business according to business principles. When
the business in wbicb we are engaged is concluded we put up the sbutters and go back
to our homes; and wben there is something
for us f0 do we come here again. I have
no doubt that if the business in another place
were carried on in the saine way the country
would be better for it. 1 may say that under
the new regime, I believe, the methods employed will be more businesslike than in the
peet. At ail events, I for one amn hoping se.
Hon. JOHN LEWIS: Honourable members,
I desire to join in congratulating the Speaker
upon bis new position, and the House upon
obfaining bis services for the post. I also
should like to congratulate all those wbo have
preceded me in this discussion. There was
evidence of a certain amount of partisan spirif,
which I suppose slumbers in us ahl, but there
was also a great deal thet was instructive and
provided food for tbougbt.
I should like to say a few words on a subiect wbicb, while not mcnfioned in the Speech
from the Tbrone. is related f0 it; fhat is to
sey, the relation of our tariff to the movement
for a larger Imperial frade. I make no criticism of the omission from tbe Speech, because
I suppose the matter was regerded as obvious,
and also because we are leff in no doubt as
to the intentions of the new Government.
The Prime Minister, wvhile leader of the
Opposition, very clearly laid down the proposition thaf the policy of e volunfary preference
was f0 be abandoned, and that there was to
be substituted for it a policy of business bargaiuing, and a demand for equivalents. I do
flot intend f0 confrovert fbat position, fhougb
I do not agree with if, but I am just a litfle
curious f0 inquire bow if is going f0 work
ouf. Wbaf is the logical conclusion of it?
Where will Canada get off, and wbere will the
Canadien farmer get off, if the idea of strict
business bargaining is carried out?
There are two alternatives. Great Britain,
if sbe adopts the policy of food taxes, mîgbt
conoeivably put a fax on the importation of
foreign foodstuffs and admit our f ood produets
f ree. Wbat is the equivalent f0 that? It is
that we sbould continue to tax foreigu manuifactures. but should admit the manufactures

41

of Great Britain free of dqity. The present
Government is undou-btedly oppoeed to such
a policy, and I do nlot know that any Government is disposed to adopt a policy of the
absolutely free importation of British goods.
Therefore we may dismiss that alternative.
The other alternative is this. We now give a
certain preference to British importe while
stili imposing a considerable tax upon them.
The equivalent of that would be for the
British Parliament to fax foreign wbeat and
other f oreign farm products and to admit, ours
et a somewhaf lower rate. Just as a matter
of conjecture, if might fax foreign wheat, say,
tbirty cents a bush-el an.d ours twenty cents a
bushel. I have very littie doubt thaf under
that system we should be not better off, but
feýr worse off than we are at present. Thaf is
neot by any means a fancifu1 conjecture.
It bas been very strongly impressed upon
the British fermer that hie needs protection
from the compefifion of foreign wheat, and if
the Beaverbrook crusede sucoeeds, and the
British farmer gets thoroughly into, bis head
the idea, that bie needs protection, I do not
sec why hie will nlot demand protection from
the competition of farmn products from Canada
and other Dominions in the samne way that
our manufacturers demand protection from
British competition as well as from that of
foreign countries.
The present Prime Minister, wbile leader of
the Opposition, very clearly stated his position in regard to the West Indies. He said
fiiet if a dollar was spent in the West Indies
that ougbt to be spent in Canada, if was just
as bad as if that dollar had been spent in the
Unifed States. I do nlot quarrel with that
position eitýher, but I want to, know how if is
going fo work out. The torrespoiiding position of the British farmer is this. He wîll
say that if a bushel of wheaf from Canada
tekzes the plaoe of wbeat that might have been
raised in England, it is just as had as if it had
corne from Russie or the Argentine; or thet
if a pound of Canadien bacon dispiaces bacon
that migbt have been raised ini England, if
is just as bad as if the bacon haid come from
Denma.rk. I find that a great many of our
protectionisf friends axe cheering on this
movement for the taxation of food in the Old
Country. In my opinion they are rather rasb,4
for if their policy succeeds, our Canadian
farmers will have very considerable cause for
enxiety. I sbould like to have the members
from the farming sections, especially in the
West, canvass taheir constituencies a liff le in
regard to this question.
The honourable gentleman fromn Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. MeMeans) repeated a remark with

SENATE

which ho apparcntly agreed. He said that we
were paying to, the United States over $900,000,000 of solid cash, most of wbicha was for
our own raw materiol, whicha they had purchased and were sending back to us in a
fini..hed state. That statemeort has been made
very frequently hy the present Prime Minister. when leader of the Opposition, and I
fancy that a great many people believe it.
It is for this reason that I should like to
examine it. Our imports of fully manufactured produets from the United States amounit
to about $576.000,000. Adding to that, to make
the case as strong as possible, partly miinufactured gooda anîounting to $57,000,000 odd,
we imnport altogether about 8633,000,000 of
m:înufactured products. 0f those manufactured products, tha'se of iran and steel are by
for the
ost important: they amount to
$317,000,000 a year. Now. is it true that the
iron manufactures that we import represent
raw moterial that we have sent to the United
States 'and are getting hock in a finishied
state?

We imported manufactured

The Prime Minister is flot onîy a distin'guished. lawyer, but a paet, a man with a
very strong dramatic instinct, as is shown by
his saying that if hie did not succeed in
carrying out his promises hie would perish
in the attempt. I do not think any one
uf us cau visualize the Prime Minister jumping off the ta'wer of the Parliament Buildings,

SEPTEMBER 12, 1930
or can imagine his substantial form fading
away to a shadow. I am sure we all hope
nothing of the kind will happen. But I
suppose his dramatie instinct stood him in
rather good stead in the elections, for we have
now a populace whose dramatic instinct has
been very largely stimulated by the moving
pictures and the talkies, and probably those
of us who take part in public life wiiH have
to appeal a little more to that instinct, because it is very hard to make people study
facts and figures. I do not think that people
differ so much in their intellectual capacity
as in their patience and willingness to study
public questions, and I am afraid that there
is no great hope of present improvement in
that respect.
Honourable
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
members of the Senate, I do not rise with
the intention of making any extended remarks which might be dignified by the name
of an address; I rise merely to refer to a few
of the facts that have been brought out in
the debate.
His Honour the Speaker has been so frequently congratulated upon his appointment
that I hesitate to refer to the subject. It
was my privilege during the sessions from
1908 to 1911 to occupy the next desk to
his in the House of Commons, and from
what I learned of him at that time, and from
watching his course as a public man since,
I feel that it is my duty rather to congratulate the members of the Senate upon their
good fortune in having a gentleman of his
ability and capacity to preside over • them
during the Parliament that is just starting.
In regard to the mover (Hon. Mr. Bénard)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Taylor) of the
Address, I only wish to say that we fully
expected that they would acquit themselves
in a creditable manner, and that they lived
up to our expectation.
This session is called under mather unusual
circumstances. It is only about three months
since the last session of Parliainent closed.
Since that time we have had a general election. I do not know that any good purpose
would be served by going back and discussing
what took place during that eleotion. Thie
Government of that day selected the time for
the eleotion; the machinery of the election
was entirely in its banda; it sdlected the
ioeue-and very properly so. The Opposition
stated its case and presented it very fully
to the electos. The electors gave their
verdict, and fortunately it was a very decisive
verddvt, and the Govermnent of to.day has

a good working majority. We are <aled, as
you ail know, in order that we may take sme
steps to secure employment for the large
number of people who are unemployed at the
present time. This is a very worthy object,
and I hope the Government wi, be successful in its efforts.
This country is pa'sing through a period
of depression, but I do not know that ià is
altogether an unmixed evii. Occasional adversity is good for the country as weli as
for the individual. It causes people to stop
and think, and to develop a spirit of selfreliance, which is very necessary. I hope that
the Government will make it plain to those
whom it is assisting at the present time that
the assistance is given raither to prevent
suffering than to convey the idea that the
Government will always see to it that they
have work. I may be wrong, but I think
there is too much paternalism in both our
Federal and our Provincial Governments, and
that our people are losing the spirit of selfreliance which is essentiall to good oitizenship,
and the development of this country.
I wish to refer briefly to the remarks of
the honourable member for Brandon (Hon.
Mr. Forke), who said that he was speaking
without preparation. I am disposed to think
that the speeches delivered without preparation are the most interesting, because the
extempore speaker is forced to deal with subjects of which he has some knowledge. In
the main I agree with the remarks of that
honourable gentleman, but while he was discussing the Wheat Pool it occurred to me
that in this Parliament and in this country
too much attention is given to the wheat
question. I know that it is one deserving of
a great deal of attention, but to one interested
in live stock, as I am, wheat is not the only
product of our agriculturists, and the West
is not the only part of the country that grows
thait product. The Province of Ontario contributes a large portion of our production,
and in the western sections of Ontario, where
wheat is grown, the average yield is 25 per
cent higher per acre than that in the West.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But it is poor.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: It is not poor, and
there is a special demand for it. But we
have a very large cattle industry in this
country, and if we cannot find a market for
our wheat or coarse grain, there is no better
way of using it than in the production of
live stock. It is necessary that something
should be done to procure markets for our
live stock products.

SENATE
In connection wi'th the revision of the tariff,

1 wish to point out to the member of the

Government who is in this flouse at 'the
present time (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that the
cattie industry is now in a rather bad position.
Taking ail grades of cattie, I may say that
the price is only about two-thirds of what
it was one year ago. Our cattie men have
been practically shut out of the United States
market, and there have been imported frorn
Australia in 1929 quantities of chilled meat
equal te -the products of over 8,000 head of
cattle, these imports taking up a market that
our people could very we]l supply. I am
aware that Australia is, one of our sister
dominions, and is deserving of some consideration, but the live stock people of
this couotrv are suffering under unusual
conditions at present-such conditions as
would, ini my -opinion, justify the Government in taking- some action along this line.
With reference te the live stock industry, I
wvas surprised to read the other day that of
the total importation of bacon into Great
Britain only 'two per cent came f1rom Canada,
or originated in Canada. That is something
foi' which our Government should bo able to
do something- in the wtay of encouragement.
There is certainly a large market for Canadian
bacon if if is properly looked after. The bacon
indutiqrvý is in a soniewhat different position
from that of the beef indusfry, because it ean
be incecascd in a very short tiýme, whereas it
takes two or three years te increase our herds
of cattle. That is one reason whv eur cattle
raisors sbould reeive some consideration at
present. When the markelfing is very bad
they allow their herdhs to diminish, and it fakes
themi some vears, te get back te normal conditions. I t rîît that the Minister will bring
this matter ite fhe attention of bis celîeagues.
The 'member for Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke)
referred al-so te ipower farming, and expressed
the view that the horse is still use-ful. and thaf
small farms are preferable te large ones. I
agree wvith him. The small farîi is the ideal
one for this country if it ýcan be c.arried on
suce.cessfullv.
I wvill give yei ýsome idea of
conditions in sonie parts of Western Ontario.
I come froni the county of Bruce, which wvas
opened up for settflement about the middle of
the last century, the land sale being in 1854.

municipalities in that county was appreximat ely twice what it is te-day. The present

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
iriembers, I have ce further business te bring
before the flouse to-day, but wish te make

SEPTEMBER
a statement, as to adjournrnent. There is
nothing on the Order Paper, and no honourable member has anything to bring forward.
It is expected that the Bill which has been
proceedýing in another place will pass there
to-day. The resolution respecting it bas
already been passed. Such being the case,
and this being an ernergent session, I arn
going to move that this Huse adjourn only
until Monday evening. The other Chamber
wil] flot sit to-rnorrow, no notice having heen
given; so it will continue on Monday. I
know that Monday evening is flot agreeable
to every member of this Chamhber. Sorne
members have said they would prefer adjournment to sorne other hour tha~n eight o'elock,
daylight saving tirne, because their trains
run on standard. tirne. I refer particularly
to members who corne frorn central or western Ontario. However, as I anticipate that
the Bill will 'be ready for us on Monday
evening, and will require our attention then,
I move that when the House adjourns it do
stand adjourned until Monday evening at

Hon. Mr. BELAND: Could you make it
hialf-past eight?
lion. Mr. WIÏLLOUGHBY: I arn perfectly
ag-reeable that it should be half-past eight.
We are hoping that -the Bill will be passed

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: lIt would be no

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
The only
objection to meeting at a later hour is that
it rnight interfere with the arrangernents and

I therefore suggest half-past eight on Monday night.

UNEMPLOYMENT

RELIEF BILL

FIRST READING

Bill 2, an Act for the granting of aid
for the Relief of Unernployment.-Hon. Mr.
Rlobertson.
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON rnoved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourahie rnernbers, possibly an
eyplanation of thîs Bill is in order at the
moment, 'but, as honourable rnembers, 1 arn
sure, are generally familiar with the purposes
of t'he legislation embodied in the Bill, the
explanation will be very brief. This legisiation arises out of the conditions existing in
the country that prompted the Prime Minister
to have this special session of Parliarnent
called for a specifie purpose. As we are ahi
aware, the Bill now before us for consideration
has heen deait with in another place. Briefly,
the Bilh is intended to provide financial resources by which the Government rnay aid
in relieving the unemployed, prefera-bly by
the creation of opportunities for ernployrnent.
This is to be done where possible in cooperation with the provinces and the mnunicîpahities. It is flot the Government's intention that this fund shahl be expended where
unemphoyrnent does not exist. In the opinion
<if the Gnvernment it is not possible to define
in detail all the purposes for which relief is
to be granted, what, form such relief mnust
necessarily take, the manner in whieh ex-

SENATE

penditures shall be made, or the extent of the
expenditure in any given place. Much will
depend upon the needs in the varions localities.
This grant is very much like the road grant
of some twenty million dollars that was passed
by Parliament about 1919, which was used, as
honourable senators will remember, for the
purpose of providing employment to alleviate
the conditions following the demobilization of
troops after the war, and which undoubtedly
accelerated greatly the programme of road
building throughout Canada at that time. It
is possible that a portion of the amount appropriated by this Bill will be used for similar
purposes, as the need indicates.
I think it is unnecessary for me to review
the situation. I tried to cover the ground
briefly the other day in the debate on the
Address. My remarks at that time were intended to give, as a sort of lead, a picture
of what has occurred with respect to unenployment and the extent to which it exists at
the moment. This Bill carries our minds on
from that point. It is sufficient, I think, to
say that unemployment has considerably increased during the past thirty days. As the
season advances, as the harvest ends and summer activities draw to a close, unemployment
in many parts of Canada continues to increase.
There is always a certain amount of seasonal
unemiplo*tyment in this country, and probably

there always will be, but the extent of unemploy nent at this time is abnormal. There
have been during the sumnier and there are
now more unemployed in Canada than there
have been at this season of any previous year
in the history of the country. Furthermore,
there are more men ont of work in Canada
to-day than there were at any time during
last winter. It is true also that the thousands
of men in Canada who were without jobs
last winter have entirely exhausted their
limited resources. and many who have been
oct of work all summer have had their credit
Consequently the conseriously impaired.
ditions under which the unemployed are facing
the coming winter are unprecedented in the
history of this country. All of this emphasizes
the importance and necessity of the Federal
Government doing all that it can, or all that
in such a erisis it might reasonably be expected to do, to assist the provinces and municipalities in relieving the distress of the people.
This Government fully recognizes, as Governments in times past have recognized, that
the obligation to take care of people in need
rests prinarily with the municipal authorities.
There is no change in that situation. Secondly, if the municipalities are unable to cope
Hon.

MNr. ROBERTSON.

with the situation the province may be called
upon for aid. But when the difficulty becomes
national and is beyond the control or power
of the local and provincial authorities, the
Federal Government assumes the responsibility
of coming to their aid in the manner outlined
in this Bill, in order that unemployment may
be minimized, if not abolished.
With this brief explanation, I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. RAOUJ DANDURAND: Honourable
members, in giving a statement to the Senate
a few days ago, the honourable Minister of
Labour said he was ready to supplement that
statement if his attention were drawn to any
further information that was necessary or
desirable. Before making a few brief remarks
-I may not be able to make them this evening-I desire to put some questions to my
honourable friend, because I am in receipt of
requests from various sources for information
as to the application of this projected relief.
I notice that the :nquiry sent out by the
honourable Minister for the purpose of ascertaining the number of men out of work was
sent only to towns having a population of
10,000 or more. Is it the intention to extend
the scope of that inquiry in order that the
needs may be met wherever they exist?
Is it the intention of the Government to
liimit the aid to men completely out of work,
or is it to be extended to those who are only
partially employed?
Is it the intention of the Government to
help manual labour exclusively?
Will such men as are engaged in what we
call seasonal occupations and are thrown ont
of work by the cessation of activities--for
instance, by the closing of ports for the
winter-be able, under this legislation, to
qualify for relief?
Will those men, otherwise regularly employed, who are temporarily suspended, as
happens when large corporations close down
for a few weeks or a month or two, be entitled
to ask for relief?
Has the Labour Department or the Bureau
of Statisties any data covering unemployment,
sieasonal or other, as it bas existed in past
years in various localities?
Has the Government any data showing the
number of unemployed who in past years have
been assisted by local authorities in towns
or cities? I 'put this question because it will
be important to know the ordinary conditions
prevailing throughout the land in ipast years,
so as to make a comparison with the present

situation. As we are speaking of abnormal
conditions, we should be able to compare

SEPTEMBER 17, 1930
normal years with the present one. This is
all the more important because each province
must allege exceptional conditions. I wonder
whether the honourable the Minister could
give us a fair indicationHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I interrupt
my honourable friend -for a moment in the
hope of expediting matters? He is asking a
considerable number of questions, replies to
which we shall be delighted to'supply, but it
occurs to me that our usual practice is to discuss the principle of the Bill on the second
reading, and then to move that the Senate go
into -committee, where we can discuss a Bill
more freely, and without being regarded as
interrupting each other. My respectful suggestion to my honourable friend is that he
should now make any observations he cares
to make respecting the principle of the measure, and should then allow us to move the
Bill into committee. We might thus make
progress more rapidly and more satisfactorily.
I would ask him to consider that suggestion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was proceeding to inquire for this information on the
second reading because I was not sure that
my honourable friend would not ask us to dispense with the committee stage.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Beïfore we go
into committee I will add the one or two
further questions I intended to ask, so that
my honourable friend may obtain the desired
information if it is not at hand at the moment.
It may form part of my general remarks on
the Bill.
The honourable the Minister stated, when
he brought before the House the information
and data that lie obtained from the various
towns and cities, that work was to be furnished, and not ýcharity given. Now I am
not absolutely sure that my honourable friend
would not modify that statement. It does
not seem quite clear. I find that municipalities that give relief, as at times they are
called upon to do, are to be entitled to
I think I have seen the
reimbursement.
statement that for relief purposes the municipality is to pay one-third, the province onethird, and the Dominion Government onethird. That is as far as relief goes, but my
honourable friend might inform the Senate
whether the expenditures for public works
will be paid by municipality, province and
Dominion in the same proportions. Certain
public works may be carried on by the province, and if a municipality is interested in
these works it may be asked to pay. a certain share. I do not know what the arrange-

ment -would be, or what the intentions of
the Government are, in regard to public
works in Which a municipality is primarily
interested. Would the Dominion Government
be called upon to subscribe one-third, and
the province a similar amount, as in the case
of relief?
My honourable friend might also tell us
whether, in contributing either towards public works or towards relief, it is the intention of the federal authorities in some instances to deal directly with the municipalities. I have not seen any very clear statement as to the possible relations between
the federal authorities and the municipalities. It is not clear to me that the federal
authorities will deal exclusively with the
province, and the province with the municipality.
Those are the questions on which I thought
the Senate would desire information, because such queries have come to me, in one
form or another. My honourable friend
states that this Bill will go to committee and
that the information I requested will be
furnished.
I have not heard that anyone on this side
of the House takes exception to the grant
which is being asked of Parliament. The
extent of unemployment, the form of relief,
and the method of distribution must be left
to be determined by the Government, which
bears the responsibility in the matter.
I have asked for information concerning
irdinary unemployment conditions in past
years because, as I have stated, the provinces
must allege exceptional conditions. Heretofore ordinary conditions have been met by
the local authorities. I wonder whether care
will be exercised to see that whatever obligation was discharged by the municipality
under the conditions existing in the past shall
not be wholly transferred to the federal
exchequer. I take it for granted that we
should guard against imposition. We all
know that there has been considerable
clamour in Great Britain because of abuses
which have been revealed in connection with
the distribution of the dole; and it seems to
me that the experience of the Motherland
demonstrates that safeguards and control are
necessary here.
In answer to the suggestion that the expenditures incurred by provinces or municipalities should be audited by the Federal Government, it is claimed that the provinces
would resent such procedure. The grants to
be made under this Act have been likened to
the annual subsidies paid by the Federal Government to the provinces, but it seems to me

SENATE

that the comparison is not a good one, because provincial subsidies are based upon provisions in the British North America Act,
whereas these grants are for a specific purpose. The case would be somewhat different
if this Bill provided that the amounts should
be distributed to the provinces according to
population: there might then bc a colourable
argument against a federal audit, since these
moneys would be distributed on the sarne
basis as the annual subsidies.
It is said, against the suggestion of an audit,
that as the moneys appropriated by the respective provinces will come out of their consolidated funds, the Provincial Governments
will have to account for expenditures to their
respective Legislatures. I understand that this
is the view held by the Government. In this
connection there is one recommendation I
desire to offer, and I think it is a reasonable
one. Since the Provincial Governments will
account to their Legislatures for their direct
expenditures and will require an accounting
from the nunicipalities to whon they will
paty over some of the money, should not the
Provincial Governments be asked te make a
report of their activities to the Dominion

Government?
object in asking the Provincial Governments
to make such a report as they will make to
their Legislatures: the Federal Government
would thus obtain a detailed record of the
cxpenditures of the sums paid out of the
Dominion treasury; and some extremely
valuable information in connection with
the unemployment situation should be received. The unemployed all over the country
will have to register their names and
addresses when applying for relief. Of

and, together with statements showing the
number of men who have received relief employment, were nailed to the federal authorities. the information might be of great service
in another similar emergency. As all honourable members know, economic crises unfortunately ion in cycles. While we are granting
relief in the present instance it should be
possible to gather data which would help us
in the future. Should we not ascertain from
every applicant where he was born, whether
he is a newcomer to Canada or to the particular municipality or rural section where he
is applying, what has caused unemployment
in his particular case, and where he was last

employed? The country is making a serious
effort to cope with unemployment and to that
end is giving lavishly of its money. Therefore,
it seems to me, the Federal Government is
entitled to all the informatibn it is possible
to get in connection with the causes of unemployment. If a record were obtained from
every man at present out of work, we should
have an excellent basis for a study of
economic conditions and for intelligent contparisons in the future.
Honourable senators,
Hon. J. BUREAU:
lest it should be taken for granted that silence
indicates acquiescence, I desire to say that I
arn absolutely opposed to the present Bill,
because I think it creates a dangerous preThe honourable the Minister of
cedent.
Labour (Hou. Mr. Robertson) has referred to
the Roads Bill, but the situation was different
in that instance, for the Provincial Government had to make application to the Department of Railways, and before payment was
made that Department had the engineers' report certifying that the work had been properly donc. In this case the Parliament of
Canada is asked to vote $20,000,000 of the
money of the people, whom it represents, and
to hand that sum over to the Governor in
Council "for such purposes and under such
terms and conditions as may be approved by
the Governor in Council."
Everybody admits that there is some unemployment. A kind of census has been taken.
When I say "a kind of census" I do not mean
to reflect upon the way in which the honourable the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has carried on the inquiry. Information has been requested fronm municipalities
with a population of 10,000 and over as to the
extent of uînemployment within their bouindaries. It seems to me we ought to be inforned what works are to be undertaken by
the municipalities who reported the existence
of unemployment and who are to receive
grants under this Bill, so that we might have
some idea of how the money is going to be
expended. At this time I shall say nothing
further, except that I object strenuously to
the principle of a Bill which empowers the
Governor in Council to expend such a large
surm of money, when Parliament is given no
information as to how the money is to be
spent and is unable to exercise any control
over the expenditure.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SEPTEMBER 17, 1930
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, the
Sena-te went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 2-grant of $20,000,000:
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, is it undeostood that this money will
be expended on conditions simidar to those
that have contriled emergency expenditures
on other occasions? As has been pointed out,
and is well known to honourable members,
when an emergency exists it is not necessary
to cal! a session of Parliament to make a
grant of this kind, but the money may be
voted by Order :in Counoil on a Governor
CeneTral's warrant. However, in this instance
Pa:riament has been esked to make the grant.
As I understand the method that bas been
adopted heretofore when it bas been desired,
for purposes of relief, to undertake special
municipal works that were not reay nocessary for the time being, the municipalirty conoemned in each
case instigated and began the
work and kept t under municipal control.
Neither the province nor the Domiinion suggested the undertaking, but the municipal,
Provincial and Federal Governments con,tributed each one-third of the cost of the
work. Is that the method that will be adopted
in connection with relief works under this
BiHl? Let us say that the muncipality desires the removal of a level crossing. In such
a case the question would be referred to the
Board of Railway Commissioners.
If the
work is ordered, there are thre sources from
which ithe expenses are met: the company, the
municipality, and a Raillway Level Crossieg Fund. through which the Federal
Government contributes. The apportionient
of .the costs s determined by the Board of
Railway Commissioners, if I remember correctly. Now, it will be found that, generally
speaking, the municipalities all over Canada
have no over-supply of money, and the local
taxes are already high enough. I know that
in the Province of Ontario municipal taxation
is fairly high and the local treasurers are
anxious to keep the rate from coming up
further. For that reason I suggest-and I
make the suggestion with all due respect to
the federal and provincial authorities-that if
each municipality where work is to be done
under this Bill is to contribute its share of
the cost, there will be more economy than if
the entire expense is borne by the Dominion
and the province. Will any municipal work
that is undertaken be initiated by the municipality, and will the province and the

Dominion each contribute one-third? I think
it would be an error to have the Federal Government deal directly with the municipalities,
because that would open up an endless amount
of work and establish a bad precedent.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable friend the leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) will pardon me for not
remembering the order in which his questions
were askedHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can put then
separately.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable friend will permit me, I shall answer
first the question that has just been asked
by the right honourable gentleman from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). It is
my desire, and the desire of the Government,
to give to the House all the information requested. With respect to the right honourable gentleman's question as to works
initiated by a municipality for the purpose
of creating employment, I may say that the
view of the Government is that unemployment in municipalities is primarily a municipal responsibility. If a municipality does
not ask for faderal assistance from this fund,
none will be given, but if a municipality
represents to the Federal and the Provincial Governments that it is unable to bear
all the costs of relieving distress brought
about by unemployment within its boundaries,
the Federal Government pledges itself to
render aid in proper proportion to the need,
and will expect the province to co-operate
and participate by proyiding perhaps equal
relief.
With reference to the construction of subways, to which my right honourable friend
referred, I may say that the Government
looks with favour upon that sort of work, for
two reasons: first, because it is always a desirable work to carry on with a view to eliminating accidents and deaths that are occurring in increasing numbers on level crossings
all over the country; and, secondly, because
the building of subways and the elimination
of grade crossings would greatly aid society
generally. Furthermore, that kind of worlc
would result in more money from this fund
going to pay-rolls and the earnings of the
men employed than almost any other class
of undertaking that might be entered into.
For this reason. I think the Government is
quite willing to supplement very substantially
the fund already set aside for the purpose,
and in the hands and under the jurisdiction
of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The

13995-4
RVISED EDITON

SENATE

Federal Government at the present time,
where requested by the municipalities, participates in the cost of eliminating level crossings, to the extent of 40 per cent, up te a
maximum of, I think, $100,000. The Grade
Crossing Fund has been drawn upon quite
heavily during the past month, I understand,
by reason of the increased number of applications coming in from menicipalities who are
desirous of creating employment opportunities
for their citizens who are out of work.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The percentage to be paid out of the Railway Grade
Crossing Fund has been increased.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But the amount
of money available for that purpose, I understand, has become rapidly depleted, and it
is expected-the Prime Minister has indicated
his willingness- that the Fund will be supplemented from the grant in the Bill now before
us.
It is not the intention of the Government to
launch upon works in any raunicipality except
federal undertakings for the purpose of relieving unemployment. The initiative mu'st be
taken by the municipality itself, or, in such
work as road building in remote districts, in
order te open up new territory in a province,
the Federal Government may cooperate with
the province on a basis which will be fair te
both, without regard te the cost te the
municipality. But I think my honourable
friend's question was whether or net the
Federal Government will undertake work for
the relief of unemployment where the municipality has net initiated the work and is net
participating in it. It is the intention, I
believe, that the municipality shall in each
case indicate to the Federal and Provincial
Governiments what works it is ready te
proceed with, and te what extent it is willing
to bear the cost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If such an agreement is made, will the municipality account
for its expenditure te the province or te the
Federal Government direct?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assume that the
practice will be similar to the practice followed
in the past in like situations. I quite well
remember a rather serious unemployment
situation arising in 1920-21. It was net of as
long duration, however, as the present one,
and therefore the need of national intervention
was perhaps not as great as it is at present.
As I remember it, there were two methods
adopted at that time. One was to dispense
relief directly through the municipal authorities te the people in distress. In that case
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the municipalities accepted the responsibility
of determining first the existence of distress,
and then the extent to which it should be
relieved; and the Federal Government pledged
itself to bear one-third of the cost of the
relief. I think in almost every instance the
Provincial Government bore an equal share
of the cost.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: That did not refer se
much to work as to relief.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall come to
the other point my honourable friend has
raised. My recollection is that the municipality rendcred a report of its expenditure,
with vouchers, to the Provincial and Federal
Governments, who, in turn, each refunded
one-third of the total amount thus expended
on direct unemployment relief. There was
but little employment created in comparison
with what it is now proposed to do. It was
midwinter before the necessity became sufficiently acute to seem to justify federal intervention, and it was not until the 14th of
December, 1920, that any step was made in
the matter apart from the representations received from a few localities stating that
distress would be acute before spring. The
Federal Government at that time volunteered
to bear a part of the necessary cost of feeding people and keeping them warm.
This year the situation is different. Throughout the summer unemployment has existed to
a greater extent than ever before, and I think
that all honourable members, and most citizens
of Canada, realize that the need must necessarilv be greater during the coming winter
than it has ever been in the past. Therefore
the Government has attempted to anticipate
as far as possible the probable requirements,
and, by means which I have briefly outlined
and which we shall explore further, to assist
the provincial and municipal authorities in
providing employment opportunities, or, where
they cannot be provided, in contributing
towards financial relief. It is estimated that
the amount of money named in this Bill is
appropriate for the purpose. I have heard it
stated in several quarters that $20,000,000 is
a very substantial amount for such a purpose
as this, but Canada is a vast country and has
a very severe winter season. The grant of
$20,000,000 amounts to $2 per capita of our
population, a sum that does net go very far
in relieving distress.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We will not
draw on it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is sometimes
held that we are drawing on it. That is net
the case, for I do net anticipate that the cost

SEPTEMBER 17, 1930
of our sitting here will corne out of the fund.
I suggest, however, that in the aggregate the
amount I have mentioned is nlot excessive in
comparison with the need.
Hon. Mr. CA.LDER: With reference to
the question of accounting, will whatever
arrangements are -made for the expenditure of
this money be made with the provinces, or
The
parbially with the municipalities?
Dominion Government, I assume, will deal
only with the provinces, and they in turn
will deal with the municipalities. In sO far
as the accounting is concerned, the municipality wilI have to account to the province,
and the province in turn to the Federal Government. The question that I wish to ask is
whether there will be any direct dealings
between the Federal Government and the
municipality.
That was one
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of my questions.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My understanding is that there will not. The municipality
is the creature of the province. The Federal
Government will, of course, expect to ha
apprized and te have evidence of the expenditure of the municipality, and when the
province agrees that the expenditure is just
and fair, and assumes its proportion, there
will be littie necessity of detailed auditing of
the accounts by the federal authorities. 1
have no doubt that payments out of this
fund by the Federal Government will of
necessity depend upon the provinces certifying the correctness of the accounts rendered,
and the payment by the provinces of their
share will be an evidence of their belief in the
correctness of the accounts.
Our honourable friends opposite very p'.perly take considerable credit for the enactment of certain old age pension legisiation.
There is a method of accounting adopted
with regard te that legisIation which demonThe provincial

authority determines whether or not the
applicant is entitled to a pension. The
Federal Government has nothing whatever
to say about that. In the present case,
however, the Federal Government will
have something to say as to whether or
net it will approve of the. payment of its
agreed portion of the cost. Under the old
age pension regulations the Provincial Governanent renders its aceounts to the Fedieral
Govennt, which, -on receipt of thoSe accouants, pays them without &ny deïtailed. audit.
0f neceessi.ty the Federal Govern.ment cannot

1399&-4

to 40,000 odd pensioners each month, anid it
must accept the certificate of the Provincial
GovernmentL as te the amount payable under
the terms of the legisiation.
I submit that -the situation is very similar
when the province and the Federal Goverament approve of the undertaking of a m-unicipality which is willinig to bara its fair share
of the coet. The accoumts as rendered by the
muinicipality, and certified by the province,
should be reasonably satisfactory evidence
upon which the Federal Govcrnment can base
the payment of ifs share.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: On August 12, accordling to information plaoed before members
of the House, the honourable Minister of
Labour addresged the mayors of Canadian
cities of 10,000 population and over in connection with this unemployment question. The
preamble of the Bili 'before us says:
Whereas unemployment, which la primarily
a provincial and municipal responsibility-and I particularly noticed that xny honourable friend (Hon. MT. Robertsoin), in the
statement just madle te the House, twioe
affirmed that unempioyment la a subject of
municipal and provincial reosponsibility. What
I shoiild like to inquire la whether the Govemnennt reoeived from, the municipalities or
from the provinces, prier to Aiugust 12, 1930,
any requeslt that the Federal Government
shou!l d umdertake to co-operate with the municae.ities and the provinces to ssist in dealing with unemployment?
Hon. Mr. ROBERT'SON: I amn glad to give
xny honourable friend 'the information that
he seeks, because I do not think he was in
the House last week when I made some observations of a general character concerning
this subject. The present Government came
int o office on August 7, late in the day, and
on August 12 the Department of Labour
solFcited information from the mayors of cities
of IQOCO or over. In each of those cities
th,, Governmnent maintains, through the Department of Labour, an employment office.
Weekly reports corne in from those offices as
te the number of people out of work in each
community. The Department knew, and the
Government knew, that those records were not
accurate, because frem the experience of ten
or twelve years it bas been learned that when
one hundred or twe hundrcd men are regis.tered in an employment office as unemployed
perhaps hundreds of others are discouraged
from registering, even though out of employment. Therefore the Department of Labour
had knowledge-not accurate knowledge, it is

SE.NATE

true, but nevertheless knowledge-that unemployment existed in those communities. As
Parliament was being called to meet on September 8, it was not thought possible to conmunicate with ail the municipalities in the
countrv within the time available, and it was
decided to consult the Employment Service
Council of Canada. This Council is a statutory body, established in 1918, and is called
from year to year. The last conference of a
general nature on this subject of unemployment was held during 1924. It was desirable
that the Council should be convened and consulted, representing., as it does, more than half
a million people. The Department of Labour
therefore endeavoured to get aIl the information available in order to lay it before that
body when the conference was called. The
Government feels that everything that was
possible within the short time available was
done, and that the best picture obtainable
has been submitted to Parliament.
My honourable friend asks what information
the Department has with reference to requests
receivcd from municipalities and provinces in
tinmes gone by respecting this subject. I think
I gave information to the House on that
point last week. My honourable friend was
not here, and perhaps he has not read wvhat
I said at that time. The fact is that a very
substantial volume of correspondence is on
file in the Labour Department, including
scores of applications from municipalities and
several from provinces. In one communication, which I remember very well, the Prime
Ministcr of a province offered to have his
province do its share, but apparently that
communication was eot even acknowledged.
It is unpleasant and I do not think it is
desirable for me to enter into the details of
this matter, and I should not have mentioned
it if miy honourable friend had net sought
the information. If he wishes to pursue the
matter further I shall be glad to obtain the
evidence and submit it to him, but I do not
believe the House wants it, because I think
we discussed that affair enough the other
day.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Personally I should
like to have concrete information indicating
hat municipalities or provinces anywhere in
Canada had on August 7, or just prier therote. intimated to the Government that unemployment was so rife in their midst that they
desired the assistance of the Federal Government in dealing with it. Of course I accept
my honourable friend's statement, but I doubt
that there is any evidence or any concrete
information of that kind, and I should very
Hon.

Mr.

ROBEISON.

ruch appreciate the laying of it on the Table
of the House in order that we might see it
and my doubt might be dispelled.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
May I suggest
to my honourable friend that the information
is already on record?
Last week in this
House I named the municipalities or other
places from which requests had come to the
Governnent between December, 1929, and
April, 1930. These are ail on record. I aise
mentioned the dates of the communications.
My honourable friend can find those references in Ilansard. If he wants the original
documents, I shall be glad to produce them,
but surely he will net hold up the House for
the purpose of asking us to copy documents
at this late date, and thus delay the provision
of the relief that is so important.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have undertaken
to read rather carefully what my honourable
friend refers te, but that does net give me the
informiation that I amn asking for. If we in
this House are entitled to that information, I
still insist that I should like to sec the coucrete evidence that municipalities or provinces did ask for financial assistance to deal
with the unemploynent problen. Personally
I doubt it, with all due respect to what I have
read.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
May I muake
one further observation?
My honourable
friend seeis to repeat that he doubts the
statenient that is on record. I think I can
assure my honourable friend that it is not
the custoi of this Government to make any
statemients that it is not prepared to support.
J would also point out to mv honourable
friend that when this matter was under discussion last week I offered to the leader of
the Opposition to bring down aIl the documents received during the past year if they
were desired, and to lay on the Table aise
the replies, but no request was made for them.
I would therefore suggest to honourable mnembers that it is net exactly customary, when
available information is offered, for an honourable member to let a week go by and then
to say that he does not believe that the
Minister's statement is true. I do not think
that is the courtesy due te members of this
House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
My honourable
friend knows that this Bill is before the
Committee of the Whole in order that it may
be intelligently discussed, and, I presume, that
proper information may be procured. This
is one of the most important steps ever taken
by Parlianent, the voting of $20,000,000 for

SEPTEMBER 17, 1930
the relief of unemployment. As a representative of labour for many years, I am glad
indeed that the members of this House and
those in another place are giving to the allimportant question of unemployment the
consideration that it deserves, although I
think a great mistake is being made in the
way the problem is being dealt with at this
time. In my judgment the proposal before
us will stultify ambition.
An honourable SENATOR: Oh!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: An honourable
gentleman says "Oh," but he shouid not
forget that I have rambled through the highways and byways and know something about
labour, organized and unorganized. I say it
will stultify ambition and prostitute resourcefulness on the part of many workers.
I realize that there is much unemployment
in Canada, but it is nothing in comparison
with what exists on the other side of the line.
Some honourable members may ask how I
know that. Well, I happen to be working for
an organization with 187,000 members, 23,000
of whom, in the United States, are to-day
not able to hold a position even on the
"extra" board. So it is with my honourable
friend's organization and with others. Therefore
I think that very much more has been made
of this question of unemployment than was
really necessary. I realize that it is necessary
to deal with this measure, as we are doing,
but I think it was a great mistake to spread
throughout Canada such statements as were
made some weeks ago.
My honourable friend will not give me
credit for reading what he said, but I have
done so. I have been associated with him for
many years in different interests and have
considerable respect for what he says, but I
should like to ask him this question.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Read what he says on
page 23 of Hansard.
Hon Mr. MURDOCK: On September 10
my honourable friend, taking great and proper
pride in Sir Robert Borden's part in helping
to formulate the Treaty of Versailles, placed
on Hansard, for the benefit of us al-and he
has my thanks for so doing-a etatement of
certain principles adiopted under that treaty.
I want to -readtwo paragraphs quoted by my
honourable friend, which appeared on page 25
of Hasard:
Third.-The payment to the employed of a
wage adequate to maintain a reasonable
standard of life as this is understood in their
time and country.
Fourth.-The adoption of an eight-hours day
or a forty-eight hours week as the standard to
be aimed at where it has not already been attained.

The question I should like to ask my honourable friend I have ahready put to him personally, but I have not been at ail satisfied
with his enswer. The question is, whether it
as the intention, in the expenditure of this
$20,000,000 of federal funds, to recognize the
fair wages policy of the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I thank my
honourable friend for having brought forward
this inquiry, because it enables one to deal
with what has been a doubt in the minds of
some, to judge by the amendment to this
Bill that was moved in another place. I
listcned with some interest to honourable
niembers who brought forward that amendment in another place, and I believe that in
doing so they were absolutely sincere in the
desire to serve the working people of Canada, but -they ovelooked the fact that there
is already on the Statute Book of Canada, in
chapter 20 of the Statutes of 1930, a law which
deals wi'th this question; also that P.C. 670,
of March last, deaft with the question of the
eight hour day.
The Prime Minister of Canada in 1919
attached his signature to the document to
which I referred a week ago, and that pledge
has been carried out as far as it was possible
under our constitution for the fe'deral authorities to carry it out. My honourable friend
and other gentlemen know that it is not
within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government to say that the eight hour day shall
prevail in aH industries, or that fair wage
clauses shall be inserted in every contract
where municipalities or provinces are concerned. The Federal Parliament can only deal
with such matters as are within its powers.
It was therefore made clear in another place
when the amendment was under consideration
that the Government would not accept it.
I may say to honourable members that it is
the intention, so far as the Federal Government is concerned, to respect those obligations
that are already law. When the Federal
Government comes to discuss an agreement
to carry on certain work, and its cost, it is
intended to have the province and the municipa.lity agree that in consideration of receiving
assistance from the federal treasury they
shall observe the fair wages resolution and the
eight hour day. The agreement thus made
will have some effect so far as the provinces
and municipalities are concerned, whereas the
amendment suggested in another place could
not possibly have that effect.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is that a promise?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assure my honourable friend that that is the intention of
the Minister of Labour, under whose jurisdic-

SENATE

tien the administration of this Act falls. I
may add that the premier of one province has
already agreed that that shall be donc so
far as his province is concerned, and I am
not telling any secret when I declare to the
House that it is the policy it is proposed to
follow.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable members, it has been stated in another place, and
also in this Chamber, that this is a matter for
arrangement by the Federal Government with
municipalities and provinces. It has also been
stated that this legislation is analogous to the
Canada Highway Act of 1919. The provisions
of the Canada Highway Act, 1919, called for
sixty per cent to be paid by the Provincial
Government and forty per cent by the Federal
-a clear-cut, specific allotment. Municipalitics were not considered, and great care was
taken to sec that all works and payments
were properly handled. The terms in this
Bill are altogether different, and, excepting
the fact that both are grants, I cannot sec
how the legislation proposed can be called
analogous.
I should like to ask the honourable the
Minister of Labour for some information in
order to clear up a question in my own mind
and perhaps in the minds of some other
If an arrangement were made
members.
among the Federal and Provincial Governments and a municipality, and a situation
arose in which a municipality was unable
to carry on its share of the work, would
it be relieved of responsibility in regard
to payment? In such a case, if the obligation
of the municipality is passed on, so that the
Provincial Government bas te assume more
than its share, it seems to me there would be
some criticism. We know that some municipalities are well governed, with a good mayor
and council, taxation is well looked after, and
fair taxes are collected, while in other municipalities the contrary condition obtains. I
think that if a badly managed municipality
could escape its financial obligations the
system would be wholly inequitable. L should
like te ask whether there is any method of
ascertaining whether municipalities or Provincial Governments are in a position te pay
their proportion of the cost of such work, or
whether the fund is going te be administered
in such a free and easy manner that the
Federal Government will hand over anything
that a local Government asks.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend will realize that it is quite impossible
for a member of the Federal Government
to answer a question that must necessarily
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

be answered by the municipalities, as to their
responsibility and their ability to pay. I
would add that my honourable friend has
very well demonstrated the reason why it
is impossible to lay down any hard and fast
rules to govern every condition existing anywhere in Canada. The law must necessarily
be flexible because of the very nature of
things. I think that is about as far as I
can answer my honourable friend's question
intelligently.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The honourable
gentleman will go so far as to admit that
some municipalities would be in a manner
penalized?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Quite se. That
might occur after the municipality represented the facts as to its condition.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable members, professedly this Bill is designed to relieve unemployment. It is called, "An Act
for the granting of aid for the Relief of
Unemployment." The actual provisions are,
to my mind, very definite:
2. For the relief of unemployment, a sum not
exceeding twenty million dollars is hereby
appropriated and ma be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada for such
purposes and under such terms and conditions
as may be approved by the Governor in Council.

Clause 3 is especially clear:
3. Withont restricting the generality of the
terms of the next preceding section hereof, and
notwithstanding the provisions of any statuite,
the said sum of twenty million dollars may be
expended in constructing. extending or improving public works and undertakings. railways,
highways, bridges and canals, harbours and
wharves; assisting in defraying the cost of distribution of products of the field, farm, forest,
sea, lake, river and mine; granting aid to provinces and niunicipalities in any public work
they may undertake for relieving unemployment and reimbursing expenditures made by
provinces and nunlicipalities in connection with
unemployment, and generally in any way that
will assist in, providing useful and suitable
work for the unemployed.
Until my honourable friend rose to-day to
explain more fully the purposes of this Bill, I
was under the impression that the money in
question would be used solely for the purpose
of providing employment. My honourable
friend rather disturbed me when he said-and
I think I understood him; if not, I am willing to be corrected-that the money would
be employed not only for the purpose of
giving work to relieve unemployment, but
also for the purpose of providing other relief. Though he was net very clear, I under-

SEPTEMBER 17, 1930
stood him to say that it was relief in thie
way of provisions, supplies, clothing, and
things of that sort.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And maney.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And money. Now,
this at once causes me to fear a curse which
has found its way into some parts of the
world, and which is, I think, the last thing
I want to see in Canada. When my honourable friend spoke in that way, I could flot
help thinking of the dole. I do hope there
is no intention of introducing that into this
,country. If the purpose of this Bill is to
give work, I have no abjection; but if it is
intended that some of these funds shaîl be
handed over for charity, or somethîng in the
nature of the dole, then I have a very strong
objection to it. I do hope that my honourable friend, and the Government af which he
is a member, will seriously consider that particular question. Surely we are flot going to
have the dole in Canada! If unemployment
exists anywhere in our country it can be cured
by our providing work on useful undertakings,
some of which may be of a temparary nature,
although. I hope that mast of those carried on
with the aid of money granted by this Bill will
be of a permanent nature. But I arn aibsolutely opposed ta the relief af want by the
granting by the Federal Government af money
or goods to municipalities. 1 had no idea that
the Government intended to do anythixg like
that ýuntil my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) spoke to us this evening. If that
sort of thing is practised, I arn afraid it will
be -followed by serious consequences. Will my
honouraJble friend kindly make clear what the
Government intends to do in this connectian? Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shahl be delighted ta try ta remnove the ghost fram before
my honouraible friend's eyes. I understand
his feeling, and the Govern.ment appreciates
the importance of doing everything possible to
avoid the semiblance of a dole systein. Surely
that was made clear in the announcements
concerning the Bill in another place. I shouhd
like ta point out ta my honourable friend that
there may be, and doubtless wi1l be, places
where it will be impossible ta provide employment for ah] who are able and wjlling ta work
this winter; and I think that the ghosts hovering over people who are hungry and unable
ta find work will be more real than any that
seems ta resemble the dole and distu*b the
minds of honouridble gentlemen. It is not
intended or desired that a single dollar shahl
be paid out except for work, if wark can be
provided, but in any municipality in Canada
where work is nat dibtainable and the people

are hungry, the Federal Government intends
to tend a helping hand.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps I might
indicate more .clearly what I had in mind. I
think that the handing out of provisions, or
clothing, or money, or anything of that ldnd,
for the relief of distress, ought to be left
entirely to the municipalities concerned, and
that the Federal and Provincial Governments
should have no part in such measures ai. ail.
Surely the distress will flot be sQ great anywhere that, after ail available employment has
been provided, a municipality will be unable
to look after local indigents. 1 think the Governments of Canada and of the provinces
should have absolutely nothing to do with
any measure that can be looked upon as in
the nature of a dole. The purpose of the Bill
is to provide for the relief of unemployment.
Doubtless a oertain amount of distress from
unemployment exists in every city-Ottawa,
perhaps, is one that suifera Iess than modt
others in this respect-but surely there are
charitable organivations all over the country
which look after urgent cases of want. The
St. Vincent de Paul Society, in connection
with my church, does work of this kind, and I
suppose my honourable friend's church has
some organization which carnies on similar
actîvities. Nohody need be without food or
clothing in any part of Canada to-day; but
the relief of want in urgent cases is a work
that belongs to the municipalities and to individuals; and if the Government undertakes to
substitute for the municipalities in providing
relief, then the Bill will be a curse.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If I did not
make clear the Government's intention when
I spoke before, I apologize to my honourable
friend. The Federal Government does not
intend to spend a single dollar in any case
unless the~ need exists, and the municipality
coneerned must make it clear that, there is
that need. The municipality will then be
authorized ta make certain expenditures to
relieve distress, and the Fe-deral Government
will help to pay the bill; but the Federal Government will neyer know, neither will it care,
whether the relief was given in the form of
provisions or cash. That is not the responsibility of the Federal Government. A national
emergency exists in Canada, surely.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Surely that is
generally recognized. Ail that the Federal
Goverument can do is to offer aid through
the municipalities, which are in the best position ta know of the exigencies.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I say that if any
municipality represents to the Dominion or
any Provincial Government that there is distress, and requests aid, the Government
should ignore it, or inform the municipality
that it should look after the matter.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: It may be
found that there are needy persons in a
number of municipalities which have not the
necessary finances to give relief. I know that
last year the Government of Saskatchewan
obligated itself ta make advances to enable
many municipalities ta supply necessary relief.
The local authorities were authorized to furnish a certain quantity of flour for every
needy person; and, where the circumstances
justified it, coal was ta be supplied, and fodder
for animals.
Many of the municipalities,
owing to strained finances, would have been
unable on their own credit to get funds for
the supplying of those wants. I think that
not only all honourable members but all the
people of Canada would object to the introduction of the dole system in this country.
Unfortunately, in many parts of Canada where
there have been crop failures condiions will
be worse in the coming winter than they were
last year. I know that in a large part of
Saskatchewan that had a severe crop failure
last year the current crop has been no more
successful, and the people there are in a far
worse plight than they were twelve months
ago. Winter employment does net exist on
the prairies ta the same extent as in other
parts of Canada. The farmer, who is required at home te attend te the live stock
and look after his family, is not near ta any
centre where employrment is available.
I
can readily conceive of cases of need where
the circumstances are such that the Federal
Government should net insist too strongly
on the observance of technicalities.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not think
that the extending of relief in cases of the
kind ta which I am referring could be regarded as a dole. A large section of the
country suffered from aridity this year. The
farmers are doing their best to carry on their
work successfully, but they cannot prevail
against the elements. I think we should look
on the distribution of this fund a little more
generously than my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) appears to be willing ta do.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I can hardly conceive that there will exist anywhere in Canada
such distress that it could net be relieved by
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

joint action of the municipality concerned and
the local citizens. If the municipal officers
would help as much as possible, and if every
citizen in the respective communities would
give that measure of charity which it is incumbent upon him to give, I feel sure that
cases of distress would be relieved locally
without any help from the Government with
funds granted under this Bill.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I am afraid that the honourable gentleman
does not understand the kind of situation that
sometimes arises. I shall try ta picture just
how the city of Winnipeg, for example. is
affected by the general unemployment. The
nearest large city to it on the west is 178
miles away, and Fort William is the nearest
on the east. Winnipeg is practically in the
centre of a huge territory, and the unemployed from all over the territory flock te
that city. During the last twenty years the
city of Winnipeg, largely on accont of its
location, bas had a stupendous problem on its
hands.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

It has now.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: To ask the citizens
and the municipality of Winnipeg to take
care of the unemployment situationHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
what I suggest.

That is exactlv

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
That is absolutely

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
ourable gentleman's pardon.
as that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

I beg the honIt is net so silly

They might do it-

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

And they should.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They might do it,
but they should not be called upon ta do it
at all, because many of the unemployed are
net ordinarily residents of Winnipeg. Then
t here are the cities of Regina, Saskatoon,
Prince Albert, Calgary, Vancouver, Toronto,
and other cities in CanadaHon.

Mr. BELCOURT:

Montreal and

Quebec, and so on.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Does the honourable
gentleman suggest that the citizens and the
municipal authorities of those places should
take care of all their unemployment?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What I mean is
that the municipalities and their citizens

Furthermore, within the next three or four

Hon. Mr: COPP: Fine !
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Undoubtedly there
is unemploynent in every country of the

But we are concernied chiefly with the situation in our own country, and when my honourable friend takes the stand that this situation can be handled by the municipalities or
the provinces, and tells me, in effect, that the
Federal Government should not give any relief
at allHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Until it is asked

Hon. Mr. FORKE: May I make a remark?
My honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) has referred to the drifting of
large numbers of unemployed persons from the
rura.1 districts to the cities. From what I have
obsevced, fewer rural people have drifted
nto the cities this year than in former vears.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I spoke, not of farmers, but of men who had been working in the
mines and forests, principally.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do net mean farmers.
I mean classes other than farmers. I do not
think there will be as large a drift :nto Winnipeg and ReginaHon. Mr. CALDER: Why not?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Bocause there was no
unemployment in the rural districts lasi
summer.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What about November?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: It was among the industrial classes. I am not arguing that Winnipeg is able to cope with its problem; but the
difficulty does net arise from the rural people
floating into these cities.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman speaks of "rural people." What does he
mean? Are they farmers? Farmers' daughters?
Farmers' wives? Farmers' children?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: They are labourers.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is the farm
labourer going to do from November till
March?
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: If lie has worked all
summer he does not need any assistance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Where is he going?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: He can live in the city
if he wishes. But there is no big flow of
rural people. I do not mean farmers. I have
a great deal of sympathy with what the
honourable leader of the Government has said
in regard to the farmers of the districts that
have had crop failures. ,I do not think the
honourable member frorn Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) really understands the situation
those people are in, because he suggests that
they can be assisted by their neighbours. The
position of their neighbours is similar to their
own. Whole districts are affected, and I think
they can legitimately receive assistance, even
from the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We have had a very
interesting discussion, but after all it boils
down to this main question: is the situation
in Canada such that the Federal Government
I thoroughly
should come in and assist?
agree with the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), as I am sure every
member of the House will, that not only
primarily, but ordinarily and usually, and
nine-tenths of the time, the Federal Government should not intervene; that the question of unemployment is local and provincial.
But, as I say, the main question is whether
there as been developed within the past year,
or a lesser period, a situation that necessitates
In my judgment the
federal assistance.
answer is yes. I have tried to give reasons.
I cannot say any more on that point. It is
one that every member must decide for himself.
The second point is this. The Government,
in its wisdom-rightly or wrongly-is providing a fund of $20,000,000Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is Parliament,
net the Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. Parliament is
providing an unemployment fund of $20,000,000-something absolutely unprecedented in
Canada. In the expenditure of that money
there lies, in my judgment, the very gravest
danger, and whoever is responsible for the
expenditure-I do not know who it will beshould at all times take the greatest possible
precaution to see that it is a proper expenditurc and that the money is accounted for.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. 'CALDER: I do not know what

document approving the expenditure of a

Hon. Mr. MURIYOCK: WiIl ny lionaurp:ble friend go a littie furth-er and say what

we any idea of the normal state of unemployment during ordinary, fair years, eo
,that by camparison we may know what is an

Probably my honourable friend will answer
that the Provincial Governments wihl judge
whether or flot an exoeptional. condition
exists in any of those centres. I agree with
him when lie says that $20,000,000 would not
go very far. My fear is that municipality
nfter municipality and town after town will
try ta load on this Governmcnt a share of
charges that do not belong ta it. Towns
can take care of the ordinary number of
unemployed during the year. It is seldom
that a province is called upon ta help a
municipality. Public-spirited citizens, charitable institutions, and organizatians of al
kinds nre asked ta contribute even before
the municipahity is called upan. I fear that
if there is no means of comparisan as ta,
what is an exceptional condition, municipalities froin the Atlantic ta, the Pacific wil

be forwarding requests for relief from a
condition which atherwise they would take
care of themselves. The kernel of the
difflculty is, what is an exceptional condition?
1 have asked my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) if lie lias anything-I am nat s0
mucli interested in seeing it, but if lie has it
lie can give it ta us--tlat will indicate the
normal, natural state of unemployment during
the variaus seasons of the last five years.
When demands are made, the duty of scrutinizing conditions may devolve upon him.
My impression is that the demands will came
through the provinces. 1 cannat conceive that
appeals stating the requirements will lie made
ta, the Department of Labour thraugh the
municipalities. 1 should imagine that they
would le centralized in the liands of the
various executives of the country. If this is
so, will the Federal Government accept the
statements from the variaus provinces without
sifting the merits of the dlaims made by the
variaus inunicipalities? With tliousands of
municipalities throughout the country al
anxiaus ta draw on this fund, we must realize
what it will mean ta hand out money right
and left. I believe we are ail at one in
thinking that the Federal Government should
lielp, througli this fund, wherever there is an
exceptional condition of unemployment. We

order ta lielp salve the unemployment problein
when it is beyond the capacity of the muicipality or of the province.
I have not repeated ahl the questions that I
put ta my honourable friend. He will find
theni in Hansard to-morrow morning. Praliably there are some that lie could answer now.
But again I put the mast important one:
who will have the last word ini deciding what
is an exceptional condition?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Winnipeg lias been
mentioned frequently in the discussion. As I
have not the exact figures, 1 liesitate ta say
anything on this subi ect. I will try to have
the figures to-morraw. 1 may say now, hawever, that the situation in Winnipeg is very
acute. I doubt whetlier any honourable gentleman realizes fully tlie seriousness of tho
situation prevailing in that city last year, or
can have any idea of wliat it wiil be during
the coming winter. 'The city lias exhausted
practically all its resources in an endeavour
ta cape with tlie problein. Meetings of the
unemployed have been lield time and again
in front of the City Hall, violence lias been
threatened, and the police have been called
out. This condition, in my opinion, lias led
many people ta join the Oommunists. In

SENATE

the last election in the Province of Manitoba
a very large number of votes were cast for
the Communist candidate; and the city of
Winnipeg has probably the only Communist
alderman in America.
The unemployment problem in Winnipeg is
serious. In no other city in the Dominion of
Canada has as much been donc, by the city
or by the citizens, in an endcavour to meet
the situation. If the honourable gentleman
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) had read
the Winnipeg newspapers last December he
would have seen copy after copy of telegrams
sent to the Dominion Government by the
mayor, the city council, the Vetcrans' Association and other publie bodies, denanding
that the Prime Minister do something to relieve the situation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does the honourable gentleman think that that was the proper
channel of communication?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: When peopie are
starving any channel is a proper one through
which to bring the situation to the attention
of the Dominion Govcrnment. For some
time, those telegrams were not even answered,
and when at last a reply was re.ceived, it was
that this was a matter for the province alone
to deal with. Unless this situation is met
there will be violence. The. money that is to
be spent will bc well spent if it staves off a
movement that will go to increase the Coinmunist vote in the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As the Minister vil1
be apeaking to-morrow, I wish to say just a
word more. I quite agree with the honourable the leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that there is the gravest possibility of danger in the administration of these
funds. There will be thousands of applications from ail ovesr Canada; everybody wirll
be wanting to dig into the fund. Now I am
going to ask the Minister of Labour a question. He wilil be able to reply to-morow. I
thoroughly agree with what ihas been said by
the honourable member from Winnipeg (Hon.
M.r. McMeans). I have been -in the neighbourhood for forty years and know conditions
as they exist in Winni;peg. The same conditions exist in cities like Torontor, Hamilton,
St. John and Halifax. But applications xvill
come in ren every hamlet and village in
Canada, and I should 'like to ask the Minister
what precautions are going to be taken to
prevent abuse in the expendi-ture of these
funds.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Lest the question
just asked by the honourable member should
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

be forgotten, I should like to give a brief
answer now, and, if lie desires it, a further one
to-morrow. The greatest safeguard in the
expenditure of this fund is the fact that for
every dollar spent by the Federal Government
the municipality and the province must also
spend their money. If my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), for example. were
representing the Federal Government, and my
right honourable friend (jRiglit Hon.. Mr.
Graham) a province, and I a municipality,
and I confessed my inability to menet the
obligations pressing upon me, and applied to
my right honourable friend for assistance, and
if my honourable friend who leads the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) were to Say,
as the representative of the Federal Goverinment, "We will help you because of the
situation you are in," I would render to them
a detailed account of all the expenditures,
together with the vouchers and the cost, for
their inspection, and, I submit, there would
be no great danger of anybody being cheated.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Who gets the voucher
first? The province or the Federal Government?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My recollection is
that in 1922, for the city of WinnipegHon. Mr. BUREAU:
I ask an answer to
my question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -vouchers
were
submitted indicating that money Lad been
expended for bread, coal, tea and other
necessities to the amount of $18.000.
That
is my recollection as to that kind of relief,
outside of the excess cost of employment.
Then the Provincial Government O.K.'d the
account and paid it, and the Federal Government paid its third. If that is the case. we
need not fool ourselves by talking about
knowing when a couple of loaves of bread
or a pound of tea are going to be handed
ont. My honourable friend the Minister of
Labour will get only the total bill for these
expenditures, with the indication that the
municipality in the first place has paid the
noney, the province has recognized its share,
and the Federal Government's share is so
much. In my judgment that is the oniy wait can be donc.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is wrong with
it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The question in my
mind relates to the public works that will be
undertaken. I think there is a great deal to
be said about that, because I am afraid that
there will be something done with the Government money that will not be just what it
should be.

as led by the late Prime Minister, and the
Liberal party-led by that same Ministerin the Chamber to which we are attached?
If we wish to have an expression of the
opinion of the Liberal' party as a whole,
and the Government's view is expressed by a
representative of the Government in this
House, how are we to avoid the technical
difficulty that one opinion is opposed to the
other? When we wish to address the Liberal
party as organized in the federal scheme, to
whom shall we appeal? Will it be to my
honourable friend from the West, or my Imourable friend from the small island in the
East, or any other particular member? Or if
a Liberal Government, constituted as a whole,
wishes to give expression to its policies in this
louse, how can it do so otherwise than
through the gentleman who is selected in its
caucus, as I understand, to represent that Government?
I think my honourable friend shauld have
no special objection ta heing designated as
the leader of the Opposition. The Opposition in this country is now led by the late
Premier and his Liberal confreres. The
Opposition must be represented here in a
similar manner. It does not follow from
that, however, that my honourable friend
shahl be guided by the old apothegm that
the purpoe of an Opposition is ta oppose
and not to give sympathetie co-operation.
Much will depend upon the attitude of mind
of my honourable friend himself. He will
oppose when he believes opposition is
necessary or reasonable, and at other times
will sympathize and co-operate. When we
appeal to him what shall we say? Shall we
say, "my honourable friend the leader of
the Liberal party"? Perliaps there will be
no very great practical difficulty, but it
seems to me that there is some technical
confusion in the matter.
UNEMPLOYMENT

RELIEF BILL

FURTIIER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 2, an Act for the granting of aid for the
Relief of Unemployment.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 2-grant of $20,000,000:
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Mr. Chairman, in
making a statement to the House yesterday
I said that I would endeavour to secure
figures in regard to the unemployment situation in Winnipeg.
I have been fortunate
enough to meet the Mayor of Winnipeg in
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

the city of Ottawa, and he has informed me
that Winnipeg has expended in the way of
unemployment relief since October last, in
round figures, the sum of $1,000,000.
Hon.
Mr, »DANDURAND:
Will
the
honourable the Minister of Labour give the
answers to the questions that I put yesterd'ay?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend the member for De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) suggeste that answers might
be given to the queries which he placed on
Hansard yesterday. We shall gladly respond
as best we can. He asked seven distinct
questions, four of which are so nearly related
that I think one answer will suffice for theme.
His first question was:
I notice that the inquiry sent out by the
honourable Minister for the purpose of ascertaining the number of men ont of work was
sent only to towns having a population of
10.000 or more. Is it the intention to extend
the scope of that inquiry in order that the
needs may ibe met wherever they exist?

Miy I say, in answer to that question, that
everv municipality in Canada. no matter what
its population, has equal right and opportunity to place its needs and proposals before
the proper authorities, and that equal consideration will be given to all communications
regarding needs and proposals, wherever or
whomsoever they come from.
The next four questions asked by the honourable gentleman were:
Is it the intention of the Government to
limait the aid to men completely out of work,
or is it to be extended to those who are only

partially emmployed?
Is

it

the

intention

of the

Government

to

lielp manual labour exclusively?
Will such men as are engaged in what we
call seasonal occupations and are thrown out
oi work by the cessation of activities-for
instance. by the closing of ports for the winter
-be able. under this legislation, to qualify
for relief?
Will those mon, otherwise regularly emnployed,
who ara temnporarily suspended, as happens
when large corporations close down for a few
w-eeks or a month or two, be entitled to ask

for relief?
These questions all seem to be closely related,
and my observations will be by way of answering them jointly.
The determination of the question whether
any person who has been out of work for a
short or a long period shall receive relief rests
with the municipal authorities. If they deem
it necessary to give assistance to any citizen,
they will assist him. and the Government purposes ta contribute a certain proportion of the
amount they expend in so doing.

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930

My honourable friend's next question was:
Has the Labour Department or the Bureau
of Statistics any data covering unemployment,
seasonal or other, as it bas e.iste d in past yearà
in various localities?
So far as 1 know, no definite record covering unemployment has ever been kept. My
hanourable friend, who was a member of the
late Government for nearly nine years, cau
probably answer that question as well as I.
The only information on file in the Department of Labour extends back over a period
of almost twelve months. It is voluminous,
but does flot indicate the number of unemployed in various localities. The only information in that cannectian that rnay be regarded as reasonably authentic is that which
bas been received froni the regular weekly
reports sent in by the Employment Service
offices. Lsually those reports refer to the condition of unemployment, the demand for
labour, the number of unemployed who have
registered, and the number that have been
placed in positions, but there is no accurate
record of the number actually unemployed.
The Empînyment Service Cauncil of Canada,
which met in Ottawa an August 21, passed a
resolution urging that a oensus of the unemplayed be taken, and the Prime Minister bas
announced in another place that the recammendations of the Council have been accepted
and adopted by the Gavernment. Resolution
No. 12 as submitted by the Council reads:
That this Council urge upon the federal
authorities that provision be made for an
adequate census of the uneniployed in Canada
in conmection with the 1931 decennial census.

192W-21 and 1921-22, the total of the Federal
Government's contribution was 81,845,000.
Each of the provinces and each municipality
that petitioned for relief bore one-third of
the cost; so, a sum between $5,000,000 and
86,000,000 was expended an unemployment relief at that time. But there is no record of
the number of persona who were assisted.
May I ask my
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
honourable friend. whether there is any record
of the places where these moneys were expended?

I can give the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
figures for the various provinces. Alberta got
M4),000,
British Columbia gat
$117,000,
Manitoba $249,000, New Brunswick $4,800,
Nova Scotia $10,600, Ontario 8900,000, Quebec 876,000 and Saskatchewan 883,000-a
total of approximately $1,845,000. The amount
for each province is stated in round figures.
Perhaps I can give a little information
which will answer the question asked by my
honourable friend from Parkdale MHon. Mr
Murdock) yesterday. He said:
1 have undertaken to read rather carefully
what may honourable friend refers to, but that
does flot give me the information that 1 arn
asking for. If we in this House are eutitled
to that information, I still insist that 1 should
like to see the concrete evidence that municipalities or provinces did ask for financial
assistance to deal with the unemployment

unemployment is essentially a national problem,
and one which should receive the assistance,
close co-operation and financial aid of the Government of the Dominion of Canada; and
Whereas at a conference between the representatives of provincial governments and the
Government of the Dominion of Canada, held
at Ottawa on September 5, 6 and 7, 1922, and
at a similar conference held at Ottawa on
September 3 and 4, 1924, resolutions to the
foregoing effect were also passed; and
Whereas, for the following reasons the assistance, co-operation and financial aid of the Goverment of the Dominion of Canada is necessary in working out the solution of the problem
of seasonal and general unemployment:
(1) No province or eity can individually
indertake to provide work for the unemployed
duîring periods of depression without making
that province or city the "Mecca" for the
iiinemnployed located beyond its boundaries, and
tluis taking upon its shoulders the problem of
others.
(2) That investigations reveal the fact that
mnenplomvnent is greatly aggravated by the flow
of new immigrants into Western Canada, many
of wvhon have been admitted as agricultural
labourers, and who bave undertaken farm work
for a short time only or not at all, and who
are now located in our urban centres, either
unemployed or holding jobs that might otherwise have gone to some of those that are unemployed. Since immigration into Canada is in
the sole control of the federal authorities. and
is a problem which to a great extent is caused
by immigration, it is, therefore, one which
deimiands federal attention.
(3) The placement services maintained by

tra nsportation companies have directed many
of the new immigrants into other than agri:ultural work, and have been very active
endeavouring to find jobs of any nature for
meîcn brought out. This has had the effect of
1epriving men already here from obtaining
work available, and men are now stranded and
on the liands of local authorities. This condition tas been allowed to develop by the
Dominion Governient, which is a good reason
wly it should share in dealing with the
problens thus created.
(4) Many of the men who are unable to
find work are in such situation because of war
exNperiences and war disabilities, even though
not in receipt of pensions, and constitute an
after-war problem and are a federal responsibility.
And whereas, the Hon. W. L. Mackenzie
King. Premier of the Dominion of Canada, wrote
the Hon. John Bracken, Premier of the Provinee of Manitoba. a letter dated at Ottawa on
January 8, 1930, which read in part as follows:
"Shîould it appear that the provinces of the

Dominion and their respective municipalities
are not in a position to cope with unemployment within their respective jurisdictions, and
we are so advised by the several provinces, we
shall be prepared to consider what course it
may be nost advisable to take, in order to
cope with a national problem of the kind."
Be it therefore resolved:(1) That this House is of the opinion that
Ieiployment is essentially a national problem,

irge the Government of Canada to grant assistHon.

ance, co-operation and financial aid to the
provincial and municipal governments in dealing with unemployment on an equitable basis.
(2) That this House is of the further opinion
that unemployment of ex-service men is a
national problem, and we respectfully urge the
Government of Canada to care for and assume
responsibility as a national undertaking for the
care of such persons.
And the Question being pu-t, it was agreed to
unanimously.
That is the record of the Manitoba Legislature. Now, following that session of the
LegislatureHon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask a question before the honourable gentleman gets
away from that? The passing of that resolution and the action that my honourable friend
has just quoted indicate on the part of the
Manitoba Legislature a marked departure
from the principle enunciated by the previous Government and also laid down by this
Government in the first words of Bill 2:
Whereas unemployment, which is primarily
a provincial and municipal responsibilityIs not that action of the Manitoba Legislature only one exception taken to the principle declared by the previous Government
and by this Government, that the municipal
and provincial governments had primary responsibility in the matter?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I thought my
honourable friend intervened to ask a question, but I do not yet perceive what his
question is. May I proceed with the inquiry he made yesterday?
Then I shall
answer his present question if he so desires.
The resolution I have read was adoptad
by the Manitoba Legislature on February 3,
at the urgent request of municipal authositics who had attended the conference, in
whieh representatives of Manitoba and the
other Prairie Provinces participated.
The
next thing that occurred was a request on
the part of provincial and municipal governments for the opportunity and courtesy of
a conference with the Government at Ottawa.
That conference was accordingly arranged for,
and was held on February 26. I have in my
hand the minutes of that meeting, dated
March 1, 1930, which were obviously compiled from shorthand notes taken during the
proceedings. There were present at that iterview with the Cabinet on February 26 the
representatives of municipalities in Ontario,
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British
Columbia, and of the provincial governments
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Columbia. It would be perhaps uninteresting and would take up entirely too
much time to read the 27 pages of the record

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930

of what occurred, but the resuit of that conference is briefiy summed up ini the last
paragraph o.f the Prime Minister's statement
in reply to the gentlemen who waited upon
him. As I understand, there were about 50
municipal or provincial delegates present.
The words of the Prime Minister of that
day were:
That the Federai Government wouid be prepared to assist in any way possible in this
regard. He suggested a federal, provincial and
municipal conference on the subjeet, and the
resolution 8llblfitted hy the delegates, he said,

wouid receive the attention and consideration
of the Cabinet.
1 hope that this information wiii be sufficient
te satisfy my honourabie friend ýfrom Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) that an honest
and earnest attempt wvas made 'by many
municipalities, supported- by several provincial
governments, te 'bring the unempioyment
situation to the attention of the Dominion
Government. They went se far as te resolve
unanimousiy that a delegatien of these varieus
municipalities and provinces shouid proceed te
Ottawa and me-et the Government. The
answer given by the Dominion Government on
the 26th of Fe.bruary, 1930, is set forth in the
final paragra.ph of the Prime Minister's statement. As is well known, Parliament had
opened only shortiy belere that conference took
place, and remained iù session for several
months afterwards; yct, in the fae of al
those officiai reque.sts siubmitted te the Cabinet
of that time. ne assistance was granted.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am stili without
,concrete information that any proper request
was made through a municipaiity and through
a province for unemployment relief. What
my honourabie friend from Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) bam just stated te us oniY
confirms the view that 1 held last night, which
1 stili hold te an even more marked degree.
The Manitoba Legislature, it is true, passed
extensive legisiatien relating te the question
of unem*pleyment. More power te them! But
they started off by di.savowing any authority
or contrel over the prcdblem, and were quite
wiiling to unload the entire burden upon the
Federal Government. The Federal Government, of course, declined te accept the burden.
The new Federai Government, in the language
of Bill 2, aise declined to aocept the view heid
by the Manitoba Legisiature. 1 am very
serry te have to say to my honouraibie friend
that 1 doubt if there is in the files of the
Department one piece of concrete evidence
of a bona fide request made by a Provincial
Government te the Federal Ciovernment te
come te the assistance of that Provincial
Government in dealing with the problem of

unempioyment in any municipality or municipalities. Certainiy the evidence bas net
been piaced before me by the honourabie
gentleman, and I stili think it proper to asic
that the information 'be laid on the Table or
'be given te me se that I may see it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Mr. Chairman, this seems te be an aimost
interminable centroversy between my honourable friend who has .iust taken his seat
(Hon. Mr. Murdeck) and my henourabie
friend in charge of this Bill (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), who from the book itself has
produced evidence in confirmation of bis3
statement. The discussion, though pleasant,
amicable and informai, bas already been in
progreas for some heurs and wiil probably

continue fer some hours yet. Before it breaks
eut nnew 1 desire to express my views on the
question in a somewhat general way. Shouid
I take a iittle more time than I might if 1
were addressing myseif simply te this Bill,
my excuse wili be that what 1 have te say is
also germane te two other measures, one of
which bas been passed in the Lower House
and is now before us, and the ether of which
is at present under discussion in the other
Chamber. I shahl diseharge my responsibility
and express my sentiments with regard te the
tripartite legisiation.

In the flrst place, I think that each one cf
us, i n making up bis mind on this legisiation,
shouid try te envisage accurately the situa-x
tion as a whole. In attempting te do this I
note firat that an unusual condition prevails,
and bas for some time prevaiied. It bas become more marked from week te week and

month te month, as bas been exempiified in
the discussion. 1 shal neot undertake any
exposition of the causes of the situation. It
is sufficient te say that, as it realiy exists, it
must he deait with as a fact. Briefiy, the faîling of the prices of commodities and the
restriction of production in the industries cf
the country have resulted in a lack of empioyment and consequent widespread distress
throughout the Dominion. The tremendous
faîl in the price of wheat affected the great
basic industry of thîs country, as well as other
industries. I agree entirely with those who
say that the distress is probably net s0 grent
in this country as elsewhere. 1 do net thinkc
it is se great or se widespread in Canada as
it is in the great country te the south of us.
This condition existed when Parliament convened last session. The intensity and extent
of unemployment and distress, and what ought
te be dene te relieve the situation, were
thoroughly discussed in another place. On
the one hand there was a disposition te make
as littie as possible of the întensity and

dimensions of this depression; on the other
hand there was a desire to state the facts
fully, and perhaps to ovcr-emphasize themn.
There ivas on the one sie a demand thit
Parliamient should take action to afford relief,
and un the uther side tlîure xîas a tendoîîcy
to throw back on the municipalities and the,
Provincial Gox eriments the sole responsibility of prex iding whatever uneniploynient
relief was neeessary. Such, brietly and very
casudlly, wiis the position.
Thoere followed on that uinusoal condition
an unusual eleetion.
As a result of the conti oversy that hiad been carrieci on for mnany
mnonthis wbile the session lasted, the, Govcrnnient of th(, day at Iast said te the Opposition:
"W 'e do flot agree with your contentions or
vour proposed niethods; we beliex e that we are
rieht and that vou are wrong; but let us
go ta the country and have the people decide,
and thon we shiaîl have an authoritative Goveriiouint, fresh from the people, administcring
the affairs of the country and endeax ouring ta

seems te me that nothing would bc' gained by
our attempting to send those rnea-ures back

I think, honourable senators, that there is
oniy one sensible course for us te pursue, and
that is te pass the measures and te hoid the
Goverriment ahsolutely responsible for the
way in which they are put into cffect. The
Government wili have te meet Parliament
again, and in both Chambers there wiil be a
full opportunity for a review of ils administrative acts.
A demand lias been made as to the application te this measure of a ruie whichi I think
shouid aiways in ordinary circumstances be
strictivfliwd namely, that Parliament
should be given complete and definite details
of thr measures of relief that it is intended
shah! be undertaken. Wouid it lie practicabie
te follow that suggestion in the present instance? In order to safeguard the e.-zpenditure
of public money it is ordinariiy essentiai that
Parliament should be furnished with dptails
of tie sumq te be spent. Another safeguard
is the audit by the proper officiais of ahl
expenditures. These conditions, it seemas to
me, ensure fairly safe administration of public
money. But te rny mind it seems clear that
we cannot at this time rigidly apply these
two safeguards in connection witih this appro-

SENATE

priation. In the first place, whait, if any, expenditures has the Government already decided to
make? Secondly, who can foretell what the
emergency situation will be in a few weeks,
or three or four months from now? While,
of course, an audit cannot be made until
moneys are expended, we have the satisfaction of knowing that every municipality has
iUs own auditors, who have to report to the
municipal council. Further, every Provincial
Government has its auditing machinery, which
in sone respects, and perhaps in all respects,
is as good as the federal system. Not only
will audited Accounts of all moneys spent
by the Provincial Government for unemployment relief be presented ýto the respective
Legislatures, but the Publie Accounts Committce of cvery Legilature will have full
opportunîity to review all expenditure. These
safeguards, combined with a vigilant publie
opinion demanding the honest application of
the monevs towards the relief proposed, and
the certain revision of results which will be
male at the next session of Parliament, will
reasonably and effectually prevent abuse

the other side of the House would more sincerely de p ecate than I should the introductien of any such thing in this country. I
realize that the Government will be faced
with a big problem the moment it is .naoe
known that the sum of $20,000,000 had been
voted and placed at the disposal of the Govornor in Council. All over Canada localities
will be hoping to get some of that mony,
and the practical politician will be at wor'k
in every hamlet, village, town, city and electoral district of this country, advising those
who may be disposed to seek relief from
unemployment by their own efforts: "Don't
go too rapidly. There is a bag of twenty
millions at Ottawa. Sec what you can get
from that first." That sort of advice will
to a certain extent whet the appetites of
numerous localities for a share of the
$20,000,000. But, human nature being what
it is, J do not think such demands can be
averted. We must remember that the Government has the responsibility of discriminating with regard to the distribution of the
money, and refusing to grant the demand
from any municipal, provincial or other quarter. The Government has my sympathy and
good wishes because of the onerous duties-in some respects, the invidious duties-xwhich

it will have to undertake in distributing this
appropriation.
As I have stated, there must inevitably be
a process of elimination in connection with
the applications that will come to the.Government for relief. When first the idea of appropriating a lump sum for the relief of unemployment was bruited, there began a sort
of competition among the provinces, which
were anxious to get their full share of the
millions that might flow from the federal
treasury. Well, what has been stated in another place has pretty well resulted in putting an end to that competition, and the
provinces now know that not a dollar cf
the money granted under this Bill will cone
to them for purposes other than the relief
of unemployment and distress. For exampie,
if it so happened that there was no unemployment in five of the provinces, then not
a dollar of the money granted by this Bill
would go to any one of those provinces; al;
the relief would be extended to the other
four provinces.
But this process of elimination would need
to be carried further. At first the popular
inpression seemed te be that no person in
this countrv should go without employiment
while this fund made employment possible,
and that relief would be granted to exvei
unemployed person in the Dominion of Canada. Now, I do net understand such to Le
the ohject of thi Bill at all. The sum of
$20,000,000 is not to be appropriated for the
relief of all persons who are without employment for the time being, but is to be applied
onlv for the relief of urgent, unusual and
emnergent cases of distress. It is not the
intention to give aid in any municipality
to every person who is .out of work; assisance is to be given only to those persons who
are suffering and in a state of distress because of their unemployment. Yeu may have
in a locality four members of a farmer's
family who are partly employed in winter
services on the farci. But if two of them are
not necessary for that work, and are therofore out of employment, those two have no
claim upon this fund; they are a family encumbrance, so to speak, and a family responsibility.

This process of elimination can be carried
still further. Take the case of a man who has
been in some business as a foreman or director:
the business bas gone flat, and his salary for
the time is suspended. So he goes home. He
received a good salary for a portion of the
year, and his earnings and savings and credit
must carry him through. He has no right to
any portion of this fund.

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930
So it becomes the Government's duty, and
a most onerous one it is, to eliminate, to discriminate, and then to decide who are the
rightful claimants to this fund, and the extent
to which they shall participate. The Government cannot abdicate its position as a
supreme and ultimate judge of the degree,
quality, and applicability of the relief given.
So much with reference to the general priaciple.
I noticed with a great deal of satisfaction
that in another place a wise and practical
suggestion was made. It was that there should
be, coincident with the relief of unemployment, an enligbtened and persistent propaganda impressing upon the minds of our citizens their individual, local and corporate
responsibilities in the matter of relief. In
a time of distress and suffering such as this
I do not see why the human unit sh*ould not
be reminded of his duties in this mýatter, as
well as the Government which acts for al
the units of the Dominion. I argue in this
way: I happen to be a householder in the
not lightly taxed city of Ottawa. I have
found, like other householders, that a house
has an appetite and requires a great dca]
from its owner for repairs of every description. I considered the neccssity f or the paining of my bouse. I had no idea of commencing the job at present, but I tbought that in
a year or two it would be to my advantage
to paint it, for preservation and for enhanced
appearance as well. But I began to think
along thîs line: if it is to be donc, and I have
the money with which to do it, why not do it
now in this period of extra depression? Bo
$250 or $300, a modest amount which I thought
I could command, will go into the general
cmployment fund foir painters axid painters'
products. Now, Ottawa is a city, we will

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

I tbink that

Riglit Hon. Sir GE ORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, we will say there are householders or
homes in Ottawa to the number of 20,000 or
30,000. Suppose that a fourtb of that number
of householders are able, without violence to
their pockets, to make some improvements
to their homes by carpentry or painting, or
the like of that, and arc able on an average
to expcnd as mucb as I purpose to cxpend.
that would create a fund for extra employment of a little over $1,000,000 in this city
of Ottawa alone. If similar action were
i aken in other centres throughout the
Dominion, and even a small proportion of
householders undertook to have sucb work
donc for their own homes, you might be sur-

prised to find that in the whole of Canada
you would have a total of some $50,000,000,
whicb migbt bc thrown into the uaemployment vacuum. Thus cvery locality would be
stimulated to a wonderful degree. That is
the best distribution that could be made. If
it were possible in this way to conduct propaganda, in which the newspapers would be
glad to join, and in whicb every department
of the Goverament could assist, it would do
a mighty work tbroughout this Dominion.
I. wonder whetber it is not possible to take
similar action on another line. I have read
that the citizens of the Province of Ontario
in the year 1929 marched up like littlc men
to the liquor sbops of that province, now
carried on under the oegis of the Ontario loicrament, and deposited $55,000,000 on the
counter, and got their beer and wine and
whiskey in return therefor. I wonder what
proportion of that $55,000,000, if it had not
been deposited on the counters of those liquor
stores, would have gone into food, fuel, clothing and comforts for the homes of this
country, and thus vivified to an enormous
extent the productive and commercial and
economie iaterests of this country?
,Some hon. SENATOBJS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But 355,000,000 in the Province of Ontario is
not the whole bill. Bootlegging bas not
stopped. Bootleggers still live; they ply their
trade, and every sensible man, every citizen
with two eyes in bis head, every reader and
observer, knows that there is a lot of money
spent for the illicit purchase of intoxicating
lîquors. This also has, in large proportion,
to be deducteil from what otherwise would
flow into legitimate channels of commerce and
production. But Ontario is not the only
sinner. There arc other provinces in this
D)ominion, and it is calculated that altogether, in 1929, nearly $200,000,000 weat from
the hands of the cîtizensbip of the Dominion
of Canada into the tilis of the liquor sbops
in all the provinces of Canada, and there is
no sensible man wbo would not williagly subscribe to the carnest wish that that money
might be diverted so that it would be used
for food and clotbing and comforts for the
family, and the betterment of the people.
I say to the honourable the Minister and
to the Dominion Government that some
responsibility for discrimination rcsts upon
tbem, and upon the other goveraments of
this country. Would it not be wise to selI
fewer permits, especially to mca who are out
of employment and who are applicants for
relief? Is it just or right that one dollar
of that appropriation should go to the man

SENATE

who, tlîough unemployed, or not steadily
empioyed, has bis permit and does havewhether ho must bave or not-his whiskey
and beer and wvinc? In a town to which I
ivas very close in the summer I listenied to
certain tales of men who were on the ýýtrcets
witbout employaicnt for many weeks, and
who were charitably treated by their fe]lowvcitizens, but w-ho managed, hy indirect or
other means, te get their daily dole of
spirituous liquors. I think it is incumbent
uipon the Government te use as great
discriminatory power as possible te prevent
any portion of that money from geing te the
relief of persons eut of iverk whe will net
consent te spend it for the purposes of the
family and foir necessary personal use.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn not charging
my honourable friend with bringing them in.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: How many Arabians
came in?
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourable members,
1 think we are getting a little away from the
Bill in hand, and into the field of politics. I
submit we should not view this question in
the light of political allegiance. I am not
antagonistic to the granting of $20,300,000 for
unemployment. The very illuminating and
sfflendid ad'dress of the right honcvurahle
member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) is one to be appreciated. He mentioned the fact that different Provincial
Covernments are coming to this Government
asking for relief while they are selling over
the counters of liquor stores $200,000,000 worth
of liquor. It should flot be a very serious
problem for this Parliament to grant onetenth of that amount for the relief of unemployment.
I should like to have some information from
the honourable member fromn Welland (Hon.
I understand that this
Mr. Robertson).
$20,000,000 is to be spent primarily for work,
alone. Ani 1 right?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Such portions of
it as are to he spent at ail are to be spent
on unemployment relief, preferably in provicling work. Where work cannot he provided the
municipality may give unemployment relief,
in which case the Federal Government will
participate.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: That does not remove
the relief very far fromn the dole. I can quite
understand that it may be difficult in some
cases to give wurk. For instance, indigent old
womien or old men cannot be given work.
They are too old to work. They should be
given some assistance.
Can a muniei'pality make a direct request
to the Federal Government?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They can make
Tequests, but the Federal Government will not
make agreements direct with the municipalities.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: Am 1 to understand
that if such requests are received they will be
referred to the Provincial Government?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Those matters of
detail must be determined by the Governor
in Council after the Bill is passed.

Hon. Mr. LOGAN: We should know how
this money is to be given.
I understand that when the rnoney is given
to, a Provincial Government on behaif of a
munici-pality, for every dollar paid by the
Federal Govern'ment the municipality will
pay one dollar and the Provincial Government
one dollar. Arn I right?
Hon. Mr, ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Not according to this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: What proportion does
the municipality pay?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Again I say that
these details must be matters of agreement
among the Federal Government, the provinces,
and the municipal authorities. Whether any
distribution is made or not must depend on
cir-cumstances.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I should like to eall
attention to the facet that you will find it very
difficult to induce one municipality to pay
when another is not doing so. There must be
some rule by whieh this money is to 'be distriibuted.
I presume there will be expenditures made
on public works of the provinces. When an
expenditure is made by the Provincial Government, without reference to the munici.pality, will the Federal Government psy onehaîf of that provincial expenditure?
Hon. Mr. ROBEiRTSON: It will pay a
portion.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN. That is not very satisfactory.
If moniey is to be paid direct, is the municipality to 'be compelled to pay anything? Can
the Dominion Government go into a munici,pality and pay out money direct without any
contribution from the Provincial Government
or the municipality?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, if it is
carrying on a federal work.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I mean paying cash
-a dole.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:' N'o.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: It will not pay unless
the municipality contributes?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- The Act so provides.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I do not think it does.
However, the honourable gentleman should
know, and hie says it does.
This is a very seri-ous problem. We are
giving 520,000,000, and it seems to me that

SENATE

we are inviting unemployment in Canada. I
undertake to say that if the honourable
gentleman sent out a questionnaire to-day to
all of the cities of over 10,000 he would receive replies stating, "We have at least
250,000 or 300,000 unemployed." It is easy to
bc unemployed when one sees a chance of
getting a dole.
As to the distribution of this money in
municipalities of under 10,000 population, in
the country districts, I think the Government
must exercise the greatest care in the distribution of this money, because if it does not,
the $20,000,000 will be far from what is required to provide for the unemployed during
the coming winter.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In reference to
the reinbursement
of municipalities for
moneys spent on unemployment, I should
like to ask the Minister how far back that
goes.

Hon. Mr. GR1ESBACH:
The point is
this. It may be possible for provinces and
municipalities to dig up bills for the past
twenty years and in this way to swallow
up the whole $20,000,000. Is this money to
be used to reimburse provinces or municipalities for any money expended in the past?
If so, how far back does it extend?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I am not a
lawyer, but my conception of the Bill is
that it will be effective from the date upon
which it receives the Royal Assent. I do
not understand it to be retroactive.
lon. Mr. BUREAU:
Can the honourable Minister point to any place in the Bill
where it sa:vs that municipalities will contribute a certain amount when moneys are
paid to them by the Federal Government in
connection with the relief of unemployment?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I may point out
to my honourable friend that every dollar
that is to be expended is to be expended for
unemployment, and if municipalities make
contributions and spend money for unemployment relief, and represent that they need assistance, their requests will be investigated and
assistance will be given them in defraying their
expenses.

Hon.

Mr LOGAN.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: But that is no answer
to my question. As has been pointed out by
the honourable gentleman from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), the Bill says that
money may bc used in "granting aid to provinces and municipalities in any publie work
they may undertake for relieving unemployment and reimbursing expenditures made by
provinces and municipalities." Reimbursement
includes the repayment of moneys expended
by the municipalities. The Minister of Labour
ought to know, and I hope he does know, what
he is going to do. When the honourable member from Cumberland (Hon. Mr. Logan) asked
him whether the municipalities would contribute, he said yes. Then he said the statute
provided for it. There is nothing in the statute
that provides for any contribution either by
the province or the municipality, except by
implication.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I point to
section 3 of the Bill, where it says that money
may be exprnded in:
assisting in dofraying tpe eost of distribution
of products of the field, farm, forest. sea, lake,
river and iine: granting aid to provinces and
miîeoîcipalities in any public work they may
ujndertake for relieving unemuploymenet.
If a municipality undeitakes work for the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Federal
Government may, under this Act, assist it
from this fund.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
from the Bill:

Continue the reading

-- and reimibursing expenditures-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It means in part,
bcause there is no expenditure to be made
unless the municipality undertakes some responsibility.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: But what does "reimbumrsement" mean? Is it the intention of
the Minister of Labour as the administrator of
this law to say that it will be only part of the
expenditure, or that it will be dollar for dollar
of the expenditure made by the municipality
to relieve unemployment?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not being a
lawyer, as I said a moment ago, perhaps I
do not draw the same meaning from technical
language that my honourable friend does. My
honourable friend very well understands, I
am sure, that the Federal Government does
not intend to pay for any portion of the cost
of any work that it Pas not previously agreed
to participate in. If a municipality or a
province desires to carry on the relief of
unemployment by creating employment, the
Federal Government may by agreement par-

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930
ticipate in the cost. It must, lie a matter of
agreement. No municipality can go out and
dig a ditch or build a fence in anticipation
that the Federal Government will share in
the expense.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: That-is flot the point.
The Bill contains no restriction or condition
that may lie imposed by the Government, and
there is nothing binding either the municipality or the province to contribute.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It says that the
Govcrnment may aid a province or a municipality; which presupposes, of course, that they
contribu te.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honouraible
friend has told us repeatedly that it was the
intention of the Government to ap.portion this
fund, and to make the three parties contribute to it-the municipelity, the Provincial
Government and the Federal Governmentand he told us a moment ago that this would
be donc in equal pro-portions.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. I did not
say that. I said that those were matters which
would lie determined by the Governor in
Council when the individual proposais came
before them, and that no definite rule had
been or can lic laid down.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Did my honourahle friend not tell us that in an expenditure
of three dollars one dollar would lie paid by
the municipality, one dollar liy the Provincial
Government, and one dollar by this Government?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. I made no
sucli staternent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I certainly understood the honourable gentleman to do so.
Then my hon ourable friend addcd that it was
provided in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. No such
statement was made.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: While that
point is being cleared up, may I caîl the
attention of the Minister to a clause in section
3, and ask him just what it means. It says:
-assisting in defraying the cost of distribution
of produets of the field, farm, forest, sea, lake,
river and mine.
Do>es that mean that a portion of the $20,000,00 may lie used in encouraging the bringing of coal, for exaxnple, from the West or
the Ea.st to the central part of Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It does.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then it is
possible that there will not lie very much

lef t for real relief work. I arn not saying
that the Government should not do that, but
it strikes me as peculiar that At should be
taken out of the $20,000,000 provided for in
this Bill, liecause if the fuel problemn is to
be solved to any appreciable extent, as lias
been done in the past, by assistance in the
way of contributions to freiglit cost, the
money will lie spent rapidly. As 1 understand this clause, part of the $20,000,000 may
lie used to pay express charges on fish shipped
from the East to the West; and part of the
appropriation mey be given as a bonus to
the lumber industry in the East and the~
West. If the Government does that sort oi
thing, Heaven lielp the poor people wlio are
looking forward to relief. Does not my honourable friend think that this clause is inserted to niake the appropriatiun louk a little
better than if it were confined to direct relief for the unemployed?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- In reply to my
honoureble friend's observation I niay say
that the Government, when drafting that
clause, had in mind that if it is feasible et
present to slip coal from Alberta into central Manitoba, it should be possible by
slightly extending tlie assistance which was
given by thc late Government to have that
produce carried anotlier 300 or 400 miles eastward, even into tlie Ontario market, and that
by affording employment for the men in the
coal areas and in transportation services some
of the purposes for which this money is
being granted would lie fulfilled. My righit
honourable friend made a reference to the
lumber industry. I mey say that elready an
application bas been received from a Provincial Government asking for consideration
of a proposai that the Federal Government
meke a contribution to the Provincial Secretary if a reduction in stumpage is grantcd.
It is thouglit that such a reduction would
result in stimulating, the lumber industry over
a large area and giving employment to a
large number of men wlio are now out of
work. The Bill is so drawn that tbe Governor in Council will be able to exercise
judgment as to the best use to whicb the
money cen be put for the relief of unemployment.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my right lion.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: I venture to sey that
the country will read with some astonish-

SENATE

ment the remarks of the honourable Minister of Labour. May I ask the honourabie
Minister whether he can form an estimate

of how much of the $20,000,000 will be spent
in actual wages to people who are now unemployed? I venture to say that the amount
so spent will be less than $7,000,000.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend may be a botter prophet than I. I
have no information that would enable mu
to answer his question, and I prefer not te
make a guess.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:

Well, that is my guess.

Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators, before the Bill is reported I should like
to make a few remarks respecting the lumber industry, which has been referred to by
the honourable the Minister of Labour. I
have in my hand a copy of some papers
relating to unemployment which were placed
on the Table of this House a few days ago,
and there is included a copy of correspondence
between the Department of Labour and the
Provincial Governments. I find in the file a
communication from the Minister of Labour
of the Province of New Brunswick to the
Minister of Labour of Canada, and this communication is based upon a letter, a copy
of which is enclosed, from a Mr. Fenderson,
a lumber operator in the northern part of
that province. Mr. Fenderson wrote:
With supplies approxinately 25 per cent
lower and a liberal reduction in stumpage, it
might be possible to operate to some extent at
least, and 1 further believe that the lunibermen are desirous of trying to help out the
situation in so far as it is possible to do so.
In the letter, dated August 18, 1930, from
the Minister of Labour of New Brunswick,
he says:
The last paragraph of his letter-that
is, Mr. Fenderson's letter-suggests a possible solution to the uneiployment problen.
That is, in the Province of New Brunswick.
Already the cost of supplies is virtually 25
per cent less than last year, and if in any way
a liberal rcliition of stumupage can be brought
about (amd it woulhl seei to mie that this can
only be done by federal aid, as stiumpage rates
are already fixed for the present year). it seemns
to mie the unenployment situation will be
greoatly relieved.
I should like to call the attention of the
honourable the Minister of Labour particularly to the fact that the Minister of Labour
of New Brunswick implies that the Government of that province is prepared to make
certain concessions to the lumber industry
lIjîn. Mr. FORKE.

if the Provincial Government is reimbursed
by the Government of Canada.
I should
like to ask the honourable the Minister of
Labour if the letter from which I have just
quoted is the communication to which he
referred when replying to a question by the
right honourable gentleman from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
I desire to
emphasize that the Province of New Brunswick is not primarily a manufacturing province, and therefore the benefits which it is
alleged will flow from the other two Bills to
come before us will not apply in New Brunswick to the same extent as in provinces
where manufacturing is carried on to a large
extent. Therefore it is highly important
that the lumber industry of New Brunswick
should be given favourable consideration by
the honourable the Minister of Labour if
he receives any request for aid to enable
the province to reduce stumpage.
I was deeply interested in the opposition
expressed by the right honourable the junior
member from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) to the introduction of the mole in
this country. I think, honourable senators,
that all over Canada there is a strong sentiment against any relief measure of that kind.
Canada has a brilliant record of achievement,
tremendous natural resources, and a people
possessed of great ability to make the best
use of the natural resources that are around
us, and it is to be hoped that no legislation
of what might be called a pronounced social
character will ever be passed here.
I happen to have occupied for a number of
years the position of Prime Minister of the
Province of New Brunswick, and in 1918 or
1919 I was primarily responsible for the introdution into that province of the Workmen's
Compensation Act. As might be expected,
there vas strong opposition to the Act on the
part of manufacturers particularly, and I told
them at the time that they themselves were
principally to blame for legislation of that kind,
bceaus) they had not taken the initiative to
provide safety regulations and appliances for
their workmen. An honourable gentleman
mentioned the other day, with reference to the
Unemployment Relief Bill, that he thought
the Federal Government had placed the cart
blefore the horse, but in the Province of New
Brunswick the horse had disappeared altogetter, and thon, when it was too late, the
stable door was locked. When the manufacturers and other employers of labour in that
province were faced with an assessment to pay
compensation to injured workmen, they took
stops which they should have taken years be-

SEPTEMBER 18. 1930
fore with a view to making safer the working
conditions of the employees. To my mind.
the situation that faced manufacturers and
other employers of labour in New Brunswick
prior to the introduction of the Workmen's
Compensation Act is similar to that which now
faces employers of labour all over this country, in relation to the dole, or what might be
termed unemployment insurance.
I should like to suggest to the honourable
the Minister of Labour the importance of
war.ning business men of the necessity to prepare themselves for the recurrence

of

de-

pression, for it seems clear that periods such
as we are now experiencing run in cycles. It is
refreshing to honourable members on this side
of the House to hear honourable gentlemen
opposite state that some of the unemployment
now existing is not due to the fiscal policy of
the country, but that we are in the midst
of a periodical depression. I believe that this
is truc, and therefore it seems to me all
the more important that we should consider
carefully any legislation which may be looked
upon as a precedent in the future. Twenty
million dollars is a large sum of money to appropriate from the exchequer of this country,
even for such an important object as the relief of unemployment. The importance of
what we are doing here should be brought
home to our minds by the fact that we are
sitting in a special session of Parliament, legislating under unusual conditions. I think the
Government should endeavour to do all it can
to prevent the recurrence of conditions such
as we have in this country to-day. Perhaps
the general situation would be relieved to
some extent if large corporations were a little
more conservative in declaring dividends and in
providing for reserves. Any tendency of that
kind would be more favourably received by
the majority of our people than legislation of
the sort we are considering to-day. Manv
economists tell us that in the future we shal
have other cycles of depression and unemployment; that the return to prosperity, which we
all hope will be within a reasonably short
period, cannot be permanent. Therefore, although I am casting my vote in favour of
this Bill, I do not wish it to be considered as
a precedent when we are faced with similar
conditions in the future.
Like the right honourable the junior member from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster), I sympathize greatly with the Minister of Labour because of the difficulties with
which he will have to contend in disbursing this
money.

I presume that the allotments will be

principally at the discretion of the Department

of Labour, and I have every confidence that
the honourable the Minister will, in so far as
ho is able, direct the expenditure in the proper
and most effective channels; but I do not feel
so sure that once the money gets beyond the
control of the honourable the Minister of
Labour it will be so properly used. I do not
suggest that there will be any actual misappropriation, but I fear that not all the $20,000,000 will be used for the particular purpose
that we have in mind.
I have a suggestion to make to the Minister of Labour, though perhaps it is not of
great importance. I happened to be head of
the Government of the Province of New
Brunswick at the time, some years ago, when
the honourable the Minister of Labour first
occupied his present position, and when he
established the Labour Bureaus throughout
Canada. At that time the Government of
New Brunswick was asked to contribute
towards the expense of those offices. I believe that some of those bureaus are not
carried on for the purposes for which they
were established. I believe that their funetions should be enlarged and made more useful, so that employers and employees might
come more closely together, and employers,
when they required labour, might go to those
offices. We might go to the full extent of
compelling employers to register their requirements in advance in the Labour Bureaus.
The man who wishes to hire labour, or may
need to do so in the future, does not register
his requirements there as he should. There
is no denying the fact that in this crisis, as
we might call it, which is just arising, there
are many labourers in this country who have
not had proper notice that their services
would Le dispensed with. The system of
registration should show when employers are
going to dispense with large numbers of men
because of conditions that are likely to arise.
Speaking only from local knowledge, I do
not think the arrangements for dealing with
applicants are as convenient as they should be.
When a labourer is out of work he has first to
tramp about to see whether he can pick up
some employment. As a last resort he comes
to the Labour Bureau and registers. The
applicants for work have to go out through
the same door at which they entered,instead
of being able to go out by another door.
I should also like to say to the Minister of
Labour that in the use of this money which
we are voting, the Labour Bureaus should be
utilized to a greater extent than they are at
present. When this money gets into the
hands of Provincial Governments and municipalities politics are bound to play some part
in the employment of labour on public works

SENATE

or any work for which the money wili bc
used. 1 say that there shouid be no political
discrimination in dealing with the people who
are secking empioyment such as wiIl be provided under this Act.
The Dominion Governmcnt itself, wha
estabiished these Labour Bureaus in Canada,
does flot employ themn for the registration of
casual labour. The very people who pay for
the' upkeep of these offices do nlot utilizc
them to the extent thcy should. This remark
applies also te, the' Provincial Governrnents,
who pay part of the costs. We know the reason why: it is because of political patronage.
Therefore 1 say that the Labour Bureaus
sbouid be utilized more for registration purposes, anti tbrough these exehanges the' people
should obtain the employment which wiil be
afforded by means of this fund which wc
are voting.

lon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable

feel there are provisions. in it that xviii establish precetients and produce problems for this

suggest to my honourable friend that he
should not pursue his request too far; and I
say this with the best of feeling. A similar
request has beén made from other provinces.
If such a request were granted I might feel
the benefit of it in a certain direction
temporarily, but in my opinion it would not
prove to be of lasting benefit.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: In regard to the question of stumpage, I was only making the plea
because the lumbermen of New Brunswick
themselves, in an interview with the Government of New Brunswick, stated that if they
obtained a reduction of stumpage they would
enter into certain operations in the lumber
business.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
I quite agree with
the honourable gentleman and with the lumbermen down there that his proposition would
relieve unemployment temporarily, but I
think the money would be better spent on
something which would relieve it for a longer
time.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, if no one desires to continue the
discussion, I should be glad te see a littie
progress made with the Bill before six o'clock
if possible. May I say a word on a few
subjects that have been brought up, namely,
those relating to the forests and the mines?
I would inform my honourable friend from
St. John (Hon. W. E. Foster) that representations have been made by the Government of New Brunswick, through its Prime
Minister, but unfortunately it omitted to
state what proportion of the expense it was
prepared to bear. That information is now
being sought. I can assure my honourable
friend that serious consideration will be given
to the question, because already some proofs
exist that the adoption of the proposal might
substantially increase employment opportunities. However, that matter is not closed at
all, and the correspondence is being continued.
As to the mines, mentioned by the honourable gentleman from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan), I think that he well knows that
situation which he was good enough to say I
knew. A difficulty with our mining industry
in the Western Provinces, particularly in
Alberta, and perhaps in British Columbia, is
that they have a productive capacity far beyond their market opportunities. I am inclined to think that the return of the natural
resources to the Prairie Provinces will result
in the Province of Alberta, as an example,
adopting different measures with regard to
the opening up of new coal areas. I have
discussed this subjeet with some men in public

life in that province in past years, and that
seemed to be the prevailing view. Some of
them thought that the Federal Government
might attempt virtually te control the development in that respect by refusing licenses
for the opening up of such areas. However,
there was the delicate question of provincial
rights, which might be interfered with. Now
that the natural resources have been returned
to the Prairie Provinces, it is within the
jurisdiction of Alberta to take such steps as
are deemed wise, and I expect to sec efforts
made to increase the actual production of the
mines rather than to increase their productive
capacity. If production can be increased, I
think it will go a long way in helping unemployment, which returns periodically in
that area.
One or two 'bonourable gentlemen have
remarked that the Minister of Labour would
be called upon .to make important decisions.
May I point out, what perhaps may have
escaped the attention of all here, that it was
clearly stated in another place that every
expenditure to be incurred as a result of this
legislation, while it might be recommended
by an individual Minister, must have the
approval of the Governor in Council. That
is a great safeguard against *undue pressure
on any particular Department.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: It is all very well to
say that the responsibility is on the Government, but we all know that, after all, the
Minister of Labour will be chief adviser of
the Government in the expenditure of this
money. I should like a little more definite
information with reference to the payment of
money te municipalities, net for work, but
for relief to old men who cannot work. Does
the Minister propose to require the municipalities to contribute te what is paid to old
men, for instance?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Prime Minister announced in another place that the
Government had received, considered and approved certain recommendations made by
the Employment Service Council of Canada
after its conference here on August 21. That
Council made the following recommendation:
That in cases where direct relief must be
given, it is recommended that the following
principles be observed: Costs should be evenly
divided between the municipality, the province
and the Dominion.
The Prime Minister has announced that the
Government accepts that basis.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then I was quite
right in saying that the proportion of each
of the three is to be equal.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: So far as direct
relief is concerned.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: Last night, in referring
to the protection of the fund, the honourable
gentleman used the following language:
The greatest safeguar 1 in the expenditure of
this fund is the fact that for every dollar spent
by the Fele rai Gove.rnment the nunicipality
anl the province iust also spend their noney.
IS tlat right, or is it wrong?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is right.

to old age pensions cone in under this regulation in anv way?

reasons whylhe cannot at this time and in
this place co-operate with me in having something done that I think should be done, and
that I think it would be a great mistake to
v undone. For thirty years a fair wages
policy bas been in effect for the benefit of
the workingmen of Canada, particularly
workingmen who are beneficiaries of any
moneys expended by the Federal Government. It would appear to me to be a retrograde step to pass this Bill without some'
recognition of the fair wages policy that this
Parliament has stood for during the past
thirty ycars, and I am going to ask my honourable friend the Minister of Labour to
move, so that I may second it, an amendment to section 3 with whieh I know he î,
personally in sympathy. It is to add a subsection reading in this way:
All undertakings by the provinces or municipalities on any publie works, or other undertakings for the relief of unemployment, shall

wages policy of this Parliament.
I hope that my honourable friend will be
able to accept that and propose it. Outside
of this Chamber I could leave a matter of

that kind entirely to his care, feeling confident that he would whole-heartedly support
the principle which I have endeavoured ta
express in these few words.
I think the
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
honourable gentleman should move it himself.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
honourable gentleman a question? Assuming
that a definite portion of this noncy is to
go directly to labouring men in the form of
wages, which is the better: to bind the Government to a high wage, or the standard
Government wage, and to employ say 5,000
men, or to give half the wages and double
the number of men employed?
My honourable
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
friend is asking me if half a loaf is better
than no bread. I would answer him by saying that for twenty years, at least, the Minister of Labour and I have been in close
and friendly association, working together in
confidence many times, with little or no disagreement, in support of the contention that
a fair wage and a stated number of hours of
work per day werc proper for workingmen,
and I do not think that we should now take
advantage of the misfortunes of the unemI think it would be criminal for

us to do that. So I am asking the Minister
of Labour to move in this matter.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: We all remember our school days. One of the things that
I remember very well from the time when I
went to school was the learning of a certain
little poem that began: "Will you walk into
my parlour?" I appreciate the manner in
which my honourable friend has approached
this question, but I am sure that he is just
as convinced as I am that it is not within
the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament to
enact the legislation that he seeks. An
amendment similar to this was submitted to
the House of Commons and discussed there
at length. It was supported by gentlemen
who, like by honourable friend and myself,
are earnest in their desire to help the working people. But in contemplating the Federal Parliament imposing its will upon a
municipality or a province, or both, one must
consider just what our rights in the premises
are. It is my understanding and belief that
no legislation that the Federal Government
might pass in reference to the domestic affairs
of a municipality situated a thousand or
two thousand miles away would be binding.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
that as a condition.

You could attach

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I think I explained clearly iast night that it was nlot within
our jurisdiction to pass such legisiation, but
that it was the intention of the Government
to urge upon the municipalities and provinces
the importance of inserting fair wages regulatiens and an eight heur day clause in the
agreements made among the provinces, the
municipalities and the Federal Government
for the distribution of money fromn this fund.
l3 y means of such agreements we accomplish
wýhat the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) desires, what 1
desire, and what I believe most of the mcmbcrs in both Houses desire. If we attempted
to accomplish this by way of amendment to
the B3ill, the provinces and the municipalities,
might say: "The' Act is no good, and we are
nlot bound to respect it." This would creatc
difficulty and dispute ail over the country.
We purpose to attain the samne object by the
means I have indicated, and I am sure it is
the direct and proper method.

CUSTOMS ACT AMENDMENT
SECOND

BILL

READING

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON moved the
second reading of Bill 3, an Act to amend the
Customs Act.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill,
which has to do with the revision of the Customs A-et, is boem
of the samne desire as the
Bill which we were discussing iast night and
early to-day. It is hoped that this measure
will resuit in an acceleration of business and
consequently increased employment ahl over
Canada. The effect of the proposed amendment te the Act will be to give Canadian pro-

ducers a greater measure af protection than
they have had in the past. The Bill in itself
will not mnake any changes in the tariff, but
it makes possible the administration of the
Customs Act in such a way as to prevent discrimination against Canadian manufacturers
and producers.
As far back as 1922, I think, there was a

Customs Act amendinent, which is commonly
termed the dumping clause, covering natural
produets. such as fruits, vegetables, and 50 on;
but, if 1 remember correctly, it was not put
into force ýuntil 1926. and then only with
respect to certain fruits and, I think, some
%-.getables, and it was regarded as a seasonal
measure. In 1928, 1 tbink, the late Govemnment again exerbised its powers under that
amendment. in the saine connection, and with
suceess.
This amendaient proposes the extention of
such powcrs on the part of the Government
to ail commodities, whether they be natural
products or manufactures.
Many instances
have come to the notice of the Government
of under-valuation of products from foreign
countries for the purposes of duty. This
became so serious that it was affecting Canadian industry injuriously. The inveice price
entered for duty purported to be the inveice
price in a foreign country. It has been discovered that that had not operated fairly te
Canada, and su this Bill has been franied for
the purpose of giving to the Minister of
National Revenue certain powers to fix the
value for duty purposes.
I take it that every honourable member
is familiar with the general purpose of the
Bill, and I will not delay the House with any
long explanation. When the Bill geta into
committee it can be fully discussed.
I meve the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend the Minester of Lab~our has, just alluded to the principal
clause of the Bill passed in 1922, which he
says is commonly known as the dumping
clause. As a matter of fact the amendnîents
sought by this Bihl are not directed te the
anti-dumping legislation, which was passed. in
1906 or 1907. I find it in the Revised Statutes
of 1927, but 1 think it was passed in 1906.
This Bill has nothing to do with the antidumping legislation passed at that time. It
does not seek to amend the principle contained in the Customs Tariff in which the
anti-dumping clause stands. Nor is it
governed by the saine prin-ciple. We are
now amending clauses of the Customs Act,
whereas any clauses against dumping are to

SENATE

e found in the Customs Tariff. I will read
section 6 of chapter 44 of the Revised
Statutes, 1927, which deals with dumping:
In the case of articles exported to Canada
of a class or kind made or produced in Canada, if the export or actual scelling price to an
importer in Canada is less than the fair market

value of ftle sanie article when sold for

home consuimption in .the usual and ordinary
course in the country whence exported to Canada at the time of its exportation to Canada,
there shall, in addition to flic duties otherwise
establislhed, be levied, collected and paid on
such article. on its inportation into Canada, a
special or duiping diity, equal to the difference between the said selling price of -the
article for export and the said fair market
value thereof for home consuiption; and sucli
spceial or dnmping diity sball be levied, collected and paid on sieli article, although it is
not otlerwise diitiable:
ProvideI that ftle said special duty shall net
exc ed fifteei per cent ad valorem in any case;
ai I ic following goods shall be exempt from
siulh special dutyThon there is a lis! of goods. That is the
anti-duimp jing legislation brought in, either in
1906 or 1907. in one of the budgets of Mr.
Fic'lding. I remieniber very well the occasion
of that lIgislation. I was preent at a largely
aittended conference at which Mr. Fielding
and his collcagues met the ropresentatives of

the Canadian Manifacturers' Association, who
caîm to ask for higher protection, net because
at the time they needed it--for they declared
that th v wcre perfectly satisfied with the
um

e

ehad, and with the tariff as it
th -on

feared that if there
the
wasi--blut Icaue
was any kind of depression in the United
Statefs, th danger-flag would be hoisted and
the industries of Canada would bu disorganized and dooed. Mi. Fiîlding desired to
give thni a sense of security for the future.
Upon their representation that they Were perftctly satisfied with the tariff as it stood, instead of granting theim higher protection
which, as they said, they did net need, he
introduced the legislation called the antidumping clauses, as amendmîents to the
Customs Tariff. Up te the convening of this
session of Parlianent the Canadian manufacturer had for his protection whatever the
custons hities against imports gave him, and
besides that h' had the anti-dumping duty or
tax, which added a possible fifteen per cent
increase over and above the tariff duties that
were set forth in the Statute Book.
What will be the situation when this Bill
is passed and the tariff increases come into
effect after heing passed by the two Chambers
and receiving the Royal Assent? The Canadian manufacturer will have, as the result of
the tariff changes, whieh will be before us
shortly, the protection of much higher customs
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

duties than before; ho will have the same
anti-dumping supertax as before, and with the
present Bill he may obtain in addition a complete prohibition of imports. Section 4 of
this Bill reads as follows:
4. Section forty-three of the said Act is repealed, and the following is substituted therefor:-

"43. (1) If at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council on a report
from the Minister that goods of any kind are
being imported into Canada, either on sale or
on consignment. under such conditions as prejiulieially or injuriously to affect the interests
of Canadian producers or manufacturers, the
Gevernor in Council may anthorize the Minister to fix the value for duty of any class or kind
of sueh goods. and notwitlstanding any other
provision of this Act. the value so fixed ehall
be deemed to be the fair market value of such
goods."
Under the anti-dumping legislation the
supertax could net exceed fifteen per cent of
the fair value of the goods. Now there is to
be no qualification as te the value of the
goods. Honourable gentlemen will not find
any limitation or restriction whatever. The
Governor in Council may declare that the
valuation reported by the Minister is the
proper valuation, and that is final. There Is
nothing governing the action of the Minister.
An article iîmv be selling in a foreign market
at a dollar. The manufacturer of such articles
mîay state that ho is prejudicially affected by
its importation. He may be selling his own
goods for $1.50. Then the Minister can declare that the proper valuation is $1.50, or
82.00, and whatever amoiunt he fixes becomes
the law. Thus the Canadian manufacturer
may obtain through the Governor in Council
an arbitrary valuation. There is no direction
in the legislation that it must be the fair
market value in the country of origin. The
valuation may b such as absolutely te close
the door and completely prohibit the bringing in of such goods.
The clause enacted in 1922 reads as follows:
43.
tion
from
class

If at any time it appears to the satisfacof the Governor in Coin.cil on a report
the Minister. tliat natural products of a
or kind produced in Caiiada'are being im-

ported into Canada, either on sale or on con-

signuient, under such con ditions as preiidicially

or injiriously to affect ftle interests of Canadian producers, the Governor in Council may,
in a.ny case or class of cases, authorize the
Mlinister to valule schli goods for dnty, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, and
the valie so determined shall be held to be the
fair market value thereof.
The amendment now sought is to replace
the words " natural products of a class or
kind produced in Canada " by the words,
' goods of any kind ". So the principle involved in the Act is being enlarged: it was

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930
limited to natural products, but is now cxtended to goods of any kind manufactured in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Wbat is the
tbat, in view

of the present

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

1 arn simply

objection
law?

to

explaining the

legislation, but 1 will show

later wbat I believe to be tbe danger that
may arise from it. As bonourable gentlemen bave noticed, tbe legislation of 1922 was
expressly limited to natural produets, and it
affected quite a large class of producersour farming community, and more especially
tbe fruit-growers throughout the land. That
legislation, if acted upon, did not close the
door to competition, because the number of
producers of natural products, sucb as fruitCompegrowcrs, precluded any monopoly.
tition remained in full play througbout Canada. The difference I sce between tbe legi,lation of 1922 and tbis which is now before
us is that tbe princiole is now to be extcnded

to ahl private interests, corporations and individuals,

and

tbis

fact

may

create

the

danger of monopoly by the exclusion of coinpetition. In natural produets there was nu
danger of monopoly; the area covered by the
producers was so wide, covering several provinces, and tbe production so diversified, that
there was bornd fo ha beavy coinpétition.

Tbere is the danger that with this extension
to aIl interests the door may be closed
against importation, and an article may bccorne tbe monopoly of the Canadian producer.
Again, in the anti-dumping clause tbere
is a limit set to the imposition of the super-

tax, whicb is fifteen per cent; but in thiq
case there is no limait. Wbatever the Minister reports becomes the law. The price
hie fixes may absolutely probibit importation,
and then the country must turn to the producer of the article, wbo will not be affected
in the setting of bis price by tbe foreign
competitor, and there will be no limitation
or qualification in tbe fixing of that price.
In the anti-dumping clause tbe fair market
value in the country of origin must be considered. We bave not tbat provision in this
liegislation. The valuation is absolutely arbitrary.
Tben I would draw the attention of Ibis
Cbamber to the danger o£ complications. A
pronounicement made Iby Order in Council maY
to a considerable degree affect the imports
from outside and alter trade conditions. It
may exelude in large measure sales for delivery in Canada. No exporter frIom a foreign

country will dare seli at a fixed price for
delivery in Canada wben an arbitrary valuation of the goods can be imposed. In many
instances hie calculates and absox4bs the customs duty, and hie does so only because the
rate is fixed. With the threat of an arbitrary
valuation hanging over them, foreign exporters undoubtedly wili seli for delivery at
home, and it will be for the Canadian importer
to take the risk.
The Canadian importer will *be in a considerable quandary. He buys abi-oad, and
generally bis buying is .based on bis sales.
How can hie risk buying wben hie does flot
know what tbe 'cost :price will be? If hie bas
no certain basis of cost, bie will be bam-pered
in disposing of bis goods in advance, in tbe
ordinary way, and in puDcbasing abroad to
meet bis sales requirements. Tbis, it seems to
me, will create considerable disturbance of
mind among our people wbo are importing
fromn abroad.

in consequence.
Some honourable gentlemen may think tbat
tbe more difficulties that we put in the way of
tbe purchase of foreign goods, tbe better it
will be for Canada. I would draw tbe attention of my bonourable friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) to tbe fact that trade is exehange,
and that if we value our export business we
must resign ourselves to accepting sometbing
in return. Tbe other day, in the debate on the
Address, I said tbat in 192, with its bigb protection, and varied climate and production,
the United States exported $2,600,0O,00 worth
of mantifactured goods, and îmported nearly
$1,8000,000 wortb, or saine 67 per cent of

the value of tbe exports.

This sbould go to

show that a country ýcannot live witb absolutely closed doors, for if there is any country
tha.t could do so, surely tbat country is the
United States, with its tremendous population
and its productivity under various climatic
conditions.
These arc the tbougbts that corne to mny
mind in looking at tbis piece of legisiation.
I tbink that tbe Government. would bave
been better advised to address itself to the
anti-dumping legislation of 1906 or 1907 with
a view to amendinz it and makin-, it more
effective. Tbe anti-dumping clause still remains on the Statute Book; but bere we are,

under our anti-dumping legislation, going to
the limit by practically giving the Governor
in Council the right of absolute prohibition.
It may be argued that in what I have said
I am exaggerating. I am simply showing
what can be done under the Act, and with
these remarks I ]eave my colleagues to ponder.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, I trust that I shall be
allowed to violate the rules slightly-not -n
language, but in discussion-because I am in
a position somewhat similar to that of the
right honourable member for Ottawa (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster), who spoke this
afternoon. The present Bills are ail correla-ted
and can be discussed in effect as one. In
addition, it is just possible that whon the
Custons Tariff Bill cornes down there will
not be sufficient time to discuss the changes
as one might wish to do, and the interjection
of a few remarks might bo construed as an
attempt to prevent the Prime Minister and
his colleagues fron grtting away to the
Econonie Conference. I say that because I
feel that the absence of the representatives of
Can:ada from the Economnie Conference at this
particular timue would be very serious. I look
upon their presence at that Confprence as of
even more imiportance than their presence at
the Imperial Coiference itself. At the Imperial
Conference, of course, matters of far-reaching import are discusscd, but they have
nothing to do with the vital question of trade
relations. In this connection I should like
to express the view that if the Prime Minister and his colleagues can discover some
scheme to get the grain and lumber and other
products of our country moving into the
hands of people who can buy them, they
will be accomplishing more to alleviate the
present situa1tion than ail the tariffs or dumping clauses ve can enact. The failure of one
crop, the non-sale of the rennant of that
crop, and the retention in our warehouses
of another year's supply affect employment
aIl along the line. I need not labour that
point before honourable members of the
Senate.
We are told that the enactment of higher
duties will result in putting many men to
work. In my humble judgment what is required to put men to work in this country
is the sale of our products. What is the
permanent value te the country of an expenditure of money and the raising of tariffs
to put to work men who are now working
only part time. or perhaps not at al], when
all that can be donc with the goods that
they manufacture is to pile them up in wareHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

houses? The purchasing power of the people
has been so affected that there is no demand
for the goods, and without a demand our
action can only result in loeking up capital
and postponing the evil day in the hope that
something will turn up to alleviate the situation.
I have discussed the present situation and
the proposed remedies with manufacturers
and others. While they feel that the higher
tariff may benefit them somewhat, the great
difliculty is that their salesmen come in and
report a lack of orders because the people
have not money to buy their goods. I want
to emphasize that point and to impress upon
the Government that if our represontatives
at the Economie Conference can come to
some agreement that will start a movement
of our wheat to the markets that it hitherto
found, and if the products of our mines and
fisheries and forests, through an interchange
of trade, can be started mov ing somewhere,
the greatest good to Canada will result.
Every producer will take heart, feeling that
what he produces will net be left on his
hands, but will b purchased by some person
at a reasonable price.
Under these circumstances I urge again
that from a national standpoint it is suicidal
to prevent our representatives from being
present at the first session of the Economic
Conference, ready to assume what I regard
as their greatest duty, and the greatest responsibilitv that they have.
The main objection that I have to this
Bill is that it brings about instability of the
tariff
A certain political party has been
accused time and again of tinkering with the
tariff, therebv creating a feeling of instabilitv.
I suggest that in giving one man the right
to fix Ihe duties on certain commodities wc
are making him too powerful, and that the
influence on trde of such action cannot be
beneficial.
I have always been a firn believer in a tariff, and have so stated. I aie
aise in favour of a dumping clause. I have
always nuaintained, however, that the peopie
of Canada, or of any otier country, although
more or less concerned about the degree ot
protection granted, are not concerned about
it as much as they are about knowing under
wrhat conditions they have to do business.
When Parliament makes tariffs the people
know for one year at least the conditions
under which they will have to do business.
Under this clause they will not know twontyfour heurs in advance what the conditions
nay be.

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930

Hon. Mr. POPE: If they are doing business with the United States they should
know. The President of the United States
can make changes in five minutes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is another reason why I do not like it. It is a
copy.
The first part of the Bill before us reads
as follows:
Section thirty-six of the Customs Act, chapter forty-two of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is repealed, and the following is
substituted therefor:"3ý6. (1) Such market value shall be the fair
market value of such goods in the usual and
ordinary commercial acceptation of the term,
and as sold in the ordinary course of trade,
such value in no case to be lower than the selling price thereof to jobbers or wholesalers
generally at the time and place of shipment
direct to Canada.
(2) Provided that the value for duty of new
or unused goods shall in no case be less than
the actual cost of production of similar goods
at date of shipment direct to Canada, plus a
reasonable advance for selling cost and profit,
and the Minister shall be the sole judge of
what shall constitute a reasonable advance in
the circumstances and his decision thereon shall
b final."
This does not even have to be confirmed
by Order in Council. The Minister's decision
shall be final. I submit, honourable gentlemen, that with the changed and ever-changing
conditions of trade too much power is put into
the hands of one man. For many years we
have had a Customs Board to which appeals
could be made in cases of dispute as to the
value of goods. Under this legislation there is
no appeal to anybody.
No one man, no
matter how great he may be, should have the
power practically to fix the tariff on goods
in which I or any other honourable gentlemen may be dealing. A .contract may be made
one day, and the next day the duty may be
changed without notice
Now let me refer to what was said by my
honourable friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr.
Pope). In the United States there is a Tariff
Commission, and all that it does is restricted
and protected by statute. If after investigation the Tariff Commission finds conditions
that it believes to bo inimical to the interests
of certain industries in the country, it is
directed to make recommendations to the
President, and te can then increase or decrease
the tariff on the articles affected, so long as
the increase or decrease does not exceed 50
per cent. But here, without any investigating
authority, without any Commission, without
any Customs Board, one Minister is to be
given the right to make decisions himself.
And to make matters worse, there can be no
appeal from his decisions.
13995-1I

What section
- Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
is my right honourable friend quoting?
My first
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
quotation was from section 1 of the present
Bill.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Before the right
honourable gentleman concludes his reference
to the powers of the United States Tariff
Commission I should like to ask him a question, taking it for granted that his statement
regarding the Commission's powers is correct.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
was quite general.

My statement

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is it not a fact
that the United States Tariff Commission bas
the power to go into countries from which
goods are imported and insist upon certain
manufacturing processes being carried out?
There was an instance last year of a small
establishment near Toronto, manufacturing an
article that was sold in considerable quantities
in Michigan. The United States Tariff Commission intervened and issued a direction that
this article had to be manufactured in a certain way, otherwise entry into the American
market would be prohibited; and it insisted
on the employment in the factory of inspectors, whose wages had to be paid by the
manufacturer. Surely those powers are far
greater than anything contemplated here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I never heard
of such a thing as that, but I do know that
United States investigators go abroad and try
to ascertain the cost of production of articles
which enter into competition with those produced in the United States. They have goie
through Ontario investigating the cost of production of milk, for instance, and they have
visited other countries too. But I cannot
imagine how they could impose restrictions
on a factory operating in Canada, although
they might say to a manufacturer, "If you do
not produce your goods in a certain way, wve
will not allow them into the United States."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is what they
did.
I did not
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
think the statute governing the Tariff Commission, as I remember it, gave them power
to do any such thing as that; but the statute
has probably been amended several times
since I read it. In any event, the workings
of the Tariff Commission in the States are
not entirely harmonious. Honourable gentlemen will remember that at the last session of

SENATE

Congress a strong effort was made, though in
vain, to curtail the powers of the President
and restrict the elasticity of the tariff.
I am alarmed mostly at the instability and
the confusion that I fea'r will follow the passing of this Bill. Last year, I think, we sold
to the United States goods to the value of
some 8500.000,000, and our imports from that
country amounted to about $900,000,000; but
we c-annot expect to export our produets and
import nothing.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does my right honourable friend not think we should manufacture more goods in this country?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That may be,
but we have to exchange some produets for
those of other countries, for Canada is not
sef-ustaining. There are some things which
we must of n'ecessity import from the United
States, regardless of what duty is imposed;
and, on the other hand, the United States are
compedlled to import certain things from us,
no matter how high their tariff is raised. We
must bea. in mind that if we wiish to maintain a condition of prosperity we cannot sell
everything and buy nothing; if we build the
tariff wall so high that no goods can be imported, our expert trade will soon die. Trade
is a variable thing. If you sell goods to a
person from whon you refuse to buy, yen wiil
soon find that ho will transfer his business
elsewhere; and the sanie thing ils true with
regard to nations. I have dreamed of a time
when there will be between the different parts
of the Briti-sh Empire a far more extensive
trade than now exists, and that it will be carried on, as far as is humanly possible, independently of the restrictions that we find it
necessary to apply when dealing with foreign
cointries.
J am told that automobile dealers and
manufacturers expeet to be taken care of by
means of the dumping clauso.
My own
opijnion is that this clause renders it unnecessary to make any changes in the tariff
schedules at alil.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This clause
gives the Minister and the Governor in
Council power to do alnost everything under
the sun, although it perhaps is considered a
fine gesture to provide for specific changes in
tîhe tariff schedule. As I say, I have been
told that automobile dealers and manufacturers expect to ho taken care of, under section 2
of the Bill, and new section 37 of the Act:
37. In determîining the fair market value
for duty of goods imported into Canada, the
Right Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

prices of which are published or listed by the
manufacturers or producers, or persons acting
on their behalf, the Governor in Council may
from time to time fix and determine a certain
rate of discount which may be applied to such
published or listed prices, and sucli published or
listed prices, subject to deduction of the
anount of discount according te such rate, shall
he deemed and taken to be the fair market
values of any such manufactures or productions
respectively as are specified in such Order in
Conocil.
The powers of the Governor in Council are
wide. If it be truc that manufacturers and
importers of automobiles have been assured
they will be benefited through this dumping
clause, then by means of this clause we shall
be doing something which we might not have
done so readily through a tariff schedule.
I should like to call the attention of honourable members to the fact that the automobile industry in Canada is divided into
different classes; in addition to the large
plants where cars are built, there are smaller
factories which make automobile parts and
accessories. May I impress upon the Government the necessity of boing careful, so that
in striving ýto please the large corporations
it does not put into their hands a club for
knocking smaller firms ont of business. I
know that automobile parts form a large
portion of the output of several manufacturing concerns in this country, and if the Government injures these concerns through the
granting of better conditions to the larger
corporations, net only will it run into difficulties, but it will cause a serions disruption
of business in a number of towns throughout
Canada.
May I now make a few observations with
regard to the iron and steel duties? Perhaps
these, because of their many ramifications,
are more important than any other items te
be found in the tariff scheduhle. Anyone who
imagines that it is an easy task to analyze
the situation and determine what ought or
ought net to be done for the iron and steel
indiistrieos, is greatly mistaken. I shall make
a brief reference to three large concerns,
which I iight call original manufacturers of
raw ore in this country.
Years ago, when the Dominion Iron and
Steel Company, of Nova Scotia, issued its
first prospectus, one of the reasons given for

considering the purchase of its stock a good
investrent was that the property was on the
Atlantic seacoast and favourably situate:I for
the carrving on of experts, as well as business
in Canada.
Later on it was found that
distance froin the large Canadian markets was
a disadavantage, and expert trade became absolutely essential. The company uses oeail from
its own mines-or from mines owned by the

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930

samne interests which control the campanyand importa its iran are by water from Newfoundland. Although the source of its raw
material is not in Canada, it is in the British
Empire, if that is of any benefit ta us in aur
present frarne of mind.
Thera there is the Algoma company. kraown
as the Lake Superiar Corporation, which owes
its existence ta the enthusiasm, of Mr. F. H.
Clergue, now of Montreal. 1 was a meirnber
of the Ontario Legislature at the time Mr.
Clergue startcd the company; and the Province granted some financial aid with a view
ta developing iran mines in Northern Ontario.
That campanv also found that its distance
frorn the Canadian market was a great
handicap, and after a while it xvas discovered

think-and, as far as I knaw, aIl the are

inquire why the company daes not export.
I can assure loy honourable friand framn
Edmonton (Han. Mr. Griesbach) that 1
appreciate lis statement that other barriers
besides a tariff may operate againat production. Here is a campany using United States
iran and coal and producing pig iran, which
as subj et ta a lawer duty in the United States
than in Canada; yet for some reasan a success
could not be made of exparting. I will ndmit
that the United States tariff was nat the cause
of the company's failure in that regard. On
the contrary, same other unfortunate conditions seerned always ta interxncne.
The~n there is the Steel Company of Canada at Hamilton, which, I think I arn safe in
saying, imports ail its raw materials, coal
and iran are, but is close ta bath its raw
materials and its market.
During the past year or two all three
companies, I believe, have been fairly prosperous; but honourable members will realize
the difficulties under which the Lake Superior
Corporation and the Dominion Iran and Steel
Companay aperate, principally on account of
the distance of the plants from the Canadian market. As honourable members know,
I was for a time Chairmaa of the Board
of Tarit! »Commissioners. One of the matters
that came before me, at the request of the

late Mr. Robb, then Finance Minister, was
an application by the Lake Superior Corporation and the Dominion Iron and Steel
Company, I think, for some incirease ina the
tariff. 1 started an investigation, and if any
main ever had a problerm on his hands, I had
one then. Ina the first place, these concerns
supplied the raw material for a number of
sccondary manufaoturers of iron and steel
products, who in turra furnished raw materials
for o>th-er con-cerns; and w.hile the original
manuSactusers were ainxious for increa,;ed
duties, a large nuýMber of the other campanies
concerned seriously objccted to any such

general increase in the tariff for the protctiun
of ail the companies, many of themn a.rgued, it
wauldc be unfair to give protection to, the
primary manufactu-re.r.
I confeas thait I arn unable to determise
how the variaus eompanies wil1 be affected
by the new tariff iracreases. 1 wiII nat say
that these increases have been made without
any investigation by the Department, because
an exarnination of saine of the items causes
me ta think that part of the evidence takera
bv the late Tariff Board has been studied.
That is probably what has happened, for ai
the cvidence taken by the Board would be
available ta the presont Ministcr of Finance.
As cvervbody knows, it is possible for people
of different opinions to draw opposite conclusioni £rom. the same set of facts. From. his
own standpoirat, the Miister is iprobably justified in the conclusions reached. 1 nîight not
have arrived at the same conclusions. Some
manufacturers of iron and steel praducts,
who abjected in the first place ta increases
being granted for the benefit of primary
manufacturers, are not sure now whether
the", are to be beneflted or hurt by the
new rates, and are busy with their pencils.
endeavouring to find out how they will be
affected. Others have written me that the
inereased duties wîll be highly beneficial. One'
manufacturer sa.id to me, "I do not see anytbing that will hurt me in thie schedule." 1
asked him, "Do you see anything that will
benefit you?" And he said, "No; I ar nmterested ina finding out if the increaâed. protection ta the primary manufaoturers is going to
result ina raising the price of my raw materials.
Ina one or two instances I amr a.fra.id it wiIl."?
I arn merely endjeavourirag ta point out the
difficulties that arise when we make changes
in the iran a.nd steel schedule. My horaourahle

a wish to give the Lancashire cotton mills
the benefit of the 331 per cent, why not do
it by naming them specifically?
Another point has been brought to my
attention, in connection with farm implements. The duty on thern has been raised.
I am not going to argue that, but I want
to point out the necessity of allowing the
small manufacturer as well as the larger one
to have a chance for a living. I am just
going to read a memorandum which has been
placed in my hands by a manufacturer:
The former general tariff on agricultural implements ranged from 6 per cent to 15 per cent;
the new rates are 25 per cent, but with the
exception of $1.2,5 per ton on pig iron and $3.50
per ton on hot rolled bars, they are still able
to import forgings, stampings, castings, under
item 442 at 6 per cent.

It is evident that the

just interests of the parts manufacturers in
Canada, supplying to the agricultural implement manufacturers, have been overlooked.
So the product that could be sold, and perhaps has been sold, for the manufacture of
implements by some manufacturing concerns
in smaller towns is protected at 6 per cent,
while the manufacturer of agricultural implements gets 25 per cent. I am calýling attention to this so that the Minister may make
a note of it and see the ramifications and,
above all, look well to it that the few large
concerns in the great centres are not given
all the benefits by the high tariff, while the
smaller concerns, which are to a large extent
the life of the smaller centres, are sacrificed.
I have talked too long, honourable gentlemen, but I could talk nuch longer if necessary-if it were on the Address, for example,
and we were trying to take a long time. I
have just gone roughly over some of the
points, and I want to impress it again on the
Minister of Labour that I pity him fron the
bottom of my heart.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Too bad.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He is going
to sit up nights and work Sundays, not to give
the people things, but to dodge the people
that are asking for things.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
the Minister's luck.

That is ever

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am glad he
has the protection of the Governor in Council,
who I think is giving full discretion to the
Minister. I want to impress on the Minister
the absolute necessity of our representatives
getting to the Economie Conference, and I
know that we in this House will expedite that
as far as humanly possible. Will the Minister do me the favour of saying that some

members of this House express the view that
the biggest job the Canadian Prime Minister
has is to see whether he can come'to some
business arrangement, with Great Britain or
other countries, whereby we can sell our goods
at a fair price and thus start the wheels of
industry of all kinds moving? If that could
be done, much of our unemployment would
disappear. Such an arrangement would do
more good to Canada as a whole than all the
tariffs we could enact, and all the dumping
clauses that could be put on the Statute Book.
Hon. RUFUS H. POPE: I am delighted
to think that my dear old friend is at last
converted to the system of protection, to
which he has been opposed for so many years.
Now he dodges and jumps and squirms
around, and makes us think of the angleworm trying to catch up to the frog. It is
wonderful. Poor old England, which was the
queen of the industrial world, is now getting
converted. Think of it: the great industrial
centre of the world, England, with factories
elosed and with millions of people ýdioled.
We are situated along the frontier of one
of the great centres of the world, the United
States of America. We all must know, if we
know anything at all, that the manufacturer
in the United States sells through the wholesaler, and the wholesaler through the retailer.
The wholesaler buys from the manufacturer
this year's goods, from patterns suitable
for this year. When he buys them he has a
contract that if those goods are sold to any
other wholesaler at a lower price than he has
paid for them, he will get the benefit of a
reduction. The same applies between the
retailer and the wholesaler. When the purchaser buys his goods for the year he buys
on that contract. Now, when the wholesaler
or the manufacturer, as the case may be, has
a few thousands or a few hundreds of thousands of yards left over of ahy kind of cloth,
what is he going to do with it? He cannot
sell it in the United States market without
giving the percentage of reduction that his
contract calls for. He had better take it
north and dump it. He says: "Where shall
I dump it? Let me dump it in the nearest
market. Where is the nearest market?"
Therefore he dumps it into Canada.
Under our present arrangement it comes for
appraisal.
Anybody who knows anything
about the business that J am talking about
knows that. Well, the owner looks around to
see if there are any of those great buyers
who are looking about to see where they can
buy stuff below its cost, and will buy that
stuff by the thousands of yards. We will

SENATE

say the goods should have cost $14 to manufacture.
Anybody who is in the business
knows what they cost. What do they value
then at? They value them at what Eaton
pays for them-probabily $7, $8, or $9. The
buyers come, and to the ruin and destruction
of ouc own industry they take away the living
of this country se far as if is obtained from
custoins duties. That is well known to everybody, and if we arc going to protect ourselves
against that, we must not only have a strong
tarif, but we nust have a dumping clause as
well.
Now, J have listened to my honourable
friend with regard to the dumping clause, and
I am free to admit ho knows more about that
than I do, because he has had experience that
i never had; but personally I can sec my way
clear to say that the Government of Canada,
or even a Minister, should have as much right
to protect us by a dumping clause as the
President of the United States has to protect
the people of that country. If the Government takes that power, then the Governrment
will try if for the next six months. I am glad
of it, and I hope it will bring about some
success by protection for the industries of the
Canadian people. That will be in the interest
of the consumer, the farmr--everybody.
Yoi cannot divide the people into producers
and consuimers. You cannot segregate some
of the citizens of this coîuntry and s:ay: "Thev
ira iarimbrs; ther do no want protection.">
oi cannot say that the labouring man does
not want protection.
E is asking for protection to-day, and we are voting $20,000,000
here to try to help protect bis life and the
lives of his children, and help him for the
next few months. I say that in all the industrial life, in all the agrieultural life, in all
the labour life of Canada, protection is
desired if we are te grow up to be the strong
nation that Nature intended us to be on the
northern half of this continent. I say, let us
intensify the protection, and let us sec what
the results will be.
The political party to which I belong
brought down in 1878 what is known as -the
National Policy. Afterwards, listening to the
party represented by honourable gentlemen on
the other side of the House, we weakened our
tariff and our position, we weakened Canada,
and out we went, and in they came. Laurier
was then the Prime Minister-and I knew him
well personally. Did ho lower 'the tariff which
ho had condemned? Thank God, ho did net
lower it, and it helped Canada through a
period of years. On every single occasion
when Canada bas been raised out of the dust
it has been donc by protection in one form
or another.
Hon. Mr. POPE.

Of course I was always opposed to this
British preference, and I am opposed te it
yet, because the products te which it applies
may not be made in Great Britain; they may
be made in Germany, or made in France, or
made in Italy, or anywhere else. I was over
in Britain, and went into an establishment
that was doing a great trade in umbrellas,
parasols and ladies' clothing, and I insisted
on seeing the works that this gentlenan had
been talking to nae about, and when I got
into his factory what did I find? Ten sewing
machines, and ten girls sewing.
The rest
of the work was al done on the continent of
Europe. You ask nae under those circumustances te accept a British preference? Not
at all. I do net think we owe England that
I think we owe England our support if she
is in trouble, but so far as commerce is concerned I have never known old England to
make a sacrifice for us, though I have known
Canada to make a sacrifice for her.
I believe in Canada as a unit in itself, independent of all the other nations of the
world. If you want coal and iron, go up to
Iuidson's Bay, where the iron is of good
quality and coal is to be found. Go to the
head of our railroad there and open up a
great agricultural implenent factory where the
coal and the ion will bc available.
The
people on the great prairies of the Northwest
will purehase your goods. The country has
been developed by the efforts of Liberal and
Conservative Governments, but the development was inaugurated by the Consercvative
Governmuent; as everything for the welfare
of the country has always been inaugurated
hy it and imitated by the party opposite.
You are imitators-not bad ones. Yeu imitated
the great Hudson Bay developnent, and there
is a great opportunity up there, inside the
Dominion of Canada, to bring together that
iron and that coal, and manufacture implemonts te be used on those great prairies, and
the transportation cost would be almost nil.
We have wonderful opportunities. Let us
net waver for one moment. Let us not
hesitate to give te the Canadian people all
the protection that great nations have, like
the successfîul one te the south of us. Let
us give such advantages te our people,
whether they be consumers, farmers, or
laborers, and we shall advance in the same
degree as the people te the south have advanced.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable members, like some others who have preceded me,
I am going to ask the indulgence of the
honourable the leader of the Government, and
of the members of this Chamber, to anticipate

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930
the legislation shortly to corne before us,
which is rieally a coroll-ary to this legisiation
in reference to, dumping.
The ramificati.ons of this legisiation are
so extensive
that no person whb has
flot
had
experiýenee
in
the
importing
business ean fulHy realize what it means.
In the first place, I would point out
that the tariff is a matter for experts. I may
say that for twenty-five years 1 have followed
the tariff very closely. I happened to be the
president of a wholesale eoncern that did a
business of haif a million dollars a year, and as
such had too rnany unhappy experiences with
the customns regulations and the tariff to be
entirely ignorant of the subject. 1 have made
trips to, the Old Country to, satiafy myseif of
certain conditions in order that I might be
lbetter pr.epared to corne hefore the Minister
of Custorns or his .deputy and show that from
timie to time the importera weTe penalized,
and that the consumers had- suifered i consequnce. In many cases I was suecessful.
More than fifteen years &go, wh.en Mr.
Pattersoýn was Minister of Customs, and Mr.
McDougald was his deputy, a question came
up in regard to the importation of wire netting, which was one of our main articles of
importation. I may say that in the course
of business we hardly ever had two successive
invoices without post entries being made, and
ahl sorts of teclinicalities being raised in regard to the rate of duty and dumping. I
remember one particular shipment that came,
and that the customns officials rcfused to pass.
1 came to Ottawa, and after sorne difficulty
sccured an interview with the Minister. I
was told that the Departrnent was not legislative, but administrative, and that changes
could flot be made by the Customns Departnient. I said that if they were necessary we
would have the matter taken up by our rnember and threshed out on the floor of the House.
My firm. was in a position Vo place $100,000
worth of wire netting. I had letters in rny
possession from aIl the wire netting manufacturers in Canada stating that they could
flot manufacture anything stronger than 16gauge netting, and that they did not galvanize
the netting after it was woven. At hast, after
two or three days of argument, the Department adrnitted that my contention was correct.
As a consequence we saved some
thousands of dollars on the shipment, and the
consumer got the benefit.
The fact is that the manufiactureis of this
country are exphoi'ti-ng the ûomnsumers.
The
tariff is full of anomalies. I will itake second
place to no man in this Chamber or in. the
House od Commons on tariff matters. I say

'that in ahl hurnility. I have made a study
of the tariff, and understand it perfeetly as
f ar as the items are concerned.
Wire netting is a commodity largely osed
in Prince E.dward Island, and a large amount
of money, probably over $500,000 a year, is
î-nvolved in its importation.
We have repeatedly asked the Canadian manufacturers
to instal galvanizing vats te galvanize the
netting after it is woven. The netting manufa-ctured ie Canada is galvauized by what
they caîl the ruýbbi-ng process, a powder process that teýkes place before it is woven. We
asked themn if they would put in gahvanizing
vats if they were assured of a certain amouint
of business. They said that they wouhd net;
that they would ýnot galvainize the netting
afte-r it was woven, and that they could furnish no'thing heavier than 16-gauge. Th.at is
only one amolng scores of exporienoes.
Another article not manufactured in Canada
is the power-driven bone-crusher. But because
there is a simple aifair that is used in kitchens
and cornes under the saine classification,
these bone-crushers are subject to a certain
duty. These are just a few instances of the
difficulties that we encoonter.
It has been said in another place that
assurances have been given by the manufacturers that the consumer will not suifer
by reason et the increased protection. In view
of the faet that not only in Canada, but the
werld ever, there is a tendeucy towards a
reduction cf prices, perhaps we can accept that
statement. The :manufaýcturers, who are well
looked after, can go so far without any
material disadvantage to themselves, but
1 know that in seme instances such an assurance has net been given and is not goin-g to
ibe given. But does not the consumer suifer
by reason of this added protection? But for
it hie would 'be able to get the necessîties of
life at a lower price, as consumers in other
countries are doing. This lower price condition is world wide; and the consumer in
this country is .bound to suifer by reason of
this -change in the tariff.
A matter that enters largely into the cost of
production is overhead. Overhead is, to use a
slang phrase, very easily "padded.' Is there
going te be any investigation into the details
of operating cost-salaries, automobiles, trucks
and things of that kind that go into the overhead of the manufacturers?
Overhead is
something that eaui very easily be expanded,
thus making profits look very reasonable
when, as a matter of fact, they are quite the
contrary.
The whohe tendency of this legisiation is,
Vo curtail sales, stifle enterprise, and make

or instability in the business of importation
nto this country. I should like to ask the
sonourable gentleman in charge of this Bill
f he can assure this House and the country
hat the importers, who constitute a subitantial body, will have a guarantee that the
lecision when given by this final arbiter,
who seems to be a Mussolini in tariff matters,
will be final? When an importer goes te a
port of entry and makes the three copies of
his entry, and pays the duty, and takes the
goods and sells them te the consumer at a
price based on his cost price plus duty, freight
and insurance, can he be certain that two
or thrce, or perhaps six months later, ho will
not be asked by the Customs Department at
Ottawa to make a post entry? That is somethein tIa happened under previous Governnients. and under the present Governient

my own firm, but on beialf of others.
1 see many difficulties ahcad, under the proposed -ystem. This tariff muddle is the biggest bungle ever made by any Government
in Canada. The tariff is net well balanced.
Already even the manufacturers are quarreing aiong themselves because they did not
understand that raw inaterials were to bear

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I do net think
it would be well to give it here, but I will
give it te my honourable friend.
The honourable gentleman from Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Pope) has spoken of the power of
the President of the United States in tariff
matters. It is truc that ho has the great
power that was attributed to him by the
honourable gentleman; but the Governor in
Council has a similar power, even though it
is said that it will not be exercised except in

extraordinary circumstances. I ask honourable gentlemen if the President of the United
States ever exercised his power overnight.
In the United States there is a Board which
reports' to the President before he takes
action, and in the course of ordinary procedure
ho cannot very well decide intelligently on
matters of that kind without giving them
some consideration.
This takes time. I
have a particular case in mind. In the Province of Prince Edward Island the seed potato
industry is an important one. Some question
was raised about so many potatoes going
from Canada into the United States, much
to the detriment of the tarmers there. What
did President Hoover do? He sent men to
Prince Edward Island, where they spent
weeks among the farmers, securing informatien as to the cost of labour, fertilizer, and
so on, in order te ascertain the cost of our
potatoes bagged and shipped to their own
country. When they had done that they made
their report to President Hoover, and ho
acted upon it. But that took months. The
result of that action is embodied in the
Hawley-Smoot tariff, from the effects of which
we are suffering.
President Hoover does not decide overnsight,
but we arc going to have a system wherebv

Canada is not a self-contained ceuntry. Why
should not oui consumers have the benefit of
goods from European and other countries?
We are not hurting Canadian manucîturers.
The wiole aim of this tariff is simply to prohibit importation of all kinds.
That brings up the important question of
where this country is going to get revenue, or,
in the alternative. of how much the people
of this country are going to have to pay
by reason of increased taxation. We know
that in the case of a few items the Governmnust will get an increased revenue by means
of the higher tariff, but there is no doubt that
the aggregate result will be a lessened revenue.
I think that must be admitted. Because of
the decline in foreign trade we already have
a declining revenue. I think this House and
this country would bu justified in asking the
intention of the Government in regard te
ievenue. Where is the revenue to come fron
to provide for the big expenditures that are

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There are

the new tariff will result in business instability,
btt I do net sec any ground for that concelusion. It may be that at the next session
of Parliament a number of amendments will be
required to tha new tariff; it may be that
some unforeseen conditions will develop and
necessitat' subsequent legislation. However,
that is a condition that would have to be
expected regardless of what changes were

The right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Hon. Mr. Graham) remarked that the
new legislation might benafit automobile

technical knowledge to enable me to controvert or support that statement. In any
event, it is contenplated, as his own argtment
shows, that there will be an increase in the
manufacture of motor cars in Canada. Reference was also made by my right honourable
friend to the Lake Superior Corporation and
Mr. F. H. Clergue. I was a resident of Toronto
and I remember attending a meeting of the
Board of Trade-it seems a century ago now,
on looking back-when Mr. Clergue was looked
upon as one of the most important men in
Canada. But he proved te be a dreamer. I
know that one of his propositions was hopelessly wrecked, and the Ontario Government,
if I remember correctly, had te lend assistance,
for the protection of the public. We are

ferred te the possibility of discovering valuable raw materials in parts of the country near
Churchill. I understand that discoveries of
iron and coal have been made up there, and I
believe it will be found that the power can be
dcveloped very cheaply in that part of the
country.
With reference to trade with Great Britain,
I take the Canadian attitude-and I have
always donc so, although I call myself an
Imperialist-and that is the attitude of the
icader of my party, the Prime Minister of
Canada. I believe that the primary duty of
our Government is te the people of this rountry. We should trade within the Empire, if
possible, and if that cannot be done our trade
shoild be along other legitimate channels. I
think we should be in a position to bargain
vith Great Britain, to be able to grant tariff
concessions with respect te some of its products, in return for the privileged entry of
eome of out goods into British markets. All
the other Dominions can, if they so desire,
Irade with Great Britain along the same lines,
by means of preferantial duties. As all honourabl members know, some things can be
manufactured more cheaply in the Old Country than in Canada. Of course, there are
some people in this country who believe the
chtaper that goods of any class can be boutght,
ie better, but I do net agree with that. I
am aitogethar opposed te dumping. I think

a parity of opportunity-not protection, as
such-for our people, so that we may develop
certain lines of manufacture for which we
have great natural advantages. With respect
to such manufactures, I believe it is a irise
policy for Canada to protect its markets as
far as possible. I have no apologies to make
for a protectionist doctrine of that kird.
Honourable
Hon. ROBERT FORKE:
senators, I crave the same indulgence accorded
to sema other speakers, that remarks made
concerning the present Bill will be considered
to apply to another Bill which will be introduced later. I should not speak at all at this
time were it not for the fact that I do not
want legislation of this kind te pass without
some protest on my part. I know very well
that the great majority of the people in the
province from which I come will fot favour
this legislation. I realize that I cannot give any
new arguments either against protection or for
frea trade or low tariffs; the whole question

SEPTEMBER 18, 1930

has been discussed ad infinitum, and when
tariff changes are made we can do nothing but
watch closely to sec what ha-ppens.
I honestly and conscientiously believe that
this legisiation will flot be in the interest of
the Dominion as a whole. I admit that the
argument for protection ig -plausible; in fact,
it is difficuit to combat. It. does flot matter
in what kind of business a person is engaged,
he wvil1 be deeply interestcd if offered protection for bis industry. Yet, every economic
authority of which 1 have heard agrees that
the principle of protection is economically unsound. Some bonourabie members may say,
" Ve are not interested in theories now; we
have to contend witb a practical situation."
But to my mind it is a fact rather than a
tbeory, that protection sucb as planned under
this legisiation is bad. In fact, it seems to
me that, as the Rigbt Hon. Arthur Meighen
said of some other proposai in another place,
this is protection gone mnad.
Subse-etion 1 of section 4,3 of tbe Act, as
amended, reads:
43. (1) If at any time it appears to the
,satisfaction of the Governor in Council on a
report fromn the Minister that goode of anY
kind are being iinported into Canada, either on
sale or on consignment, under such conditions
as prejudicially or injuriously to affect the interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers,
the Governor in Couneil may authorize the
Minister to fix the value for duty of any clas
or kind of such gonds, and notwithstanding
aay other provision of this Act, the value so,
fixed shall be deemed to be the fair market
value of suceh gonds.
There is no limit to the powers of tbe
Minister bere; if be so desired he could absolutely prohibit the importation of any class
of gonds, and I think that was admitted in
I am not saying that the
anorber place.
Minister would do that kind of thing, but
it certainly seems to be a tremendous power
to put into the bands of an individual for
the Minister will bave the real power, aitbotigb tbe Governor in Councîl grants the
necessary autbority.
It bas been said that this legisiation wil
benefit the producer. Will honourable ruerabers excuse me for making a personal reference? I have barns fuit of produce. Will
the Minister, by pratecting my goods, enable
me to seli them at a profit? I say that would
be absolutely impossible, for there is no legislatian that can be introduced here or in
another place that can prateet the matn wbo
bas ta seli bis goods in the markets of the
world.
We often bear' it asked, " Why not keep
our good money at home and encourage
Canadian production?" Well, 1 sbould like to
ask honourable members if they have seen

mucb Canadian money floating around in the
United States, where wve bought $90e,000
worth of gonds last year.
They do not
want our money over there, and the
gonds we purchase from them are paid for
by our goods-perbaps not directly, but
through the complicated economic system
which exists. If we pass legisiation which wiIl
make it impossible for us to buy the gonds
of other countries, I wonder how we are going to sel] our products abroad. If we sbip
gonds to Great Britain we must expect ta
import certain produets from that country. It
seems to me that every barrier pla.ced on
international trade resuits in making business

I recently read an article by the Hon.
Walter Runciman, in connection with the
attempt ta force protection upon the Oid
Country. He reinarked that protection seemed
ta be popular tbroughout the world to-day.

differences of opinion among honoura-ble
members on other matters, 1 think all wiil
agree that Canada bas made tremendous
strides forward in tbe last eigbt or nine years.
I tbink aur country was bound to advance
irrespective of wbat party was in power, but
it was a proud thing for me, and I think for

were not content; we wanted a change. The
difficulties and troubles we bave come tbrough
had notbing wbatevor ta do witb either higb

Some speaker mentioned the conditions in
England. I think the honourable leader of
the Govertiment was present at a recent meeting at which Mr. Lukin Jobnston deliveréd
an address on the problems existing in
England to-day. He said that across the
south of England, in a great many counties,
there was great prosperity; people were living

ta compete with. The distress was la the

whern unempînyment is very rampant at

I did not intnnd ta make a speech. I rose

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Only altered in
language, perhaps.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: No; I would say
that te "fix" a thing is more positive than
to "determine." The word "determine" would
mean that some consideration had been given
to it; "fix" would mean an arbitrary act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That may be my
honourable friend's interpretation.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: That is the general interpretation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It bas occurred
during recent years that almost all countries
in the world except Canada have been increasing tariffs and increasing protection to labour
and industry in their respective countries.
Canada has been travelling in the opposite
direction until a great many industries have
found themselves unable to carry on competition with goods imported from other lands
where living standards and wage standards
were a great distance below those in Canada.
Same honourable member a little while ago
referred te Japan. I know of an instance
where a certain large concern, I think a departmental store, imported some 6,000 dozens of a
certain article at a cost price quite below the
possible cost of production in Canada; yet
those goods were sold and are ,being sold today to the consumers of Canada in competition with the goods that are being manufactured in Canada, with the result that the
manufacturers are ibeing crowded to the wall.
and must of ne.cessity give up the ghost unless
they get relief. The consumer has not benefited. The Canadian manufacturer is wellnigh destroyed, and the foreign manufacturer,
with his labour costing probably one-third
that of the workman in 'Canada for similar
service, is getting the business. So the proposal is that the Governor in Council, when
the Minister of National Revenue finds such
conditions existing to the detriment of Canadian trade and Canadian workmen, shall have
the power to adjust the matter and fix the
value so that at least the competition will be
more nearly equal. I am sure that is a fair
explanation, in a few words, of the purpose of
this alteration.
With reference te tariffs generally, the
fact remains that tariffs have suddenly or
gradually been lowered in Canada, and I quite
agree that such changes as were made in the
post-war period were perhaps a mistake; but
there were causes for them which I think we
all appreciate. Inasmuch as the tendency has
been growing worse from the standpoint of
Canadian industry and Canadian employment,
it became a question of national interest
during the past few months, when the election

campaign took place.
The leader of the
present Government made positive declaratiens to the people of Canada as to what
lie would do if he were authorized by the
people of Canada to put his policies into
effect. Wisely or unwisely, the people of
Canada approved bis policy, and lie is proceeding without delay, and as rapidly as is
rcasonably possible, to implement those
promises, in the expectation and hope that
he is going to assist in reviving indiustry and
try to provide with employment thousands
of people who are now out of work. So there
are before this House proposals with respect
to amendments to the Customs Act for the
purpose of eliminating as far as possible un:.
fair competition, and proposals for the purpose
of encouraging industry to be more active
than it has been.
The Prime Minister has gone a step farther
and has launched upon a new idea, and is
giving it effect: he proposes to protect not
only the labourer, and the producer of natural
products, but aiso the Canadian workman,
and, last and most important of all, the Canadian consumer. He has obtained definite,
clear-cut written declarations from producers
that if they are given the opportunity to make
Canadian products, prices will net be advanced. It is a great experiment, the results
of which we cannot foretell until it has been
tried out.
Surely it is evident that something different
frem what has been the case during the past
year or more should be tried, because of the
continued depression, and reduced prices in
other countries of the world, which are dumping
their goods into Canada and thus constantly
decreasing the purchasing power of our people
through depriving them of employment. It
must be realized that the- purchasing power
of a nation depends upon the earning power
of the people. So it is proposed that the
people of Canada shall be given an opportunity
to increase their earning power by increased
employment, and that the consumer shall net
be exploited.
Those are the principles that lie behind the
legislation of this Bill and the Tariff Bill that
is yet to come; and I suggest that it is the
wish of the people of Canada, as expressed
by the electorate recently, that those policies
should be tried out and made effective. If
they do not bring about the cure that is
anticipated, then the Government itself must
assume responsibility and realize that it has
failed in its mission. I am convinced that
it will not fail. I am convinced that, given
the Canadian market, the Canadian manufacturer can supply the goods that the people
use in their everyday life, just as Canada

SENATE

excelled during the days of strife and struggle,
when she did ex'ceed almost any other country
on earth in manufacturing the goods that
were necessary for the world's use at that
time. In my humble opinion it will go a long
way toward easing the ýdifficulty under which
our agrarian fýriends in Western Canada now
suffer that they should be able to extend
their home market, and enlarge more and
more the production of the things that the
Canadian people will consume; because the
farther away your market is, the more costly
it is to transport the goods that you produce,
and it is the producer who must bear the
cost.
So this experiment, as subrmittel to the
people, is now submitted to Parliament, and
i believe that our honourable friends opposite
will at least let the Government try the experiment out, and if it does not succeed I
expect they will come and say to the Government, "We told you so." But the people of
Canada are not satisfieid with the situation as
it has existed, and are 'looking forward to a
change, and to the adoption of the policy of
the Prime 'Minister and a fulfilment of the
promises which he has made. Therefore the
Government of this day is launching upon a
courageous course which it believes will bring
greater happiness and prosperity to the
country at a time when they surely are sorely
needed.
lon. Mr. MITRDOCK: May I ask my honourable friend a question? I concede absolutely
that there is a great exhibition of courage
here, but as J rcad section 2 of this Bill I
notice that new section 37 says:
37. in deteriniing the fair market value for
dity of goods inported into Canada, the prices
of whieh are published or listed by the manufactureors or producers, or persons acting on
tiir belialf, the Governor in Council may from
tiie to time fix and determine a certain rate
of

discount

which

imîay be

applied

to such

rîuîblisled or listed prices, and such published
or listed priecs, subject to deduction of the
aiount of discount according to such rate, shal
he deemed and taken to be the fair market
valies of any such manufactures or productions
resicetively as are specified in such Order in
Coiuncil.
Is it the intention that the Governor in
Council, under that materially revisedl section,
shall or may ignore or annihilate the new
Tariff Bil! tiat we undenstand is coming to
this Parliament" In other words, in the case
of automobiles or any other commodities can
be detcrnmine on such a discoumt as would
make ineffective the inrcase that is now proposed in the new tariff? I should like to ask
my honourable friend whether that can be
donc.
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, J think we are departing somewhat
from the usual practice of this House on the
second reading of a Bill, and we have praetically gotten ourselves into the committee
stage without moving the House into Cornmittee. Therefore, if we follow this course,
we may not need to refer the Bill to the
Committee.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: An answer given now
might render unnecessary the committee stage.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. My honourable friend suggests that under section 2 of
the Bill it might be possible for the Government so to act that the protection afforded
by the tariff might be wholly eliminated.
There are several methods by which that
provision nay be administered, because it
may be a manufacturer or a producer that is
importing, or it may be a person acting on
his behalf. That simply means that the value
of goods shipped on consignncnt, and having
no owner in this country, nay be fixed in
anticipation of a change in conditions or
prices. If it is cxpected that prices are going
to rise, the Minister of Finance, through the
Mini.ster of National Revenue, may reconmend that action be taken under that clause
for the protection of the industry in Canada.
The section has no ulterior meaning and does
not materially change the existing legislation
except, perhaps, to extend the powers when
circurnstances
and unusual
tunpreceiented
warrant.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The original section
says, "If any difficulty arises." The one before
us dons not propose looking for difficulty, but
assumes the right to determine the rate of
discount in any case where the Governor in
Counocil desir1e. I am whole-heartedly in
sympathy with an honest-to-goodness measure
that will really prevent dumping; but in
this, if I read it correctly-and I hope I am
not too suspicousI see the opportunity for
the Government of the day to make friends
at will by setting a tariff rate on any conmuodity or any article, from time to time, as the
exigencies in their judgment seem to require.
If that is not permitted under the section I
certainly want to be put right.
If the law is
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
positive and gives to the Minister, or the
Governor in Council on the recommendation
of the Minister, the power to .determine, then
it must necessarily follow that difficulties will
not arise and that there will be no difficulty in determining the fair market value.
Apparently the question was open to dispute

-7
SEPTEMBER 18, 1930

in the past, and if difficulty arose certain
things would occur. The section as now proposed reads:
In determining the fair market value for duty
of goods imported into Canada, the prices of
which are published or listed by the manufacturers-and so on. I do not think there is anything
which justifies suspicion.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS:
The remarks that I
have to make should perhaps come at the
committee stage, but they will take only a
few minutes. The Minister of Labour has
said that under these laws proteetion is given
to the consumer against exploitation. From
that remark, though I did not suppose he
so intended it, it might be assumed that there
was such a provision in the B-ll now before
us.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is in the next
Bill.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: There is no such provision
in this Bill, and the provision in the Custons
Tariff is no protection against exploitation
under this Bill, but simply emphasizes the
necessity for including in this Bill a similar
provision.
The motion was agreed te,
was read the second time.

POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
' I have no
amendment to offer, and if no other member
of the Chamber has an amendment in viaw,
we can well dispense with the committee
stage.
I make this statement because my
honourable friends arournd me may not have
noticed that we were passing over the committee stage.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If nobodv on
this side of the House is anxious to discuss
the Bill in Committee, it is not necessary
to go into Committee.
Hon. E. D. SMITH:
Honourable members, I just wish to take this opportunity of
congratulating the Government on the prompt
and effective manner in which it responded
to the applications of the fruit growers.
Nearly four years ago the fruit growers
appeared before the Tariff Board. They were
heard no less than four times. No new
evidence was produced that affected the
result, but the decision was delayed from
year to year, at least three years longer than
was necessary. That indicates the difference
13995-7

between the action that may be taken under
the dumping clause, which is prompt, and the
action brought about by the Tariff Board.
At last, just before the election, the Tariff
Board recommended some very small additional protection to the fruit growers, which
was passed. But three years had elapsed, and
the fruit growers had lest thousands of dollars
by reason of the fact that our markets were
thrown open to the fruit produced on the
other side of the line at a time when there
was plenty of Canadian fruit to be put upon
the market. When the present Government
came into power it immediately applied a
remedy that was effective and prompt, as a
result of which the fruit growers procured
markets that had net been available for many
years. Immediately the duties were added, a
demand sprang up in the Western Provinces
for the fruit produced in the Niagara district,
and a great many carloads of that fruit were
sent forward within the next-two weeks. To
satisfy our Western friends, and to nail down
the lies that were spread abroad in some of
the towns in the West, to the effect that the
price had been advanced, I can say truthfully
and honestly and firmly that the price was net
advanced. On the other hand, it was gradually reduced. We had a very large crop, and
the selling price was fixed,'as it always is, by
the law of supply and demand. The price
was never advanced one cent so far as I know.
I have been engaged in the shipping of fruit
all my life, and ship now in large quantities,
and I know pretty well what all the shippers
are doing, because there is constant and severe
competition among them. The stories that the
price was advanced were no doubt circulated
by dealers who wanted to take advantage of
the opportunity to make a larger profit. The
shippers from the East never will advance the
price on account of the duty, if they have a
sufficient supply for the demand of the
country.
The effective result of what the Government
did shows the necessity of legislation to admit
of prompt action. We had a case last year
that illustrates this necessity. The duty on
grapes was 2 cents a pound. Some of the wine
manufacturers discovered that under the Act
they could bring in grape juice at an ad
valorem duty of about 27ý per cent, which
was equivalent to half a cent a pound on fresh
grapes. Before any action could be taken, the
concentrated
juice from California
was
brought in to an amount equivalent to 5,000
tons of grapes. The wine makers filled up their
receptacles, and this year are buying at a
very much reduced price, which I do not
believe would have been the case had it net
been that grape juice was brought in last fall.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

The reason why grapes should not be allowed to come in at such low rates is that
in California, within the past few years,
production has been increased to such an
extent that the Government, through the Land
Board, last year prohibited the growers from
allowing the surplus grapes to decay on the
vines, and by legislation forced them to sell
their crops in some form or other. This surplus was concentrated in grape juice, and
was sold wherever it could bc sold. This
vear the United States Government bas
changed its course, and instead of compelling the growers to sell their grapes it lias,
through the Land Board, bought thousands of
acres of grapes at $9 a ton, to be left on the
vines to rot, in order that the price may be
maintained. If the late Government had not
changed its policy just before the present
Government came into power, we should have
suffered by reason of the placing upon our
market of grapes that would otherwise have
been burned or destroyed. That would have
depressed the price of grapes in this country
to such an extent that it would not have been
profitable to grow them at all. So it seems
to me that the ability of the Governor in
Council to act promptly in an emergency is of
enormous importance, and I am very glad to
congratulate the Government and the fruit
growers upon the effective redress that they
have secured.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I move the third
reading of this Bill, but in case some honourable members should desire to make further
observations to-morrow I would suggest that
the third reading be postponed until then.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: As a matter of procedure, can there be a debate on the third

CUSTOMS ACT AMENDMENT

BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. G. D. R'OBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bill 3, an Act to amend the Customs Act.
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: Honourable senators, I had not intended to speak on the
Bills that we are dealing with at this time,
but I feel more or less compelled to offer
a few remarks after listening to some of
those that have been made here. The arguments that have been put forward here and
in another place on the subject of free trade
and protection are as old as the Laurentian
Hills that look upon the city of Ottawa. My
opinions have not been changed by anything
that has been said during tbis session, and
I do not expect that anything I say will
change the opinions of any honourable senators. The Right Hon. Walter Runciman,
who is well known here because -of his standing and his views, is one of the prominent
men who have been quoted with reference
to the advantages of free trade, but one
gentleman who seemed to bc overlooked was
the late Mr. Disraeli, who some time about
the middle of the last century stated that
protection was both dead and damned.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
emphatic.

That sounds

Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: That statement of
his is a matter of history. I should like to
draw the attention of honourable senators to
the protectionist aspect, especially in relation
to conditions now existing. Evidence of one
of the most surprising changes that have
taken place in modern times in regard to
fiscal matters was given at a session of the
Trades Union Congress in London.
The
following statement appears in an article in
the Saturday Evening Post:
For years the Trades Union Congress-it
corresponds to the American Federation of
Labour and is both backbone and cash register
of the Labour Party-stood unalterably for the
Cobden idea of free trade and especially free
food imports. In June the economic committee
of the general council of the congress formulated a series of resolutions in connection with
the meeting of the Imperial Conference. Much

SEPTEMBER 19, 1930
to the dismay of the Labour Party and to the
joy of the empire free trade protectionists, it
declared flat-footedly for the new deal. Among
other things, the committee made the following
pronouncement:
"The maintenance of close relations with the
rest of the world does not prevent us from urging the creation of machinery and, if necessary,
formal agreements with the dominions for
further development of intercommonwealth trade
and for the best possible distribution of economie
activities within the British commonwealth."
Still more revolutionary, in the light of past
Trades Union Congress history, was this clause:
"Every nation and in practice, if not in
theory, every party bas long since abandoned
the notion of complete freedom of trade. In
almost every aspect of economie life, regulation
and conscious control of economie factors and
forces is the accepted policy. It may or may
not be desirable to hold up world-wide freedom
of trade as an ultimate ideal, but it is not,
and cannot bc, a working aim in the immediate
situation in the world to-day."
The second milepost in the movement for
empire free trade was set up in the report of
the British Preparatory Commiittee for the Imperial Conference. The committee was recruited
from the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce, the Federation of British Industries,
and the Chamber of Shipping of the United
Kingdom, and thus represented the organized
commerce, industry and shipping of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland. Its findings were
summed up in a sentence which concluded,
"that the most urgent necessity exists for increasing to the utmost the trade of the empire."
This was based on the following more detailed
statement:
"When it is realized that the British Emiire
bas an area of 14,000,000 square miles of territory, occupied by 451,000,000 people, with vast
supplies of the food and raw materials required
by man and industry, it is clearly essential that,
in order to take the fullest advantage of those
great resources, some simple, coherent and universally accepted trade policy should be established.
"Such a policy must in the nature of things
be designed and developed by people with expert knowledge of the trades and problems involved, and must have stability and continuity
in order to maintain that confidence and security which is a vital condition to any form
of trade.
"That the British Empire should operate as
an economie unit bas long been an ideal towards
which many efforts have been made. That these
efforts have not so far been fully successful is
due fundamentally to the lack of proper machinery for the consideration of the many problems
that arise, and for enabling proper and suitable
action to be taken following the conclusions
arrived at."
Perhaps even more significant than those
two declarations was a manifesto issued as a
result of a meeting of bankers and industrial
leaders held at Hambros Bank, one of the
greatest of Britain's international financial
concerns. It was resolved:
That urgent measures for the promotion of
inter-imperial trade are needed to secure and
13995-7

extend the market for British products both
at home and through the export trade.
Bitter experience bas taught Great Britain
that the hopes expressed four years ago in a
plea for the removal of the restrictions upon
European trade have failed to be realized. The
restrictions have been materially increased, and
the sale of surplus foreign productsMark the word "foreign."
-in the British market has steadily grown.
While we retain the hope of an ultimate
extension of the area of free trade throughout
the world, we believe that the immediate step
for securing and extending the market for
British goods lies in reciprocal trade agreements between the nations constituting the
British Empire.
As a condition of securing these agreements,
Great Britain must retain ber open market
for all empire products, while being prepared
to impose duties on all imports from all other
countries.
What reinforced the historie importance of
this declaration was the list of signatories.
Hoading it was Walter- Whigham, director of
the Bank of England. Even more epoch making
was the inclusion of Reginald MeKenna,
Britain's foremost banker, chairman of the allpowerful Midland Bank, a giant among the big
five joint stock banks and a banking world
all its own. MeKenna bas been for years a
die-hard Liberal and therefore an uncompromising free trader. His alliance with this group

Honourable members, I ask you to consider
not only the arguments that were so ably
presented yesterday on behalf of frec trade,
but also the other side of the question. What
do we see even in to-day's paper? There was
held in London a meeting to which were
invited the principal citizens, including many
of the best known industrialists and financiers
of England. The purpose of the meeting was
to replace out-of-date party economie 'theories
with practical common sense. I commend that
to honourable senators.
Mention has been made of the times of
Cobden. Certainly Cobden's thought on trade
was all right for the age in which he lived.
It was based on the theory that each nation

produced the different kinds of goods that
it was best able to produce, and that there
would be a fair and honourable exchange

SENATE

of goods between nations. It is not necessary
for me to say that such a scheme as his
would be entirely out of place and impossible
of realization in this day of mass production.
What has happened? High tariff walls have
been erected in every country of the world
with the exception of Canada. Sone people
in Canada claim that this country should be
given credit fLor the fact that our tariff walls
have been lowered instead of being made
higher. Competition, rather than Cobden's
theory of co-operation, is the order of the
day. Great Britain turns out to-day practically the same kinds of articles as are
turned out by France, Germany and other
countries. Ship-building, the manufacture of
steel and cotton, and other industries are
flourishing as greatly in those foreign countries as they are in Great Britain. At one
time Great Britain built ships and manufacturcd goods, and then loaded the ships with
those goods and sent them out to be sold
in foreign lands. Even the ships were sold.
This gave employment to the people of
Great Britain.
Then Britain would lend
money to the countries who had bought ber
ships and products, in order that they might
rcimburse ber for the money she had expended in manufacture and trade. But a
great change bas cone over the world since
the days of Cobden.
I admit that Canada has net followed a
full free trade policy, and perhaps this bas
been to the benefit of Canada. That it is a
fact is not due to the people in this country
who can see ýonly one side of the question
and who think that an era of prosperity can
be ushered in when our doors are opened to
goods that can be manufactured more cheaply
elsewhere by underpaid labour and under less
favourable living conditions than prevail in
this country.
lonourable gentlemen, let us try out the
plan that bas now been suggested te us,
which will give us some measure of adequate
protection. The Government bas submitted
proposals whicb it thinks are in the best
interest of Canada. I think you will agree
with me that if we have ever had a courageous
Government we have one at the present time.
I feel sure that the Government bas it in
mind to protect not only the industries, but
also the farmers, who are the backbone of this
country. The East is affected by any depression that may take place in the West. The
interests of our farmers in the eastern provinces are akin to those of our western farmers.
I would suggest to our Government that some
form of subsidy might be granted to Britishlion.

Mr. WEBSTER.

owned steamers carrying grain fron our shores
to Great Britain or elsewhere, and that those
same steamers could be economically and profitably employed in carrying British anthracite coal to the Dominion of Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Steam coal?

Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Yes. That coal
would net come into conflict with our Canadian mines. I am sure that Lord Melchett and
other great British leaders would be only too
glad to meet our Ministers at the Imperial
Conference in London, and I am satisfied that
some such plan can be worked out to the
advantage of Canada.
I am pleased to know that our labouring
people have .not been forgotten and tht
provision is made for them in the Bills that we
are passing. I know that work and not charity
will be the Government's object. I am not
afraid of the spending of $20,000,000 for the
purpose intended in the Bill now before us.
Indeld, I should be quite in favour f that
amount being increased if an increase were
deemed necessary in order to stop unenployment in this country and to maintain Canada's
industrial and farming position in the world.
We do not want in this country a repetition
of the problen of unemployment as it prevails
in England, where to-day there are about
2,000,000 idle people-the largest number since
1922; and if the present policies in England
are continued, the number may reach 2,500,000.
Idleness bas cost Great Britain the enormous
sum of over $3,000,000,000, including the cost
of administering relief. More than 200,000
miners are to-day out of jobs in the mining
district of Great Britain, and they will he without employment for the rest of their liv
unless some other work is found for, them.
It is not necessary here to enter into a discussion of the causes for these conditions, or
to discuss further the amount that is being
paid in Great Britain to-day for doles to the
unemployed. May I say that taxes are going
up, and must continue to go up by reason of
these conditions in the homeland. I know
from personal experience and from the experincee of companies with which I am associated
îlat money is being sent from Great Britain
and elsewhere, because investors are not
satisfied with present conditions in the Old
Country, nor do they think the future offers
any promise.
Idleness will always breed more idleness.
Some years ago it was suggested that we subsidize work rather than idleness, and that is
what I understand our 'Government in Canada purposes doing. With work, whether

SEPTEMBER 19, 1930
subsidized or net, every section in Canada
should prosper; the farmers, the industries,
the railways, the banks and ahl shouhd be
more prosperous than they have been. Let
us hope that capital, labour and brains may
together work out this seriaus problem, which
I feel is only temporary. There need he no
fear for the future of Canada if good-will is
shown in ahl parts of aur Dominion.
Honourable
Hon. -GEORGE GORDON:
members, yesterday in the course of lis remarks the rîght honourable member for
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) suggested that awing to the tariff structure being
so complicatcd, great. study should be given
to it, before any change of consequence was
made. I agrce with that in the main, but
many items in the tariff are quite simple, and
after the promises which the Govcrnment
gave, and the mandate it obtained, it would
be unworthy of us ta leave such tariff items
any longer in their present position.
My honourable friend from Brandon (Hon.
Mr. Forke) intensified my impression, which

Hon. Mr. FORKE: It would -have cost a

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I think we should immediately make tariff adjustments to put aur
people in a fair position ta cempete with
those &f the United States and all ather
countries. I find that we spent hast year
approximatcly $80,000,000 on the import of
goods stich as are produced by our farmers
and fruit growers. For example, we imported.

round figures the values of goods brought
into this country front the United States in
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1930, in competition with goods produced by our farmers
and fruit growers. The figures are: Fresh
fruits, $7,399,000; canned and preserved fruits,
$1.586.000; fresh vegetables, $11,006,000; grain
and its products-I want my honourable friend
from Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke) to notice
this-$23,673,000; hops, $2,802,000; seedsmost of which, I presume, were clover seeds,
which can be successfully grown in Canada$5,061,000; meats, $7,599,000; milk and its

$156,000; eggs, $1,229,000; sausage casings,
$1,547,000; a total of $78,592,000.
Every
dollar's worth of those goods could have been
produced right in our nv country, and our
money would have been spent at home; and
that is what would have happened if our
duties had been as high as those imposed by
the United States.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I am sorry to have
to disagree with my honourable friend in
regard to vegetables. Vegetables are a very
important article of food, yet we ýcannot grow
them in the months of December, January
and February; therefore we are bound to
import a certain quantity.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: There are times of
the year when -perhaps it is necessary to import
some goods in these classes, but the bulk of
the goods do not come in during our unproductive season. I think that strawberries and
fruits of that kind are a rich man's food in the
winter-time, when we have to import them.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Just as well as potatoes. I cannot understand how anyone who
becomes a member of either House of Parliament can sit idly by while our farmers and
fruit growers are being subjected to such unfair
competition as they have had in the past few
years. I think that when the other tariff Bill
cornes to us we shall find that the duties on
some of the articles which I have mentioned
are to be raised, and I hope that in the near
future every item I have mentioned will be
protected by higher duties.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, a good deal of freedom of discussion
has been allowed t honourable members who
have taken part in the debate on the two
Bills which have been brought down for the
relief of unemployment. I think the Government has a mandate fron the people to
attempt a solution of the unemployment by
granting relief, such as is provided in the first
Bill we passed, and also iN making increases in
the tariff. The policy of the Govecrnent was.
I think, made quite clear during the recent
election campaign; but I fear that many
people who voted for the Government had no
idea that it would go to such extremes as
are indicated in the tariff increases, and overlook sections of the country that are badly
handicapped and probably in a more depressed
condition to-day than for many years. I do
nt
want to discuss this legislation fronm a.
sectional standpoint; on the contrary, I should
like to impress upon honourable members the
importance of keeping a national outlook and
avoiding the kind of friction and dissension
that existed in certain sections a few years
ago and has now almost, if not entirely,
disappearcd. I cannot help feeling that seeds
of disconent, which nay interfere with the
harmonionus unity of Canada in years to come,
are being sown in consequence of the extreme
measures that the Government has taken. I
have no intention of preaching or encouraging
that feeling in the section of the country
frnm which I com, because I helieve that
as a Canadian I should sprcad the doctrine
ni national unity; but it is iny duty, as a
representative of the Western Provinces, to
warn this honourable body of the sentiment
which I feel will develop in the West as a
result of this legislation.
I think we can correctly say that up to
this year Canada was in a prosperous condition; that our industries, as a whole, were
thriving. Consider the agricultural implements
industry. for exaiple. Until this year it was
in a hcalthy state, employing labour freely,
and itsk stocks were increasing in value, because

SEPTEMBER 19, 1930
the classes to which it ratered were in a
position to buy implements. If that industry
is crippled to-day, it is because the purchasing
power of the agricultural classes has been
greatly weakened. I do flot think the agricultural implemenits industry will be greatly
benefited by tarif! increases. What is needed
to put that industryv back into its formerly
prosperous condition is a restoration of the
purchasing power of those classes of our people
who need implernents. The farmners will not
be able to spend freely until there is an increase in the prices of their produets, and
there is flot a very good prospect for such
increases this year nor probably for some years
to corne. It seerns to me that it is a mistake
to flaunt increases in the agrîcultural impIements tarif! in the faces of farmers of the
West who are receiving- extrernely low prices
for their products, and who probably will
undergo greater hardships this winter than
they have experienced in many years. I arn
afraid those farmers will interpret the new
tariff as indicating that the Governmnent has
no syrnpathy with them at the present time.
We are told that manufacturers who are
to -reccive the benefits of higher protection
will not inerease the prîces of their products.
But our experiences in the West have been
such that we cannot place much hope in
promises of that kind. It rnay he that prices
will not go up irnmediately, but they are
bound to risc later on. During the years that
I have been corning to Ottawa and travelling
through other parts of Eastern Canada, I
have found that the invariable question in
the spring is, "What are the crop prospects
in Western Canada?" Businessmen, bankers
and railroad officials are keenly interested in
the state cof agriculture in the West, because
they know that the succea of industry as a
whole in Canada depcnds largely on the
success of Western crops. I am flot and neyer
have heen an advocate of absolute free trade
for Canada; I always have felt that industry
in the eastern part of this country necded a
certain arnount of protection, and for that
reason I have atternpted to take a middleof-the-road course. As I have already stated,
my thought has been that what we need
above everything else in this country is a
strong national sentiment, so, that different
sections will understand the needs of, and cooperate with, one another. It is on that
account that I so deeply regret the bringing
down of measures that are likely to resuît
in increasing discontent in some parts of the
West, and in reintroducing discord and
agitation.

The Government has said that its poliey is
a Canada First policy, framed with the object
of relieving unemployment and assisting industry ail over the Dominion. But that
policy, as expressed in the tarif!, will flot
benefit industry in Western Canada. Why
is it that the coal industry, which is highly
important in Alberta and British Columbia,
is flot granted sorne relief under the tarif!,
with a view of giving employrnent to tens
of thousands of miners who are out of work
because there is no market for the produets
of the mines? If the consurners of the West
-are to be forced to purchase the produets
of textile industries of the East, why not force
the people of the Est to use Western coal?
0f course, I admit it would be ridiculous
to use the tarif! as a means of cornpelling
people in Eastern Canada to use coal mincd
in Alberta and British Columbia, but that
would be se reasonable as the compulsion that
is being applied to consumers of textiles and
othier produets. And what consideration has
bee.n given to the men who are raising sheep
throughout the length and breadth of Canada? Is any effort being made to force the
woollen industries to use the wool from Canadian sheep? If so, I have not noticed it.
In confining its measures of relief to, certain industries and sections of the country,
the Government is encouraging the feeling that
It has a sectional rather than a national outlook. I feel that the Government should
have done cvcrything possible to increase
unity and harmony in this country. I amn not
an advocate of the extreme views of Western
Canada, neither arn I in syrnpathy with the
extrema views of Eastern Canada. I like to
take, as I have already said, a middle-of-theroad course, which I believe will be in accord
with the views of lail faîr-mînded people in
every section of our country.

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: I merely want to
register a protest, because people who have
examined the tarif! schedule tell me that it will
be of very littie help to the steel and coal
rndustry of Nova Scotia. I understand that
the duty on iron is to, be 50 cents a ton.
What is the use of that, when iron can be
manufactured in Belgium and Gerrnany $6 and

$7 a ton cheaper than in Nova Scotia?
have in mind. what happened to the British
Empire Steel Corporation, in which. so much
money was sunk, and which has been superseded by the Dominion Coal and Steel Company. I suppose that the original stockholders
-1 arn sorry to say I was one of them-will
flot get any more than eighit or nine cents on
the dollar for the rnoney they put in. I do

SENATE
not know whether honourable members realize
that some six or seven years ago the huge sum
of $127,000,000 was invested in that enterprise,
and that no interest or dividend has been
paid. If the interest were computed at but
a moderate rate, it would amount to a large
sum. But no tariff changes have been made
with a view to improving that situation, and
I am surprised that honourable members from
Nova Scotia on both sides of this House have
not risen in protest. I am net speaking in
my own interest now, because my investment,
in common with that of other honourable
members, bas been practically wiped out.
When I saw money being voted for bars,
and for this and for that, I thought surely the
Dominion Coal and Steel Company would
get something out of it. It may interest the
House to know that this conmpany some few
years ago, for the purpose of filling an order,
actually imported bars from Belgium, and
paid the duty on theni. because thre cost of
importing them was less than it would have
cost the company to manufacture. Under the
Laurier regime that institution was protected.
Hon. W. S. Fielding, Minister of Finance,
who knew · he conditions, gave bounties on
t
manufactures of iron and steel and so on.
When Sir Robert Borden came into power,
he, the great apostle of protection, let those
bounties drop, and the bottom went out of
the whole business. Then the war came, and
the company, like every other iron industry,
at that time made some money. It could
not do otherwise.
The bounties I have mentioned never cost
the country one cent. I have before me the
statement made by Mr. Fielding in the House
of Couinons, iliat during the time when
bounties were paid, the customs tduties, because of
ci-ced prosperity-, amounted to
$16,000,000. The bounties amountnd to some
$13,000,000 odd; so the Government actually
made a profit.
What was the result of these bouînties?
Iron and steel products to the value of
$500,000,000 were manufactured, half of the
cost of which was distributed in wages, and
Canada got $30 for cvery dollar paid in
bounties. If that was net a good inivestment,
I should like to hear of a better one.
Hon. Mr. M(-MEANS:
What is the authority the honourable gentleiian is reading
fron?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am referring to
Hansard of the Senate. So it is open to the
honourable gentleman to read it for himself.
As I say, I an surprised that no honourable gentleman from Nova Scotia has protested. During the year 1928 the company
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

was in the hands of the receiver. After operating at 97 per cent of its capacity, there was
net a single dollar for the shareholders; just
enough was made for maintenance, repairs
and wages. Now, this company, which next
to the Canadian Pacifie Railway is the biggest
in Canada, is getting no help from this tariff.
I protest against that.

benefiting by this tariff. Why should it benefit when every ton of coal that it uies ls
imported[ from the United States?
Why
should our moneyr go to pay wages in that
country instead of in Canada? That company
imports the ore from the Mesaba Range on
Lake Superior. Again the money goes to pay
the wages of men on the other side of the
line. Even the limestone used for the flux was
inportedti until a couple of years ago. I understand that now a farn hias ben bought ornewhere in this country and that son Cai.adian

ter. If honourable gentlemen read this article
to whieh I have referred they will come to the
conclusion that there is only one solution for
our troubles. I have advocated it in the House
over and over again, and some honourable
gentlemen have called me an Imperialist.
Well let them. I may not live long enough
to see it, but I dream nof the day when there
will be a truly Imperial Parliament, sitting
somewhere in the British Empire, for the purpose of dealing with international affairs. It
will not be like the Imperial Conference, which
bas no authority. When the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Justice came back from
the Conference of 1926 we were told that we
had a Magna Charta, that everything was
changed, that we were an independent state
on a parity with England, and could declare
war if we wished. About that time it was my
good fortune to meet at luncheon in Montreal
Mr. Bruce, then Prime Minister of Australia.
I asked him if there was any change in the
constitution. He said: "None whatever. We
are jlust as we were before. Anybody who
aitends those conferences carries away just
what suits him." So the meetings of the Imperial Conference are just about as useful
as the meetings of the League of Nations.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

par. What would you think of a court without a sheriff. or of a sheriff without police?
If we were to adopt the principles of the
League of Nations, we should withdraw the
police from the streets of the city of Montreal
and trust to everybody's good faith. I do not
believe that the world is good enough for
that yet. If you want to read about the
Lerague of Nations you can go to the Library
and get the work of l'Abbé Saint-Pierre. There
air sixteen volumes of it. I think the honourable gentleman from Montarville has it
now. The Right Hon. Charles J. Doherty

bas not even the virtue of being new. The
Chinese had a League of Nations 2,800 years
before Christ. There is nothing new about
the League; it is very stale. But when people
have nothing to do they must invent something to do.

Now, $20,000,000 is going to be voted to

are 200,000 unemployed, that amount would

will not go far on that. And, mind you,
that is on the supposition that the money all
goes into wages. But there bas to be some
material to work with, and the cost of it will
be probably 50 per cent of the total. So the
Government, in its generosity, is giving the
grand sum of $50 a head to the unemployed.

in political party discussion here. I think
every member of this House will agree with
me that this is not the place for such discussions, and certainly this moment is not the
time for it. On this side of the House-and
I think the same thing may be said of the
Opposition side in another place-the measures
of government have been dealt with on their
own merits. So far as I have been able to
follow proceedings, there have not been in
the other House any discussions from the
party point of view. Certainly there have
been none here. I think my honourable
friend bas made a mistake. I hope he will
pardon me for saying so, but I am doing this
in the very best spirit, and I think he will
agree with me when he considers the matter.
I refer to it not with the intention of finding
Tault, or for any purpose of that kind, but
only because I think it the duty of some of
us, whether on this side or the other, to
protest against any discussion along party lines
in this Chamber. Nothing will be gained by
it. If some honourable member on this side
of the House should be provoked into replying
to my honourable friend, what might be the
-result? For one thing, it might delay the passing of legislation and thereby prevent what
we all are striving to 'facilitate, the attendance
of the Prime Minister and his colleagues at the
Imperial and Economic Conferences. My honourable friend and I are now and always
have been good friends, and I hope he will
not think badly of me for what I have said.
I have protested at this time, and on previous
occasions when I considered it necessary, because I feel that those of us who have been
members of this Chamber for many years
should endeavour to make it clear that political discussions are out of place here. That
is the rule, and I can say I have always tried
strictly to observe it.

for more than eight years, and I sat in
Council with my colleagues. If the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) desires to give credit to the Conservative party, -on the ground that it bas
lived up to its principles, may I remind him
that the Liberal party has always been truc
to a policy that tended towards a reduction
in customs duties? I say "reduction," because
that party has never advocated free trade. It
has tried, rather, to keep the tariff at certain
levels which would encourage freer trade than
is possible under high protection. How can
my honourable friend impute insincerity to
a Liberal Government that lived up to the
principles proclaimed at the convention of the
Liberal party in 1919? The late Government
during its nine years in office was largely
succes.sful, by the putting into force of Liberal
principles, in its attempt to increase the prosperity of this country. Up to September, 1929,
our industries were flourishing, as is well
known to my honourable friend, who is deeply
interested in many industrial concerns and
keeps his eye on the stock market. I would
remind him that during the last five years
certain industries were so prosperous that their
stock was quoted at a figure that would yield
a return of hardly 3 per cent, although at
par the rate would be 6 per cent or more. It
was the very prosperity of industry in general
that brought about the extraordinary incentive
to speculation, and the good times that prevailed wcre refiected on the stock exchange in
all classes of stocks-in cotton as well as other
stocks. The large profits, dividends and reserves of those years all indicated that the
then Government had successfully co-operated
in the development of trade, not only domestic,
but foreign as well.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If I am permitted,
perhaps I should plead guilty to a certain
extent-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall not repeat what I said on the Address, but perhaps
I may refer briefly te the remarks I made at
that time. I pointed te the state of the country
when the late Government came into power
in 1921, and to its accomplishments during its
term of ofefie, and I asserted that if the
election had been held in the summer of
1929, before the word-wi.de depression had
extended to this country, that Govermment
would have been returned.
Honourable
members on hoth sides of the House have
admitted that unemployment and reduced
business in Canada have resulted from an
international situation, over which we had
no contmol. What justification, then, can my
honourable friend, or anyone else, have for
saying that the late Government deliberately

costs.

Two dollars and

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -at least, for expressing myself with a certain .degree of heat;
but perhaps I might offer by way of excuse
the example of my honourable friend from
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan), who opened
the door pretty wide.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: I am net eager
to enter into this discussion, which seems to
be closing somewhat strenuously, but I should
like to say that I do not think it is quite
proper to accuse others of insincerity. I represented the late Government in this Chamber

sacrificed the interests of the country for the
sake of remaining in office? May I remind
my honourable friend th'at the late Government could have remained in power for practically a year and a haif longer, had it so
desired, but it dissolved Parliament and appealed to the people. The Government conscientiously believed that it had done the

back upon that Government's record during
the last eight or nine years, I only hope that
the present Government will be able to show
similar results after four years.
My honourable friend from Montarville
(lon. Mr. Beaubien) has perhaps not been
in attendance during these last .days. We

consiîderation '%Bill for increasing custons
dut'es, and although honourable members on
this side have expressed their objection to
the principle, :they will not oppose that Bill,
because it is their desire not to thwart the
apparent decision of the electorate. This is
surely the first time in Canada that a tariff
experiment has been made along such lnes.
The duties are bcing raised from 25 to 150
per cent higher than those now existing, and
the Government contends that the cost of
goods to the consumers will not be increased,
because marnufacturers have made a promise
to that effect. I know of Conservatives who
have said, "We are taking a big risk, but we
shall see what comes of it." I fear that even
if the manufaicturers are sincere, conditions
will arise within a few months, or certainly
within a year or two, which will prevent them
from keeping their promise. It goes without
saying that if there is any appreciable increase in the cost of raw materials the consumer will bear the cost. And if there is no
competition to keep the prices of manufactured articles within reasonable limits in this

slightest pretext will be seized upon for the
purpose of increasing profits.
Some years ago I was privileged to meet a
number of important men of the financial
world under the roof of the late Mr. Roosevelt, at Oyster Bay. There was also present

-from the British Parliament. The question

versation, an American gentleman stated that
he sat as director on the boards of many industrial companies, and he felt somewhat
uneasy because most of those companies could
sell goods to the people of the United States

higher--than could be obtained in foreign
markets. That was the. result of proteetion,
and he seemed to doubt that the people of
his own country were getting a fair deal. I
had already heard similar expressions of
opinion frorn other sources. Well, the present
Government has assumed the risk of raising
a high tariff wall and trusting to the assurances of manufacturers. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and we on this
side of the louse shall wait and watch,
hoping fervently that this country will not be
injuriously affected by the new tariff policy.
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
senators, I wish to make a few remarks by
way of closing the debate. I am indebted to
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) for the generous feelings that
he has expressed towards the new administration, which is attempting to improve conditions for our own people. The debate on
the motion for the third reading of this Bill
has brought forth a number of interesting
and useful opinions. Certainly no one can
say there is any stifling of free speech in the
Senate of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that the
attitude of my honourable friend opposite is
a wise one. Well do I remember that the
right honourable the ex-Prime Minister, when
he became the head of 'Government in 1922,
urged, and indeed pleaded with, Parliament
net te criticise hastily the new administration. I remember that during the session of
1922 the Opposition purposely refrained from
criticism; and in 1923 the then Prime Minister, having been in office more than a
year, asked for continued freedom from
criticism, on the ground that his experts had
not yeît completed their investigation into
fiscal matters; and he promised that when
the reports of the experts were presented the
Government would formulate a definite fiscal
policy. That policy was not announced until
March, 1924, roughly two and a half years
after the general election. I therefore feel,
in the present instance, that if honourable
gentlemen on the other side were inclined to
be critical of the policies proposed by the
new Government, they should remember what
happened when the late Government took

SEPTEMBER 19, 1930
office, and the treatment that was accorded
that Government at the hands of a militant
Opposition at that time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
have done that.

Evidently

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I desire to say
thaf the Government does appreciate the
stand that has been'taken by my honourable
friend, the leader on the other side of this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), in advocatingfor the new administration a reasonable
opportunity to put into praotice a policy
based upon promises made f0 and endorsed
by the people.
1 feel that it is much better f0 allow a,
free and fuit discussion of subjects of public
interest-especially such a one~ as this, which
for so many years has divided our people
politically-than to attempt to stifle discussion
or cut off debate. 1 hope, thereýfore, that no
one who desired f0 discuss this question has
been prevented from doing so. 1 do not se
any particular necessîty for prolonging te
debate. With these remarks I move that the
Bill be now read a third time.
Hon. Mr. CASGR.AI'N: May 1 ask just
one question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERT'SON:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does the honourable Minister think that 320,000,000 is enough?
If will flot go very far.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- I would point
out fo my honourable friend that the $20,000,000 is only a portion of the total amount to
be expended, because the provinces and the
municipalities are expected f0 increase it about
threefold.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Honourabie
members, there is nothing on the Order Paper

The best information I have been able to get
is that there, is no chance whatever of prorogation this week; s0 there is nc' object in

have a right to discuss the Bill when it comes

House adjourns to-day it do stand adjourned
till Monday next at 2 p.m.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
instead of 3?

Why 2 p.m.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The reason is
that it is desirable to hasten prorogation, if
pos-sible, in order that the Prime Minister
may depart.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the expectatien that the Bill will leave the other Chamber Monday morning?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUCHBY: And be before
us at 2 o'celock. That is the expectation.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, the latest information I have received indicates that the other Chamber will
not have finished until'at least 2.45, and it
may be later than that. I understand the
honourable the leader on the other side of
this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will not
arrive in the city until 4 o'clock, and it has
been intimated to me, although not by him,
that he will have something to say on the
Bill that is to come before us. It is highly
desirable that any discussion we may have
should not be continued long after 4 o'clock,
because we have to fix a time near that hour
for prorogation, and to notify His Excellency;
and, furthermore, there is to be a Council
meeting at 5 o'clock. I know honourable
members would not like to interfere with
these arrangements.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have not
been notified about the Council meeting.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHIBY: Well, my invitation went astray, too, but I am informed
that the Council is to meet.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

PARLIAMENTARY RESTAURANT
MOTION

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: With the permission of the Senate, I should like to
make some reference to the Parliamentary
Restaurant. I feel it is safe to say that many
honourable members of the Senate and of
the other Chamber have not been too well
satisfied with the arrangements that were made
last year with reference to the operation of
the restaurant. As honourable members know,
the restaurant was put in charge of the
Canladian National Railways and Parliament
undertook to indemnify them for any loss
they might sustain up to $15,000 a year. That
arrangement was to remain in force for one
year only, unless renewed. When we met
again provision had to be made for either
the renewal of the contract with the company, or the making of other arrangements.
We have, as honourable gentlemen know,
a Joint Committee of the two Houses on
the Restaurant. Two members representing
the Senate, and, I presume, an equal rumber
representing the other House, met in conference with Their Honours the Speakers of
both Houses to consider what should be done,
and, according to the information that I have
received, it was the unanimous opinion that
the contract should net be renewed, but that
there should be a return to the old system.
Pursuant to that decision, a resolution was
passed by the other House, at the instance of
the Prime Minister. I have in my hand a
similar resolution, the approval of which by
honourable gentlemen will permit of the
necessary arrangements being made for the
opening of the restaurant next session.
I move, seconded by Right Hon. Mr.
Graham:
Tbat it be resolved that the agreement made
by the Joint Coniiittee of the Senate and
Ilouse of Commons on the Restaurant, with the
Canadian National Railways, approved by this

House on the 6th day of Jine, 1929, to take
over the management of the Parliamentary
Restaurant and Cafeteria for the period of one
oear
for the sum of $15,000 be discontinued and
that the management of the said restaurant and
cafeteria be again assumed by the Joint Connittce of the Senate and House of Commons on
the Restaurant.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable members, I think that we should net acquiesce in
this new arrangement without first receiving
some information. On the whole, I would
perhaps prefer a reversion te the old order.
I remember, however, that I was one of the
members of the committee that made the
arrangement with Mr. Van Wyck. At the

SEPTEMBER 22, 1930
time seime very strong opinions had been
%'oiced in regard to the running of the
restaurant. It was thought that the Canadian
National Railways and the management of
the (Chateai Laurier could give better satisfaction, particularly by providing better food,
and that in the, end the Government might
save somc money. Af ter the experience of
one short session we now have placed before
us a resolution asking us to revert to the old
systcm. We may be justified in taking soch
action, but 1 tbink we should be informed
how the restaurant came out financially last
year, whether or not the Canadian National
Railways want to give up the contract, and
what is behind this motion. We cannot
reasonably be asked to lump fromn one systema
to the other hefore hearing some expression of
opinion from the members of both Houses.
1 think that many honoiirable members would
prefer the old systcm; but if the opinion of
Mr. Ryckman had been borne out, the grant
of $S15,000 to the Railway, with free light,
free rent, free linen and so forth, should have
effected a saving to the country and permitted
the Canadian National Railways to make
some money out of the restaurant. In any
event, 1 think the I{ouse and the country are
entitled to somne information.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I should like to know
why this drastie step is being- taken, and
wvhether it is with the consent or at the request
of the Cainadian National Railways. -To speakc
plainly, I have always regarded the restaurant
as a kind of graft. I do not think this country is under any obligation to incur a loss,
of $30,000 or $40,000 a year in feeding the
members of this House and the House of
Commons. I think that is what it has been
<bing for many years.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Oh, no0.
Hlon. Mr. GORDON: 1 think I arn right.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Absolutely not.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Correct.
lion. Mr. GORDON:- I believe that is the
fact.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have been on the
comînittee and have seen the figures, anil I
know that the amount is not haif tbat mentioned by the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MacARTIIUR: I remember distinctly that in some years the cost exceeded
$20,000.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It was higher than
that at times. I was under the impression
18%95-8
REVISIP

that it was a good stroke of business to give
the management of the restaurant to the
Canadian National Railways; first, because
I thought the restaurant would be run in
the businesslike manner in which tbat company deals with every problem, and secondly',
because we should know just what the cost
was going to be. I should be sorry to serthat arrangement discontinued without the
company havin.- had a foul opportonity to
show what it could do. As I have said before, 1 think it is the meanest kind of graft
for members of Parliament to accept services
that are provided at a bass to tbe country.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not know wheae
my bonourable friend gets his information.
1 can assure the House that he is quite ini
errur in the figures he has mentioned. No
authority has been given for a Committee on
the Restaurant to take official action in this
matter, but several of us who were members
of the üommittee in past years were sufficiently interested to endeavour to securc. the
opinions of miembers of the Senate and mcmibers of the other Huse. It was impossible
to sec everybody, but so far as we could
ascertain it was the consensus of opinion that
the service last year was not satisfactorySome Hon. SENATOR.S: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -and that in the
end it did not result in any saving of money.
There bas been a general impression that
the restaurant was conducted as a club for
the members. If it ever was such a club, it
wvas divested last year of that character and
became notbing but an ordinary eating-houýýe.
Members were treated in just the same way
that tbey would have been if they had gone
to a public place of refreshment. To a great
many members that was not pleasing. I do
not know about my honourable friend, but
it bas been my custom during the greater
part of the sessions to t.ake my meals in the
restaurant, and therefore I know sometbing
about it.
After consulting with Their Honours the
Speakers of both bouses, and -with many
members, the unofficial committee who wem
asked to discuss the matter were unanimously of tbe opinion that we should reverL
to the nid order of things. At the same time
it was stated by persons who, I believe, have
knowledge of the subjeet that steps could be
taken to reduce the overhead cost of the
restaurant.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It is well known that
the principal difficulty is due to the fact t.bat
