SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
Hîs Exceliency the Governor General was then pleased to

[En glish]
1-onourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of'Conimions:
I have the honour to weicome you t0 the First Session of the
3l1st Parliament of Canada.
Canada has been honoured this year by visits [rom two
members of the Royal Family. In Aprii the Prince of Wales
traveiied 10 the west and north and to Toronto and Ottawa. In
June and July Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother graciousiy
undertook engagements in Halifax and Toronto. Members wiil
be pieased Io hear of Prince Phiiip's forthcoming brief visit
this October in preparation for the Duke of Edinburgh's
Commonwealth Study Conference in Canada next spring.
Meanwhiie in November Princess Anne will fulfil engagements with the Canadian Save the Children Fund.
During this year 1 have had a most memorabie opportunity
to reinforce my appreciation of the beauty, variety and natural
weaith of our country. My wife and i have experienced the
warm welcome extended to us by each region in ils own special
way. We have paid officiai visits t0 ail ten Provinces and the
Northwest Territories, and we look forward t0 a visit before
long t0 the Yukon Territory. We have also had periods of
residence in The Citadei, Quebec, and in quarters made available in the Governor's Flouse ai Lower Fort Garry.
i arn proud, in my capacity as representative of our gracious
Sovereign Queen Elizabeth il, to participate in this important
ceremony in the life of our nation, which brings together the
three elements of the Parliament of Canada, the Crown, the
Senate and the Flouse of Commons.
1 look forward to meeting the Members of this new
Parliament.

SENATE DEBATES
My Ministers were given a mandate to change the direction
of the Government of Canada, as we enter the 1980's. The
basic purposes of that change will be to enhance the rights,
freedoms and opportunities of individual Canadians, and reestablish the spirit of partnership and renewal which are
fundamental to our Federation.
[Translation]
The mandate of my Ministers is also to build upon the
special strengths of Canada. We front on one mass market and
three great oceans, with access to the world. Each of our
regions contains vast physical resources which can be the basis
of industrial strength well into the future. Confident local
identities are emerging-rooted in language, custom and community-and yielding a cultural vitality unique among
nations. My Ministers believe that the way to build a whole
nation is to respect our individual parts, and you will be invited
to consider measures to build upon the diverse regional and
cultural strengths of Canada.
During the past four months, my Ministers have made every
effort to change the climate of federal-provincial relations
which has prevailed in recent years. As a result of their efforts,
there has been visible progress. An agreement on lotteries has
been concluded and agreement in principle has been reached
with certain coastal provinces concerning offshore mineral
resources. Bringing about this change in relations is fundamental to my government's philosophy. Working with our provincial partners, we seek practical solutions to concrete problems.
To make federalism work, it is essential to change the
attitudes of the past and the federal government must set the
example. Accordingly, it is a primary goal of my Government
to bring about a new era in federal-provincial relations. Consultation and cooperation will be the hallmarks of that new
era. The time has come to reconcile our differences. It is time
to work together to fully realize our country's potential. It is
by building for the future that we will renew Canadian federalism. In this spirit, my Government looks forward to the next
Conference of First Ministers in Ottawa this year.
[English]
Citizens and Parliament can control government only if
information is public. You will be asked to approve Freedom
of Information Legislation based on the principle that government information should be available to the people, that
necessary exceptions to that principle should be limited and
specified, and that disputes over the application of those
exceptions should be resolved independently of the Government.
To correct inequities currently borne by some Canadian
individuals, you will be asked to amend sections of the Indian
Act, to extend spouses' allowances in circumstances where
they are now denied, to amend certain legislation respecting
veterans, and to further protect the privacy of individual
Canadians.
You will also be asked to consider reforms to extend the
power of Parliament. Proposals will be submitted to the Standing Committee on Procedure and Organization to strengthen

October 9, 1979

the powers and resources of parliamentary committees, to
accord more prominence to private members' initiatives, and
to make my Ministers more accountable to you. The Standing
Committee also will be invited to consider the question of a
permanent Speaker for the House of Commons.
To demonstrate the capacity of Parliament, you will be
asked to approve the immediate establishment of four small
select committees, with the resources and powers necessary to
enquire fully into the special needs of handicapped and disabled Canadians; measures to strengthen the role of the voluntary sector in our society; policies with respect to foreign
ownership, including the operations of the Foreign Investment
Review Agency; and measures necessary to prevent recurring
cost overruns on major government projects. You will be
invited to establish a Joint Committee to undertake a broad
enquiry into the future development of nuclear energy in
Canada. In addition, Standing Committees of Parliament will
be invited to examine Canadian cultural policy, Canadian
foreign policy, and the retirement income needs of Canadians
in the 1980's. Annual Reports of Crown Corporations, the
Commissioner of Official Languages, the Economic Council of
Canada and other similar bodies will be referred automatically
to the appropriate committees of Parliament.
To broaden responsibility for the management of Parliament, Privy Councillors not members of Cabinet and drawn
from both sides of the House will be invited to serve as
Commissioners of Internal Economy.
[Translation]
My Ministers believe the greatest immediate challenge
facing Canada today is to restore growth, confidence and jobs
to the Canadian economy. While our economy faces serious
immediate problems, my Government believes the economic
potential of Canada is the strongest in the world. My Ministers
will propose a five-part strategy to build on that potential.
First, my Ministers will reduce the burden of government on
the economy by better controlling expenditures. A new expenditure management system has been introduced within the
government to set strict overall spending limits, to ensure that
all ministers accept full responsibility for spending restraint,
and to require that funds for new programs come from savings
in existing programs. In that context, you will be asked to
approve creation of a Ministry of State for Social Development to better coordinate social programs and expenditures.
My Government has initiated action to reduce the size of
the Federal Public Service and to offer for private purchase
and ownership Crown corporations operating in areas where
direct government intervention is no longer necessary. Legislation will be introduced to strengthen control over and accountability of remaining Crown corporations. You will also be
asked to approve "sunset" legislation to provide a regular
opportunity for Parliament to judge whether Government programs and agencies need continue in their present form, if at
all. The form of the estimates to be placed before you will be
improved to provide more accurate information. You will be
given projections of Government revenues and expenditures for

October 9, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

the next four years so that you can judge the probable impact
of today's decisions on tomorrow's economy.

the provinces and industry, a national tourism strategy will be
developed.

[English]

Fifth, my Government is committed to making Canada
self-sufficient in energy by 1990. To that end, in consultation
with the provinces, measures will be introduced to encourage a
significant reduction in Canada's overall energy consumption,
and to stimulate a major expansion in our capacity to supply
and distribute energy in various forms. In bringing forth these
measures, my Government accepts and respects provincial
jurisdiction over resources, as it accepts its own responsibility
to ensure economic stability, competitive advantage and other
national objectives.

Second, my Government will place greater reliance on
individual initiative to generate growth and jobs for Canadians. You will receive proposals for regulatory reform, designed
to ensure that the certainty and nature of government regulation encourages individual initiative and planning. Measures
will be introduced to expand research and development in
Canada and to further promote exports of Canadian goods and
services. You will be asked to approve agreements arising from
the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including
adjustment measures for industries adversely affected by those
agreements. The Minister of State for Economic Development
will convene a National Economic Development Conference to
discuss with the provinces, business, labour, cooperatives and
other groups Canada's economic goals for the decade ahead,
and how they might best be achieved in a spirit of full
economic partnership. In that same spirit, legislation will be
introduced to improve the handling of industrial disputes
within federal jurisdiction.
Third, my Government will propose measures to help
individual Canadians build a stake in our country. You will be
asked to approve a program of tax credits for mortgage
interest and property taxes. Measures will be placed before
you to assist small and medium-size enterprises, and to encourage more Canadians to participate in the ownership of public
and private enterprises. You will be asked to consider revisions
to the Employment Tax Credit program, the creation of a
Youth Employment Secretariat, and other measures to create
new jobs for young Canadians. An employment strategy for
women will be placed before you. Programs to assist native
Canadians to develop and apply work skills will be expanded.
Changes will be introduced in the unemployment insurance
program to ensure greater equity and to remove disincentives
to work.
Fourth, my Government will ask you to support programs
which build upon the strengths of the regions of Canada.
Legislation will be placed before you to strengthen the mandate of the Department of Regional Economic Expansion. You
will be asked to consider a White Paper on future development
of our fisheries resources, prepared in consultation with fishermen, the fishing industry and the provinces. My Ministers
have begun to overhaul the grain transportation system
through appointment of a grain transportation coordinator, the
signing of agreements for the development of the Prince
Rupert terminal, and a significant increase in hopper car
capacity. A Seaway Advisory Council will be created to ensure
that users and affected areas can contribute to policy concerning this essential waterway. My Government will ensure an
even flow of work to Canadian shipyards, as we develop an
effective Canadian merchant fleet. Measures will be introduced to encourage further mining development in the Canadian North, and to strengthen the capacity of our two Territorial
governments to manage their own affairs. In cooperation with

My Government views the diversity of Canada as a great
national asset, and is determined to encourage, not limit, the
development and expression of that diversity. That encouragement will be the beginning principle of the proposals by my
Ministers for consideration by the parliamentary committee
reviewing cultural policies. It will be the purpose of an amendment to the Immigration Act to embed in its preamble the
multicultural fact of Canada.
[Translation]
Legislation will be introduced to encourage fuller provincial
and Parliamentary participation in telecommunications policymaking. The Canadian Film Development Corporation Act
will be amended to significantly increase private sector partici,ation in the Corporation and to broaden its mandate to
encompass development of the recording and publishing industries in Canada.
Members of the House of Commons,
During the session you will be asked to appropriate the
funds required for the services and payments authorized by
Parliament.
You will be asked to approve a number of bills left pending
at the dissolution of the previous Parliament.
You will be asked to consider other measures.
[English]
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May divine providence guide you in your deliberations.

The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was pleased to retire.

TRIBUTES

[Translation]
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, the Senate that i see
today is not quite the same as 1 remember it was six months
ago.
First I would like to refer to some changes which have
nothing to do with the election held on May 22 last.
I wish to speak of several senators who have left us.
First, Senator Maurice Bourget. He was a friend of ail and
had been a personal friend of mine for years.
I sat with him in the House of Commons to which he was
elected in 1940, 18 years before I was. However we were
defeated the same year in 1962. I remember that I was then
more sorry for him than for myself.
Senator Bourget served his country some 40 years. At first,
in the capacity of a member, as I said. And since 1963, he was
a senator and for some time the Speaker of this house.
His contribution to the study of legislation was invaluable.
As an engineer, he was a stickler for meticulousness and
accuracy which often enabled him to find oversights that had
escaped the attention of most of us.
Endowed with a very attractive personality, his knowledge
of international matters led him on several occasions to be a
highly valued Canadian representative abroad.
On behalf of the government and the Progressive Conservative caucus, I extend to his wife Margot and his children our
deepest sympathy.
We also had this summer to mourn the death of the
Honourable Claude Wagner, that great Quebec statesman
whose stay in this house has unfortunately been far too short.
I have known few people to be gifted with as great an
influence as Claude Wagner was. He will have left his mark on
public life in Quebec and Canada where his followers were
many. His health never allowed him to participate in the work
of this chamber as often as he would have wished; yet, he did

manage to make a few remarkable interventions. And each
time, it was obvious that we were fortunate in having the
opportunity of listening to a man of such outstanding national
importance, a man whose knowledge and love of country were
exemplary.
His wife Liselle and his children, whose support never failed
him, know that we have ail suffered bitterly from his loss.
Less sad but equally regrettable is the departure of Senator
Forsey who has retired. The moment he chose to do so allowed
him to retire discreetly; after a fashion, of course, since he has
reached the age of compulsory retirement. But the influence he
exercised on our assembly is such that we are ail saddened at
his no longer being able to be one of us. In short, it is
extremely difficult to get used to the idea that he will no
longer sit among us.
i believe it can be said without fear of hurting anyone that
Eugene Forsey was the best known Canadian senator. His
dynamism and tireless devotion guarantee him a very special
place in the hearts, and especially the minds, of aIl Canadians
who read the newspapers. Through his works, he in a way
contributed to popularizing the Senate. That entitles him to al]
our gratitude.
* (1405)

[English]
Senators, let us be thankful that there is more than one way
to leave this place. Senator Forsey will be with us for a good
time yet. His work, and, Lord knows, the need for his wisdom,
is not nearly at an end. I am quite sure that we will see him
around. We should arrange to be able to seek his advice as
often as possible.
I would also like to pay my personal respects to Senator Bill
McNamara, who took his leave of us over the summer just
ended. As a man of the west who served for 12 years as Chief
Commissioner of the Wheat Board, a position of vast consequence, Senator McNamara had an appreciation shared by
few of the difficulties and yet the potential facing those who
farm our great Canadian bread basket. Not surprisingly,
therefore, his views on transportation, agriculture and related
matters in particular were incisive and always relevant. His
expertise cannot, I think, be easily replaced in the Senate. i
extend to him the warm wishes of his friends here and of the
Government of Canada.
Senator Harold Connolly also retired this past summer. The
good senator had been in ill health for a number of years and,
regrettably, his participation in debate was restricted as a
result. With him go our best wishes for the future.

SENATE DEBATES
Finally, honourable senators, I take leave to pay respect, on
bebalf of us all, to the late Right Honourable John George
Diefenbaker.
The former Prime Minister's death shocked us all. Not in
perfect health for a number of years, he nevertheless was such
a part of Parliament, a giant within the process, that it is
difficult to imagine him no longer here.
My personal career in politics has been closely associated
with Mr. Diefenbaker's. In 1957 I ran with him and for him in
the province of Quebec. By 1958 his style had gripped the
land. I came to Ottawa and subsequently served in his ministry. My presence in the Senate is as a result of his appointing
me.
In such an intertwining of careers one is left with inescapable memories of the man. His populism-the degree to
which he opened the process-is now legend. For many of us
the civil libertarian and humanitarian principles which he
espoused gave greater meaning to our political involvements.
He understood and respected the law and strove to make it
equitable. His Bill of Rights remains a lasting imprint on
Canadian jurisprudence. We shall not again be graced by the
likes of John Diefenbaker. Those of us who knew him must
count ourselves among the luckiest of Canadians. We shall all
remember him.
I have alluded to events that had nothing to do with the
election. I am not going to deal with substantive changes at
this time. But as we begin this Thirty-first Parliament with a
new Speaker in the Chair I think it is appropriate for me to
pay tribute to Senator Allister Grosart. He is a friend upon
whom I have relied for much in recent years, and I am pleased
to see that he has assumed the pre-eminent position among us.
I am sure we all concur in applauding the wisdom of the
senator's appointment to the Chair.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: As a man well-versed in not only the rules
but the traditions, customs and practices of this house, Senator
Grosart is superbly qualified to discharge all official functions
incumbent upon his new role. I join with all senators in
offering congratulations and good wishes for his term.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, as we are on the subject of the new
Speaker, I would also like to pay homage to his predecessor,
the Honourable Renaude Lapointe who occupied the Chair in
this house. Her charm was certainly a great asset to the
Senate.
She carried out her duties in this chamber with a great deal
of tact. But it is especially outside this house, in the social role
that she played, that she distinguished herself by making
friends of Canada all those she met as Speaker of the Senate.
We are happy that she can now take a less neutral stand and
return to her former activities.
I indeed remember a rather virulent speech she once gave,
and we are anxious to hear her speak again in such a way. We
are nevertheless very grateful to her for what she did for
Canada while she occupied the Chair.
[Senator Flynn.]

October 10, 1979

I would also like to take this opportunity to extend a hearty
welcome to all our new colleagues. There are indeed some
notable personalities who entered this chamber yesterday and
who may make a contribution, and transform the Senate or at
least initiate some reform. We are indeed most happy to have
them among us.
[English]
To those on this side of the chamber who took their seats
yesterday, I extend an additional special welcome. We have
suffered an imbalance in this place for some time, and it is
refreshing to me that strides have been made towards infusing
our ranks with blood of a bluer variety.
Hon. Senators: Hear, Hear.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, it is good to be back
here again, but not necessarily on this side of the chamber. I
read some press comments that members of the party of which
I am a long-time supporter had been cast into the outer
darkness of opposition, but I reassure myself this afternoon
when I note there is a good deal of illumination on this side. I
hope it will continue throughout the life of this Parliament and
that we may provide illumination on a number of issues which
confront Canadians.
e

(1415)

First of all, honourable senators, may I express, on behalf of
the official opposition in this chamber, our great delight and
joy that the Honourable Senator Allister Grosart has been
appointed Speaker.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: I think it is no secret that there is a great
deal of enthusiasm on the part of supporters of the Liberal
Party that with the change in government this great and
unregenerate Tory should have been appointed to this high
post, and we know that he will be meticulously objective in all
of his judgments and rulings. Our new Speaker has a great
sense of this place, a great sense of Parliament, and we feel
sure that he will serve us in a distinguished way.
I am pleased to join in the eloquent tribute accorded our
outgoing Speaker by the Leader of the Government, Senator
Flynn. The Honourable Senator Renaude Lapointe, whether in
this chamber or when travelling on behalf of this house
throughout this nation or abroad, has always brought great
honour to the Senate and to Parliament. We are proud of
Senator Lapointe. She has been a great Speaker who has
served us superbly.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: Senator Flynn, in his remarks, described
some of the grievous losses of members that we have suffered
over recent months. Certainly March 29 last represented a
grievous loss for his family and his nation, and for Parliament,
when the Honourable Senator Maurice Bourget passed away.
Inevitably, information contained in the Parliamentary
Guide is rather sketchy. Only in very cryptic form does it
describe the careers of those who serve in Parliament. We read
that he was elected to the House of Commons in 1940, and

October 10, 1979
October 10, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

was re-elected in 1945, 1949, 1953, 1957 and 1958. But a
recital of dates does little to describe the Maurice Bourget that
we knew.
Senator Flynn has described many of his other qualities and
activities. This was a man who was a friend to all of us,
wherever we sat in this house. He was always ready to defend
a good principle, always prepared to be a good friend in a
whole range and host of ways. He was a shining example of
what public service can really be all about, regardless of one's
political affiliation. This former Speaker and great parliamentarian brought great honour to the province of his birth and his
nation, and to Parliament.
I join Senator Flynn in extending to his wife and children
our condolences and our sympathy. i know other senators will
wish to speak about Senator Bourget later.
Another great Canadian was taken tragically on July 11, the
Honourable Claude Wagner. There were many wonderful
characteristics of this man, but surely one of his most appealing qualities at this time of great national concern about unity
was his dedication to national unity. He was concerned for the
welfare of Canadians wherever they live, whether in the Atlantic provinces, on the west coast, in central Canada, the north,
Quebec or Ontario. He was a man of great vision taken too
soon. Again we extend to his wife and children our condolences
and our sympathy.
Some of our members have departed through retirement,
such as Senator William McNamara, whose prairie farm
background eventually led him around the world in a distinguished career as the Chief Commissioner of the Canadian
Wheat Board from 1958 to 1970. As honourable senators are
aware, he was responsible for negotiating Canada's first major
wheat sales to China. I remember some years ago I went on a
visit to China with Senator McNamara, and the two most
famous Canadian names in China at that time were Dr.
Norman Bethune and William McNamara. It was a great
revelation for me and other delegates. Senator McNamara
established the foundation for literally millions of dollars'
worth of wheat sales annually for Canadian farmers and the
Canadian economy generally. He certainly will be missed.
Senator Forsey-1 note from the record, and i was acutely
aware at the time when I served as Leader of the Government
in the Senate-did not always vote with the government side.
He was essentially a proud and independent spirit.
He had been a senator for only nine years, but earned this
chamber a mountain of recognition in that time. The image of
a staid and somnolent institution-which we all know is
incorrect-has regularly been shattered by the brisk, machinegun logic of our esteemed colleague. And he demonstrated that
senators can legislate, can educate, and can also entertain. He
did this all the time with a superb command of both official
languages.
He was honoured on the Hill the other evening in a very
appropriate fashion. I can tell you that all of us are going to
miss his presence here. I suppose he would be described as a
constitutional expert, monarchist supreme, and guardian of the

80072-2

BNA Act, and an unremitting opponent of those who tinker
for the sake of change. Eugene Forsey needs to be shown
something better before it receives his seal of approval. And
woe betide the proponents of any constitutional measure which
does not have his approval. Eugene Forsey certainly does not
mince his words. He will be missed. I hope he will stay close to
the Hill so that he may provide assistance and guidance for all
of us.
It seems to me that this is a time when we should consider
once again the establishment of a senator emeritus.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: I advance this in all seriousness. I am sure
there is a place for those with great talent, capacity and ability
who may have gone beyond the formal retirement age of 75,
but who still have a great deal to contribute to our nation. I
urge the Leader of the Government to consider this as one of
the many reforms which i am sure he hopes to introduce.
For all of Canada, the passing of the Right Honourable
John G. Diefenbaker was a traumatic event. John Diefenbaker
will long remain in the minds and hearts of Canadians as an
unforgettable man. A characteristic of the late Mr. Diefenbaker was that no matter how vigorous the opposition to some
of his most cherished ideas, he always recognized the right of
the other party to be heard, and he relished the idea of having
his ideas assaulted in this fashion. He always had good words
for anyone who would engage in vigorous parliamentary
debate. That is the way Parliament should be. In fact "parliament" derives from the word "parle", meaning "to speak."
Mr. Diefenbaker never let us forget that.
To those of us who had the unique opportunity to know him
in our day-to-day work, he was constantly here among us in a
most visible and vigorous fashion. But beyond these walls,
many Canadians felt that they knew the man just as well as his
closest confidants. That is perhaps the most telling feature of
John Diefenbaker's work and his style of public life. He was
able to touch people-great numbers of people-in a highly
personal way.
History will record the ups and downs of his political career
for future generations to study and analyze. Liberals, particularly, at this time are mindful of the fact that Mr. Diefenbaker
lost many elections before he came to power, but we hope our
return will not be delayed to the extent of his defeats in what I
understand were seven straight elections.
Senator Flynn: Five.
Senator Perrault: For us in our time we are grateful for the
opportunity which history gave us to know John Diefenbaker
in a personal way, to share some of his time with him, to
witness his work first hand and to be certain that he strove to
leave this land better than he found it.
During the course of the upcoming debate, I hope to make
reference to the many new senators who have been appointed
to this chamber. All of us feel that there are great resources of
talent and ability that can be put to work to serve the interest
of the Canadian people. Together with my colleagues I look
forward to working with these new senators.

October 10, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

world affairs and particularly of world trade was so valuable to
us during the nine years he was here. Then I should like to
turn to my namesake, so far as the last name is concerned at
least, Senator Harold Connolly whose health, unfortunately,
did not allow him to participate in our work in latter years to
the extent that he would have liked.
But I should particularly like to say something about our
great friend Senator Forsey. From the time of his first intervention in the Senate, when he joined us some nine years ago,
his career was one of great promise. Indeed his time here
displayed the fulfilment of that promise because his influence
was both enlarged and solidified not only in this house, but in
Parliament and in the country.
As has been said, Senator Forsey was one of the most
articulate people who has ever graced the benches of the
Senate, and in both languages. Senator Forsey understood
Parliament and the legislative process, and his chairmanship of
the Regulations and other Statutory Instruments Committee
demonstrated that. The work of that committee was not
newsworthy, perhaps, in the real sense of the word, but be
understood the importance of Orders in Council and regulations and their effect upon legislation and the legal process,
and how they could enlarge legislation unduly and far beyond
the contemplation of the legislature, and how they could
infringe the rights of the citizen.
This has been a major concern for many years in the upper
bouse of the United Kingdom, the House of Lords, and
Senator Forsey made it an important concern, as it must
always remain an important concern, of this house. The work
is tedious; the material is detailed, and meticulous study must
be applied to it. The requirements of this kind of job are
intelligence and judgment. Senator Forsey, and the committee,
to whom I also pay tribute, did this work extremely well.
I really think, however, the fulfilment of Senator Forsey's
career arose during the great constitutional debate in tbis
bouse and in committees in 1978. His lifetime of study and
experience, going back to his days at McGill, and his days of
close association not only with the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen but with many other constitutionalists of his day,
proved invaluable to him for that great debate and for the
process which we all went through, and are, perhaps, continuing to go through at this time. His interventions, his letters, his
articles and his interviews certainly delighted the media, but
they delighted us as well. His views swayed the Senate and the
committees of Parliament. He performed a signal service not
only for this chamber but for our national institutions and for
our country. The departure of Senator Forsey from this chamber and from Parliament leaves a great void.
* (1440)

Honourable senators, I should like at this time to say
something about my friend, Maurice Bourget. I ask permission
particularly to do this because when I had the privileges and
responsibilities of the leadership here he was the Speaker.
His death was one of the great shocks we have had in recent
years, because only days before it occurred be presided over

this house in the absence of the Speaker. Parliament will not
be the same without Maurice Bourget. He had been here or
hereabouts for some 40 years. He was a great gentleman; he
was urbane; he was cultivated; he was considerate; and, above
all, he was kind.
He had friends everywhere in Parliament, on both sides of
the house. He had friends in far-flung places-in Europe, in
the Middle East, and in the United States, where he went as
part of his work as a parliamentarian. He had friends in all
parts of Canada. He had friends particularly in the province of
Quebec, and perhaps most especially in his native city of Lévis.
There is epitomized in his home high on the cliffs over Lévis,
which overlooks the harbour of Quebec, an idea of what
Maurice Bourget understood of the early days of this country.
One of the great views in this country is the prospect of the
city of Quebec from the river. Every time the Bourgets looked
out of their windows they saw that view, and the view they saw
distils the early history of this country, because Cartier had
been there, Champlain had been there, the Indians came there
to trade and the coureurs de bois came there to commence
their journeys to the interior, the settlers were there, the
missionaries went from there and the traders naturally used
the river as the only highway into the interior.
All of this mixture of history was part of the background of
the thinking, of the philosophy, of the life of Maurice Bourget,
and that background he understood and appreciated. It was an
integral part of his conception of Canada, a country that he
loved deeply.
I remember, when the first flames of separatism appeared,
he called me on the telephone from his home with great
emotion and in great distress. I remember what he said,
"What are they trying to do to my country?"-not "our
country", not "your country", but "my country". He felt that
he himself was being violated by the propositions emanating
from separatist quarters, and he continued, "They cannot be
allowed to succeed. They will not succeed."
By training Maurice Bourget was an engineer, and as an
engineer his advice was sought, but as Speaker he exhibited a
judicial quality that is rare even among people trained in the
law. Instinctively, he had an understanding of the rules that
apply in Parliament, and of the decorum that should prevail in
this house. He was one of the most distinguished Speakers we
shall ever see in Parliament.
To his great wife and to his two wonderful daughters we all
send our very deep sympathy.
[Translation]
Senator Denis: Honourable senators, I would simply like to
add a word in commemoration of my personal and intimate
friend, the Honourable Maurice Bourget. I think everyone
agrees that be was a very worthy colleague. As well we all
agree he was a highly competent Speaker. Having known him
since 1940 when he was first elected as member for the riding
of Lévis I can say that he served exemplarily the interests of
the voters of his riding.

SENATE DEBATES
We then became very close friends. He was almost always
my deskmate except when he was Speaker of the Senate. We
must all admit that his departure created an immense vacuum
especially for me who always shared his joys and his sorrows.
To his distressed family, to his two daughters, to his charming wife I would like to extend my most sincere condolences. I
personally extend all my sympathy to all his many friends, to
all his voters from the riding of Lévis as well as to all his
friends in the Senate. I feel like having lost a beloved brother.
I would like also to extend my deepest sympathy to the family
of Senator Wagner as well as to the family of the Right
Honourable John Diefenbaker.
* (1450)

[English]
Senator Walker: Honourable senators, I did not intend to
speak today, but the name of the late Right Honourable John
Diefenbaker was mentioned, and so I shall do so.
Fifty-two years ago i met him at the first national convention of the Conservative Party, which was held in Winnipeg.
He was then a tall, gangling, curly, fair-haired man with light
blue eyes that pierced right through one. That quality never
changed. In 1942 I nominated him for the leadership at the
National Conservative Convention at Winnipeg, at which time
he received an awful licking. In the meantime he had been
beaten in Saskatchewan for the leadership of the provincial
party, and for the mayoralty of Prince Albert. Although he
had often been beaten-five times in all-he was finally
elected a federal member of Parliament in 1940.
In 1948 he again ran for the leadership. On that occasion I
was his campaign manager, and the present Speaker of the
Senate, the Honourable Allister Grosart, was then campaign
manager against him. Senator Grosart was in favour of the
Honourable George Drew, and Mr. Drew won the leadership.
It must have been a great temptation for Mr. Diefenbaker to
retire from such contests. In 1956 he ran again for the Tory
leadership, and on that occasion he won brilliantly. At that
time the present Speaker of the Senate was the campaign
manager and I was acting as his official agent. All those
events, in retrospect, remind us, "If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again."
During my term as a cabinet minister in Mr. Diefenbaker's
government, wherever I went in the world on missions for the
Prime Minister, Mr. Diefenbaker was looked upon as the
champion of the coloured races. That is something about
which little mention has been made, but it is a fact, and it
made a great deal of difference from then on in Canada's
relations with the rest of the world.
Mr. Diefenbaker was also the champion of the common
man, as he used to call him-the ordinary man-and gave
millions of people a vision of hope that otherwise they would
not have had.
I could go on to speak of his achievements, the Bill of
Rights, the various pieces of legislation that he passed, "the
sixty achievements" recorded in my speech in the House of
[Senator Denis.]

October 10, 1979

Commons Hansardin 1962, but time does not permit me to do
so and this is not the place to do it.
As I was sitting here, I recalled that splendid poem by Lord
Tennyson which most of us learned when we were at public
school. I am applying this to Mr. Diefenbaker in retrospect:
When I look back on what hath been
Like some divinely gifted man,
Whose life in low estate began
And on a simple village green;
Who breaks his birth's invidious bar,
And grasps the skirts of happy chance,
And breasts the blows of circumstance,
And grapples with his evil star;
Who makes by force his merit known
And lives to clutch the golden keys
To mould a mighty state's decrees
And shape the whispering of a throne.
And moving up from high to higher,
Becomes on Fortune's crowning slope
The pillar of a people's hope,
The centre of a world's desire.
Senator Croll: Honourable senators, I served with all those
honourable gentlemen whose names have been mentioned. I
associate myself with what has been said. I served in the
House of Commons with Maurice Bourget, and there is really
nothing that one can add to the glowing tribute that was paid
to him by Senator Connolly and others.
I am a particular friend of Harold Connolly, who served in
this chamber for a considerable length of time, which was cut
short by illness. His was a great talent, but unfortunately he
did not have an opportunity to use it in the way that would
have been beneficial to Canada. He provided many years of
service in his native province and for a time was provincial
premier.
Eight years ago I was privileged to introduce to this house
Senator Forsey, who has made a significant contribution both
to the Senate and to the political life of this country.
Senator Forsey was never at a loss for words, either spoken
or written, and he was always adept at recollecting what had
been said by others. He has always been a very active,
energetic man, and whenever we sought him, we had to search
for him.
Senator Forsey possesses a thorough knowledge of the working of government. He always knew how government operated.
Yet on occasion he would admit to the house that his idea of
what the Senate did was something that he picked up as he
went along and found that he had much to learn when he
joined the Senate. It is possible that his view of the Senate
changed once he was appointed, but I rather doubt that. He
was not that kind of man. Senator Forsey was able to attract a
great deal of attention and people began to think of the Senate
as an institution somewhat better than merely a Wednesday

October 10, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

give-away at a supermarket. The result was that his value to
the Senate was always inspiring. Senator Forsey is a scholar, a
gentlernanly and courteous man. Beyond question he is a
recognized expert on constitutional law. This leads me to
emphasize something that is of particular interest to me, that
Senator Forsey was obliged to retire from the Senate when he
reached mandatory age. Such forced retirement denies us
much that is valuable.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I know that
this is unusual, but perhaps, with your leave, you will allow me
to call to your attention the fact that Senator Forsey has not
left us, that he is in the gallery. With your permission, I will
ask him to move down to a seat in the front row so that we
may all see his smile once again as we proceed.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[Translation]
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I do not intend to
repeat everything that has been said about those who are no
longer among us or who have left us.
I merely want to add some particular aspects which struck
me, and since His Honour the Speaker has just spoken of our
friend, the Honourable Eugene Forsey, the two particular
aspects that I would like to underline in his regard are that he
is probably one of the greatest liberal minds I have ever met,
even when he spoke in conservative terms.
Mr. Forsey and myself also share something in common. As
you know, Senator Forsey was director of research for the
Canadian Labour Congress, which means he worked for several years in the labour movement, just as I myself did. I was
greatly saddened by his retirement.
I would like to touch upon something mentioned by our
leader and apparently supported by the government leader,
namely, that compulsory retirement at 75 is bad. Some should
retire at 50, others should stay on as long as they can efficiently
serve the country.
In any event, his departure was a great loss for the Senate
fortunately it is not yet a loss for the country.
I would also like to say a word about Senator Bourget. I
certainly agree that he had all the qualities that were attributed to him. It reminds those of us who are from Quebec of the
war years and of the very courageous stands that Senator
Bourget then took in the House of Commons. That required
much courage, and his attitude marked our generation.
As for the Honourable John Diefenbaker, I probably did not
know him as well as most of you, but I witnessed his ardor and
his fighting spirit. I have of him a vivid if not a burning
memory.
If it were physically possible I could also show you some of
the scars that our exchanges left me with. I am happy that
action was taken to ensure that his name is remembered.
Honourable senators, I believe we should take the time to
remember those who served our country. As for Mr. Diefenbaker, he is one of the rare persons I met-but there are still
some in both houses-who have become true institutions, that

is, they give the impression of not merely being men but
institutions, and being remembered as such in the history of
our Parliament. That was true in Mr. Diefenbaker's case. I
could name others, but I shall wait, as the opportunity may
again present itself.

[English]
Senator Goldenberg: Honourable senators, I cannot let this
occasion pass without adding a word to what has already been
said. I am not going to repeat the tributes that have been paid
to my old friend, Maurice Bourget; I had, however, something
in common with him that no other senator had. We were born
on the same day of the same year, and used to refer to each
other as twins.
Claude Wagner, though he was young compared to myself,
was an old colleague of mine at the Bar of Montreal. He
appeared before me in arbitrations at different times before he
entered politics.
I knew Bill McNamara when I was a commissioner in
Manitoba and he was head of the Wheat Board.
I want, however, to make particular mention of the one who
is probably my oldest friend, Eugene Forsey. I must tell you
that we began our parliamentary careers together. We were
active participants in the mock parliament at McGill University when we were students in the late twenties.
Senator Asselin: Were you a Conservative?
Senator Goldenberg: No, I was not a Conservative, but he
was. If I remember correctly, Eugene at that time was leader
of the Conservative Party in the mock parliament, and that
will perhaps explain to you why, when speaking in this chamber while sitting on the Liberal benches, he could always say
with pride, "I am a John A. Macdonald Conservative." He
started, as you will agree, Senator Flynn, on the right track
and then moved a little in between.
I will tell a story, and I hope my friend Eugene will not
object. We were on the staff of McGill at the same time. At
one point he went to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. The
head of the Department of Economics at that time was
Stephen Leacock, and both Eugene and I lectured under
Leacock. After Eugene came back from Oxford I ran into
Leacock one day in the lobby of the arts building at McGill
University. He stopped me and said, "Goldenberg, what in the
world has happened to Forsey?" I said, "What do you mean,
Dr. Leacock?" He said, "Well, he left here a leader of the
Conservative Party"-and, of course, Leacock was a Conservative-"but he has come back a socialist! What Oxford does
to the people we send over, I will never understand."
Well, Eugene Forsey and I, as I said, have known each other
for approximately 55 years, and it was a source of great
happiness to me to be associated with him, after all these
years, in the Senate.
I do not have to repeat what has already been said so
eloquently about him. I know some constitutional law, but
Eugene Forsey is the authority. He has guts, he is articulate,
and, as has already been pointed out-and I do not think

SENATE DEBATES
honourable senators will object if I say this-no senator in the
past, and certainly not in the eight years that 1 have been here,
has done more to keep the Senate before the public than
Eugene Forsey. I hope he will be around for a long time to
come.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, 1 have been listening
with attention and complete agreement to the observations
that honourable senators have been making about the several
distinguished, and, indeed, famous, people whose names are
being brought into remembrance this afternoon. But when the
Speaker informed us that our former colleague, Senator
Forsey, was in the gallery, I thought it would be nice to say
something about somebody who was present to hear it, since so
often, and particularly in political life, good things are said
about you only when you are dead. It is nice, therefore, as 1
say, to be able to say some good things about somebody when
he is present to hear the opinions that are being expressed.
Eugene Forsey is a charming, vivacious, and cultivated
personality. I almost described him as a cultivated "bag of
tricks," but, of course, I mean that in an affectionate sense,
with regard to the capacity of his mind, informed by knowledge, and of his intellect, so disciplined by hard work.
What I particularly liked about his contributions to this
chamber, among other things, was the wit and good humour
with which he approached matters under discussion. I enjoyed
his poetic contributions towards our debates, and I hope he
will not think of it as unkindly if I say that his poetry was
rather of the school of Edward Lear than that of William
Shakespeare; nevertheless, both, of course, have their place in
our literary tradition.
Eugene Forsey had a fund of reminiscences about famous
persons in our political life which always enlivened his discourse. He always has a historical reference that could be
applied to whatever situation was before us.
As we have good reason to know, he had a fund of constitutional lore which is perhaps second to none. What I liked about
him also, and what I still like about him, is his capacity to
judge the issues that he studies on their merits, his ability to
express an independence of political opinion, which aIl of us
are not able to command, and his capacity to go to the root
and substance of any argument that might be undor discussion. He saw both sides of the question, but he had the power
to bring sound judgment to bear in arriving at a definite
conclusion.
e (1510)

The Greeks, or Hellenes, as 1 suppose they are known, have
been described by some wise man as being the education of
Europe. I am not entirely sure Eugene Forsey was the education of the Senate, but he was certainly the education of Duff
Roblin, and for that 1 express my gratitude and esteem.
He is the keeper of our Constitution these days, and he is
the conscience of anyone who would indulge in constitutional
reform, so I say to you "Beware!"
My parting shot to Eugene Forsey would be to apply to him
a Scottish saying which I am sure he will be able to interpret
[Senator Goldenberg.]

October 10, 1979

without any further help from me-Eugene Forsey, lang may
your lum reek.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, at some other time 1
intend to make some reference to a number of former senators
to whom tributes have been paid here today. However, I
should just like to make one particular reference at this time to
Senator Forsey.
One fact that has not come out in ail of the references-and
1 would be derelict in my duty if 1 did not remind senators of
it, as Senator Forsey has on many occasions reminded us and
the public of Canada-is that Senator Forsey, while he spent
most of his life on what we call the mainland of Canada, was
born in Grand Bank, Newfoundland. He was a contribution
that Newfoundland was able to make to Canada long before
1949. Needless to say, we Newfoundlanders are very proud of
the contribution that he has made.
But, while being a great Canadian, he never forgot his
origins, as we can testify. On many occasions when we had
constitutional problems and we appealed to Senator Forsey for
advice, he was always ready to give it. In fact, on at least one
occasion when 1 was asked how many senators Newfoundland
had, although 1 knew that under the Constitution we were
entitled to six, 1 embarrassed myself by naming seven. Of
course, one of the seven 1 named, not facetiously, was Senator
Forsey. We always regarded him as being, in addition to a
great Canadian, a great Newfoundlander.
On behalf of ail Newfoundland senators and, indeed, on
behalf of ail the people of Newfoundland, I should like to
express our appreciation of the great contribution that that
distinguished scholar and humanitarian has made to Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE DEBATES
THE ECONOMY
INCREASE IN BANK RATE-ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF
COMBATTING INFLATION

Senator Perrault: May I ask a question of the Minister of
State for Economic Development and Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce? Yesterday interest rates were increased
by the Bank of Canada, less than 30 days after the last
increase. The so-called "key" bank rate was increased by
three-quarters of one per cent from 124 per cent to a record
13 per cent on September 10. In view of the fact that the
Minister of Finance, the Honourable John Crosbie, in a CBC
broadcast this morning, expressed real personal doubt concerning the value and efficacy of this continuing process, what does
the government propose in the way of alternative courses of
action, and are such alternative courses of action being considered to combat inflation?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, first of ail may I
briefly add to the comments made by my colleague, Senator
Flynn. I do not propose to answer for the Minister of Finance
in the Senate. I think he will certainly be called upon to
answer questions that are his direct responsibility, such as
stabilization policy questions, in the other place.
I would like, in answering the honourable senator's specific
question on this issue, to indicate that it is my understanding
that earlier today it was proposed, and unanimously agreed,
that the whole question of interest rates be referred to a
standing committee of the House of Commons so that there
may be a thorough public hearing on the topic, and so that the
matter be fully debated.
Senator Perrault: Surely we are not expected to wait for the
report of a parliamentary committee before dealing with a
critical situation affecting the lifestyle and well-being of thousands of Canadians from coast to coast, including the small
businessmen of this country. Surely the honourable minister is
not suggesting that we must wait for the report of a parliamentary committee before taking action on behalf of the Canadian
people.
Senator de Cotret: Not at ail. What I am suggesting is that
on a question of such fundamental importance as this, and one
of great complexity economically-because, as you well know,
we are not living on an island by ourselves; there are some very
complex links between the financial and capital markets of this
country and the financial and capital markets of the rest of the
world-it is of importance to have the issue debated in an open
forum, and I will be more than happy to seek further specific
clarification on the question from the Minister of Finance and
report back to the Senate with the least possible delay.
Senator Perrault: That will be appreciated. I should like to
ask a supplementary question. Have there been any meetings
between Mr. Crosbie or any of the other economic ministers
with Mr. Gerald Bouey to discuss this incredible spiral, or
have any meetings been scheduled, to the minister's
knowledge?
Senator de Cotret: I cannot answer the honourable senator's
question specifically. I would expect that there have been.

October 10, 1979

However, I could not say specifically whether or not there have
been, and if there have been I could not give the exact dates or
times of those meetings. However, I would be most happy to
inquire from the Minister of Finance and report back at the
earliest possible moment.
Senator Perrault: We appreciate that commitment, and look
forward to a reply as soon as possible.
POSSIBLE WINDFALL PROFITS TO CHARTERED BANKS

Senator Oison: I should like to ask a supplementary question. Is the minister or the government doing anything to take
care of the surcharge, or whatever the right term may be, for
the windfall profit that will fall to chartered banks in moving
up the rates on almost ail of the loans on their books?
Senator de Cotret: Once again it would be the responsibility
of the Minister of Finance to see if, in fact, that practice were
followed, and if, in fact, it would result in a windfall profit
such as the one you are suggesting. As is well known, an
interest rate increase of this type will affect the asset structure
of the banks as well as the liability structure of the banks, and
I am sure it is incumbent upon the Minister of Finance to
assure himself that everything is done to prevent the kind of
development referred to. Once again, I would be very happy to
inquire from him if he has any specific intentions, or if, for
that matter, he sees that there is a problem about that kind of
development.
STRENGTH OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Buckwold: I have a supplementary question for the
minister. The reason for raising the bank rate and prime rate,
and the whole rate structure, has generally been that it is
essential to do this in order to protect the Canadian dollar and
prevent the outflow of capital. We have been at an interest
rate a little below that of the Americans for the last week or
so, and the Canadian dollar has been reasonably stable. As a
matter of fact, for a while it went up a little bit. I would like
the minister to indicate whether, in fact, this is not a lesson,
that perhaps the time has come when we should not be relating
our interest rate to that of the Americans, but should run the
risk of the Canadian dollar's adjusting itself to circumstances.
The government might be rather pleasantly surprised at the
strength of the Canadian dollar. I wonder if I could get a
response.
Senator de Cotret: Certainly, senator, I would be happy to
respond to that question. Once again, I feel it is a question that
should be properly answered by the Minister of Finance, who I
am sure could give you a much longer and more thorough
explanation. However, I would like to point out that, as a
matter of fact, the Americans have since July increased their
prime bank rate by one and a half points. We have not quite
followed. The record will show that we did not increase when
they increased by half a point earlier this summer. In the last
round, when they increased by a full point, we have increased
the bank rate in Canada by three-quarters of a point.

SENATE DEBATES

all Canadians during the great manoeuvres which will take
place and which are being prepared with so much fervor?
Senator Flynn: I believe that that type of question could be
answered during the debate on the Address in reply. I intend
to say a few words about that issue when I rise to speak.
While the word "referendum" is not found in the Speech
from the Throne, the government is very concerned about that
issue. What I have said, what the Prime Minister has said
many times and what the government has said is that by our
actions we will show more comprehension towards claims and
representations of the provinces, and we will prove that federalism can work. With such demonstrations, we would be able,
during the pre-referendum debate, to convince Quebecers
they can hope to gain appropriate solutions to their problems.
The government has explained that it would not introduce a
bill on referendums because we feel it would be a provocation.

I think that really goes back to the question you were raising
as to what kind of flexibility we had and what were going to be
the impacts on the Canadian dollar. That is being monitored
very closely, and we have not been following blindly on the
general philosophy that whatever the United States does in
terms of their monetary policy or bank rate automatically has
to apply in Canada. There has, therefore, been some effort by
the present government to evaluate the impact of the differential in interest rates between Canada and the United States on
the value of the dollar. I might note that since the close on
Friday the dollar has been losing some ground. I am sure that
officials of the Ministry of Finance and of the Bank of Canada
are monitoring the situation very closely to see what further
developments will occur in the exchange market.
Again, I humbly suggest that an attempt be made to get a
fuller explanation from the Minister of Finance in terms of
what steps are being taken to monitor this process.

SENATE DEBATES
Government said, "He is, of course, also responsible for directing the economy."
By way of clarification, am 1 to understand that on this
second day of the Thirty-first Parliament it is the policy of this
government to have the economy of the country directed by
Senator de Cotret so that questions concerning the direction of
the economy are to be asked in this house, and not in the
House of Commons; and that in the House of Commons, when
a question is asked the Honourable Mr. Crosbie can say,
"That is up to Senator de Cotret because he is directing the
economy," and Senator de Cotret can say the question should
be asked of the Minister of Finance'?
Senator Flynn: Any question you have for any minister not
in this house can be directed to me or possibly to another
minister and it will be transmitted to that minister for reply,
unless you have given us notice in advance and we have
already obtained the reply. That is precise.
As far as the responsibilities of Senator de Cotret are
concerned, he is, so far as departments are concerned, responsible only for the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It may be that in his other capacity he will have
occasion to reply to some general questions. But when there
are specific questions, for instance, pertaining to the Department of Agriculture, he will not, in that capacity, reply for the
Minister of Agriculture.
If Senator de Cotret wants to explain his general responsibilities so far as econornic development is concerned, I invite
him to do so.
Senator Frith: May I ask whether it is truc that the Leader
of the Government in the Senate said, when responding for the
government in answer to the question, that Senator de Cotret
is responsible for directing the economy? Is that right or not?
Senator Flynn: One is responsible for one's departnent.
Senator de Cotret's department is Industry, Trade and Commerce. I shall give him the occasion to reply with regard to his
other responsibilities but, technically speaking, a question of
policy will have to be assessed in every case. But it may be a
question concerning agriculture and a matter concerning the
economy, and Senator de Cotret will take that question to the
Minister of Agriculture and report the reply.
Senator Oison: What about economic policy?
Senator Frith: In this government is Senator de Cotret
responsible for directing the economy, or not?
Senator Flynn: The cabinet is, generally.
Senator Perrault: On a matter of clarification, the Canadian
people have been given to understand that in this re-think of
cabinet structures and the whole format of government efforts
have been made to co-ordinate the activities of various government departments.
I understand, for example, that Senator de Cotret chairs an
economic committee of cabinet which involves representation
from finance and representation from other allied economic
portfolios. I find it very difficult to understand that here we
have a minister who has come to the Senate, and states that he
[Senator Frith.]

October 10, 1979

has no knowledge of the most fundamental economic policies
affecting Canada.
Senator Asselin: He did not say that.
*

(1540)

Senator Perrault: I can recall that during my own experience in cabinet there was shared information with respect to
economic policy, interest rates, and so forth. Are we to be told
that that information now can be obtained only by sending
messages from here to cabinet ministers' offices, that this
information must be verified there and transcribed, with a
laundered edition sent to the Senate for its perusal? If that is
the case, it is not good enough.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
LOSS OF SALE OF CAN DU REACTOR TO ARGENTINA

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, in view of the
strange and embarrassing spectacle of Canadian officials
attacking each other as scapegoats for the recent failure of the
federal government to sell a Candu reactor to Argentina,
would the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce inform
this chamber whether any corrective steps have been taken by
the government to prevent a repetition of such bungling that
produces more unemployment and a greater trade deficit?
Senator de Cotret: Certainly. I am happy to talk about the
situation with respect to the sale of the Candu reactor to
Argentina. As you are well aware, this involved complex
negotiation. i do not think that one can use a simple approach
to any one of the very difficult issues involved in the
transaction.
There were certainly a number of considerations on the part
of the Government of Argentina to the extent that we are
aware of the full consideration given the matter before they
reached their final decision. Certainly the fact that we had, in
years past, a rather poor performance on the sale of the first
reactor to Argentina weighed quite heavily in their decision.
As you know, the reactor sold several years ago involved
several delays in bringing it on line, and also significant cost
overruns. That is certainly something that must have been
considered in arriving at their final decision.
We also know that the Government of Argentina was concerned about "sole-sourcing" for nuclear energy. They were
concerned about the possibility of having all of the nuclear
energy technology provided by a single country and were
interested in having a diversity of sources. That, by the way, is
probably one of the reasons that, in announcing their decision
on this particular reactor, they took steps to underline the fact
that their decision applied to this next step of their program
but not to the program as a whole.
Certainly the changes in the past with respect to the safeguards were involved in their decision. As you will recall, the
prior government changed the safeguards requirements twice.
We insisted time and time again that we would require full
scope safeguards with the Argentineans. I am sure you will
agree that that was, essentially, the position of the prior

SENATE DEBATES

October 10, 1979

government. We wanted to ensure that those safeguards were
met. I do not think there was any misunderstanding on the
part of the Argentineans on that account.
I think all of these considerations bore on their final decision. 1, for one, said publicly that I was disappointed that we
had not been granted the contract. It is something that is
regrettable, but I can assure you that the decision on their part
was a complex one and I do not think we can tie it into any one
specific thing. It is certainly an area, in terms of the future
sales of nuclear technology around the world, that is under
very active consideration right now.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
CURTAILMENT OF FOREIGN AID

Senator Haidasz: I have a supplementary question which I
think would be better answered by the Minister of State for
the Canadian International Development Agency.
Would the minister inform the chamber what countries
would have their foreign aid cut off or curtailed in consequence of the statement made by the Secretary of State for
External Affairs that their domestic and foreign policies are
abhorrent to Canada's views on civil liberties and human
rights?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: A joint Senate and Commons committee
might be set up to review Canada's foreign affairs and foreign
aid policy. At that time, all the relevant information will be
given and a decision will be made regarding the proceedings
and the findings of the committee.
[English|
Senator van Roggen: Is the minister announcing another
joint committee not mentioned in the Speech from the Throne
yesterday?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I am not announcing
that a new committee is being established. I am merely saying
that we are considering setting up a joint Senate and Commons committee to study Canada's foreign affairs and foreign
aid policy.
[English]
Senator van Roggen: My apologies. I understood the minister to say that there would be such a committee.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
MEETING OF UNALIGNED NATIONS, HAVANA, CUBAREFERENCES TO CANADA

Senator Bird: Honourable senators, I have a question for the
Leader of the Government in the Senate which I hope he will
answer on behalf of the Secretary of State for External
Affairs.
In light of the recent remarks made by the Secretary of
State for External Affairs about the ingratitude of Pakistan,

would the Leader of the Government supply the Senate with a
transcription of every reference to Canada that was made at
the meeting of unaligned nations in Havana, Cuba?
Senator Flynn: I will try to supply the honourable senator
with that information.
SPEECHES OF MINISTER AT UNITED NATIONS AND EMPIRE
CLUB, TORONTO

Senator Bird: I have a supplementary question. Recent
speeches made by the Secretary of State for External Affairs
at the United Nations and at the Empire Club in Toronto were
reported. However, we have not received them here in full.
Could you supply us with transcriptions of the words uttered;
not what was in the written text?
Senator Flynn: I am surprised that the text of the speeches
has not been distributed. However, I certainly will obtain one
for Senator Bird.
THE ECONOMY
EFFECT OF INCREASE IN BANK RATE AND OIL PRICE ON
COMPETITIVE POSITION OF EXPORTERS

Senator Bosa: I have a question for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In view of the substantial increase
in the interest rate announced yesterday, and in view of the
stated government policy that there will be a rapid increase in
the price of oil to the level of that in international markets,
which is bound to increase the cost of production, what
measures is the minister proposing to take to maintain the
competitive position of our exporters?
Senator de Cotret: First of al], I should like to state that we
have never talked about the actual speed at which the price of
domestic crude would approach world prices. I should like to
emphasize that we have talked about the domestic price of
energy over time approaching world prices. The Minister of
Energy, and for that matter the Prime Minister, have both
made it very clear that in order to protect our competitive
position in world markets, the domestic price of crude would
not be allowed to surpass the price of crude in the U.S., the
Chicago price, and would not be allowed to get to the actual
level of world prices. In other words, we would maintain a
differential which would be in the interest of the Canadian
competitive position abroad.
Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question. Would the
minister tell us whether it is government policy to narrow the
gap between the domestic price and the international price, or
allow it to widen as happened in 1979.
Senator de Cotret: Once again, as you well know, the
specific question of oil pricing and the schedule for further
increases in oil pricing is one that is under active discussion
between the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Energy, the
Prime Minister and their provincial counterparts. It is not our
intention, however, to allow the gap to widen. It is our stated
position that we feel that gradually over time the domestic

SENATE DEBATES
price of crude should be allowed to approach the world level
and to approach the U.S. level.
Senator Bosa: A supplementary question. The minister did
not answer the first part of my question which related to the
increase in interest rates and how that affects the cost of
production.

•

(1550)

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I am a little bit at
a loss. It seemed to me that the question was directed to our
competitive position. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in
interest rates in Canada has been less than has been the case
with our major trading partners. That being so, we could not
possibly be losing any competitive advantage. If anything, I
would suggest that we are gaining competitive advantage by
not increasing our interest rates as rapidly as are our major
trading partners.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
LOSS OF SALE OF WHEAT TO RUSSIA

Senator Hays: Honourable senators, 1 should like to ask a
question of the Minister of lndustry, Trade and Commerce. A
week or ten days ago, the Minister of Transport, the minister
responsible for the Wheat Board, flew to Poland to finalize a
sale of 4 million tons of wheat to that country. While he was in
Poland, Russia quietly purchased 25 million tons of wheat
from the United States.
Was the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce aware
of Russia's need for 25 million tons of wheat, and if so, was it
a pricing problem that prevented Canada from making that
sale, or was it simply that we were not aware of Russia's
requirement in this regard, as a result of which we failed to tap
that market-a market which is traditionally ours.
Senator de Cotret: I am afraid I cannot give a specific
answer to that question. I will be happy to look into it and
provide an answer with the shortest possible delay.
YUKON TERRITORY
RESIGNATION OF COMMISSIONER

Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Justice.
Instructions were given to the Yukon Commissioner, lone
Christensen, yesterday, which brought about her resignation.
Unfortunately, she learned of those instructions from a Whitehorse reporter. Were those instructions discussed with the
Yukon Legislative Assembly and with the native leaders of the
Yukon, who represent 30 per cent of the population; and if not,
why not?
Senator Flynn: I am afraid I am not familiar with the
circumstances mentioned by the honourable senator. I shall
look into it and try to provide a reply tomorrow.
[Senator de Cotret.]

October 10, 1979

GOVERNMENT POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

Senator Lucier: While he is looking into it perhaps the
minister would obtain one or two other answers for me.
The minister's letter states that the principal objective is to
move to full responsible government. The Prime Minister
stated during the election campaign that a referendum will
take place to determine what the residents of the Yukon want
in terms of constitutional development. Would the minister
please inform this chamber as to what the actual policy of the
government is? Will the Yukon Territory have a choice in this
matter, or will it be a matter that is decided in Ottawa?
The minister's letter goes on to state that he will convene a
meeting between the Government of Canada, the Yukon Territorial Government and the Council for Yukon Indians. Why
was such a meeting not convened before these announcements
were made, and will a meeting now be convened, and when?
It seems a little bit late for the meeting to take place, since
the action has been taken, but I would like to have answers to
those questions.
Senator Flynn: This matter is not within the responsibility of
my department. I shall obtain a reply for the honourable
senator.
Senator van Roggen: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might put a supplementary question to the Leader of the
Government in the Senate. Would he also include in the reply
a statement as to whether the Commissioner was instructed, or
whether instructions otherwise went forward, that the Leader
of the Government in the Territorial Council should refer to
himself as "Premier" in future.
Senator Flynn: I will.
Senator van Roggen: My question is a serious one.
Senator Flynn: I do not doubt it. However, I can sometimes
smile without taking anything away from the seriousness of
the matter.
HOUSE OF COMMONS
ACCOMMODATION IN SENATE GALLERY

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I should like to address
a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I
am wondering whether he, or any other representative of this
chamber, regardless of party affiliation, was consulted before
10 seats were taken by the Prime Minister in the gallery in the
other place which has traditionally been reserved for senators
and their guests.
Senator Marshall: That is a question for the order paper.
Senator Flynn: I must say, honourable senators, I was not
consulted. It was probably donc in consultation with the
Speaker of the other place. If the honourable senator wishes
me to enquire, I shall try to bring in a report eventually.

SENATE DEBATES

October 10, 1979
THE CABINET

INTERNATIONAL TRADE

MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SENATE

SALES POLICY RESPECTING CANDU REACTORS

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to raise
what I think is an important matter. I am wondering whether
the Leader of the Government will undertake to let us know
tomorrow, or at least soon, to whom we should direct our
questions.
There are three ministers in this chamber who have specific
departmental responsibilities-that is, they are responsible for
details respecting those departments or activities of those
departments-and in that respect we do not have any problem.
There is, however, a problem as to whether or not these
ministers are going to answer questions on matters of policyeconomic policy, social policy and, in some respects, international policy. It would save a lot of time if we knew to whom
these questions should be directed.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, perhaps I should prepare a written reply to dissipate any doubt that there might be
in this regard. May I suggest to the honourable senator that in
previous Parliaments, when there was only one member of the
administration-namely, the Leader of the Government-in
the Senate, all questions were directed to him, following which
he went and sought out replies. Unless be was given prior
notice of the question, he would go to the appropriate minister
for a reply.
The situation in this place is now very much improved and,
as is now obvious, honourable senators opposite are interested
in putting a good many questions to members of the cabinet in
this place. We will deal with those questions as best we can.
Subject to any prepared reply I might give tomorrow, each
minister in this place is responsible for his department. If a
question does not relate to one of those departments, it should
be addressed to me, and I shall deal with it in the same
manner as did the previous Leader of the Government-and
probably better.
Senator Oison: I have a further supplementary question.
The minister no doubt recalls being in Calgary a few days ago
and advising people that the top priority of this government
was freedom of information. Reference to that was also contained in the Speech from the Throne. So, I presume that in
addition to having three times as many ministers here, we are
going to have this "practice what you preach" attitude, with
the result that we can expect to get answers more rapidly. I
would ask the minister, therefore, to assure us that this is
going to happen in regard to questions of policy. Specific
details obviously have to be sought out.
Senator Flynn: As policies are defined by the government,
they will be announced. While the policy of greater access to
government information will not make the process quicker, it
will make it wider. That is the purpose of the legislation, as I
understand it.

Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. As I read
the speech given by the Minister of External Affairs to the
United Nations Assembly, she had, in a most eloquent
manner, listed a number of countries which, in her opinion,
had drastically violated human rights.
Is it the policy of the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce, therefore, to instruct his department not to pursue
an active policy of selling Candu reactors to the countries
listed by the Minister of External Affairs in that speech?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, that is a question
that bas been discussed between myself and the Minister of
External Affairs. I can assure honourable senators that there is
no difficulty whatsoever in terms of actively pursuing the sale
of further nuclear technology to Argentina.
Senator Thompson: But with respect to any country that has
violated human rights, there would be no problem?
Senator de Cotret: There would be no problem with respect
to Argentina. I can assure honourable senators that if the
Minister of External Affairs felt strongly that a country was
violating human rights, she would bring that to my attention,
and we would act accordingly.

•

(1600)

Senator Thompson: I think she has brought it to the attention of Canada and the world through ber speech to the United
Nations. Having brought to your attention the violation of
human rights in those countries, what is your intention with
respect to the sale of Candu reactors to those countries?
Senator de Cotret: I think that question bas already been
answered. We have not been able to sell the Candu reactor to
Argentina. There was full consultation between myself and the
Secretary of State for External Affairs. There is no conflict in
our approach to this. We have insisted on total safeguards, and
I think our position is very clear. However, should the question
arise again we will deal with it at that time. I should hate to
try to answer a hypothetical question about the future when
there is no active case under consideration.
ENERGY
MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I should like to
address a question to Senator de Cotret in his dual ministerial
capacity. In so doing, let me say that I very much welcome his
presence in the house and the increased vigour with which I
believe our question period and our debates will be conducted,
and in particular the flow of economic information I believe we
will be getting as a result of his being here.
I might say in parenthesis that I still do not understand the
difference between his capacity as Minister of State for Economic Development and that of other economic ministers such
as the Minister of Finance or the President of the Treasury

SENATE DEBATES
Board. No doubt Senator de Cotret, by way of an answer to
this question-which is not quite phrased as a question-will
help us understand the difference.
I would like to ask him what is meant by the government in
the phrase "encourage a significant reduction in Canada's
overall energy consumption". This phrase appears in the
Speech from the Throne and it seems to threaten a really
difficult economic period being introduced in Canada. I would
like to ask whether the government means to tell industry and
consumers in this country that there must be a reduction in
overall energy consumption; and, if that is what is meant,
whether the minister has done a study of the impact on the
various Canadian industrial sectors with respect to the cost of
such an energy reduction; and, finally, what is meant by the
word "significant". That is a word that this house has debated
in other contexts. Does il mean 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per
cent? What are you asking Canadians to do when you ask
them to reduce their overall energy consumption?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, if I might address
the question as to the exact wording in the Speech from the
Throne on encouraging conservation, I would like to mention
to honourable senators once again a fact I am sure they are
well acquainted with, and that is that we in Canada are the
highest per capita consumers of energy anywhere in the world,
and when we talk about conservation, certainly in an energyshort world, if we are ever going to achieve our goal of energy
self-sufficiency, we have to place some emphasis on and attach
some importance to the need for a nation such as ours to
conserve energy. That will come as no surprise. We have had
programs in the past, that the previous government introduced,
with that very idea in mind, so that as much energy as possible
might be conserved. I have in mind the insulation program,
among others.
In putting together the new energy policy which the Minister of Energy will announce shortly, we are attaching significance to the conservation of energy. Keeping in mind, once
again, that we are the highest consumers of energy per capita
in the world, conservation has to be as much a part of an
energy strategy in this country as the enhancement of supply,
and that, I think, is what the Speech from the Throne referred
to.

In terms of specific conservation goals, I am afraid I will
have to ask the Minister of Energy to give me an indication if
there is a specific target to be met and by what time.
Senator Austin: May I just draw the honourable senator's
attention to the difference between encouraging a significant
reduction in Canada's overall energy consumption and
encouraging a reduction in the rate of growth of Canada's
energy consumption? I believe the former could very seriously
dislocate Canadian industry.
As for the question you would like me to ask, may I ask the
minister whether there is any intention on the part of this
government to introduce any amendments to the Petroleum
Administration Act and the amendments which were made to
it by the previous government, to reduce in any way the powers
[Senator Austin.]

October 10, 1979

which the federal government retains under that act to set the
price of oil and natural gas in Canada?
Senator de Cotret: I will take that question under notice and
I will give an answer to il as soon as I possibly can.
Senator Hays: Mr. Minister, is the government planning
any rationing so far as conservation is concerned?
Senator de Cotret: The answer to that question is no.
THE CABINET
MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SENATE

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I believe the Leader
of the Government in the Senate has just indicated that
questions that are not within the ambit of responsibility of the
three ministers here can be asked of them and they will check
with the appropriate minister in the other place as to the
answer. I think it is important, then, that we know exactly
what the responsibilities of the ministers who sit in this
chamber are. In respect to Senator de Cotret, I think I
understand what is meant by his responsibilities as Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce, but I wonder if he could
delineate for this chamber what his responsibilities are as
Minister of State for Economic Development.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I would be very
happy to say a few words on that topic while reserving the
opportunity to give a somewhat fuller description in writing of
the responsibilities of the Minister of State for Economic
Development.
Essentially, the Minister of State for Economic Development plays a co-ordinating role between the line economic
departments of government. That co-ordinating role is played
through a cabinet committee on economic development. The
Ministry of State for Economic Development acts as a substantive secretariat to the cabinet committee, and is available
to all the ministers who sit on that cabinet committee.
An honourable senator mentioned that the Minister of
Finance and the President of the Treasury Board also sit on
that committee, and they do. But they do not sit on that
committee as do the line departments; they sit on all policy
committees as ex officio members. In other words, il is not the
responsibility of the cabinet committee on economic development to deal with matters, for example, that would be contained in the budget, nor is il the responsibility of the cabinet
committee on economic development to deal with matters
directly related to the Treasury Board. So the President of the
Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance sit on the cabinet
committee on economic development and all other policy
committees of cabinet.
The departments that do report directly to the cabinet
committce on economie development are the line departments
of government that have an economic mission in life, and the
role of the chairman of that committee is one of co-ordination
within the new system of expenditure management that we as
a government have put in place over the last few months.

October 10, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

As I say, I will be happy to give a more detailed description,
in writing, of the role of the committee, the role of the
chairman, and the role of the Minister of State, and I shall
endeavour to do that in the very near future.
Senator Everett: I thank the minister, because I feel that
that would be very useful to the members of the Senate.
However, it would help us greatly if the minister could now
verbally tell us what those line departments are that report to
the committee.
* (1610)

Senator de Cotret: I will do my best at it. I hope I do not
forget any. There is Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Energy,
Transport. Obviously there is Industry, Trade and Commerce.
There is DREE.
Senator Mellraith: CIDA?
Senator de Cotret: No, CIDA reports to the cabinet Committee on External Affairs and Defence.
Senator Oison: Communications?
Senator de Cotret: Communications? No, I am sorry, not
Communications. I have already mentioned Fisheries. Labour.
I had not mentioned the Ministry of Labour. I think I mentioned Transport and Regional Economic Expansion. The part
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that deals with
northern development. Indian Affairs reports to the Social
Affairs Committee.
The Minister of State for Federal-Provincial Relations sits
on the Economic Development Comrnmittee, but of course there
is a cabinet policy committee in that area so federal-provincial
matters are not discussed in the Economic Development
Committee.
I think I mentioned Agriculture. Employment and Immigration. Apart from the unemployment insurance aspect, Employment and Immigration reports to Economic Developrnent.
I mentioned Industry, Trade and Commerce. The Minister
of State for Science and Technology. I think that is a complete
list.
Senator Everett: Let us take the example of DREE, Mr.
Minister, which reports to the committee. Is it possible that
because DREE is involved solely in development that the
minister then would be capable of answering questions about
the Department of Regional Economic Expansion?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I wish to make it
clear that to the extent that I am able to answer questions
relating to ail of these departments, I will be happy to provide
whatever information I can. To the extent that questions deal
with the operations of the departments and are not of course
subject to discussion in committee, I will endeavour to obtain
from my colleagues the appropriate information and, as
expeditiously as possible, present that to the Senate.
Senator Everett: What I am trying to delineate is to whom
we should direct certain questions. This is important to us
because the efficiency in asking and answering questions is
important to this chamber. Certain questions the Leader of the

Government has said we should ask him and he will endeavour
to obtain the answers, but where we are dealing strictly with
development, as I understand it, the minister, I gather, would
be capable of answering those questions, even though they
involve another department, because, indeed, in his capacityand I must give this name correctly-as Minister of State for
Economic Development, he is dealing specifically with the
departments on that point.
I just wanted to make it clear that if a matter comes up in
respect of DREE, and the development work that DREE has
done, we should put that question directly to the minister and
not to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, that is correct.
Senator Everett: Thank you.
ENERGY
SUFFICIENCY OF DOMESTIC RESOURCES

Senator van Roggen: I have a question for the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce.
I assume that the committee which he chairs would have
had an item in the Speech from the Throne directly relating to
energy come before his committee. If not, he may wish to
discuss this question with the Minister of Energy before giving
a reply.
In the Speech from the Throne his government says, and I
quote:
my Government is committed to making Canada selfsufficient in energy by 1990.
I may not have the same interpretation of the word "selfsufficient" as has the minister, but as of the last year for which
I have figures, if you take aIl of Canada's energy exports and
imports, including electricity, coal, oil, gas and uranium, we
have a surplus in our balance of trade.
Senator Asselin: You are making a speech. Ask a question.
Senator van Roggen: No, no. I am asking a question. I will
come to the point very quickly.
Senator Asselin: You are making a speech.
Senator van Roggen: I am entitled to a preamble in asking a
question.
Senator Asselin: But you are making a speech.
Senator van Roggen: No, I am not making a speech.
Senator Asselin: Well, it is a long preamble.
Senator van Roggen: So that the minister can understand
my question, I have to put to him that, when you take aIl of
our energy trade, we have a surplus of about $2 billion a year,
and it is going up. So I would suggest that we are self-sufficient in energy. I would suggest to him that this wording is
misleading to the Canadian public, and that perhaps what his
government is trying to seek is self-sufficiency in oil.
My question is: Will the minister let this chamber know, in
answer to my question, whether or not this is meant to be

SENATE DEBATES
self-sufficiency in oil by 1990, or whether it is also to mean
self-sufficiency in coal, in which we are presently in imbalance
because we import more coal in the east than we export in the
west? Is it meant to be self-sufficiency in petro-chemicals,
meaning a combination of oil and gas, or are we to balance our
exports of gas against our imports of oil?
These are very important questions. This statement is meaningless as stated in the Speech from the Throne, because we
are presently more than self-sufficient in energy to the tune of
$2 billion a year.
I have asked three questions and I think the minister has
them.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I certainly have
one question: What is meant by the term "self-sufficiency"? I
would be pleased to answer that question specifically.
What we mean when we talk about self-sufficiency by 1990
is that Canada would be independent from foreign sources of
supply. In other words, not only that we have, in terms of
consumption in Canada, an equal amount of production, part
of which may be sold abroad to compensate for part of which
may be bought abroad, but that we in Canada will not have to
rely, by 1990, on foreign sources of energy supply. That is
what is meant by the term "self-sufficiency."
Senator van Roggen: Does that include coal as well as oil?
Senator de Cotret: It includes everything. It means that we
not be dependent at that point on foreign sources of energy
supply; that we can at that point be self-sufficient within
Canada on a coast-to-coast basis.
Senator van Roggen: I have a supplementary which was part
of my original question. That specifically includes coal?
Senator de Cotret: Yes.
Senator van Roggen: I might remind the minister that we
will import a lot of coal into eastern Canada at the moment
from the eastern United States, which is cheaper than bringing
it all the way from western Canada. It would seem to me that
his answer would be that by 1990 we will not be importing coal
from the United States but will be bringing it from western
Canada. Is that correct?
Senator de Cotret: That is the intention. We would be
self-sufficient by 1990, in the sense that we would be able to
supply ourselves fully from domestic resources.
Senator van Roggen: Thank you very much.
THE ECONOMY

October 10, 1979

out of Canada into the United States or into other countries,
how much money is involved?
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator is asking a
question that I struggled with for a great number of years in
my former incarnation. The elasticity, to put it in technical
terms, and I am afraid I don't know how to explain it
otherwise, but the elasticity of capital flows to changes in
interest rate differentials is something that has escaped me for
a great number of years, and it varies. It varies. It is not
something that will be constant over time. It depends on a
number of psychological factors, a number of market factors,
and one month you may have a small change in interest rate
differentials or the value of currencies that will mean a large
outflow, or vice versa, and another month it may be quite the
opposite. I don't think there is any constancy in that.
Senator Hays: The trade deficit dropped another $161
million in the last six weeks, or something like that. Did that
have anything to do with triggering the boosting of the interest
rate?
* (1620)

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, the short answer to
that question is no. There is no question that when one looks at
the total system, the current account position does have an
impact on our foreign exchange position and the foreign value
of the Canadian dollar. Certainly one could argue that if the
stream is followed down far enough, it probably does have a
distant relationship. However, I believe the short answer to the
question would be no.
Senator Hays: As a supplementary, the Minister of Finance
said that we did not necessarily have to follow the United
States in raising interest rates, that we could carry on quite
well without having to do so. In some cases our interest rates
are now up to 15 per cent, and many banks have added
another one per cent.
When the Governor of the Bank of Canada telephoned the
Minister of Finance-and I am sure the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce must have been there, because he is part
of that committee-what figures were given to that committee
so that it agreed that the Governor of the Bank of Canada
should go ahead and hike interest rates to an all-time high?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I feel at case in
answering only part of the question. The Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce was not a party to that conversation,
and therefore I cannot answer the substance of the question. I
shall have to refer the question to my colleague.

INCREASE IN BANK RATE

EXCHANGE VALUE OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Hays: Honourable senators, I should like to direct a
question to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce in
connection with interest. I believe the interest rate that the
bank is charging now to its blue chip customers is 134 per
cent.
What triggered the government and the Bank of Canada to
increase the interest rate? If it is a drain on the money going

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. The Governor
of the Bank of Canada, in his statement, said that one of the
reasons why interest rates in Canada had to be increased was
that we could not allow the Canadian dollar to fall any further
in terms of the currencies of our major trading partners
because of the inflationary effect that would have.

[Senator van Roggen.]

SENATE DEBATES

October 10, 1979

Given that the government agrees with the action of the
Governor of the Bank of Canada, does that indicate that there
is now a floor under the Canadian dollar?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I shall raise that
question with my colleague, the Minister of Finance, and will
be happy to provide a specific answer.
CROWN CORPORATIONS
PROPOSED DISPOSAL OF ASSETS OF PETRO-CANADA

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
the Leader of the Government whether there is any intention
on the part of the government to introduce amendments to the
Petro-Canada Act in this session of Parliament.
Senator Flynn: The honourable senator knows the situation.
No action will be taken by the government before it receives
the report of the task force which is presently studying the
kind of assets of Petro-Canada that might be disposed of.
Senator Austin: Could the Leader of the Government tell
the Senate whether that task force is an official government
advisory group or a party group, and whether it is being paid
by the government for its services?
Senator Flynn: By the government.
Senator Austin: I wonder whether the government leader
would give us in writing its terms of reference, so that we can
determine whether it has been asked the principal question-Is
Petro-Canada in the public interest and should it be kept in
the public interest as a crown corporation?-or whether it has
been asked some lesser question.
Senator Flynn: I will provide the honourable senator with
that document.
Senator Austin: Will the government leader also undertake
to provide us with the report of the task force as soon as it is
available?
Senator Flynn: Yes, in due course.
Senator Austin: In accordance with freedom of information.
Senator Flynn: Yes, in accordance with.

STATUS OF WOMEN
ANNIVERSARY OF PRIVY COUNCIL DECISION

Senator Quart: Honourable senators, may I draw your
attention to the fact that October 18 is a very special day for
women senators, past, present and future, for it was on that
day 50 years ago that women became persons in the eyes of
the law and were eligible to be appointed to the Senate of
Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Quart: It might be apropos to refresh our memories
as to how and when women were first admitted to the Senate.

In fact, every woman senator owes a debt of gratitude to five
public-spirited women from Alberta. They are Mrs. Emily
Murphy, Mrs. Nellie McClung, Mrs. Louise McKinney, Mrs.
H. M. Edwards and the Honourable Irene Parlby.
Those five women, after years of sacrifice and struggle, and
after having had their pleas rejected by the Canadian Parliament, presented their case to the Supreme Court of Canada
and lost. However, undaunted, they carried their case before
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in London,
England, stating their argument that Canadian women be
considered as "persons" in the eyes of the law and, as such, be
eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada.
The vital question was debated pro and con as to whether
women were "persons" under the terms of the B.N.A. Act of
1867. The case was heard in July 1929. After convincing
argument and anxious consideration, their lordships found that
the word "persons" included both men and women, and from
that time on women, as "persons," were eligible to be appointed to the Senate of Canada.
It was a great victory for those five women, for the decision
of the Privy Council in England reversed the decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada.
The struggle commenced in 1916, and those five women
battled all obstacles for 13 long years before achieving their
goal. I am sure they must be chuckling with glee from their
heavenly abode because, after all these years, a woman from
Alberta has been appointed to the Senate of Canada. I refer to
the Honourable Martha Bielish.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Quart: It is interesting to note what started those
five women on the warpath. It was not a case of "Cherchez la
femme," but "Cherchez l'homme," for on July 1, 1915, which
was Justice Murphy's first day on the bench of the magistrate's court in Edmonton, Alberta, the defence counsel, Mr.
Eardley Jackson, enraged at the stiff sentence meted out to his
client, objected and rudely told her that she was not eligible to
sit as a judge as she was not a "person" in the eyes of the law.
The Supreme Court of Alberta supported the decision of
Justice Murphy, and it was the spark that lit the fire that
launched those five women on their campaign. I repeat, that
incident was the match that lit the flame that sparked the
campaign to change the B.N.A. Act so that women might be
considered "persons" in the eyes of the law. Next week, at
various places in Canada, there will be celebrations marking
the anniversary of that wonderful event.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session.
Senator Bielish moved:
That the following Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada:

SENATE DEBATES
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Edward Richard Schreyer, Chancellor and principal Companion of
Our Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of
Our Order of Military Merit upon whom We have conferred Our Canadian Forces' Decoration, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the
Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg Icave to
offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the
gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to
both Houses of Parliament.
She said: Honourable senators, as 1 rise in this chamber on
the occasion of my very first address to this body, in connection with the introduction of this motion, I feel compelled to
note that my mere presence here today as a recent Senate
appointee reflects sornething of a momentous occasion in the
annals of this house, However, please allow me quickly to
explain such a rema
,rk, lest you think the effect of this
appointment has been to alter my sense of propriety.
1 am indeed highly honoured to have been asked to serve in
such a prestigious body as the Senate of Canada, and 1 am
cognizant of the extensive traditions associated with this
chamber. The significant contribution to the governing and
understanding of this nation made both by senators present
today and by your predecessors serves as an appropriate
testimony to the conscientious and vibrant fashion in which
senators have approached their functions. As a lifelong resident of a rural community in Alberta, J feel very humble in the
presence of such an assembly of talent and expertise. May J
simply say that my fondest hope is that in the framework of
Senate activity 1, also, will be able to make a worthwhile
contribution, so as not to disappoint anyone in my discharging
of the public responsibility which has been placed upon me.
Yet J am able to repeat, without any fear of appearing to
indulge in self-aggrandisement, that my mere presence as a
newly appointed member of this body reflects an occasion of
real import. In making this assessment I refer to the final
determination, in 1929, of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council of, specifically, the case of Henrietta Muir Edwards
and others v. the Attorney-General for Canada. This decision
of the Privy Council, on appeal from the Supreme Court of
Canada, is popularly known as the "persons" case, and represents a landmark decision in which Lord Sankey concluded, in
his majority judgment, that women were indeed persons within
the meaning of the British North America Act. As a result,
women became eligible for appointment to this body, the
Senate of Canada.
In its era this was a most remarkable step forward for the
women of the nation. Accordingly, in a representative rather
than in an individual fashion, my appointment is noteworthy
inasmuch as il comes during this fiftieth anniversary year of
the 1929 "persons" decision, which we are currently celebrating, the precise date of which falls on October 18.
[Senator Bielish.]

October 10, 1979

The "persons" decision, in addition to providing a notable
breakthrough for Canadian women as they strove towards
equality in the most general sense, also serves as an excellent
historie reference point. In an attempt to assess the degree of
progress achieved, we can compare the era prior to the rendering of the "persons" decision with the era following it, which
has continued to the present day. It hardly need be said that at
the time of the passage of the British North America Act, in
1867, the rights and privileges independently retained by
women were far fewer than those held by their male counterparts. It was the traditional position of the common law that
women could not hold public office, and it was this circumstance which caused interpretative concerns for the Supreme
Court of Canada when il considered the Edwards case some
61 years later.
The precise point in question concerned section 24 of the
British North America Act, which provided that:
The Governor General shall from Time to Time, in the
Queen's Name, by Instrument under the Great Seal of
Canada, summon qualified Persons to the Senate;
The Supreme Court of Canada concluded that the legislative intent of this section could not have been to include
women within the group of qualified persons, since at that time
we did not permit any but those of the male population to hold
public office. Fortunately, the five Alberta petitioners who had
sponsored this constitutional reference, spearheaded by Emily
Murphy in association with Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie
McClung, Louise C. McKinney, and Irene Parlby, chose to
pursue the matter to the ultimate court of appeal, the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. It was this latter body which
decided that women were in fact contemplated as being within
that group of potentially qualified persons, and thus helped to
usher in a new era with regard to the social and political
advancement of Canadian women.
Lord Sankey, in his inspired judgment, reflected that:
The exclusion of women from all public offices is a relie
of days more barbarous than ours,
Lord Sankey chose not to be bound by earlier customs no
longer relevant, and, instead, adopted the "living tree"
approach to the interpretation. We would undoubtedly all
agree that his approach was a very suitable technique.
1 have referred to the decision in such depth only partially so
as to associate my own appointment with the fiftieth anniversary of this determination. In a very much broader and more
important sense the "persons" case and the circumstances in
which it arose, are of real assistance as we focus upon the
tremendous strides made by the women of this country in
subsequent decades.

e

(1640)

While it is vitally important to look ahead and contemplate
further necessary advances, I consider it equally important
that Canadian women have a sense of where they were and
that they be able to document the significant advances which
have been made. With particular reference to the "persons"
case, it opened a door, both literally and figuratively, for the

SENATE DEBATES

1 dare hope that my personal contribution will be of value.
The many years I spent serving the public and the private
sector as a professional, as an insurance broker, will perhaps
help set the nature of my participation in the affairs of the
state. Further, I think I am the first man in our profession to
serve in the Senate. I think therefore that I shall be able to see
and to analyse things in a new light, which will perhaps be
useful.
The profession I practice is not only that of a great number
of other Canadians, but is also one which relates to almost all
the working population. In my province, it is related to a
professional and commercial activity which plays an important
role in the economic picture of Quebec in addition to being a
major francophone presence in the financial community.
In this respect, I have been particularly impressed by the
new vision the Speech from the Throne is giving us with
respect to private enterprise. I take for example the common
denominator for thQ different economic positions. The government is clearly showing a favourable opinion of private enterprise. We cannot help, in my opinion, but welcome such an
attitude. For more than a decade the government, in general,
has systematically and openly opted for other directions. It is
now high time to concentrate our efforts on the spirit of
initiative and liberty of action. The trends of the past have
been reflected by an invading governmental presence in the
business of individuals and corporations. Their rights and
privileges to settle their own future are quite eroded today. It
seems to me that the Speech from the Throne is bringing us
back in a healthier direction for our collective future, most of
all because of the insight shown by the legislators' intentions,
for there is clearly a will to encourage increasingly the
individual spirit of initiative. It is also clear that its action will
not fall into excessiveness. For we would stand to lose much by
focusing indiscriminately on anything we did in the past.
Everywhere in the legislative menu of this session we can
denote a sense of balance; for that, too, we ought to rejoice.
This balance, coupled with firmness, can also be noted in the
government's attitude toward more important questions that
will have to be debated shortly, such as national unity. The
Speech from the Throne tells us that from now on, confrontation will be replaced by consultation in the relations between
federal and provincial governments. This is a turning point in
the constitutional debate because the fact that Quebec, which
I represent here today, is under a political regime dedicated to

October 10, 1979

separation may be due in part to some positions adopted by the
previous federal government which were stirring up dissension.
Out-and-out centralization could only end up in frustrations
which are felt not only in Quebec but in all other provinces as
well. We must suppress from our relations with the provinces
all sense of aggressiveness.
*

(1650)

[English]
As a professional involved in business I have learned that a
partnership will succeed only when there is mutual respect. In
just a decade we have witnessed its erosion through certain
attitudes and decisions. This Speech from the Throne gives
clear indication that we are heading in a new direction, and I
am personally relieved to sec that the last look Quebecers will
have at the functioning of our system before the referendum
will be one of a team working to solve our own economic
problems in a positive manner. Economic and financial wellbeing will go a long way in uniting this country. This seems to
be the direction the government intends to take, and I heartily
agree.
[Translation]
I do not think that the cause of Canadian unity is helped by
certain attitudes, that are often arrogant, of some federal
representatives. Allow me to say that the spirit of the Speech
from the Throne reveals a flexible federal government, willing
to prove that the central government, within the context of the
Canadian confederation, will succeed in improving the economic well-being of all Canadians. As a representative from
Quebec, more precisely from Kennebec, one of the most
picturesque spots in our country, I am proud and pleased to
start in public life as a promoter of that new perception of the
role of our two houses.
In conclusion, I should like to stress once again that it is by
making fully available to this house my means and efforts that
I hope to be in a position to make a worthy contribution.
Therefore, honourable senators, I am pleased to support the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne
because, in addition to numerous other strong points, which I
have no time to refer to, it is the start of a new era for Canada
for the promotion of private enterprise and gives a new orientation to the national unity issue.

QUESTION PERIOD
BANK OF CANADA
ALLEGED INSTRUCTIONS TO GOVERNOR

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, i should like to
direct a question to the minister described on page 19 of
Senate Hansard of yesterday as the "minister with the responsibility of directing economic development generally." It has
been reported this morning by the broadcast media that Mr.
Gerald Bouey, Governor of the Bank of Canada, has stated
that he will resign from his office if ordered by the government
to reduce the Bank of Canada interest rate. Will the minister
now advise whether the government has issued instructions
that the Governor of the Bank of Canada shall reduce the
bank rate?
*

(1415)

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, i should like to
make one point of clarification. In terms of the current title
assigned to my responsibilities in the cabinet, i am Minister of
State for Economic Development. i am not the minister
responsible for the general economic development of this country, although i certainly hope to make the maximum contribution i can.
Senator Olson: What does the term mean?
Senator de Cotret: To answer your specific question, i think
that Governor Bouey has repeated a position that he has taken
on a number of occasions, and I would only reiterate that there
is certainly no intention on the part of our government to ask
the governor to reduce or roll back the increase in interest
rates that he announced yesterday.
Honourable senators, I take this opportunity to answer
several questions asked yesterday by senators opposite.
Senator Perrault: May i pursue the subject before the
honourable minister gets into other areas, which we shall
certainly welcome shortly.
I must say that i think we all appreciate the clarifying
statement made by the minister that he is not in fact directing
the economic development of the country-a statement made
yesterday by his leader.

Senator Flynn: I disagree.
Senator Perrault: However, I think the opposition felt that
as there had been no correction in the official record of the
Senate, perhaps it was an accurate appellation.
Mr. Minister, has the government received such an
ultimatum from Mr. Bouey either verbally or written? Has
any communication been received from Mr. Bouey? The minister has stated there will be no direction issued to Mr. Bouey
that those interest rates should be rolled back. In turn, however, has Mr. Bouey provided the government with any of his
views with respect to the matter?
Senator de Cotret: Certainly not to my knowledge.
Senator Steuart: Perhaps i may follow this up, and direct a
question to the Leader of the Government, Senator Flynn. In
view of the statement made this morning on the television
program "Canada AM" by Alvin Hamilton, a member of
Parliament and a minister in the last Diefenbaker governmentSenator Asselin: That's a long time ago.
Senator Buckwold: We can hardly remember.
Senator Steuart: Alvin is from a long time back but he is
still very active-to your embarrassment, i am sure. He made
the statement that the action of Governor Bouey in raising the
interest rate was not Conservative policy.
Would the leader, on behalf of the government, either
endorse this statement by Mr. Hamilton or disassociate himself from it?
Senator Flynn: Mr. Hamilton speaks for himself.
Senator Steuart: Since Mr. Hamilton-and possibly Senator Flynn too-was one of the architects of the Coyne affair of
a few years ago, would Senator Flynn comment on the suggestion that this is the beginning of another Coyne affair, to try
once more to remove a Governor of the Bank of Canada from
office?
Senator Flynn: I am not sure. It would seem to be the wish
of the other side. It could be. But it is not the wish of the
government.
Senator Steuart: You had better straighten Mr. Hamilton
out.
Senator Buckwold: That is the other side of the coin.
Senator de Cotret: I am sure the author will want attribution for that.
THE ECONOMY
INCREASE IN BANK RATE

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, if i may, i should
like to respond to some of the questions raised on this topic
and other topics yesterday for which i had agreed to consult
my colleagues and report back today.
First, with reference to Senator Perrault's question concerning "personal doubts," which the Minister of Finance might

October 11, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
have been interpreted as having expressed yesterday morning
in a media interview, the Minister of Finance assured me, and
has asked me to convey to you, that he has not expressed any
such doubts on the policies being pursued at the moment.
e (1420)
Again with reference to Senator Perrault's questions concerning meetings with the Governor of the Bank of Canada,
the Minister of Finance assured me that, as always, he has
been in consultation with the Governor of the Bank of Canada
and that that is a practice he intends to follow.

savings, that being a home energy audit program being held in
co-operation with over 200 companies, the provinces and the
various provincial utilities. In addition, the National Film
Board is in the process of producing a series of industrial
conservation films, which will star David Suzuki.

POSSIBLE WINDFALL PROFITS TO CHARTERED BANKS

In co-operation with the Canadian Automobile Association,
the Quebec Motor League and the Ontario Motor League, we
have developed a number of promotional projects which will
demonstrate the potential for conservation of fuel in the
automobile consumption area. We are currently expanding the
national Energy Bus Program to include a new generation of
mini-buses, which will act to conserve energy.

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, with reference to
Senator Olson's question concerning the potential for windfall
profits in the banking system that might conceivably arise
from a higher interest rate structure, the Minister of Finance
assured me that, upon reviewing the situation, there is no
indication that such profits are now occurring but that he will
continue to monitor the situation.

There are mobile energy conservation information bands in
Saskatchewan and Ontario, and those programs are expected
to be expanded. Finally, there will be a public information
program in the spring to further promote automobile gas
savings which, as you well know, is a major source of energy
consumption in this country. The cost of that program is
estimated to be $400,000.

STRENGTH OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator de Cotret: Finally, with reference to Senator Buckwold's question on interest rates-the question being whether
or not this might not be the appropriate time to completely
disregard developments in international capital markets and
let the dollar find its own level and pursue a domestic monetary policy geared to the domestic policy considerations
alone-it is the belief of the Minister of Finance that this is
not the time to pursue such a policy.
ENERGY
MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION

Senator de Cotret: Senator Austin raised a question dealing
with potential amendments to the Petroleum Administration
Act and asked specifically whether there were any intentions
on the part of the government to introduce amendments to this
act that would reduce in any way the powers the federal
government retains under the act to set the price of oil and
natural gas. The response from the minister is that he is not
intending to change the powers of the federal government to
set the price of oil or natural gas.
There were further questions posed by Senator Austin concerning the new energy policy and strategy, specifically related
to the conservation efforts that we are pursuing. While the full
details of our energy policy will be announced shortly, I might
mention several of the activities that are now under way to
encourage conservation and some of the goals we are pursuing.
In terms of the activities, there is currently in progress a
public information campaign to promote energy conservation
at home, at an estimated cost of $600,000. Also, we have had
designated an International Energy Conservation month, with
the Governor General as the patron, and an International
Industrial Conference on Energy Conservation was held October 1 to 3 last. There is also a program to promote energy
[Senator de Cotret.]

In terms of the targets for conservation, our overall target,
as I discussed briefly yesterday and as I reiterate, is to gain
self-sufficiency, as I defined "self-sufficiency" yesterday, by
1990. More specifically, we are committed to reduce oil
imports to 600,000 barrels a day by 1985, down 50,000 a day
from the previous target. The 1979 target is to reduce net oil
imports by 100,000 barrels a day.
THE ECONOMY
INCREASE IN BANK RATE-POSSIBLE WINDFALL PROFITS TO
CHARTERED BANKS

Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question of the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce respecting the
reply he got from the Minister of Finance to my question
regarding windfall profits. If there is no reason for the Minister of Finance to believe that increasing the interest rate does,
in fact, increase bank profits, could he then explain why bank
profits increased anywhere from 35 to 58 per cent in the last
part of 1978 vis-à-vis the year earlier? This was through a
period when interest rates were escalating very rapidly, and I
simply do not understand how it is the Minister of Finance
cannot find any relationship between the two facts.
Senator de Cotret: As I say, the Minister of Finance has
told me that he sees no indication at this time to lead him to
the conclusion that the latest increases in interest rates-and I
am talking about the increases over the last several monthshave led to any windfall profits. He is monitoring the situation
closely. I sec no reason why there would be an automatic link
between the two.
Senator Oison: A further supplementary. If a 38 to 58 per
cent increase in profits in one year does not constitute a
windfall profit, then I should like to have the minister's
definition of a windfall profit.

SENATE DEBATES

Also, if the Minister of Finance cannot find any evidence,
would the minister like me to send him some research that I
have done on the effect of interest rate increases?
Senator Flynn: When did you do that?

CROWN CORPORATIONS
DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

[Translation]
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and Minister of State for Economic Development. I am sorry that he
qualified the responsibilities of his portfolio earlier in his first
statement, but I still wish to ask him a question.
Since all Canadians are shareholders in Canadair, we would
like to know if we would be told beforehand of the terms of the
transfer of Canadair if ever the government decides to sell it so
that we may discuss those terms, because not only the matter
of price would be involved but also the question of research,
technology and development in an industrial sector which is of
interest to Canada as a whole.
Senator de Cotret: Of course, honourable senators, the
terms of any possible transfer of Canadair, as well as that of
any other corporation which we may consider returning to the
private sector, will be made public. I can say that a committee
has now- been asked to study the terms of such a transfer.
Certain very specific conditions have been laid down.
First of all, these corporations will have to be sold to
Canadian interests. They will have to continue to play their
strategic role in their own industry.
In this particular case, and as Minister of Industry, Trade
and Commerce, I can say that two such corporations are now
being studied: Canadair and de Havilland.
As you are well aware, honourable senators, when the
Canadian government decided to get directly involved in the
management of these corporations, they were both in financial
difficulty. The then government decided for the good of the
Canadian industry to step in in order to put these industries
back on their feet. These were key industries. They are still
extremely important in the industrial development of this
sector. Therefore, the final decision as to whether to privatize
one or both of these companies must be made only after a
complete review of our strategy in the field of aeronautics.
This review should be completed by the end of November.
Until now, the decision has only been made in principle. We
are considering the terms of a sale. We are also studying the
strategy that we want to apply to this industry so as to ensure
that these companies, whether they are sold to the private
sector or remain under public control, will be able to continue
to meet our objectives for this industry.

Senator Marchand: I have a supplementary, honourable
senators. You say that these terms will be made known. I well
expected that we should learn of them eventually. However, I
would like to know whether these terms will be known before
the sales agreement is formally reached or only after the
documents will have been signed.
I do not want to delay the proceedings unduly, but I have
another question? Will Canadians be given first choice to
purchase these two companies or could American interests
possibly take them over?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I would like to
repeat, so that there will be no misunderstanding, that there is
no question of selling these companies to foreign interests.
They will be sold to Canadians.
This statement was made by my colleague, the President of
the Treasury Board, and was repeated during our news conference when the decision was announced in principle. There
must be absolutely no doubt and no misunderstanding on this
point: The companies which will be privatized will be turned
over to the Canadian private sector. They will be placed in
Canadian hands.
As for the terms of a possible sale, they will of course be
known before the sales. However, there will certainly not be
any public auction. It is in the interest of all those who may be
interested in acquiring shares in this industry or in other
industries which would be more viable in the private sector to
know the terms on which the transfer will be made.
Therefore, in answer to your question, I can say that these
terms will be known well before any agreement is reached.
Senator Marchand: Allow me a last question, honourable
senators.
Is getting rid of profitable companies and acting only when
companies are in financial difficulty a policy of the government or a principle it considers valid?
Senator de Cotret: No, not at all. I think you will agree that
the government has a role to play in the industrial development of the country, which can sometimes bring it to take an
active part in a purely commercial undertaking.
However, when we try to analyze the role of the government, we really have to ask ourselves whether our future role
will allow us to keep an interest in a company the main
product of which is at the moment almost exclusively jets
intended for a very restricted market. At the present time, the
company is truly a business concern. The government bas
played its role. It has put that company back on its feet during
the last few years. The firm is now profitable again. Now, as
far as public policy is concerned, the government has no longer
a role to play that it could justify. In that case, I think the only
logical thing to do is to privatize companies like Canadair.

ELDORADO CORPORATION

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. I refer to the statement made, as I understand

SENATE DEBATES
it, by the President of the Treasury Board, that the Eldorado
Corporation would not be sold, or that the Saskatchewan
interest in the Eldorado Corporation would not be considered,
because the government did not want to denationalize an
industry in order to provincialize it. So my question to the
minister is this: If the Saskatchewan goveriment should show
such an interest in this corporation as to make the highest bid,
does he not feel that this would be a good thing to accept, and
that it would be good to have a corporation like this in the
hands of a province rather than in the hands of so-called free
enterprise in this very important field?
Senator de Cotret: I would really like to have the opportunity to refer back to the specific comments of my colleague,
the President of the Treasury Board, on this specific case.
As a general question of principle, 1 sec no necessary
guideline there that we would follow in the divestiture of some
of the crown corporations. Certainly, some of the provinces
have different political philosophies from those espoused by
the present government. 1 am sure that they are quite frec and
capable of pursuing their own affairs.
Senator Argue: My question is: Would a bid by the Saskatchewan goveriment for Eldorado be considered, or is it out
of the question because it is a provincial government?
Senator Flynn: Do you want it?
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge-and I
stand to be corrected-it would, of course, be considered. I do
not think there has been any kind of exclusion made in the
contemplated sale of any of these crown corporations. 1 do not
think there has been anything stated by the government that
would preclude a bid by any of the provincial goveriments.
THE ECONOMY
EXCHANGE VALUE OF CANADIAN DOLE AR

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, yesterday I asked the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce two questions.
One was on the definition of his duties as Minister of State. I
can appreciate that that might take a little time to answer. The
other, however, was more immediate. It referred to the statement by the Governor of the Bank of Canada whercin he said
it was also important to avoid the inflationary impact of any
further appreciable reduction in the exchange value of the
Canadian dollar in terms of the currencies of our principal
trading partners, and 1 asked whether it was government and
Bank of Canada policy to put a floor under, or whether this
indicated that there was a floor under, the Canadian dollar.
Senator de Cotret: I am sorry, senator. J missed the end of
your question because the microphone was turned off.
Senator Everett: In light of the Governor's statement in
respect of the increase in the interest rate that it was also
important to avoid the inflationary impact of any further
appreciable reduction in the exchange value of the Canadian
dollar in terms of the currencies of our principal trading
partners, my question was: Given that the government has
[Senator Argue.]

October 1 1, 1979

been consulted on, and agrees with, the policy of the Bank of
Canada, does this indicate that there is now a floor under the
Canadian dollar'?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, 1 took that question under notice yesterday and I hope to be able to give a
specific answer to the specific question raised. If I might
address just for a moment the question of the inflationary
impact of the reduction in the Canadian dollar, I would say it
is obviously an item of concern not only to the Governor of the
Bank of Canada but also to the government.
As is well known, there becomes a kind of roller coaster
effect in devaluations followed by increases in rates of inflation
followed by the movement of those price increases throughout
the system. It was highlighted, certainly, in the experience of
the United Kingdom in the earlier part of the decade. I think it
has to be a matter of concern for any government at this point,
given the very high inflation rates that already exist.
I will endeavour to have a specific answer to the specific
question at the next sitting of the house.

THE HONOURABLE ROBERT R. DE COTRET, P.C.
NEWSPAPER REPORT OF STATEMENT BY LEADER OF THE
OPPOSITION IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, 1 should like to refer
to an article which appeared in today's issue of the Ottawa
Journal, part of which reads as follows:
Trudeau argued that de Cotret's presence in a key
cabinet position was not only a lingering insuit to the
voters, but "an insult to the spirit of democracy and an
insult to the House of Commons."
The article also states:
Earlier in his hour-long address, Trudeau poked at de
Cotret as one of the ministers "hiding down the hall" in
the Senate.
I merely want to say, after the minister's performance
yesterday and today, which I think was a good performance,
that 1 do not believe he is hiding anywhere.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

STRENGTH OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I should like to

Senator Flynn: I will send you the statutes.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Senator Buckwold: Very good. At any rate, I thank him
very much for the prompt answer to my question as to whether
the time is opportune for allowing the Canadian interest rate
to be disassociated from the influence of the American rate
and letting the Canadian dollar set its own level. I suggested
that we might even be pleasantly surprised if that were done.
The answer came back promptly, and I thank him for it, that
this is not the time to pursue such a policy.
a (1440)
I wonder whether the economic czar of Canada could
explain that a little. Why is this not the time to pursue such a
policy? What is the rationale?
Senator Flynn: Are you making a speech?
Senator Buckwold: I am asking a question. I am asking
someone else to make a speech. We require more than just a
one-sentence explanation of this very important subject. I am
wondering whether we might have some response.
Senator de Cotret: Is the honourable senator asking me or
the economic czar?
Senator Buckwold: I should think we were speaking of the
same person.
Senator de Cotret: I believe we touched on that briefly
yesterday. I would be very happy to go further on that
question. In the last two months the American authorities saw
fit to increase their bank rate by some 150 basis points, or 1.5
percentage points. Over that same period, we in Canada
increased our bank rate by just half, by 75 basis points.
Certainly I believe that demonstrated the willingness of the
government to be somewhat less tied to American domestic
monetary policy, to gauge the reaction in the markets of not
following on a one-to-one basis with what the Americans were
doing, and to ensure that we used the maximum amount of
flexibility at our disposal in setting domestic interest rates. I
think that has been largely followed during that period.
While 1 quite agree with the Minister of Finance that this is
not the proper time to forget ail considerations of developments in foreign money and capital markets, I think that we
have to some extent experimented with the reaction of the
exchange rate and that of capital flows to a different differential between Canadian and United States rates, and to the
extent possible we will continue to monitor the situation very
closely.
CENTRAL MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION-INTEREST
RATES

Senator Buckwold: As a supplementarySenator Flynn: Do you want to make another speech?
Senator Buckwold: Is the Leader of the Government enjoying my speeches?
Senator Flynn: No.
Senator Buckwold: I am sure that we shall have much more
discussion on this particular aspect, but I would like to move
on to a supplementary with regard to interest rates.

Senator Asselin: You need more information?
Senator Buckwold: Not at ail. I just want to find out
whether the government knows what it is doing. One of the
most significant and perhaps underestimated effects of the
higher interest rates, which have now reached the stage of
almost precipitous danger, is the impact on mortgage rates.
My question to the minister is: Has there now been a policy
devised that will, in fact, allow Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corporation to offer interest rates that are substantially lower
than that charged by the financial institutions, which, I understand, is now about 13.75 per cent? Is there something being
planned by the government that will assist the great number of
Canadians who depend on a reasonable interest rate for their
housing? Is there a plan that will assist others who will be
renegotiating interest rates, because most of them are on fixed
terms? Literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians will this
year have to move from a lower to a higher rate because of the
five-year renewal. What is the policy of the government to
assist homeowners, other than by giving them some mortgage
interest deductibility, the benefit of which will be wiped out?
Is there a policy that will alleviate a burden that runs into
literally hundreds of dollars a year for the average Canadian
homeowner?
Senator de Cotret: There is no question that we are looking
at a number of areas in which problems could arise because of
the very high rates of interest..To the best of my knowledge,
there is no program being actively contemplated through
CMHC to offer subsidized rates.
The honourable senator mentioned the mortgage interest
deductibility program that we are committed to introduce. I
believe he said the benefit would be wiped out by the increase
in interest rates. I would like to suggest that that program will
compensate to a very large extent, and even well beyond, the
current increase in mortgage interest rates. That will certainly
bring a great amount of relief to aIl those Canadians owning
homes, and to those who are looking forward to the purchase
of their first home.
Senator Buckwold: We shall see the effect of that in due
course.
INCREASE IN BANK RATE

Senator van Roggen: I wish to direct a supplementary
question to the minister regarding the first part of Senator
Buckwold's question. As I heard the minister, he mentioned
that during the last couple of months the United States
authorities had raised their interest rate by approximately 150
points or 1.5 percentage points; that during the same period we
in Canada had gone only half as far, approximately .75 of a
percentage point; and that this indicated that we did not follow
the American pattern.
I may be confused in this matter, but is the minister saying
that it was a decision of the government, and not that of Mr.
Bouey and the Bank of Canada, that we should move up by
only three-quarters of a point?

SENATE DEBATES

Senator de Cotret: I stand to be corrected on that, honourable senators. It is a decision of the Bank of Canada, in which
the government fully concurs.

CANADA SAVINGS BONDS
INTEREST RATES

Senator Bird: Honourable senators, I have a question for the
Minister of State for Economic Development. It is a short
question and requires a short answer. In the light of the recent
rise in interest rates, is the government planning to raise the
interest rate on the current issue and on previous issues of
savings bonds?
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to take that question as
notice. I do not have the answer right now, but I shall
endeavour to provide one in the very near future.

October Il, 1979

In view of the present government's great passion for consulting parliamentarians and reviving their role through committees; the speech given at the United Nations by the Secretary of State for External Affairs with its unfavourable
allusions to Argentina; the widespread rumors amongst the
public and in the newspapers to the effect that the cabinet is
strongly divided on the sale of a Candu reactor to Argentina;
the much belated intervention of the Minister of State for
International Trade which, to my mind, obviously reveals a
serious rift within cabinet; and, above ail, the serious accusations made on television against the present government, and
one minister in particular in this regard, by a top officiai of
Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Mr. Campbell, which incident
I believe is without precedent in the history of our political
system, will the Leader of the Government refer the whole
matter at the earliest possible date to the proper Senate
committee?
Senator Flynn:

I thank Senator Lamontagne for his speech!

Senator Lamontagne: Remember your questions!

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
SALE POLICY RESPECTING CANDU REACTORS

[Translation]
Senator Lamontagne: Since this government is deeply committed to freedom of information, I ask the Minister of State
for Economic Development whether he could table in this
house the lengthy 26-page brief, according to newspaper
reports, sent by the Government of Argentina to the Canadian
Government to explain why they decided not to purchase the
Candu reactor.
[English]
Senator Flynn: That perhaps is a question that should be put
in writing.
Senator Perrault: It is a simple request.
An Hon. Senator: It requires just a yes or no answer.
[Translation]
Senator de Cotret: I see no objection to it. I shall even be
pleased to table that brief. I see no reason why it should not be
tabled. However, I am not sure whether a brief was presented
to the Canadian government or whether a statement was made
by the Government of Argentina. But it certainly could not be
classified matter, nor could it in any way ...
Senator Lamontagne: The answer is yes.
Senator de Cotret: Yes.
Senator Lamontagne: I have a supplementary question to
put to the Leader of the Government in the Senate who,
despite his past attitudes, assumes the duties of government
leader as well as of Senate leader.
[Senator van Roggen.]

Senator Flynn: I remember my questions full well; they were
never as long as that one. In any event, I can tell you that I
have no objection to that one; that, in fact, the whole nuclear
policy of the government will be referred to a committee; if not
to a joint committee, to a Senate committee. But it will
probably be a joint committee and Senator Lamontagne can
then enjoy himself to the full.
* (1450)

[English]
Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I would first of all
like to thank Senator Oison for denying responsibility for the
two questions I put yesterday to the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce and the Minister of State for the
Canadian International Development Agency about the failure
of the sale of a Candu reactor to Argentina.
I now ask the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce
what his personal views are about the statement made by Ross
Campbell, the chief international sales officer of AECL, blaming the Secretary of State for External Affairs for the failure
of the sale of the Candu reactor.
A related question is: What has the government done to date
to improve the delivery and quality of service of the Candu
reactors, including the supply of heavy water?
Senator de Cotret: First of ail, honourable senators, I would
like to say that I am in total and complete disagreement with
the statements made by Mr. Campbell. I do not think they
were reasonable statements, nor do I think the facts bear out
the allegations that were made by Mr. Campbell in terms of
the role that is alleged to have been played in this matter by
the Secretary of State for External Affairs. I think that was
made very clear to us by the Government of Argentina in
subsequent conversations. I think these are very unfortunate
allegations, and in no way would I concur in any of the
statements made. I think they are erroneous, false and misleading. The facts certainly do not bear them out.

October 1 1, 1979
October Il, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

As I mentioned yesterday, in terms of the sale of our
technology, we certainly do have very good technology. The
deal with Argentina was fraught with a number of difficulties.
It was a very complex negotiation. I have already mentioned
our performance on the Embalse reactor, which was far from
being satisfactory in years past. The Government of Argentina
was concerned about that performance. I mentioned also that
the Government of Argentina was concerned about second
sourcing. That is a concern I can well understand, because
they do not want to be totally dependent on one foreign
government for their source of nuclear supply.
There was also the question of our insistence on the safeguard policy as set forth by the previous government. That was
a position that was well known to the Government of Argentina, and when we look at the totality of the factors involved,
we can perhaps see why they opted, in the case of this one
transaction, for a German-Swiss consortium. There are still
three other potential Candu contracts in Argentina, and we
will be aggressively pursuing those, as well as other possibilities in other countries.
[Translation]
Senator Bosa: A small supplementary.
Senator Lamontagne: If you will allow me, I would simply
like to ask the minister for a clarification because I did not
fully understand his remarks. Did the minister say he agreed
with what Mr. Campbell said?
Senator de Cotret: On the contrary, I disagree entirely. It is
in total disagreement.
[English]
Senator Bosa: There seems to be a great deal of difference
of view in cabinet as to what caused the failure of the sale of
the nuclear reactor to Argentina.
Senator Flynn: What do you know about that?
Senator Bosa: Well, if the leader would wait for a second,
perhaps he might learn what I know.
The Minister of State for International Trade is reported as
having said this in the House of Commons yesterday:
-the factor of safeguards was a matter in the decision
they reached recently on the Candu reactor sale.
That appears to be in complete contradiction to what Miss
MacDonald, the Secretary of State for External Affairs, is
reported as having said by the Globe and Mail this morning, to
the effect that in a conversation with the Argentinean ambassador she was told that nuclear safeguards were not a factor in
the loss of the sale.
Which is the official version?
Senator Flynn: You have just heard it.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, our position on the
safeguard issue has been very clear from the beginning. We
insisted, as did the previous government in these negotiations,
on total safeguards. That position was well known to the
Government of Argentina. The fact that the safeguards were
changed twice since the initial Embalse contract was signed by

80072-4

the previous government may have raised doubts in the mind
of the Government of Argentina. Certainly that is a question
you would have to ask them rather than us.
From our point of view, our position on the safeguard
question was well known, and was communicated to the Government of Argentina. I believe the official reports were to the
effect that they understood exactly the position we had taken
on the matter.
Senator Bosa: But this is not what Miss MacDonald is
saying.
THE ECONOMY
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE
TRANSACTIONS

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of State for Economic Development. As the
minister will know, the Canadian dollar fell below 85 cents in
terms of the U.S. dollar in the last day and a half. I would ask
the minister whether it will be the policy of this government to
intervene in currency exchange transactions to regularize and
normalize day-to-day trading, which, in the last government,
was called a clean float, or whether the government will ask
the Bank of Canada not to intervene in any way in day-to-day
currency transactions, which was the position the opposition
took in the last Parliament.
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to consult my colleague,
the Minister of Finance, to respond to the specifics of your
question.
I should like to mention, however, that the Canadian dollar,
in light trading this morning, was rising, and also that the
stock exchange was rising by noon. I do not think we have to
worry about the Canadian dollar's falling too rapidly at this
point in time.
Senator Austin: I just want the minister's assurance that the
Canadian dollar will not rise because the Bank of Canada has
been instructed to purchase United States dollars.
ENERGY
DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS PRICES

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, may I address
another question to the same minister.
I very much appreciated the answer this afternoon to the
effect that there would be no amendments to the Petroleum
Administration Act, and I would like to ask the minister to
assure this house that in the event that no agreement with the
Province of Alberta and the Province of Ontario and the other
provinces of Canada is possible with respect to the price of oil,
the government will exercise its authority under that act to
establish a price level for the one-price Canadian market.
Senator de Cotret: First of al], honourable senators, I would
just like to re-emphasize the answer that I gave to the question
that the honourable senator asked yesterday, in which I

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
indicated that we were not contemplating any changes in the
Petroleun Administration Act that would reduce in any way
the powers of the federal government to act in the setting of oil
and gas prices. That does not mean that there may not be
amendments to other sections of that act, but certainly not in
terms of federal powers.

October 1 1, 1979
October Il, 1979

Senator Austin: Do you have a target as to what would be
an appropriate rate of growth for Canada's economy in energy
consumption terms and, therefore, in GDP terms?
Senator de Cotret: 1 will be happy to provide information on
the specific rate of growth which we do, in fact, have.

* (1500)

I should like to assure the honourable senator that the
federal government will carry out its responsibility with
respect to oil and gas prices. There are extensive consultations
under way between the Prime Minister, the federal Minister of
Finance, the federal Minister of Energy, and their counterparts in the various provinces, and I, as they, remain very
hopeful that we can, in the very near future, strike an agreement as to the future course of oil and gas prices in Canada.
Senator Austin: I appreciate the minister's answer, but the
question is: In the event that no agreement is possible, will the
provisions of that legislation be utilized by the government?
Senator de Cotret: I believe 1 answered that part of the
question. The federal government will certainly not shirk its
responsibility in this field. The question at this time is very
hypothetical and I, for one, as well as my colleagues, am very
hopeful that we can reach an agreement amongst the various
parties through the process of consultation that is now under
way.
MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION

Senator Austin: 1 thank the minister for his lengthy answer
outlining the conservation program which the government
hopes to follow; 1 found it a most interesting one. However, I
thought he avoided my question of yesterday which related to
a phrase contained in the Throne Speech, ". . . encourage a

significant reduction in Canada's overall energy consumption . . .". My question was not really in relation to conservation but was directed to the issue of whether the government
intended to reduce Canada's overall energy consumption, and,
if so, how the government intended to do that.
Senator de Cotret: Specifically on that, if we are talking
about reducing consumption, we are surely talking about
reducing the per capita consumption, and that, of course, is
where you enter into a discussion of measures to be introduced
to encourage conservation. I do not sec any possibility of
reducing the actual level on a general basis of consumption; it
is on a per capita basis that you would reduce the rate of
growth in our consumption. Of course, that tics directly into a
conservation program.
Senator Austin: 1 asked the honourable minister yesterday
whether indeed the phrase was intended to say, as it does,
"significant reduction in Canada's overall energy consumption," or whether it was intended to say, "a reduction in the
rate of growth of Canada's energy consumption." Are you now
advising us that we are directed to the rate of growth and not
the overall level of consumption as it exists today?
Senator de Cotret: Yes, of course, it is the rate of growth.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
FUTURE OF CANADA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to ask a
question of the Minister of State for Economic Development. I
should like to say that I appreciate the large amount of
information that he has provided to this chamber in the many
responses that he has made to questions from this side of the
house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Argue: My question is based on a report in this
morning's Ottawa Journal that a report prepared by a Conservative committee has cast a dark cloud over the future of
the Canada Development Corporation. The article goes on to
say that the gist of the committee's report is that a study
should be made as to whether the 68 per cent government
interest should be reduced to 10 per cent. I would remind the
minister that if this were donc it would mean the sale of some
$2 billion worth of assets.
My question is: What is the status of this report; who has
produced it; and, bearing in mind the proposed freedom of
information legislation, can we be given a copy of it?
Senator de Cotret: 1 must say that I read the very same
story this morning. I have not had a chance to inquire as to the
current status of the report or who prepared it. The CDC is
not a corporation that reports to me directly; it reports, I
believe, to the Minister of Finance, but I will be happy to
make inquiries on your behalf.
There has been, over time, as I am sure honourable senators
are aware, discussions as to a further sale of CDC shares to
the Canadian public, as was initially intended. This report
allegedly suggests that the government equity participation be
reduced to 10 per cent. However, I have not seen the report,
and I cannot attest to the accuracy of the news story on it, but
1 will certainly find out for the honourable senator and report
back.
Senator Argue: I should like to supplement my question.
Does this committee in fact exist; and, if so, who are its
members, and what is the status of the committee? Apart
altogether from the precise recommendations it may have
made-and they are very important-I should like to have
some general information as to what this committee is aIl
about. Is it a secret committee? Does it have any representation from any party other than the government party? In my
judgment, this is a strange way to proceed, and I should like to
have the minister's comments.
Senator de Cotret: I would be more than happy to provide
information to you about the status of any committees investi-

gating or studying any of the crown corporations that report
directly to me. However, I am not aware of its terms of
reference or its composition, nor, for that matter, was I aware
of the existence of this particular committee on CDC until I
read the story you have referred to. I will be happy to get you
the information.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
PROPOSED PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE

Senator Thompson: I should like to direct a question to the
honourable minister in charge of CIDA. I understand the
minister has announced that there will be a parliamentary
committee set up to study the work of CIDA. Is it his intention
that that should be a joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons?
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, as I said yesterday, il
is the intention of the government to establish a committee of
Parliament to review the whole question of foreign aid and
foreign policies of this country. I am inclined to suggest that
this committee should be a joint committee of the House of
Commons and the Senate.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
THE SENATE
COMMENTS BY LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT DURING
QUESTION PERIOD

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I should like to pose a
question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. When
1 previously attempted to ask a question of the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce, the Leader of the Government turned around and said, "What do you know about it?" I
was asking a question which he felt was not within my
competence. I am surprised at the attitude of the Leader of the
Government in the Senate. I took that remark as belittling my
question and probably intimidating me into not asking further
questions. Is this going to be his attitude in the future towards
new senators in this chamber?
Senator Flynn: I think it is rather amusing that Senator
Bosa should take the bait so quickly. He said words to the
effect, "In view of the fact that there is division within the
cabinet . . .", and I said, "What do you know about that?" He
replied that he had read il in the press. If he bases his
knowledge only on what he reads in the press, I assure him
that very often he is going to be mistaken. It is not an insult to
ask him if he knows more than what he reads in the press. He
can put as many questions as he wants, be they silly or not.
Senator Bosa: 1 had not posed the question yet. I was
quoting from the Debates of the Senate. Would you not say
that is an authoritative paper?

ENERGY
OIL PRICING POLICY

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Minister of State for Economic
Development. It relates to a widely reported interview given by
the Right Honourable the Prime Minister the weekend before
last. I would refer particularly to that journal of truth and free
speech in New Brunswick, the Telegraph-Journalof October
2. The interview had to do with the oil pricing system as
administered by this government. The Prime Minister was
being questioned about the increase in the domestic price to
approach world level. The quotation reads:
0 (1510)

Clark said in a weekend radio interview that higher prices
would make industry competitive on world markets.
Perhaps I should read that again. I had to read it several times
to believe it.
Clark said in a weekend radio interview that higher prices
would make industry competitive on world markets.
My question to the minister is this: Does he subscribe to this
strange economic philosophy; and, if so, could he explain to us
how it works?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I can with no
hesitation whatsoever assert that that is not the position of the
Prime Minister, and never has been. I believe there are
probably a few words missing in that quotation which would
underline the basic tenet of our policy towards energy pricing,
which is that there should always remain a margin between
Canadian domestic prices and either the United States price or
the world price, and that that differential should ensure that
Canadian industry remains competitive in world markets. That
has been the position of the Prime Minister all along, as well
as that of the Minister of Energy, the Minister of Finance and
myself.
Senator McElman: As a supplementary question I should
like to ask whether, in light of the suggestion that this is
perhaps not an accurate story, it would be possible for the
minister to obtain a transcript of that interview for the benefit
of the Senate.
Senator de Cotret: To the extent that it is possible to do so I
shall be happy to use whatever efforts I can to gel a transcript
of the interview. I can only repeat that the words the honourable senator just read out do not in any way correspond with
the position held by the Prime Minister of this country.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

[Translation]
Senator Leblanc: Honourable senators, my question is for
Senator de Cotret in his capacity as minister.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
About the sale of crown corporations, I understand that the
government has now decided to proceed with some sales.
However, in your previous answers, you pointed out that it was
understood there would be no foreign interests involved in
those sales. So I would like you to give us your personal
assurance as well as the assurance of the government that none
of those corporations will be sold in part, any part, or in whole
to foreign interests.
Second, I would like the minister to tell us also whether he
thinks there is enough capital right now in Canada to buy all
those corporations that are to be sold, namely the eight
corporations mentioned in the list released by the Treasury
Board.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, in answer to the
first part of the question, I have no hesitation in giving you the
assurance of the government that the equity in crown corporations which could be returned to the private sector will be sold
to Canadian interests.
As to the second part of your question, when we talk about
those eight crown corporations, several of which for that
matter are subsidiaries of others included in the list, there is no
doubt in my mind that Canadian interests will be able to
provide the capital required to purchase the equity shares in
those corporations.
Senator Leblanc: So I thank the minister for his answer. Of
course, it is reassuring to know now that if there are no
Canadian buyers, those corporations will continue to be owned
by Canadians as is now the case.
THE ECONOMY
STRENGTH OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Leblanc: Switching to another topic, concerning the
strength of the Canadian dollar, in his replies, for instance
when he answers Senator Buckwold and other senators, the
minister always says "we".
So I would like to know, for my information and perhaps
that of other senators, what he means by "we". Is it the
Governor of the Bank of Canada only? Is it the Minister of
Finance only? Is it the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce only? Is it a group of individuals together or is it
the inner cabinet or the whole cabinet that set guidelines,
because I read on page 20 of Hansard, under the heading
"Strength of Canadian Dollar," Senator de Cotret says:
-we

did not increase . . . In the last round, when they

increased by a full point, we have increased the bank rate
in Canada by three-quarters of a point.
Further on, on page 21, in another answer, he said:
We have to monitor-we have a better feelSo who is "we"?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, in the context in
which you just reported the remarks I made yesterday, as
recorded on pages 20 and 21 of Hansard, when I say that we
did not increase our bank rate as rapidly as the Americans, I
[Senator Leblanc.]

October Il,1, 1979
October 1 1979

mean that and only that. It is a collective "we". It is a mere
statement of what is happening in Canada as compared to the
United States.
As for the value of the Canadian dollar, the rate of
exchange dealings of the Bank of Canada are the responsibility
of the Minister of Finance. Consequently, it is the Minister of
Finance, the cabinet, who have to implement a policy in this
field, except that there have been some institutional changes
quite recently.
As far as the interest rate is concerned, our monetary policy
is the responsibility of the Governor of the Bank of Canada. It
is quite clear. He consults regularly with the Minister of
Finance, as I said earlier today, but it is his responsibility by
law, and it is a statutory responsibility.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
PROPOSED DISPOSAL OF ASSETS OF PETRO-CANADA

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have several answers
to questions asked yesterday. I do not know if honourable
senators have had enough for today, but, in any event, I have a
reply for Senator Austin about the task force concerning the
possibility of disposing of certain assets of Petro-Canada.
This is a communiqué from the Department of Energy,
Mines and Resources as well, which was issued on September
5, 1979. The terms of reference are there. I do not know
whether the honourable senator wants it to be printed in
Hansard,or if it would be sufficient for me to remind Senator
Austin that he should watch his mail more closely.
Senator Perrault: Would it be possible to have it printed as
an appendix to today's Hansard?
Senator Flynn: I have no objection, but these are things that
have always been available.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For lexi of communiqué, see Appendix "B", p. 58.)
THE CABINET
MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SENATE

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, yesterday the Leader
of the Opposition asked for a detailed summary of the specific
cabinet responsibilities of the members of the government who
serve in this chamber. I do not know exactly what he meant. If
he meant what are the legal responsibilities, I can say that as
far as the Minister of Justice is concerned they are described
in sections 4 and 5 of the Department of Justice Act. Again I
do not know if, for the information of honourable senators who
do not know of the existence of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, I should have this inserted in Hansardat this point.
Senator Perrault: No. In view of the reorganization of
departments it was felt that it might be useful to honourable
senators, particularly those of the opposition, to know those

SENATE DEBATES

October 11, 1979

agencies reporting to the various ministers and the areas of
responsibility of the ministers. I think honourable senators
know the information to which the Leader of the Government
has just referred.
Senator Flynn: I should have thought that the Honourable
Leader of the Opposition, after having been on the government
side for so long, would be knowledgeable about ail these things
and would not need to put that kind of question.
Senator Steuart: You told us you were changing things.
Senator Oison: We want to know what the changes are.
Senator Flynn: We do not mind providing information that
you did not feel necessary before.
•

(1520)

Senator Perrault: We asked the question only in the sure
and certain knowledge that this new era of enlightened, open
government, spoken about so eloquently by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, actually meant something in the
working of Parliament.
Senator Flynn: It will certainly spread on the opposition, no
doubt.

YUKON TERRITORY
GOVERNMENT POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, in response to Senator
Lucier's question of yesterday, I would like to say that it is the
policy of this government to promote greater democracy in the
Yukon. It is an issue upon which each party candidate in the
Yukon took a stand in the general election. The will of the
people for greater self-government is evident by their overwhelming mandate to the present Minister of Public Works.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Flynn: The election result proves it, anyway. And I
mean the result of the territorial election.
The government has maintained regular consultation with
the people of the Yukon through the territorial council, and as
well with representatives of the Yukon Council of Indians.
Such consultations will continue, and Mr. Epp, the minister,
intends to convene an early meeting between the Government
of Canada, the Government of the Yukon Territory and the
Council of Yukon Indians to discuss the resolution of issues
prior to any amendment of the Yukon Act.
It must be pointed out to Senator Lucier that the extension
of the powers of the Government of the Yukon Territory
permits the exercise of democratic government to the limit
allowed under the present legislation. Any further extension of
the authority of the Yukon government will take place only

after full consultation with the people and, of course, those
amendments would come before Parliament for debate.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
REDUCTION IN FOREIGN AID

[Translation]
Senator Rizzuto: I should like to direct a question to
Senator Asselin concerning our assistance to underdeveloped
countries. You have advised the Senate that you would consider setting up a joint committee of the Senate and the House of
Commons to deal with our foreign aid policy. Are we to
understand that you do not share the opinion of the Minister
of Finance who stated in Europe that Canada would reduce its
assistance to the countries it has always helped?
Senator Asselin: The statement made by the Minister of
Finance referred, of course, to the multilateral assistance
Canada must provide to such international organizations as
the World Bank, UNESCO, the International Monetary
Fund, etc. As a matter of fact, the Minister of Finance intends
to reduce Canada's assistance to international organizations in
order to increase its bilateral assistance.
Moreover, the minister, speaking at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, urged his counterparts to refrain
from making any further commitments which would go
beyond the scope of the IMF.
Senator Rizzuto: A supplementary question. Do you share
personally this approach of the Minister of Finance?
Senator Asselin: It is, of course, up to the cabinet to decide,
when it reviews Canada's foreign affairs and foreign aid
policy, how the cutback referred to by the honourable senator
will be effected.
Senator Rizzuto: Your reply does not reflect your personal
opinion. I think you are responsible for this agency.
Senator Asselin: As a cabinet member, I know about ministerial solidarity. My replies are subject to the cabinet's
decision.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Senator Bielish, seconded by
Senator Charbonneau, for an Address in reply thereto.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I know I speak on
behalf of ail honourable senators in opposition when I extend
to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and his cabinet
colleagues in this chamber my very best wishes as they assume

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
their new and very important responsibilities. We wish them
luck. Not too much luck in terms of the time the party which
they represent bears the responsibility of government in this
land, but enough good fortune, enough wisdom and common
sense to help guide this nation successfully through its many
challenges during the months to come.
Our new friends in government-old friends, but new in
government-have waited a long time for an opportunity to
implement their ideas, to put to practical tests some of the
concepts they have spoken about with such fervor in this
chamber for such a long time. I think they will discover, if they
have not discovered already, that at times it is much casier to
be an opposition critic than to bear the responsibility of
government-bearing in mind the hard logic of economics and
the deadly accurate statistics which come before cabinet. The
fact is that what can be achieved does not always match up
with the best hopes of any of us.
The Leader of the Government here, who has been vested,
as well, with the portfolio of Minister of Justice, must feel a
special sense of gratification that after many years of loyal
service to his party and good service in the Senate he has been
called upon by the Prime Minister for senior responsibilities.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: It has been said that good things come to
all those who wait. Many of our friends in the Conservative
Party have waited for a long time. To be ushered from outer
darkness into the brilliant sunshine of governmental responsibility must be a heady experience. We hope that it does not
overwhelm them.
We on the opposition side are also pleased that our good
friend and colleague Martial Asselin has been given ministerial responsibilities. We know that he will undertake those
responsibilities in his usual conscientious and able fashion.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: I want to assure him, on behalf of the
Liberals in this chamber, that while we intend to criticize him
from time to time, that criticism, of course, will be only valid
criticism, in the spirit of our party's usual unflagging zeal and
quest for the truth.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Perrault: The minister responsible for Canada's
economic planning, Senator de Cotret, has proven once again
that there can be ministerial life after electoral death.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Perrault: We welcome him here. He will continue
to inspire lively interest from our benches. The first two days
of questioning indicate that there will be many questions
directed towards this important minister.
* (1530)

He, together with the other members of cabinet in this
chamber, have a major responsibility to the nation and to
Parliament. We in opposition have a responsibility to make
certain that all the proposais offered by this new government
[Senator Perrault.

October 1 1, 1979

October Il, 1979

are subjected to rigorous but fair scrutiny. I think I can give a
commitment on behalf of the majority opposition in this
chamber: we want to be fair and we want Parliament to work.
We want this country to prosper just as do members on the
other side of this chamber.
Those of us in opposition have been asked about the role of
the Senate opposition in this new Parliament. With a Conservative plurality in the Commons and the Liberal majority in
the Senate, concern has been raised with regard to whether
this government can operate and whether there is going to be
continued frustration as a result of the efforts made by the
opposition in this place. The fact is that Parliament and the
government will operate. There is no member of the opposition-indeed, no member of the Senate-who would put his or
her partisan interest ahead of the interest of this nation.
On May 22 a mandate to govern was accorded the Progressive Conservative Party. That party earned the right to govern.
Paradoxically to some, the Senate of Canada, with a preponderant Liberal majority, will be called upon to approve a
legislative program prepared by the new Conservative government. I do not suggest for a moment that the Senate, under
these conditions, will be a supine rubber stamp, with opposition senators walking in lock step with the new government.
Senators have never donc that in the past and will not do il
now. I know that I can promise this government and the
Canadian people a strong, diligent and positive opposition
striving to make Parliament work more effectively and in the
Canadian people's best interest. I know 1 can promise a Senate
opposition dedicated to the improvement of legislation and to
the introduction here of positive measures, rather than a
Senate opposition obsessed with the notion of obstruction and
delay for the sake of political advantage. The times are too
important and the welfare of this nation so vital that only the
best that parliamentarians are able to offer is good enough.
Although the opposition can give no total commitment that all
measures will be passed easily or will be passed at ail, every
effort will be made to be scrupulously fair.
In any case, the walls of this place rebound still with the
echoes of past speeches delivered by the new Leader of the
Government, delivered with gusto and fervor and proclaiming
the inalienable rights of the loyal opposition. He has emphasized many times why we need a strong opposition. Well, Mr.
Leader, you have that strong opposition. If at times you or
your ministerial colleagues and Senate colleagues become
impatient with some of our efforts, remember the words of the
late great, revered Tory, Sir John A. Macdonald in 1869, when
he said that given a government with a weak opposition you
could debauch a committee of archangels. We are anticipating
no parliamentary debauchery at this point, nor would you wish
otherwise.
I know that the new government will expect suggestions for
amendment to continue to emanate from the Senate, both
from the opposition side and the government ranks. I remind
honourable senators that during the last session of Parliament
alone, when there was a Liberal government, the Senate
proposed over 200 amendments. To my knowledge, most of

October 11, 1979
October 11, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

them were accepted on the other side. This is not generally
known by the public because our method of operation in the
Senate is far less partisan than it is in the House of Commons.
When we sec defects or difficulties with certain bills, we
discuss these on a rational basis with the government of the
day. I hope we can continue with that process in the future. I
know that the process of amendment which occurred with bills
advanced by the previous government will continue. Honourable senators will wish to continue their diligent and essentially
non-partisan work in committee in order to ensure that these
measures which come forward are in the public interest.
The new Prime Minister has an awesome responsibility to
lead this nation at a time of world economic dislocation. It
won't be easy. I can assure you that it was not easy for the
previous leader, nor for the previous cabinet. There are no
simplistic answers anywhere in the world, including Canada,
but the Canadian people do want this government to be given a
chance.
I want to say a word about my own leader, the leader of the
Liberal Party. Canadians of aIl parties admire the manner in
which he has assisted the change in government. The election
result brought no acrimony from Mr. Trudeau. Indeed, when
the result was made known, he was the first to offer his
assistance and advice to the new Prime Minister, Joseph
Clark. Every resource was offered to achieve a smooth transition of government, and this is the way it should be in a
mature parliamentary democracy. Liberals are very proud of
their leader, not only for the manner in which he served this
nation as Prime Minister for 11 important years-and he
could be back again-but also for his great driving concern
and passion for national unity and for his efforts to help ail
Canadians, regardless of racial origin. We feel that he will be
an able and distinguished leader in the other place. He has
certainly demonstrated opposition talents and potential in the
first two days of his activities there.
Honourable senators, before I move to the Speech from the
Throne, I wish to acknowledge the fine contributions to the
opening of this debate by the mover and seconder of the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
As we ail know, our chamber has recently been enhanced by
the addition of several new senators representing various political philosophies. I think we are aIl pleased to have an opportunity to welcome them into our midst. We are looking forward
to the contributions that they will make. They offer a wide
range of talents and a wealth of experience which will be of
value to the Senate, the whole parliamentary process and the
country generally. Our chamber is now richer for the presence
of Senator Martha Bielish of Alberta. She has been actively
involved in public life for many years, beginning in 1944, when
she joined the Women's Institute. Since then she has risen to
positions of prominence in both the Alberta Women's Institute
and the Federated Women's Institutes of Canada, as well as
the Associated Country Women of the World. In 1975, International Women's Year, she received the Woman of the Year
Award. Before being summoned to the Senate, she was active
in a wide range of community work.

*

(1540)

With that kind of background, and judging by her remarks
yesterday, it is clear that she will serve the Senate and ail of
Canada very well indeed in this new assignment she is now
taking up, and we welcome her.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[Translation]
Senator Perrault: I would like to take this opportunity to
welcome Senator Charbonneau to the Senate and to congratulate him on his appointment. He has recently been called to
the Senate following an active and successful career in his
native province of Quebec. His qualifications in the business
world, and especially in the financial sector, will be well
appreciated in the Senate.
He will add a new dimension to the extensive business
expertise we now enjoy in this assembly.
Economic policies will be one of the main concerns of this
Parliament, and we shall be interested to hear the ideas and
advice of Senator Charbonneau during our discussions.
[English]
Senator Charbonneau has been actively involved in the life
of his party in the province of Quebec. I know what a difficult
and important task that can be. I know the limited number of
Conservatives there have been to this point in the province of
Quebec. Coming from the province of British Columbia, which
at the present time has a rather beleaguered party of another
kind, I know what a challenging task it can be to keep a party
alive, healthy and operating under trying circumstances.
He has borne important responsibilities for his party, and he
should be congratulated for so doing. However, I hope that
both he and Senator Murray, who played such an important
role in the recent success of the Progressive Conservative Party
at the poils, will now feel that it is time to give up their
organizational labours and concentrate exclusively on their
work in the Senate. No longer need they dedicate their efforts
to signing up new members for the governing party and
organizing for it; it is quite healthy enough! It is in the Senate
that they should now concentrate their efforts. Surely they
have toiled hard enough for the Tory party. We are anxious to
have their counsel.
We bid both Senator Bielish and Senator Charbonneau
welcome, and congratulate them on their initial contributions
to the Senate in the speeches they delivered so well yesterday.
In mentioning these two especially, I do not mean to overlook
the other honourable senators who have joined us so recently,
taking their oaths on Tuesday. They will aIl serve well.
I know that those who sit across the way will appreciate my
sentiments when I take particular satisfaction in noting the
appointments earlier this year of at least a few new senators on
this side. On Tuesday there was a virtual army of new people
being sworn in to take their places on the government side.
There did seem to be a rather preponderant number of Senate
appointments from the government side. As a Liberal, it is
rather difficult for me to understand that. Nevertheless, we
welcome them, It is nice to see that a few will sit with the

SENATE DEBATES

opposition, just to keep the proper balance in this chamber to
which we have all grown so accustomed.
Honourable senators, i have heard many Throne Speeches
in my day, as have many others in this chamber. Let me say
there is nothing quite as certain or predictable as the standard
reaction of most opposition parties and leaders to a Throne
Speech. Their reaction is almost "Pavlovian"--words like
"incomplete", "disappointing", "dismaying", "appalling",
"lacks vision", "a great disappointment" are featured in their
remarks. i wonder if anyone here can cite a lime when any
Leader of the Opposition said that he thought that a Throne
Speech possessed merit. I cannot recall any such occasion. The
fact is that a Speech from the Throne, in truth, is a general
outline of the actions proposed by the government. In no way
can it be a measure of the value of any government's
programs.
It is unfair to condemn outright any Speech fron the
Throne, because ail Throne Speeches are incomplete and
necessarily lack detail, and so it was with the address delivered
in this place by His Excellency the Governor General. By any
standard, the Speech from the Throne was cautious, tentative,
predictable and "garden variety"--like most other Throne
Speeches, regardless of the political party in power. Action has
been promised in a number of areas, but until we sec the
measures proposed and the specifics of those measures, il will
be unfair to render any kind of final judgment. That kind of
judgment will not corne from me until the appropriate moment
has arrived.
I would like to draw to the attention of the government,
however, certain areas which will occupy a good deal of the
official opposition's attention during question period and
debate. With respect to economic policy, for example, we sec
inflation continuing to rise; interest rates are at record levels,
and our dollar is under serious pressure. We in this chamber
must devote attention to these and allied problems. Energy
policy is another example. The government has failed to
negotiate firm arrangements respecting oil prices. It rushes
forward with the senseless destruction of one key instrument of
a national energy policy, Petro-Canada.
There will bc questions in the field of foreign policy. We will
be asking for explanations. Canada has been seriously embarrassed by the bungling with respect to our embassy in Israel
and by the Secretary of State for External Affairs, who has
suggested that Canadian foreign aid will be dispensed to needy
countries based upon the degree of politeness they exhibit
towards Canada.
We will be asking questions on the matter of government
re-organization and the government's rhetorical but little practised, in the view of some of us, respect for parliamentary
institutions. There will be questions on the government's quest
for privatization-the turning over of efficient and profitable
governmental agencies to the private sector without parliamentary consultation and without regard for the economic and
social impacts of that action.
[Senator Perrault.J

The government has talked in terms of ils respect for
Parliament. In connection with my responsibilities in opposition, I visited Britain a few weeks ago to discuss with representatives of political parties there the operation of Parliament
when one party has a plurality in one chamber and the other
party a majority in the other-a situation which Great Britain
experienced for a number of years. In addition to the valuable
research material I was able to obtain there, I noted with some
interest that the Conservative government in Great Britain
met within two weeks of the election, with a full Speech from
the Throne, and weeks ago a program of legislation in the form
of bills was advanced to implement the British Tory party's
campaign promises-the pledges of the Thatcher government
in Britain. In light of that kind of action, why was it necessary
to delay the calling of our Parliament until the present lime?
If the problems confronting this nation were as urgent as we
were told they were by the Tories during the course of the
election campaign, why has il taken so long for the new Tory
government to call Parliament into session? Now that we are
meeting, we hear that a great many committees are going to
be formed to discuss these "problems" further. Il seems to me
that here we have a government which is really not prepared to
tackle the issues-a government swept into power by a wave of
rhetoric, but not prepared to swing into action in the manner
other governments appear to have done, such as the new
Conservative government in Great Britain. Mrs. Thatcher was
elected leader of her party in Britain at approximately the
same time as was the leader of the Conservative Party in
Canada. Why has il taken so long for Mr. Clark to gel to work
in Parliament on some of our Canadian problems? So we are
going to ask many questions in the area of the operation of
Parliament.
*

(1550)

On the issue of federal-provincial relations the government's
"affirmative" action to date has consisted entirely of stripping
away federal authority and diluting the federal presence across
Canada. Together with many Canadians of all political parties
and of no political party, we are disturbed about this process.
Those are some of the concerns felt on this side of the house.
They serve to illustrate that we as an opposition have a serious
job to do; wc will do il constructively, but we will be relentless
in our pursuit of answers and information in an effort to call
this government to account. Our activities during the question
period in the past two days indicate that we have come here to
do serious business. Other senators will go into each of the
areas I have just mentioned and many others in the course of
this debate in the days to corne.
One basis on which to assess a government is the degree to
which il honours the commitments il makes during ils campaign for election. After ail, the people who voted for the new
government did so on the basis of the number of promises
made from coast to coast, on television, in the newspapers and
in public forums. Last spring the Conservatives were full of
promises. As they worked towards May 22 they were guided
by the most recent public opinion polîs. Whatever seemed
popular they promised in their "lightning-rod" style of politics.

October Il 1979

SENATE DEBATES

According to independent estimates last spring the total bill
for full implementation of the government program ranged
between $6 billion and $10 billion. The Tory platform was
estimated to cost from $6 billion to $10 billion. Inevitably, if
all their proposals are put into effect, honourable senators, the
federal deficit is going to have to grow much larger. There is
no way around it. That is something that the Conservatives say
they stand against, but they simply cannot have it both ways.
They may try, however, proving the truth of a statement made
more than 100 years ago by the British statesman Disraeli who
defined a Conservative government as "an organized hypocrisy". We are not accusing this government of being "an organized hypocrisy"; that would be an unfair judgment to make.
But now it is for this government to prove that there was no
hyporcisy at all in its range of campaign promises. There is a
list of 45 main promises costing $10 billion. I have that full list
in my hand, and if honourable ministers and honourable
members of the Conservative Party on the other side have lost
their lists, I shall cheerfully provide them with copies of the
one I have before me. I should be delighted to do so. But wait
until I finish my speech.
I do not think there is any intention on the part of our
government colleagues in the Senate to be hypocritical, but
they do have a serious responsibility to prove that they intend
conscientiously to implement the platform which elected them
to office on May 22.
In addition to the deficit question, there is what some of us
feel to be the ill-conceived plan for the economy as outlined
during the election campaign which is likely to produce higher
inflation, greater unemployment and a weaker dollar. And the
danger signs are already in our midst. That assessment was
offered not merely by politicians engaged in that campaign
against the government party, but by the prestigious Centre
for Policy Analysis at the University of Toronto. Even the
Conservatives, own internal economic assessment released in
July predicts a higher jobless rate and slow growth. These
aspects of the Conservative campaign promises are worrisome,
to say the least, but Canadians may not have to be too
troubled about their impact, again proving, or at least partially
supporting, Disraeli's point.
The new Finance Minister, the Honourable John Crosbie,
was reported in July as saying, "Our party feels no obligation
whatsoever to implement what it has promised to do." He said,
"The Conservative government thinks it has a completely free
hand, unfettered by its promises to Canadians." I repeat that,
honourable senators: "unfettered by its promises to Canadians." It was in that same interview, honourable senators, that
he branded himself as Canada's "Mr. Tough Guy." Mr.
Crosbie has ruled, among other things, that his leader's promise of a massive tax cut for Canadians, totalling some $2
billion, is in that category. That is "Mr. Tough Guy's" statement, that it really was a promise not meant to be kept, and he
is tough enough to keep from implementing it. That was one of
Mr. Clark's main campaign planks, and yet how quickly it has
been forgotten. However, it will not be forgotten by the people
who serve in the opposition in this chamber.

Canadians will find it just a bit more passing strange that
the Tory "Mr. Nice Guys" of last spring-remember they
were "Mr. Nice Guys" and "Mrs. Nice Guys" and "Ms. Nice
People" last spring who pretended to have a magical package
of ideas-new easy solutions for every problem-why they
even had solutions to the problem of how to get stains out of
the kitchen sink; a solution for everything-well, they have in
fact no such magic and now seem content to call themselves
tough guys and blame all of their difficulties on the previous
administration. That, honourable senators, was the most predictable thing they have done so far-to blame the previous
government. How long do they think Canadians will be prepared to accept such a cop-out?
Surely we in opposition have a responsibility to remind the
government day by day of the promises they have made and to
remind them also that promises are made to be kept. The Tory
legacy of broken promises is much larger than simply the
reneging upon that $2 billion tax break and the reincarnation
or perhaps the re-emergence of Mr. Crosbie as Canada's "Mr.
Tough Guy."
I have here that list of just some of the commitments made
by the Conservatives during that campaign last spring. The list
is only a partial one. Our research staff is still working on it
because there are many more Tory promises to go. This partial
list of "goodies" numbers 45 so far, with a long way to go. I
have not noted the minor ones. The hundreds of small ones are
kept in a sort of "Category B," but we shall remember those as
well. But these are 45 separate promises. This has been the
most "promising" government in Canada's history.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: But not in the sense, my friends, that you
are applauding. That word "promising" is meant to be in
quotation marks.
Senator Steuart: Promises, promises, promises.
Senator Perrault: "Promises, promises, promises," says the
distinguished Senator Steuart.
e (1600)

Most of these 45 promises have been dumped unceremoniously in the nearest political ashcan, with the new Tory
ministers retreating in droves-faster than Napoleon retreated
from Moscow-from commitments they made, as they vainly
hope that the memory of Canadians will be a short one.
Senator Steuart: We shall remember!
Senator Perrault: But, honourable senators, as Honourable
Senator Steuart has said, "We shall remember!"
Let me say just a few words about two promises the
Conservatives seem bent upon keeping.
Senator Flynn: Only two?
Senator Perrault: They are two of the worst. My friend, if I
went through the complete list of all of the promises which
have not been kept and described them in detail, we would be
here until five o'clock tomorrow morning and we would just be
making a start.

SENATE DEBATES

The Petro-Canada fiasco is a glaring illustration of misguided Tory promises and disturbingly incompetent administration.
Let us hope that things will improve shortly. I don't want to
condemn them at this point; it would be unfair.
During the election campaign Mr. Clark described our
national oil agency as a "turkey." He called it a turkey. Coast
to coast it was Canada's "turkey" and he pledged to axe it.
All the public opinion polls have shown overwhelming popular support for Petro-Canada. I wonder how Senator Murray,
in his former capacity as a national Progressive Conservative
Party chairman, and a successful one by political standards,
failed to read those polls properly or accurately. Even prominent Conservatives like the distinguished and respected M.P.
Bob Coates, the national Progressive Conservative Party president, have argued that Petro-Canada should stay.
The debate on this issue has raged in many circles this
summer across the country, but the key man responsible, the
energy minister, has for the most part remained totally silent;
or totally confused is perhaps a better way to describe it.
In a feature story in Maclean's magazine in August, the
minister, Mr. Hnatyshyn, earned the dubious headline, and I
quote, "The Case of the Missing Minister," for the fashion in
which he has abdicated his responsibilities in relation to PetroCanada as well as on the crucial question of oil pricing policy.
Even newspapers in his home province of Saskatchewan, like
the Regina Leader Post, for exampleSenator Steuart: A Tory rag, if there ever was one.
Senator Perrault: -which, I understand, urged the clection
of a Clark government, have used words like "a disaster" and
"an embarrassment" to describe the energy minister's sorry
performance. We don't want to be unfairly critical here.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, no, no!
Senator Perrault: But this material must be placed on the
record. Despite the prevalent public opinion about PetroCanada, despite key backbench support for the agency in the
Conservative caucus and despite some of the minister's own
publicly-stated views, the government seems bent upon the
destruction of Petro-Canada.
Canadians are asking why. The reason may have been pretty
well summed up by nationally-syndicated columnist Richard
Gwyn. Writing in September under the headline "Cabinet
Sold Out Part of its Energy Policy to Look Tough," Mr. Gwyn
had this to say:
The inner Cabinct's decision was close.
It must have been a dramatic meeting you had, Mr. Leader.
The inner Cabinet's decision was close. It might have
gone the other way had not the government already had
to back away as far as it could from its promise to move
our Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, had not Sports
Minister Steve Paproski mused aloud how it might not be
such a bad idea, after all, if Ottawa continued to run Loto
Canada, and had not Finance Minister John Crosbie
similarly talked in public about how promised tax-cuts
may not be implemented in his first budget.
[Senator Perrault.]

October 1 1, 1979
October Il, 1979

Mr. Tough Guy!
After all that softness, the inner Cabinet felt it had to
be firm on Petro-Canada ... To prevent the government's
political credibility from corroding, the inner Cabinet
Ministers chose to cast away one of their instruments of
energy policy. Instead, all they accomplished was to corrode the credibility of their political will. They wanted to
appear strong. They acted weak.
That was Richard Gwyn in his nationally-syndicated column
across Canada.
An Hon. Senator: Prejudice!
Senator Perrault: 1 can only suggest that Mr. Gwyn has
quoted Conservatives very favourably on a number of matters
in the past. And the same Mr. Gwyn urged Canadians from
coast to coast to vote for this government. Now you attack his
credibility and logic, honourable senators. Was he wrong as
well in May? That is a consideration which should haunt you.
Honourable senators, I had intended to speak at length
about Petro-Canada, but I think that a longer debate should
be held in this chamber on a future occasion to talk about this
issue and to talk about whether this agency is serving the
interests of Canadians and whether or not this mad drive to
destroy Petro-Canada is in the public interest.
I want to say that Canadians now own a national petrolcum
company whose aim is to ensure that Canadians will have the
supplies of oil and natural gas needed in the years ahead. It is
a company that makes sufficient profit from conventional
involvement in the industry to achieve its goal without excessively burdening the taxpayer.
It always interests me, regarding some of this Conservative
philosophy, that they love to go across the country talking
about how inefficient governments are, and they say, "Why,
every government corporation loses money. Everyone knows
that." Then all of their proposals are to privatize only those
government operations which make money and to leave all of
the unprofitable and marginal operations still to be supported
by the taxpayers to limp along on government subsidies so that
at some future time they can say, "Well, we are a free
enterprise party. Look at those government corporations. They
can't turn a profit."
I think that is grossly unfair to many of the operations
which have been developing and thriving under government
ownership or with partial government support.
That does not mean to say that Liberals are at all opposed to
the privatization of certain companies; but there has to be
consistency with respect to this policy, and we urge the government not merely to retain all of the money-losing propositions
and burden taxpayers with them and sell off the money-making ones to the private sector. There must be an even-handed
policy.

Petro-Canada has the power not only to find future energy
supplies in Canada but to negotiate with foreign countries for
an assured supply of imports.

October Il, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

The Canadian people and the Canadian economy will need
secure oil supplies at the best possible price for many years to
come. In my view, only a publicly-owned company like PetroCanada can deliver this. That is why this Liberal opposition
party actively opposes a move by the Conservatives to jeopardize energy security for Canadians, and we intend to speak out
very vigorously on this matter in the months to come.
I would like to turn to another area where one of the few
promises the Tories are keeping will cause major problems for
Canada. Going back to Mr. Clark's very first hours in office,
the issue of relocating Canada's embassy in Israel from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem gave us our first clue about how foolish and
accident-prone the new government was likely to be. The
promise to move the embassy was originally made to win votes
for the Conservatives in certain areas of the country where
they thought such a move might be popular. The fact is that
the Prime Minister blundered with that idea, disregarding the
best professional advice, disregarding the continuing state of
conflict in the Middle East, and also the delicate state of peace
negotiations in that area.

(1610)

In one fell swoop-perhaps it has never happened before in
the history of Canadian government and politics-the Tories
managed to anger both the Arabs and the Jews simultaneously. They have damaged Canada's long-standing reputation as
an honest and fair broker in Middle East affairs, especially
peacekeeping; they have made Canadian officials in diplomatic
offices abroad the potential targets of possible terrorist
attacks; and they have also put millions of dollars of existing
and potential business for Canadians in serious jeopardy.
As a last ditch effort to save face, Mr. Clark asked Robert
Stanfield, a highly respected Canadian-now know as "Stanfield of Arabia," I suppose-to intervene on a mission to bail
out the government. Mr. Stanfield is finding it to be an
impossible task, and he is a reasonable, able gentleman.
Let us take a look at the overwhelming public reaction to
the Conservative policy on our Israeli embassy. First may 1
quote from a letter sent to my former office, the old office
occupied by the then Leader of the Government. It was
received by my office this week from a spokesman for a major
international company based in Canada-and I refer to
Northern Telecom.
The letter is not marked "Personal and Confidential," and I
shall therefore quote from it as follows:
October 5, 1979
Telecom Limited
Northern
255 Albert Street
Ottawa, Ontario
... For our part, Northern Telecom's representatives in
the Middle East inform us that Canada has been under
almost daily attack in Arab newspapers during the past
recent months. They have noted a distinct change in
attitude and action of the representatives of our customers. I am advised that there has been a slowdown in
contract negotiations in the past several months. In the

event that there was a complete cutoff of negotiation the
effect would be measured in many millions of dollars and
several hundred jobs.
That is a letter from one company alone. Despite this
blundering policy, losing reactor contracts in Argentina and
valuable contracts in the Middle East when it is not necessary
to do so, this nation, at the same time, can retain its moral
force in the world without compromising any of its principles.
What is the reason for this insanity? Why do we embark on
policies so badly thought out that we are endangering the
ability of thousands of Canadians to earn a living, and lengthening the unemployment lines? I would ask honourable senators to listen to the following quotations about bumbling
government policy in the Middle East.
A spokesman for the Department of Industry, Trade and
Commerce-the minister's own department-says:
Canada stands to lose at least 55,000 jobs and $1.6 billion
worth of imported petroleum if the Arabs retaliate against
an embassy move by cutting off all trade.
The Minister of National Defence, the Honourable Allan
McKinnon-the government leader's distinguished cabinet
colleague-made the following statement on June 13:
With our present difficulties with the Arab world, I don't
think that Iran would sell us a bucketful of sand let alone
a special price on F-14s.
Roger Banister, President of Banister Continental, on the
fourteenth of that month, said:
The embassy move is like taking a bet when you have
everything to lose and nothing to gain.
There have been comments from Ronald Keating of Litton
Industries, and also from J.C. Thackery of Bell. The latter
said:
Bell is completing the second year of a 5-year ($1.5
billion) contract but it is renegotiating with a view to
doubling its business in the country.
Such action on the part of the government is placing contracts of that kind in jeopardy.
Quite apart from the effect on employment in this country is
the effect on the exchange rate of our dollar. There is now a
vital need to export and sell more abroad. This is precisely the
wrong time for governments te blunder into a delicate international situation, and affect thereby not only the economic
prospect of Canadian manufacturers and companies, not only
endanger Canadian jobs, but also adversely affect our ability
to be an honest broker in the Middle East. Canada traditionally has done everything it can to bring about peace in the
Middle East. This country recognizes that Israel must exist
behind safe and secure boundaries and, at the same time, is
using its good initiatives toward solving the difficult and
intransigent Palestinian refugee problem.
Rowland Frazee, of the Royal Bank of Canada, said:
A threatened financial boycott of Canada by Arab countries must not be underestimated.

striving to ensure that the legislation the government brings in
serves to implement those common aims.
I hope honourable senators appreciate the degree to which
this place has been strengthened by the new government. The
presence in this chamber of three ministers with portfolios will
upgrade the relevance of our deliberations and aid significantly
towards Senate reform. As for ministerial accountability, I feel
certain, as a result of yesterday's Question Period, and of
course, today's, that it will be ensured, in spades.
The Prime Minister, by design or necessity, has recognized
the legitimacy, importance, and vitality of this chamber. It is
now up to us to demonstrate to the Canadian people the
wisdom of that decision and to drive home the inestimable
value of a bicameral system. The position of prominence which
has now been accorded to this chamber now equips us, as never
before, to discharge our mandate as representatives of the
regions of Canada. Rarely has there existed a better opportunity to articulate at the centre the views of the communities
which make up this great federation.
The Speech from the Throne emphasized this government's
realization that cultural and regional diversity is a Canadian
strength, not a weakness. While the late John Porter's sociological dichotomy of the melting pot versus the mosaic may no
longer strictly apply, the fact is that Prime Minister Clark, a
man wise beyond his years, recognizes that a Canadian identity within this vast North American continent cannot be
achieved through homogeneity. Rather, regional traditions and
customs, honoured for their value to our nationality and
represented and listened to by the national government, will
strenghten both the parts and the whole.
The Clark government is determined to redress the numerous misgivings about this country sincerely held by many
sectors of the population; and it is wondrous to behold how the
assurance of both an ear and a voice in Ottawa serves to soothe
badly ruffled feathers.
This is where the Senate can be of great help. We are
created, in part, for just that purpose: to ensure regional
representation in Parliament. We should fulfil that purpose
with added determination now that we are guaranteed
recognition.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, the particularism of Quebec will not
disappear: it must be respected by this house. We must
abandon any technocratic effort towards shaping Quebec after
the other provinces. The present government, within which I
have the honour of representing Quebec, has already won
praise, even that of the duly elected Quebec government, not
because it approves its ultimate objectives-that is certainly
not the case-but rather because it proved it could listen and
make room for consultation, which helped to dissipate part of
that feeling of confrontation that had prevailed until then.
I sincerely believe that Quebecers can become imbued with
the feeling which impels the new government. It has no
intention of treating them with paternalism. It does intend
instead to prove that this government enjoys the necessary

credibility from sea to sea to implement the changes needed to
ensure the respect of particular regional, cultural and linguistic characteristics.
I feel that we have already proved our good faith by
implementing quickly the recommendations of the commission
assigned the task of looking into bilingualism in air communications. That decision was made possible thanks to the sense of
tolerance and fair play of the people. We knew Canadians had
those qualities. We now have proof of it. The man who chaired
that commission of inquiry, a learned and shrewd man, will
henceforth have the opportunity of serving his province and his
country in the Supreme Court of Canada.
Allow me, in addition, to render unto Caesar the things that
are Caesar's by pointing out that the appointment of Mr.
Marcel Massé as the highest civil servant in the land is clear
proof that this government put into practice the wise policy of
equality of opportunities for francophones in the Civil Service
of Canada.
We now stand on the eve of a new era in federal-provincial
relations in our country. Pessimism and negativism must now
be things of the past. We have every reason to face the future
with confidence and enthusiasm. The province of Newfoundland could be mentioned as an example of a province whose
aspirations loom high and whose future looks very promising.
Whether it be Newfoundland, Quebec or Alberta, an obvious change can be noticed in the approach of the federal
government. That new approach to problems will make it
possible to unite all the governments of the country through
new ties of solidarity. The objective of this government is to
increase the self-sufficiency of the provinces. We are not trying
to gain control over their destiny. On the contrary! We hope
they will henceforth assume a greater share of the responsibilities that will enable them to give that destiny its orientation.
e (1630)

[English]
Honourable senators, this is a government with a new style.
Joe Clark has invited the province of Newfoundland to share
in the economic wealth of this nation; to become a "have"
province; to enjoy at least the prospect of no longer being
dependent on handouts; and to be in a position to give rather
than to receive. You will grant me, I trust, that economically
viable provinces can form a strong federation, and you will not
counter with the antiquated belief that they must all be poor
and reliant upon Ottawa. Yes, senators, with the advent of this
new government, sensitive to the feelings and aspirations of the
provinces, a new era of federal-provincial relations has come to
Canada.
My thoughts on the matter of promoting increased harmony
among governments in this country were initiated today in the
context of regional representation, a function of this chamber,
which is of paramount importance. I have indicated that the
relevance of this house, in the sense of day-to-day government,
has appreciated. Visibility carries with it, of course, a great
responsibility to the people, the process, and the institution of
Parliament.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
We are more than just an assembly of sober second thought.
Our committees, while never delaying legislation, pass effective judgment and make sound recommendations. Recent
reports by Senate committees on trade with the U.S., growth,
employment and price stability, and many other matters, are a
testimony to the creativity and soundness of judgment present
in this place. The appointment of vigorous new senators will, I
am convinced, contribute to that process.
As a house of Parliament, we cannot, however, lose sight of
the fact that if only because the public believes it to be so, we
as senators have not the same mandate as our elected colleagues down the hall. I need not remind the Senate that the
British Lords once had as much authority as we do now until,
after a protracted dispute with the Asquith Liberal government in 1911, it vas largely emasculated. We know, as astute
political beings, that the Senate would lose any electoral
contest provoked by a stubborn refusal on the part of this
house to pass, after careful consideration of course, the legislation commended to us by the other place.
It is in this vein that I particularly appreciate the thoughts
on this subject of Senator Perrault this afternoon and as
quoted over the summer. A visit to Westminster has apparently convinced him that policies endorsed by the people with
their ballots warrant spcedy enactment into law; that statesman-like co-operation in that regard will be instrumental to
the process of governing this country; and, as the Leader of the
Liberal Party has added his view, that the Senate should not
obstruct the will of the democratically-elected government, 1
guess we have every reason to expect a congenial session
ahead.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, we are counting on your support
because the Speech from the Throne suggests that this government is determined to act. Already this summer the Prime
Minister and his cabinet took a host of unprecedented steps.
The government showed determination in making cutbacks.
It did so because it is deeply convinced that any waste must be
eliminated, more particularly any squandering of public
monies. The combined effects of this approach and a concern
for government efficiency should enable this government to
put us back on the road to economic prosperity.
We know perfectly that a policy of restraint is not a popular
one. But we know also that somebody had to show the people
the difficult situation that we have inherited.
So we had to take a double dose of courage and tell it to the
people as it is. That is what the new government endeavoured
to do as soon as it took office.
We want our government to govern. Furthermore, we want
the people to know about our goal and that we are doing
everything we can to achieve it.
[En glish]
We are telling it like it is, and the Canadian people seem to
appreciate this forthrightness. That is why the Minister of
Finance, despite an improving unemployment and inflation
picture, has prognosticated a deteriorating economic scene for
[senator Flynn.j

1980. From this the people will glean that our approach is to
cease covering up and to cease applying bandaids in favour of
creating a sound economic structure over the medium and
longer ternis.
The task is not an easy one. The experience will be a
wrenching one, for what we are attempting to do is to give
government back to the people. We are trying to give the
taxpayer a more direct say in how his tax dollars are spent. We
are bound and determined that there should be less government influence in the day-to-day lives of Canadians. Smaller
government and bigger people-that is what we want for this
country.
We have inherited a social and economic situation which, to
say the least, is a challenge. Now we turn to the people and
ask, "Won't you please support us in the difficult decisions
that we are going to have to make in the next short while?
Won't you help us gel Canada producing again?" The answer
has been, "Yes." The determination to make a success of this
renewal is ever increasing.
* (1640)

Honourable senators, I have faith that the people will show
us compassion as we proceed to enact our legislation. After all,
the Throne Speech and other indicators have revealed clearly
that it is the will of this government to once again make the
individual count.
It is hoped also that gone are the days of alienation on the
part of Canadians from the Parliament of Canada. Parliament
must never be made to feel impotent. The government must
never become overbearing and inflexible. We must strive to
win back the attention and sympathies of Canadians, particularly the young. One of the first steps this administration took
along these lines was to include in the Throne Speech specifics
as to how the consequence of Parliament, and hence the
representativeness of the individual, might be reinforced.
Just a few months in office and the Progressive Conservatives have made it clear that the people have a right, with very
specific exceptions, and facilitated by a simple appeal process,
to know what it is the government is doing, what options it is
considering and how our tax dollars are being spent. The
enactment now of freedom of information legislation will, I
predict, have such an impact on the face of government in this
country that it might come to be remembered as Joc Clark's
"Bill of Rights."
Now, honourable senators, we do not plan to stop there. As
the Throne Speech implied, this government will act to guarantee the individual a greater voice through a Commons with a
redefined purpose. Both the independence and the productivity
of Commons' committees will escalate once they are given the
power to call witnesses, before televised sittings, and to be
backed up by expert professional staff.
Having promised the individual a voice in Parliament, the
Throne Speech promises the individual a stake in his country.
Much has been said of the government's program to phase in a
mortgage and property tax credit. It is, in my opinion, an
equitable and forward-looking initiative, designed to stimulate

October 11, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

employment through the encouragement of a broadly held but
heretofore difficult to realize societal goal-home ownership. I
surely need not expound upon the stabilizing influence of home
ownership in our urban environment of today. I will say that
for those who prefer to rent, not only will they continue to
enjoy, albeit indirectly, a similar tax advantage, but they
should have a wider choice of rental accommodation available
to them as families who currently rent realize their dreams and
move into newly-built accommodation.

[Translation]
Honourable senators, the program of tax credits for mortgage interest is but one of the solutions applied by this
government to the economic challenge it is now facing. The
Speech from the Throne recognizes the fact that only the
private sector can create permanent and full-time jobs. During
the 1976 session, I stated that the government must stop
wasting money in vain attempts at job creation. The many
job-creation programs implemented by governments throughout the years have all proved ineffective.

more to consider the changes required to the Fugitive Offenders Act as well as provisions which will finally allow the
garnishment of salaries paid by the federal government. Moreover, the government will ask this house to consider an
increase in the salary of judges appointed at the federal level,
proposals concerning freedom of information, as well as other
amendments to the Federal Court Act and the Canadian
Human Rights Act.

I have here a list of measures that the government intends to
introduce in Parliament during the first session. Perhaps they
could be printed as an appendix to today's proceedings for the
information of members of this house. They will note that this
list contains at least five bills which come directly under the
Department of Justice.
(For list see Appendix "C",p. 59.)
It is quite obvious, honourable senators, that we shall be
very busy during this session and that we will have a lot of
work to do.

[English]
The new government proposes an economic development
strategy based upon the joint efforts of labour, business and
government. Canada's technical skills are recognized universally, but our progress in this area has slowed down because
other countries have constantly allocated more funds to
research and development than our own government. We have
put a stop to this unforgivable indifference to our advance over
our competitors; since the government is concerned with the
middle term, it agreed to further assist the development of our
advanced technical sector, which will put to good use our
highly qualified manpower.

As you know, honourable senators, I sit in the cabinet in
both capacities of Leader of the Government in the Senate and
of Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. I
would like to give some indication of the various legislative
measures that Parliament will be called upon to consider and
which come under my specific responsibility.

I fully expect to be able to introduce a bill amending many
provisions of the Criminal Code. Parliament will be asked once

Honourable senators, as I have said, in this session the
government will be introducing legislation in many areas, and
I have asked that there be printed as an appendix to today's
Hansard a list of some of the measures the government will
propose to place before Parliament during the present session.

Honourable senators, that is generally our program. It is an
ambitious one, one that will require great industry to implement properly. I am sure we in the Senate will do our share to
sec to it that this new government gives Canada the direction
and leadership it needs to face the decade of the eighties.

In closing, I would like to say a word about Senate reform. I
am awaiting introduction in the other place of the government's white paper on parliamentary reform. That document
should serve as a focus for discussion in this chamber as well.
Pursuant to its presentation, it is my intention to discuss with
the Leader of the Opposition, in some greater detail, the
substance of Senate reform about which we have often spoken
in the past, and also some possible changes in the arrangement
of our day-to-day business.

STATEMENT BY THE HONOURABLE RAY HNATYSHYN
MINISTER OF ENERGY. MINES AND RESOURCES

September 5, 1979.
The government has now completed an extensive and
detailed review of the operations and functions of Petro
Canada. This review has confirmed the government's intention
to see a significant proportion of the assets of Petro Canada
returned to the private sector and to end the preferential
position the government company now holds in frontier lands.
It is the government's firm conviction that these assets will be
more effectively managed in the private sector and that the
benefit of their ownership should be broadly distributed among
Canadian citizens.
Certain activities should continue in the public sector. The
government, in pursuit of its overall energy objectives, sees the
following functions as properly residing with the government:
(i) the negotiation of state to state contracts for the
importation of crude oil where necessary:
(ii) the promotion of exploration in frontier areas with
increased Canadian participation and at a pace which
cannot be expected of the private sector alone;
(iii) the promotion, along with frontier exploration, of tar
sands and heavy oils research and development.
I have, therefore, appointed:
1. Roland Giroux
2. Sid Kahanoff
3. Donald McDougall (Chairman)
4. Ralph Sykes
as a task force to advise nie on which of the existing assets of
Petro Canada might most beneficially bc returned to the
private sector as well as to broaden Canadian participation
and ownership. The task force will advise as well on the best
means, in its view, of effecting this transfer of ownership to
individual Canadians. In tendering its advice, the task force
will also be concerned to ensure that sufficient capacity is left
with the government to carry out the three essential functions.
The task force is to make its report to me not later than
mid-October.

THE HONOURABLE SARTO FOURNIER
THE HONOURABLE AZELLUS DENIS
FELICITATIONS-FORTY-FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS IN
PARLIAMENT

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it has been
drawn to my attention, and I believe honourable senators
would wish it to be drawn to the attention of the Senate, that
Senators Sarto Fournier and Azellus Denis completed 44
consecutive years in Parliament on Sunday, October 14. They
were first elected to the House of Commons on October 14,
1935, and have remained in the service of Canada and the
Parliament of Canada from that day to this, with great
distinction.
[Translation]
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I think 1 should echo
the Speaker and congratulate Honourable Senators Sarto
Fournier and Azellus Denis, who have been sitting over 40
years in Parliament.
As they both look quite young-unfortunately Senator
Denis is not here-we realize that they launched their career
quite early. I am sure they will remain among us for a long
time. I extend to both of them my congratulations and my best
wishes.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I also wish to highlight the 44 years of uninterrupted service in Parliament which
Senator Sarto Fournier and Senator Azellus Denis completed
last Sunday, October 14.
I know that my colleague-Senator Denis is here now.
[English]
Senator Denis: What about the gift?
[Translation]
Senator Flynn: It will come.
Senator Perrault: I know that my colleagues want to join me
in extending our sincere congratulations and best wishes of
good health on this occasion.
We hope they will rernain among us for years to come.
Senator Fournier (de Lanaudière): Honourable senators,
after all the unexpected praise which we have just received, my
colleague Senator Denis and myself, they were more or less
deserved at the beginning, we owe them to the generosity and
the loyalty of the electors of the constituency of Saint-Denis

and those of Maisonneuve and Rosemont who during 18 years
have kindly let us serve them.
Since 1953, I have had the honour of sitting among you. I
feel that I must tell you, because I have felt in my conscience,
my heart and my mind, since the very first day that, to
belong-excuse me, I no longer have the voice I had in days
gone by-that to belong to this august assembly for so long is,
I believe, in civil life as well as in public life, the highest
honour and at the same time the heaviest burden a man can
assume.
As for the Senate, it is not nearly as much in the limelight
as the House of Commons because the type of discussions we
have here, the type of analysis and reflection we do is not quite
the same as those in the House of Commons with which, both
my friend Senator Denis and myself have had considerable
experience. In the other place, one fights to be re-elected while
serving the country. Here, we are solely concerned with serving
our country to the best of our ability.
It was an honour for me to do so with you and, to those who
wished me to continue doing so for years to come, 1 say I hope
their wishes come true.
Senator Denis: Honourable senators, I have just come in
and learned why I was applauded. Probably because you
praised me. So, I accept your praise and thank you for it. I
also thank you for the faults you ignored.
And so, I hope I shall continue to serve very humbly. I trust
that all those who have the courage to spend 44 years in public
life will also deserve congratulations.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Despite his own strong personal misgivings, a proposed
oil tanker route off the British Columbia coast has some
merit to it.
* (2015)

I wonder if the Leader of the Government could provide
some of the reasons why that statement was made by his
colleague. At the same time, perhaps the Leader of the
Government might share with us the information which has
led to the conclusion that there is merit in shipping huge
quantities of oil off the west coast of Canada.
Senator Flynn: I will certainly obtain a reply from the
Honourable John Fraser.
Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question to put to
the Leader of the Government. Because of the tremendous
environmental and economic ramifications that flow from the
fact that Foothills is withdrawing its application for an all-land
route, can he advise this chamber whether or not the government had any advance warning of this?
Senator Flynn: I will also endeavour to obtain a reply for the
honourable senator.
Senator Oison: May I ask a further supplementary question? Was the government not advised that Foothills was going
to withdraw its application for an all-land route before the
National Energy Board hearings commenced in Vancouver?
Senator Flynn: I don't know if the government was advised
or not. I was not so advised.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I am really baffled. I
understand that the Leader of the Government is a member of
the so-called inner cabinet for economic policies. Are we to be
told now that this very important economic and environmental
matter is unknown to him?
Senator Flynn: Perhaps the honourable senator does not
remember how cabinet worked in his days because it was a
long time ago, but advice to the government does not necessarily reach every member of cabinet.
Senator Perrault: Does it reach anyone?

QUESTION PERIOD
ENERGY
TANKER TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL ON WEST COAST

Senator Perrault: May I direct a question to the Leader of
the Government in the Senate and the Honourable the Minister of Justice? For some years the Minister of the Environment, the Honourable John Fraser, has been a fervent advocate of measures and initiatives to protect the environment. I
would ask the Leader of the Government to provide information with respect to a statement, attributed to his colleague in
an interview, which appears on the front page of the Vancouver Sun, dated October 12, 1979.

Senator Flynn: It certainly does eventually. Senator Perrault
should know that. It is not such a long time ago that he was a
member of the administration.
Senator Oison: I have one further supplementary question.
If I am not going to get any further information I think it is
futile to ask these questions, but did the government have
consultations with the Government of the United States prior
to the announcement being made of the so-called Northern
Tier pipeline in the United States?
Senator Flynn: I do not know. I will inquire of my colleague,
the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. He is probably
the one who had consultations, if anyone did.

SENATE DEBATES
THE ENVIRONMENT
POLLUTION BY ACID RAIN

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, I intended to direct
my question to the minister responsbile for economic development, and I am sorry that he is not here. I hope we have not
exhausted him or pumped him dry after only two days of
questions.
Senator Flynn: Certainly not you.
Senator Steuart: When he has recovered I hope to sec him
back in his place for the next Question Period.
I will direct my question to the Leader of the Government.
This question flows from the national concern being expressed
regarding the pollution threat known as acid rain, which has
become an enormous worry for industrial plants in Canada
and the United States.
Today in the other place the government indicated that it
intended to deal with this problem in a comprehensive way and
not on an industry-by-industry basis. My question is: Does this
imply that the government will promote new industrial
projects that might add to this pollution problem without
regard for the possibility of an acid rain threat? Does the
government intend to promote industrial development that will
clearly pose a threat of acid rain'?
An Hon. Senator: He doesn't know.
Senator Flynn: I think it was the former Minister of
Agriculture-who was not very long in cabinet-who said that
he doesn't know. He knows that many ministers did not know
much in his time.
The question is directed to the Minister of the Environment,
the Honourable John Fraser. I will obtain a reply from him.
e (2020)

Senator Steuart: A further supplementary. I do not know
whether the minister in the last government set any kind of
record in terms of not knowing, but if this keeps up you will no
doubt be in the Guinness Book of Records along with him, or
a little ahead of him.
My question should perhaps be directed as well to the
Minister of State for Economic Development. I would like to
draw his attention to the acid rain problem associated with the
construction of a new hydro-electric plant on the CanadianUnited States border in the town of Coronach in southern
Saskatchewan. This problem has been known for some time
and is of considerable concern on both sides of the border,
especially to farmers in that immediate area of the province of
Saskatchewan.
Despite the recent and rather surprising support for that
plant offered by the Honourable Flora MacDonald, the Secretary of State for External Affairs, in a message to the International Joint Commission, will the government consider withholding further support for the Coronach plant until the
environmental and other worries regarding its pollution potential have been satisfactorily resolved?
[Senator Flynn.]

October 16, 1979
October

1979

Senator Flynn: I shall put that question to the Honourable
John Fraser. I do not know that the problem of acid rain is
worse because it is near the border, as opposed to elsewhere.
Senator Steuart: Well, I want to point out that, to my mind,
this is dreadfully important in view of the fact that the
Americans are putting about five times as much acid rain over
eastern Canada as we are, and we cannot very well ask them to
clean up their act and have our government apparently
encouraging the same kind of thing in Saskatchewan on our
side of the border.
Senator Flynn: Is it my honourable friend's position that this
is a problem that has developed since May 22 last?
Senator Steuart: The plant is not in operation. It is a new
plant, and the problem is that your government supports the
development of this plant, and has indicated that support of
the IJC. This is something new, and I would hope the Leader
of the Government in the Senate would look into it and report
to the Senate on how serious the minister concerned thinks the
acid rain problem is.
Senator Flynn: I am quite sure the present minister is more
serious than the previous one.
Senator Perrault: There has been a lot of fallout since May
22.
YUKON TERRITORY
GOVERN MENT POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE GOVERN MENT

Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, I have some questions
for the Leader of the Government. My questions to the Leader
of the Government last week concerning his government's
policy on responsible government in the Yukon were not fully
answered. If the people of the Yukon have a referendum and
vote for provincial status, will agreement be required from the
provinces before provincial status is granted?
I want it clearly understood that my question concerns
agreement of the provinces, not consultation with them. Will
the agreement of the ten provinces be required before provincial status is granted to the Yukon?
Senator Flynn: I shall endeavour to get a reply to that very
important question. If my memory serves me correctly, there
was no agreement required from the other provinces when
Newfoundland joined Canada.
Senator Lucier: I agree, but when Newfoundland joined
Canada, the Prime Minister of the day did not promise the
premiers of the other provinces that they would be consulted,
whereas Prime Minister Clark has donc so in this instance.
That is why I ask the question.
I have a further question that I would like to ask of the
Leader of the Government. Since the Minister of Indian
Affairs and Northern Development has already indicated to
the Leader of the Government in the Yukon Legislative
Assembly that he may call himself "Premier", what will be the
status of the Yukon Legislative Assembly should the people of
the Yukon vote against provincial status?

This was set out in the letter to lone Christensen to which 1

bringing about ber resignation.
We now have a man who bas been told by this government
that he can cal! himself "Premier". What happens in the event
that the people vote against provincial status-which 1 think
they will?
Senator Flynn: Without assuming your statement to bc truc,
the mere fact that a minister has told someone that he may
cail himself "Premier" does flot necessarily make it legal.
Senator Perrault: That is interesting.
Senator Lucier: That statement is contained in a letter that
was sent by the minister to the Commissioner. On the first
page of the letter the minister indicates that he wiIl be
discussing this problem with the Minister of Justice and the
Ninister of State for Federal- Provincial Relations.

Senator Leblanc: Honourable senators, my question should

reply, but in any case, I have received from the office of the
Prime M inister a press release dated October 12 which says in
the second paragraph, in English:

(2025)

Canada will provide $950,000 worth of food aid in the
short term, in addition to a $75,000 grant for Domînîca
through the League of Red Cross Societies.
But, in the language of Molière, the same paragraph reads
as follows:
Dans l'immédiat, le Canada enverra à ce pays des secours
alimentaires équivalent à $950,000 et une subvention de
75 millions de dollars par l'intermédiaire de la Société de
la Croix-Rouge.
In English it says $75,000, and in French $75 million. Is the
government more generous in French than in English?
Senator Asselin: Weil, I think the honourable senators
noticed immediately the mistake in that release. AIl I know is
that as the minister in charge of CIDA I authorized funds of
$150,000 through the Red Cross to help Dominica recover
from the disaster and help its victims. I think I will also be
shortly providing further help in view of the disastrous situation in that country.
80072-5

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, 1 should like to ask
Senator Flynn a question. If provincial status is given to the
Yukon Territory, and particularly to the Northwest Territories, which seems to be favoured by the federal government,
will it be the policy of the federal government to pass over to
these new provinces complete control of ail the energy
resources in the Arctic and the Beaufort Sea?
Senator Flynn: I would suggest, honourable senators, that
such policy will be announced in due course. Those territories
have first to achieve the status the honourable senator is
speaking about.
Senator Buckwold: 1 don't believe that that is a very satisfactory answer. I would like to have a denial.
Senator Flynn: It is not a satisfactory question.
Senator Buckwold: It is a legitimate question and one that
concerns aIl of us. We have these great resources in the Arctic,
and it would seem to me that again the goverfiment is weakening the whole federal position by preparing the way for passing
these on to what could be new provinces.
Senator Flynn: Are you speaking of the areas without the
Yukon Territory or ail the Northwest Territories?
Senator Buckwold: The offshore energy resources plus the
onshore resources.
Senator Flynn: I do not know of any offshore resources for
the Yukon Territory.
Senator Buckwold: Weil, I think there are lots.

his colleague, the minister responsible for the direction of
economic affairs, is absent from the chamber this evening?
The government may wish to consider the appointment of
parliamentary secretaries in this house for those rare occasions, when ministers are not able to be present in the Senate.
For example, it would be helpful, because of the importance
of the economic portfolio, to have some specific information on
certain questions posed here this evening.
Senator Choquette: How many did you have in your
cabinet?
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there have been
continuing expressions of serious concern about the availability
of fuel oil this winter in both the Atlantic provinces and
eastern Canada. Is the Leader of the Government able to give
an assurance to the Senate this evening that the government is
aware of a possible fuel shortage this winter and that measures-extraordinary measures, if necessary-will be taken to
ensure there is no interruption in the vital supply of fuel oil
supplies for Canadians?
Senator Flynn: In reply to the question, and not to the
previous comment, of the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources made a statement in the
other place to which any honourable senator can refer. If the
Leader of the Opposition wishes me to recite that statement, I
will do so.
As to the appointment of parliamentary secretaries, when
the Leader of the Opposition was the only member of the
government in the Senate, we did not feel the need for a
parliamentary secretary even when the honourable senator was
absent.
Senator Perrault: May I suggest that the situation is somewhat unique in that there are now three members of the
government in this bouse on the other side, and there may be a
valid case for having the back-up support for ministers that I
suggest. I repeat that the situation is somewhat different.
Senator Flynn: I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition
that a parliamentary secretary would only be able to provide
the Senate with the replies of the minister. The minister will be
present tomorrow and will be able to give the same reply that a
parliamentary secretary would give.
Senator Perrault: I understand that the colleague of the
Leader of the Government is, in fact, in Ottawa this evening.
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Perrault: It must be, I suggest, a rather pressing
occasion to keep him from this chamber.
Senator Flynn: As pressing an occasion as those when the
Leader of the Opposition was in Vancouver, organizing on
behalf of his party, with the results that are well known to us
all.
Senator Perrault: I did not organize anything on Senate
time.
Senator Flynn: You never organized anything.

PETRO-CANADA
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT OF TASK FORCE

Senator Frith: Can the Leader of the Government give us

Senator Flynn: The government will respond in due course. I
am not the one to reply to that report. It is up to the
government, particularly the Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources. I am quite sure that the honourable senator is
studying the report very carefully and will not draw conclusions before be bas had time to reflect on it.
Senator Frith: Some of the suggestions contained in the
report are sufficiently amusing as to delay any final judgment.
Do I understand that the answer can only be obtained from the
Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, and that the Leader
of the Government cannot tell us when the government might
respond to that report?
Senator Flynn: I am not in a position to give the exact date.
It may take a°few days. In the meantime, the honourable
senator will continue to be amused.

seconded by Senator Charbonneau, for an Address in reply
thereto.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
[Translation]
Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, first I wish to
pay tribute to Their Excellencies who are already fulfilling
their duties with so much dignity and energy.
This year, the list of senators to be congratulated is longer
than ever. It includes, first of all, our new Speaker, who, I am
convinced, will chair our proceedings with wisdom and
patience. It includes aiso our two colleagues who did so well in
opening this debate and our new ministerial trinity of which
two members, including the government leader have been
forced into entering the cabinet and the other who became a
senator unwittingly. The list also includes all of our new
colleagues.
I wish to congratulate more particularly the Conservative
Party for having succeeded in retaining the services of Senator
Tremblay, one of my colleagues at Laval University and once
my neighbour from across the street on Forget Street in
Quebec City.
And finally I shall add that we are now particularly privileged in the Senate since we have among us, sitting on the
same bench, on one hand the brain of the Conservative Party,
the Minister of State for Economic Development, the author
of electoral promises and beside him, the party's conscience,
Senator Murray, who makes sure that those promises are kept.
In my new role, as opposition member, my attitude will not
change much because in the past I criticized on several
occasions the former government when it was formed by my
party. However, by assigning to three of our colleagues important ministerial responsibilities, the Prime Minister forces us,
on the opposition side, to accentuate our role as critics because
otherwise, three ministers would escape parliamentary control
which obviously, would be contrary to our system and political
traditions. I for one do not intend to shun my responsibilities
as a critic but I intend to discharge them in a climate of
friendship and dignity without ever resorting to personal
attacks.
It secms that the new government since taking over has
attempted to facilitate and somehow extend our job, as critics.
Almost five months after the clection, at a time when our
economy is in deeper trouble, we still do not know the broad
trends and the main elements of the economic and financial
policies of this government. It is certainly not the opposition
that has paralyzed the administration of the nation since the
month of May. It is the government that put itself in trouble.
I think it was demagogical to make irresponsible promises
bejore the clection. It is ridiculous and against the public
interest to want to keep them now, aßier the election. It seems
that the ministers at the other end of the corridor are still
looking for the list of promises made by their leader during the
election campaign. Each time those ministers discover a new
commitment made by the Prime Minister they do their best to
find a way to escape them.
The Minister of Finance thought he had discovered the
answer when he said that the Conservative Party had not been
elected because of its promises and so he did not have to keep

October 16, 1979
October 16, 1979

them. But unfortunately for him, he was not yet aware of
everything his leader had said before May 22. And so it was,
for instance, that the former Leader of the Opposition
declared before the election, probably on the advice of his
conscience, Senator Murray, and I quote:
[English]
What is important is to demonstrate quickly that there is
a government that is going to keep its word.
[Translation]
The Minister of Finance was therefore compelled to
announce a well watered-down version of the promise made to
homeowners although according to conservative polls, it only
represented 2 per cent of total votes obtained by the new
government. Then, the ministers looked for a new procedure
which would enable them to break the promises made by their
leader without rejecting them. The Conservative Party, while
in opposition, had often denounced what it called the practice
of the former government of resorting to outside consultants
and creating what is commonly called task forces. It had
firmly undertaken to stop doing that. Once in power, it did not
matter very much if a single promise was broken especially if
in doing so it would make it possible at least temporarily to
forget the others.
[English]
Today, we are being task-forced to death. We have a task
force on Jerusalem, on Petro-Canada, on the disunification of
the armed services, on the movement of grain, on unemployment insurance, on medicare, on the future of the Foreign
Investiment Review Agency, and on trade relations in the
Pacific Rim. My list is undoubtedly incomplete and does not
include a new kind of task force set up by the Conservative
caucus on external aid, for instance, and numerous so-called
internal reviews. We even have now a privatization unit,
supported by an outside advisory body. Almost everything now
is under review. The government has gone to school.
The Prime Minister candidly stated on September 6: "I like
creative suspense." This has become the substance of his
leadership. We have a government in suspense or, more precisely, in suspended animation. This government says: Let us
privatize; let us provincialize; let us consult with the private
sector and the provinces; let us initiate internal reviews and set
up outside task forces. According to his recently given interview to Le Devoir, the Minister of State for Economic Development spent most of his summer in provincial capitals,
consulting on what ought to be the process of consultation that
could lead eventually, but not before 1981, to a strategy for
economic development. The Prime Minister is not content to
meet premiers in their own baronnies; he goes to meet them at
airports, as he did recently in Montreal. Yes, we have had
suspended animation for more than four months. Now, we
must ask: When will this government begin to govern in the
interest of all Canadians?

The present state of the economy is a source of serious
concern to all of us. I am particularly worried when I read the

October 16, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

economic thoughts of the Prime Minister. For instance, in an
interview published in May in Executive, he said, "We can't
afford to live with a current account deficit of that size and
growth forever." And he added, "Now, the question you're
going to ask me is what I would do, and I can't answer that
today, because I don't know." The interviewer insisted, "Let's
say we put (that question) back six or eight months." To that
Mr. Clark replied, "I can't answer it even then." So much for
the solution to the current account deficit.
On the subject of public finance the Prime Minister said,
. .. we are looking toward a balanced budget down the linethat's our goal-and we recognize that it cannot be accomplished simply by cutting government expenditures." The logical extension of that argument would have been to suggest an
increase in taxes, but Mr. Clark reached exactly the opposite
conclusion. He added, ". ..

we've also got to cut taxes at the

same time we're cutting expenditure." I fail to see how this
approach can eliminate the budgetary deficit. I was even more
puzzled by the Prime Minister's arithmetic when he later said,
"I guess I don't believe that a buck is a buck."
However, I understood for the first time why he wanted to
help the rich with his mortgage plan. He said, in the same
interview, "You know, it is not the rich who own homes. That's
a myth." I am really moved by this solicitude for the rich. It is
high time that they receive a tax break so that they too, like
the poor, can afford to own a home. However, we should not
take the Prime Minister too seriously, especially when he does
not have his economic "brain" with him.
It is also interesting to see how the Secretary of State for
External Affairs, a former red Tory, has so quickly become a
convert to this new philosophy of social justice, when she
recently announced in Toronto that from now on Canada's
external aid would be restricted to the richer countries because
they can afford to buy more.
I should like now to refer to our current economic situation
in a more serious vein. In a speech I made in this chamber on
October 3 1 last year I outlined the long-term structural problems that threatened not only Canada, but all western industrialized countries. Today I intend, rather, to concentrate on the
short term.
Last October I said:
I now believe that we have reached the high mark in
the short-term economic cycle and that a new recession
will start before the end of the first quarter of 1979.
What has happened since then? The rate of growth of real
GNP in the first quarter of 1979 appeared to be rather good,
but the main factor accounting for that result was an unusual
and substantial rise in non-farm business inventories, which is
always a sign of an imminent recession. Sure enough, GNP
declined in volume by 0.7 per cent during the second quarter.
The Minister of Finance, to justify his lack of action to
counteract this situation, claims that the Canadian economy is
merely the victim of the American recession. I contend that
the recession started in both countries at about the same time
and for the same usual reasons. It is obvious that the drop in

exports to the United States has become a source of weakness
of the Canadian economy. I would suggest, however, that
insofar as the decline in the level of GNP is concerned, such a
drop in exports was largely compensated, in the second quarter, by reduced imports, a clear indication of the internal
weakness of the Canadian economy. Moreover, I submit that
the Minister of Finance should read what Statistics Canada
has to say about the performance of our economy during that
quarter. Here are some excerpts:
Business non-farm inventory accumulation, business
investment in machinery and equipment, and personal
expenditure also moderated somewhat this quarter ...
Marginal growth in service-producing industries dependent on consumer or government demand also contributed
to the weakness of Real Domestic Product.
Statistics Canada also refers to "the recent softening of
consumer demand in Canada," to "the weakness of consumer
demand," and to a drop in housing starts. All I want to show
here is that we are not merely importing the recession from the
United States, but that we are also generating it at home, and
that the government has the very clear responsibility to cope
with it before unemployment reaches unacceptable levels next
winter.
e (2100)
The Minister of Finance, who was very talkative outside
Parliament during the summer, painted a rather gloomy picture of the state of the Canadian economy, that would last at
least until 1981, but he clearly indicated that, apart from the
mortgage plan, which he obviously did not want, he would do
nothing to improve current economic conditions. Gone was the
electoral nightmare of a "stimulative budget." Gone were the
income tax cuts of more than $2 billion, as well as many other
incentives and subsidies solemnly promised before the election.
I suggest that Senator Murray, the guardian of the list of
promises, should speak to the Minister of Finance before the
Conservatives completely lose their credibility.
The Minister of State for Economic Development was less
talkative, but in his speech in Vancouver on September 23 he
referred to the gloomy forecasts published by his former
employer, the Conference Board, and he added:
However, I would like to state emphatically here that this
government does not view these forecasts as inevitable or,
for that matter, acceptable. Indeed, perhaps our difficulty
as a nation has been that we have focused too much on
our problems, when we should be concentrating on Canada's potential.
The minister was obviously referring here to Conservative
speeches that were made before the election. He concluded:
We can and we must achieve that potential.
The minister, who had developed the concept of the stimulative deficit, did not dare to refer to it on that occasion because
he was probably afraid to be labelled as a socialist roader by
his colleague the Minister of Finance. However, his cal] to
achieve Canada's potential clearly indicates that he has not yet
abandoned his Keynesian heresy. He repeated the same

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
gloony forecast in a long interview published yesterday in the
Ottawa Citizen.
On September 27 the Prime Minister spoke at the Conference Board Business Outlook Conference. He had obviously
read what his "brain" had said in Vancouver. Mr. Clark
stated:
[The board's] prediction of an extended period of slow
growth or no growth can be a reality if we, as a government, and al] of us, as a people, are prepared to accept
that and prepare to let it happen. To that extent, the
Conference Board is telling it as it is.
While the Prime Minister, like his Minister of State for
Economic Development, found the board's gloomy forecast
realistic, he did not view it as acceptable, and spoke of the
necessity to achieve Canada's potential.
How did he intend to accomplish this goal? He put forward
a program in six parts. First, the Minister of State for Economic Development would call a conference later this year to
study Canada's economic objectives in the 1980s. This is not
going to be very helpful next winter. Secondly, the government
would reduce its expenditures. This is not very helpful either in
the midst of a recession. Thirdly, it would put much more
reliance on the private sector-but this is precisely where the
recession originated. Fourthly, it would correct specific obstacles to better economic performance. Fifthly, it would
introduce its mortgage plan-but this scheme, of course,
would only have, at best, a very marginal impact on new
residential construction. And, finally, the government would
provide "an infrastructure of stable, surprise-frec fiscal and
monetary policies".
I agree that in certain respects this government is providing
a surprise-free scenario. The Prime Minister and his Minister
of State for Economic Development gave large excerpts of the
Speech from the Throne two weeks before it was pronounced
in this chamber by His Excellency. The Minister of Finance
announced outside Parliament last summer the main tax measure that his budget speech will contain, whenever it is presentcd. As a result of the Prime Minister's statement last week, we
will not be surprised in February when a new Governor of the
Bank of Canada will take over. His name will be known in
November or December. I submit, however, that in the meantime we will have a lame duck governor, and that this situation
will increase the great uncertainty already existing on moncy
markets.
It is quite clear from the six points formulated by the Prime
Minister that this government has no fiscal policy to deal
efficiently with what it admits is going to be an extended
period of slow growth or no growth. Even its much advertised
mortgage plan will be most unfair, very expensive and completely inadequate to assist depressed residential construction.
We will have much more to say about this irresponsible plan
when it is introduced.
In view of the most important events of last week, 1 feel
obliged to refer also to monetary policy. It is not necessary to
be a great economist to know that the main sources of current
[Senator Lamontagn.]

October 16, 1979

October 16, 1979

inflation in Canada are the price of energy, the price of
imported products, and the lack of competition in food retailing, which alone, according to a recent estimate, has driven
basic food prices up as much as 4 per cent. It is not necessary,
either, to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand that even
the extremely dear money policy imposed by this government
cannot have a significant impact on those sources of inflation,
but that it can substantially slow down an already weak
economy.
If current unprecedented rates of interest are bad for growth
and cannot help curb rising prices, why is the government
promoting such a policy? Simply because the Bank of Canada
has to maintain a basic rate differential between Canada and
the United States in order to protect the value of the Canadian
dollar and to take care of the current account deficit that the
Prime Minister does not know how to reduce. In this context,
therefore, the Bank of Canada and the government have lost
control over Canadian monetary policy, and they have become
prisoners of United States policy. But the American monetary
authorities are in the same position. They too have to protect
the value of the American dollar. Against what? First, against
countries with hard currencies, such as West Germany, Switzerland and Japan, having a direct interest in a depreciated
American dollar that enables them to pay less for their
imports-more particularly, oil. As a result, we now have a
vicious interest rate war at the international level. Secondly,
they have to protect the American dollar against the estimated
trillion of stateless money flying in orbit around the world,
outside the control of central banks. This is a most dangerous
time-bomb that can explode at any time and plunge the world
into a serious international crisis.
*

(2110)

In the summer of 1978, William Miller, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, now the Secretary of the
Treasury in the United States, made the following astonishing
statement:
The Eurodollar market is a deep concern to us because
a very large amount of dollar-denominated money is out
there over which the central bank has very little control.
A lot of money is created in the international market
outside the control of any central bank, and this is one of
the greatest worries in this period of time.
In my speech in this chamber on October 31 last year I said:
I am convinced that the current monetary crisis is of
such a nature that no country in the world, not even the
United States, can go it alone.
1 suggested then that this most important question be taken
up as a matter of priority at the next economic summit of
industrialized countries. Unfortunately, the Tokyo meeting
was entirely devoted to a seminar on energy conservation.
So here we are, with the Americans having lost control over
their monetary policy and committed to extremely high interest rates-not to fight inflation at home, but to protect the
value of their dollar abroad. Unfortunately, we are in the same
situation, for similar reasons, and we will continue to be in this

before the great fire of 1916, one realizes or should realize that
one is in an institution which knew and heard somne of the truly
great personages of this Dominion.
Here, honourable senators, were expressed the penchant
opinions of Cartwright-he said aIl we owed to Britain was
Christian forgiveness-Aylesworth, N4eighen, Dandurand,
Crerar, Grattan O'Leary and many, rnany others. 1 was
tempted to add Sir George Foster, one of the great orators of
his lime and professor of the University of New Brunswick.
but he had a failing which prompted me to think I would flot
like to be a companion of his in this chamber, because he was
not only a teetotaller but a prohibitionist. In my view, that was
carrying good faith much too far, but he was an adornrnent of
this great chamber.
I may say, honourable senators, that in another political
incarnation, if as a Presbyterian 1 may use that expression, I
have had an opportunity over 22 years to meet and know the
vast majority of the members of this contemporary chaniber. I
have had a chance at first hand to know thcir ability. their
dedication and their coritinuing contribution to their country,
and I arn happy to join their ranks in this înost important
national institution.
When I was appointed to this place-or summoned, which is
the proper word-the CBC in Charlottetown asked, '-Will you
flot be ilI at case in a charnbcr wherc there are so mnany
Liberals?- I said 1 had grown accustomied to minority situations. No Progressive Conservative could feel otherwise if hc
lived very long. Then someone asked, noting rny venerable and
antique countenance, "-Iow do you accept the designation of

anything, that I was delighted with the designation.
I do not claimi any special qualities or qualifications for

argue very long with the Prime Minister when he callcd mie,
but I can say that for many years I spent long, long hours as a

Many have withered; many have passed away. Why has this

is a question which should challenge and interest flot only any

One of the popular clichés, honourable senators, of the
group from which 1 came, the political scientists, is that a
second chamber derives only from a society of class, an
aristocratie society. Thcy point out that the Greeks did flot
have a second chamber. and you cannot get back to the mother
of democracy through Grcck political science.
1 could argue, as some Anglicans argue, about saints on the
head of a pin, whether Rome cornes into this in its Republican
days as to two chambers. But the interesting thing is that in
Britain, which was an aristocracy, the Upper House has bccn
diminished, been curtailed, been reduced, and here in
equalitarian Canada, this chamber, this honourable chamber,
remnains. in form and in constitution, very much as it was when
those wise men met in Charlottetown in 1864 and constructed
a valuable governmental apparatus for our wonderful country.
If 1 may miake a personal interjection-onc should neyer do
this-I arn always upset by this stupid phrase -patriation of
our Constitution." If we have to use such a terrible expression,
then it is -repatriation." The British North America Act was
not an English document; it was a Canadian document. Ninety-five per cent of il was composed in Charlottetown. It is our
document. It represents the Canadian wisdom of Canadian
politicians, and 1 ask the H-onourable Mr. Jarvis to discard
that ridiculous word. If it has to be anything. it must be
"repatriation.This chamber has survivcd. I would not say that its survival
is a miracle, but it is at least a highly significant fact in
Canadian history. To bc frank, honourable senators here rnuch

n the presence of our Speaker, who is one of the great
Shakespearean scholars of the world.
Beyond the recognition and the admission that this second
chamber. structured as it was and is, was the sine qua non of
Confederation, there has scarcely been a good word said or
written about it other than by its own members. That is the
sad truth, honourable senators, and we ignore that truth ai our
peril. Everyone is familiar with these jocular denigrations'the rheunis and gouts of the Senate" is an old expression; the
doddering chamber. the chamber of sweet slumber. Whatevcr
in the name of heaven sweet slumber is, I don't know. They
caîl it "a uselcss appendage." I have flot seen the word
-appendix,- but perhaps it, too, was uttered. Much mirth has
been caused by those who corne up with these descriptions.
Nor has the great pastirne ended. I read the current press.
We are visited once in a while by the Fourth Estate now, and
talk about "the slumbering Senate" was again raised last
week-the slumbering Senate. I suppose that we have to be
candid and be realistic. We must know that, in a free society,
we must endure much of the semi-humorous from the

SENATE DEBATES

honourable senators-in the year 1893 there was held in
Ottawa-not Winnipeg, but Ottawa-the First National Convention of the Liberal Party. It was not a leadership convention. Their leader was there, the great Wilfrid Laurier. They
pronounced many policies and made many statements, and
supreme among them in 1893 was immediate reform of the
Senate. That was in 1893. Not much has happened since then,
and I am not terribly contrite or terribly upset, nor should any
historian be, that no great changes emanated therefrom. But in
the years since 1893, as decade followed decade and we came
up to my own time, which was a few years later than that, the
call for Senate reform was heard in the land-heard, perhaps,
but rarely heeded. It may be that this indicates that at any
given time the wise citizens of this great Dominion rightly
discerned that there were, in fact, at that given time, more
compelling and more important issues facing them than the
reform of this particular chamber, and I think Canadian
citizens then and now made an accurate and precise judgment.
I am here as what is called a Red Tory. I do not know what
it means. If it means I have compassion for those in our society
who most need help from the government-Senator Muir is
with me-then I am that; if it means I believe in the value of
historic tradition and the honourable process through time and
valuable institutions, I am that too. But a Red Tory in the Red
Chamber is perhaps what I am.
I have never believed that if one sees in one's society an
institution which functions with something less than 100 per
cent perfection or efficiency, the immediate answer is to
destroy that institution, to cast it aside, to discard it. It seems
to me, honourable senators, that it would be far better to look
upon that institution with care to sec if within the framework
there is not a better adjustment for the needs of the day and
the exigencies of the hour. You do not scrap that which is
useful; you try to make some adaptation.
I remember a very wise man, now the Premier of Prince
Edward Island, who once said it is very, very good to be
progressive, but he supposed that if one lived in Lapland the
most progressive person would be the first lemming to go over
the cliff. I think we have to watch that. I think the Canadian
people, perhaps not in organized judgment but in very valuable
judgment, have not been overly excited about such things as
Senate reform.
I may be many things. If I am here with you, if God gives
me health for the next 15 years, I may become a consistent
advocate of certain things, but I am a greater believer in
Edmund Burke. You do not discard the institution. You
subject it to these great qualities and you end up with his
judgment when he said that all government, all virtue, every
positive act, is founded on compromise and virtue. In our day,
honourable senators, we have a disregard for the word "compromise." We attach it, I am afraid, sometimes to a wornan of
easy virtue, and I am much too old to be interested in that, but
I read these things-"she compromises herself." But the art of
government, surely, is compromise, common sense and
adjustment.

80072-6

There are many shortcomings in the workings of this institution. I have read both Hansardsfor many, many years. I spoke
a few minutes ago about being in a minority, and I am sure I
am in a very small minority. Few people read the Hansard of
the House of Commons, and fewer still the Hansard of this
chamber. I have read it and I have noted the constant expressions of anxiety. There has been, since Confederation, a defensive pleading, a feeling of uncertainty.
* (2140)

I think Senator Muir will agree with me that some people
say that we, the maritimers, have a sense of unrewarded virtue.
And I believe that. But if you read the Senate Hansard
for many, many years, you sense a feeling of not being
appreciated. Thoughtful senators from time immemorial have
said that this chamber is misunderstood; they have felt
ignored, their speeches unread and unheeded. And I believe
they were right. And in the realm of oratory, "Full many a
flower was born to blush unseen" in this place, and that is no
benefit to the country. But it is truc. Senators have complained
that governments, regardless of political stripe and regardless
of who was in the governing party, have been inconsiderate, if
not contemptuous of the legislative role of the upper house.
But I think, because of an inclination in the other place, I have
some understanding how and why these things happen. I am
convinced that the generations of senators were right, and I
believe that Senator Mcllraith and Senator Argue and others
will realize that that is the case. Some legislative items have
been left far too late for this chamber, and this chamber has
been asked to put the rubber stamp on legislation coming from
the other chamber. The Senate has been underutilized, misunderstood and sometimes abused, and the Dominion of Canada
would have been better served by a great utilization of this
chamber.
I have, honourable senators, because of my academic discipline, studied many legislative and deliberative bodies, and I
think that this chamber bas many virtues. And I hope that it
will not lose them. I cherish the appreciation that this body has
for consensus. I think that that is the essence of the democratic
process.
I belonged to another chamber some time ago-and I shal
not say which one it was-but I recall being told, "You go in
there and you vote against the presiding officer." How, in the
name of God, can there be a party line in a procedural matter?
Consensus is far more important. And I have checked the
Hansardof this place and I found that you have few votes, and
I think that is wise. There are so many issues that cannot be
resolved simply by a yes or no, and I think I get some sense of
what Senator Bosa was talking about recently that in our
British parliamentary tradition we should provide some capacity for those who, having listened to all points of view, in an
intellectual sense feel they should abstain.
There is another thing that pleases me, and it is that in this
chamber there is not an overburdening of procedure. I have
seen many deliberative bodies, be they town councils or school
boards or what have you, who spend far more of their time
wrangling over procedure than in accomplishing things. In this

74

SENATE DEBATES

complex and difficult life, honourable senators, it is hard
enough to accomplish anything, to legislate anything, let alone
to be overpowered and overwhelmed by citations on procedural
matters, and I hope and 1 pray that as long as I am here-and
if my Presbyterian God gives me the time I shall be here for 15
years-we will never be overburdened with great citations, or
that we should deal with citations A, B, C, D and E and
neglect the affairs of the nation. I sec that Senator Argue
agrees with me and I think he knows the experience I have
had.
I admire that aspect of the Senate and I have said many
times in other places and in public meetings that the Senate of
Canada has produced the most efficient and valuable committees of inquiry and investigation of any deliberative body that 1
know. I want to say in the presence of our distinguished
Speaker that a few years ago 1 went to the Commonwealth
Caribbean on a visit, and I visited many ministers. I cannot
remember a single one of them who in his bookcase did not
have a copy of the report on Canada-Caribbean Commonwealth Relations, produced by the Standing Senate Committee
on Foreign Affairs. And I am sure I was not all that important
that they put it there just to impress me.
I sec Senator Croll, a very distinguished man, and I commend all the research and the encouragement of Canadian
participation that he has donc. It brings great credit to hin
and to this chamber. And for those demi-literate, insensitive
people, who pour scorn upon what they call this "slumbering
place," 1 say they should pay a little attention to the magnificent items of research that it has prepared. 1 can mention
Senator Argue in the field of agriculture, which, although 1
come from one of the richest agricultural areas in the Dominion, 1 do not pretend to be an expert, but 1 appreciate what he
has donc.
Now this chamber, as many times before, is in a tenuous
situation. One cannot be sure what is going to happen. I said
earlier that the Canadian public was never too upset about

Senate reform, but I think we must be candid and accept that
if it came into the minds of certain people that this body
should be abolished, 1 do not think there would be great
parades in the cities and towns of Canada advocating the
saving of the Senate. I don't think we would be that popular.
So we live in a tenuous era, in a precarious era, and I think it
is our valuable function which will guarantee our continuity,
and I believe that our continuity is of value to our country.
I was reading, these last few days, because as a freshman
senator I wanted to be prepared in the presence of so nany of
greater experience than myself. I read what we call the father
of political science, Professor Robert MacGregor Dawson, a
great scholar, and a great Liberal, and I am not so bigoted as
to suggest that the two terms are mutually exclusive. He is the
father of Canadian political science. He wrote learnedly about
the Senate of Canada and after analyzing all its problems, its
weaknesses, its bruises and the assaults upon it he wrote, "But by
far the most crippling blow since Confederation is the
modern practice of keeping the number of senators in the
cabinet low.- Time was when Prime Ministers rose in this

place; time was when powerful ministers were in this chamber,
and in Britain still some of the most eminent members of the
cabinet are in the House of Lords. That is why 1 say, honourable senators, that I am happy to be here. I suppose I would be
happy to be here at any time, but I am especially happy to be
here when we have not one, not two, but three ministers. The
honourable leader for so long has presided over a small and
diminishing minority with grace, wisdom and understanding.
e

(2150)

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Macquarrie: And now he may have what is even a
more difficult situation, being in the majority party in the
minority chamber. But I trust his wisdom, his graciousness and
his judgment.
Senator Asselin, whom 1 knew at the United Nations many,
many years ago, was regarded by delegations from all around
the world as an enlightened, sensitive internationalist. I am so
honoured that he is a great minister in the government.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Macquarrie: And Senator de Cotret, learned in
economics, is a massive intellect in that very, very complex
field of economics. Long ago, honourable senators, I studied
economics, the dismal science, and, God forgive me, I once
taught it. I never really knew what it was all about.
But as 1 listen toSenator Perrault: The dismal science.
Senator Macquarrie: Dismal science is right, honourable
senators. But as 1 listen to Senator de Cotret 1 learn every day
from him and I am convinced, day after day, as I sit here in
the back bench, that here is a minister who is forthcoming,
who does not forward arrogance when he does not have the
answer but deals honourably with this house and says, "Wc
will find the answers".
If there are people in the press gallery who think that in this
chamber there will be a kind of gladiatorial situation and that
Senator de Cotret will be carried out on his shield in the
Spartan sense, they are totally wrong. He is too wise and too
sensitive, and the Senate is too wise and too sensitive.
1 have listened with great care to the members opposite,
most of whom 1 have known and honoured; they have asked
questions, sharp, incisive, piercing, as they should.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Macquarrie: They are discharging their duty.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Macquarrie: If I am keeping you up too late
tonight, it is because they are good at their duty. They are

asking questions as they should and they are making this
chamber an important part of our legislative process.
Senator Perrault: Would you like to sit over on this side?
Senator Macquarrie: Some day I may be there, but not for a
while. But I admire the processes and procedures that they are
following.
I believe, honourable senators, that the press are wrong in
suggesting that this will be a place of great confrontation. The
press-God bless them! They have their virtues and their
failings, but they really are not much interested in the parliamentary process beyond the Question Period. Confrontation is
ail they are interested in. They leave after the Question Period
is over, but there is much that happens after that.
I think there will be an enrichment and an enhancement of
this Upper Chamber because of the fact that we have three
very able, very important ministers and we have a very seasoned, wise opposition. This will bring things into balance and
will enhance the value of this house, which always should have
been more valuable than it has been considered by those who
do not know what it is about.
There are very serious situations in a Constitution like ours.
We do not have, as the Americans have, the checks and
balances situation. We have a situation in which there is a
majority or a commanding group in the lower house, and while
we say we are co-equal, and in many ways we are, in the
essence of ministerial responsibility we are not. It is the group
that must contain and retain the confidence of the lower house
that counts.
There is a possibility for deadlock. That would be foolish.
But, more important, there is the situation of what I call a
valid and valuable tension between the two houses. That is
good for this house. It is good for any goveriment.
Down through the years this chamber has, on occasion,
decided to thwart the view of the party which has had the
confidence of the elected house. It has happened several times.
It has that right. Constitutionally, this chamber is one of the
most powerful upper chambers in the whole world. But I think
that any objective historian would say that, when this house
has thwarted the government, thwarted the party which is in
control of the lower house, it has generally been wrong. There
have been some occasions when that has not been the case.
Robert Borden said in 1912, with some sense of relief, that the
Senate did right in rejecting a bill which he had been forced to
put forward as a matter of party politics.
But, generally speaking, and I think many learned senators
here know exactly what I mean, generally speaking, the Senate
has not been wise in making a sustained opposition to that
party, that group which has the control in the lower house.
The Senate of Canada, unique among second chambers, has
retained on paper, legally and constitutionally, its powers
untrammelled. It is much more powerful than the House of
Lords. It is much more powerful than the Seanad of Ireland. It
is much more powerful than many, many chambers I could

mention. I believe it has retained these powers, honourable
senators, because it has not pushed to the extreme the legal
and constitutional powers which it has..
I hope he will not be embarrassed if I praise him, but the
other day I heard the Leader of the Opposition, Senator
Perrault, saying, "We will be strong and reasonable but not
unfair." I think he senses that situation.
i cherish the values and virtues and roles and opportunities
of this honourable Senate, and I think, as Senator Perrault and
the people around have realized, sometimes in nations, in
institutions and as individuals you show your strength most
when you indicate the restraint of your strength. I look forward, honourable senators, to a very interesting time in this
honourable chamber, when there will be careful survey, careful
praise, and careful questioning of government policies. I am
happy about the start that has been made.
The Throne Speech which we heard the other day is not the
greatest. It is better and shorter than those I have heard for
many years, but it is not ail golden. There are questions, and
honourable members opposite have raised questions and have
given criticism, and often it is said in this modern age that
these documents are ail innocuous, but in that document,
honourable senators, there is one aspect that thrilled me. At
the age of 60 I should not be ail that excited, but I was
particularly thrilled to note that a government had taken the
initiative jn making Parliament more meaningful and indicating that there would be more freedom of information.

•

(2200)

We are used to a situation whereby the government in power
is pressed severely by duly elected parliamentarians to be more
forthcoming and to give more power to parliamentary committees. Here we have a government, new in office, which has said
that it will take the initiative to make Parliament more
meaningful, to make committees more valuable; and in that
process, although it is not spelled out carefully or precisely, I
am sure that a role for the second chamber is included.
Honourable senators have been kind enough to listen to me.
I rarely make a speech in which I do not refer to foreign
affairs. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the situation
in the Middle East. I respect his views and share his concern.
In reference to the proposed transfer of the Canadian embassy
from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem, I should like to make two observations. The first is not meant unkindly. For over a decade I
have spoken in legislative chambers and public meetings about
the importance of our relationship with the 150 million Arabs
for whom we should have nothing but friendship. Very few
people then joined me in that concern, and I note that some
are now much more vocal.
My second observation is that while foreign policy is sometimes a legitimate concern for partisan confrontation-and,
indeed, Gladstone brought it into the Midlothian campaign
many years ago-1 believe that generally it is better not to
make it a domestic area of confrontation. I wish, with reference to the SALT treaty, that there were not an upcoming
American election. I say that sincerely, as I feel deeply about

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
the matter. I thank God that in this country we have a man of
the wisdom, judgment, and the goodness-if I might use an
old-fashioned word-of Robert Stanfield. I trust his judgment
and await his verdict.
Finally-I am now at the fifth point in my sermon, honourable senators; I am sorry for having trespassed on your timeI am happy to be back on Parliament Hill in this illustrious
chamber. I understand that 1 shall soon be shuffled off to the
Victoria Building, and that the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Building is now called the South Block.
Surely, honourable senators, we who have been so disrespectful, so neglectful, of our historic past, can find something
more imaginative than the points of the compass to designate
meaningful buildings around here? I should be going into the
Sir John A. Macdonald Building, someone should be going
into the Sir Robert Borden Building, and someone should be
going into the Mackenzie King Building-and God forgive my
Tory soul for mentioning that man, but he was a great
politician.
When are we going to listen to that wonderful man, Joseph
Howe, from Nova Scotia, who said long ago that:
A wise nation preserves its records, gathers up its
muniments, decorates the tombs of its illustrious dead,
repairs its great public structures, and fosters national
pride and love of country, by perpetual reference to the
sacrifices and glories of the past.
So I ask honourable senators to please help us get beyond the
points of the compass with regard to our historic buildings.
Important as they are, compass points are not historic and they
are not good enough for Canada in this context.
On motion of Senator Bird, debate adjourned.

(a) the existing retirement age policies affecting workers in both the public and private sectors;
(b) the social and economic implications of mandatory
retirement based on age alone;
(c) the feasibility of enabling workers, especially elderly
citi7ens, to continue to make a worthwhile contribution
to our society through flexible voluntary retirement
plans to the extent of their ability and motivation;
(d) the protection for those over sixty-five against age
discrimination in all employment areas; and
(e) the need for the maximum co-operation of all levels
of government, labour unions, business and the public
[Senator Macquarrie.]

in respect of existing and future retirement age policies
and retirement plans;
That the Committee have power to engage the services
of such technical, clerical and other personnel as may be
necessary for the purpose of the inquiry;
That the papers and evidence received and taken on the
subject in the Third and Fourth Sessions of the Thirtieth
Parliament be referred to the Committee;
That the papers and submissions received on the subject
and the work accomplished during the dissolution of
Parliament. as authorized by the Intersessional Authority
(appointed pursuant to a resolution of the Senate on the
29th day of March, 1972) be referred to the Committee;
and
That the Committee have power to send for persons,
papers and records, to examine witnesses, to report from
time to time, to print such papers and evidence from day
to day as may be ordered by the Committee, to sit during
adjournments of the Senate and to adjourn from place to
place in Canada.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Senator Croll: Honourable senators, before the motion is
adopted, may I point out that the motion contains two additional paragraphs to a motion that was adopted during the
preceding Parliament. They are:
That the papers and evidence received and taken on the
subject in the Third and Fourth Sessions of the Thirtieth
Parliament be referred to the Committee;
That is a normal request. And:
That the papers and submissions received on the subject
and the work accomplished during the dissolution of
Parliament, as authorized by the Intersessional Authority
(appointed pursuant to a resolution of the Senate of the
29th day of March, 1972) be referred to the Committee;
That paragraph is included to give the committee an opportunity to deal with matters that are before it. While I am on
my feet, perhaps I may be allowed to provide a little information with regard to the committec. The committee is now on
the home stretch. Its report is at the editing stage and the
editor for the English edition is now studying the report to
avoid excessive repetition, to ensure continuity, correct emphasis, clarification and orderliness.
It will then go to the translators, and from there to the
French editor, who will follow a similar procedure to that of
the English editor.
Printing of the report will follow. These household tasks
cannot be avoided. The procedure will take a few months to
complete, and there is nothing we can do to shorten it. All that
the members of the committee can do is to keep their fingers
crossed and hope that everything will go along smoothly,
because we depend on many people. Everything seems to be in
order. For those honourable senators who are anticipating the
report, all I can say is that it will have the usual senatorial
class.

CONSUMER AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS
PRESS CONFERENCE HELD BY MEMBER FOR BURNABYQUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I rise on a question of
privilege. I wish to make a statement in reply to a press
conference held this morning by the honourable member for
Burnaby, Mr. Robinson. He has recently made allegations
concerning my colleague, the Minister of Transport. First I
wish to emphasize that Mr. Mazankowski attended the meeting in question at my personal invitation. The discussion at this
meeting concerned possible charges. It would be highly
improper for me at this time to discuss them since no charges
have yet been laid. It should be clear that my colleague, Mr.
Lawrence, in his capacity as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, and Mr. Mazankowski, the Minister of Transport, attended that meeting again at my request. The subject
matter of the discussion was the transport field, and for that
reason I asked Mr. Mazankowski to be present.
I believe that I have, as Attorney General of Canada, every
right, and, in some instances, a heavy duty to consult prior to
coming to my decision as to whether charges are warranted.
There is no doubt that there are many precedents for this
procedure. I believe it was entirely proper for me to have
convened the meeting which I did last Friday. I want to make
it clear that there was no impropriety on the part of anyone
present, and I also wish to make it very clear that this decision
to prosecute, which I will be making in due course, is mine and
mine alone.

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, last week I was

certain documents. I should first like to respond to Senator
Lamontagne's request of October l1 by tabling a copy of a
brief sent by the Government of Argentina to the Government
of Canada on the subject of the purchase of a Candu reactor.
However, honourable senators, I should like you to note that
this is an unofficial translation of the Argentinian text and I
should like it to be treated as such.

Prime Minister, published in the St. John, New Brunswick,
Telegraph-Journalof October 2, 1979, I should like to table
that transcript for the benefit of honourable senators.
I should also like to clear up any misunderstanding we had
in discussion last week by pointing specifically to page 3 of the
Telegraph-Journal transcript. Honourable senators will
remember that the question dealt with the impact of higher
energy prices on the competitive position of Canadian
industry.
In the interview the Prime Minister said:
-one of the constants that has to guide national policy is
to maintain a competitive advantage for Canadian industry, as against United States industry.
I think that will clear up the record.

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, regarding Senator

my colleague the President of the Treasury Board. I should
like to reiterate the position I took then, which was while we
are not looking for provincial bids in the privatization exercise,
certainly if a provincial bid were to be submitted it would be
given due consideration.

HEALTH AND WELFARE
PROPOSED INCREASE IN MEDICARE CHARGES

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have a reply to the
questions asked last evening by Senator Haidasz. I should like
to refer him to the response made by the Minister of National
Health and Welfare to similar questions in the other place.
By way of elaboration, however, I would point out that the
government has asked Mr. Justice Emmett Hall to undertake
a full review of the implementation of Medicare. I stress that
the principles of the Medicare program are not in jeopardy.
The study will attempt to determine if methods of implementation are compatible with those principles.
The government is obviously committed to the provision of
medical services, which do more than relieve the hardship of
sick people, as referred to in the honourable senator's question.
As a former member of the cabinet, the honourable senator is
aware that while federal moneys are transferred to the provinces for health and other services through the Established
Programs Financing Act, the ultimate provision of those services is the responsibility of the provinces. As indicated, Mr.
Justice Hall will be reviewing that matter and others, and his
report is expected in the spring of 1980, at which time, with
full information in hand, the minister will take any appropriate
action.

MOVEMENT OF OIL FROM ALASKA TO LOWER FORTY-EIGHT

FUTURE OF CANADA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Leader of the Government in the hope that
he will be a little more forthcoming this afternoon than he was
last evening. This question concerns the sudden changes of the
Canadian position respecting an oil pipeline along the Northern Tier or through Canada.
Was the government consulted or advised by Foothills that
they were going to withdraw their application for an all-land
route from a point in Alaska into the existing system in
Canada in favour of the Trans Mountain application, which
requires tankers to come into the Juan de Fuca Strait.

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, in response to
Senator Argue's question concerning the Ottawa Journal
article of October 11 on a Conservative committee report
about the Canada Development Corporation, I should like to
state that the report referred to in the Ottawa Journal was
done by a Conservative caucus committee, the Economy in
Government Committee. This is an internal Conservative
caucus committee that meets on an ad hoc basis and liaises
confidentially with my colleague Sinclair Stevens, President of
the Treasury Board and Chairman of the Cabinet Committee
on Economy in Government.

Senator Flynn: As I stated yesterday, I was not informed of
the decision of Foothills before it became known to the public
generally. Foothills never indicated that they were in favour of
the Trans Mountain line.
Senator Oison: Do 1 take it, then, that the government had
no prior knowledge that Foothills was going to withdraw its
application? I say that because Foothills says that there is
some strategic advantage in what they have done. Some people
are concerned about bringing tankers into those straits, and if
that is good for Canada, we should like to know the government's rationale for reaching that decision.

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, in response to
Senator Buckwold's question about CMHC, I have consulted
with my colleagues Mr. Crosbie and Mr. MacKay and I have
discussed the subject of CMHC offering subsidized rates.
I should like to report that at the moment no such action is
contemplated.
CROWN CORPORATIONS

SENATE DEBATES
Senator de Cotret: I should like to re-emphasize the answer
given by my colleague, the Minister of Justice. The government was not aware, in any way, of Foothills pulling oui at this
stage, given the decision of the Americans. As a government,
as you well know, we strongly encouraged and urged the
United States government to adopt the Foothills proposai, both
officially and in a memorandum of intent sent to the President
of the United States recently, and also through unofficial
discussions held throughout the summer by the Secretary of
State for External Affairs, the Minister of the Environment,
and the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. We were
not aware that Foothills would pull out in the manner they did.
Senator Oison: A further supplementary. In view of the
rminister's statement that the government is in favour of the
all-land route so as to avoid environmental problems, are
overtures now being made to obtain from Foothills their
reasons for withdrawing their proposai?
In view of the fact that this is an action which seems to be ai
cross purposes with what the minister says is government
policy, i would ask that we be advised as to what Foothills
response is?
Senator de Cotret: i shall certainly undertake to sec that
this house is informed, to the extent possible, of the reasons
underlying the Foothills decision to withdraw. As honourable
senators are well aware, this government was asked, as was the
previous government, to indicate the preference of the Canadian government in terms of the movement of oil from Alaska to
the United States. There is no question, both for environmental reasons and in terms of the significant economic benefits to
Canada, that the Foothills proposai is, by far, the most attractive to this country.
Senator Oison: Hear, hear.
Senator de Cotret: For that reason we had no hesitation in
pursuing the course that had been pursued by the previous
government in recommending strongly to the United States
government that we preferred the Foothills proposai.
AIDE-MÉMOIRE FROM CANADA TO THE UNITED STATES

Senator Oison: A final supplementary. Would it be possible
to have tabled a copy of the aide-mémoire that went from the
Canadian government to the United States government stating
this preference?
There has been some information about, that an aidemémoire went forward in late September stating the Canadian
government's position in favour of the all-land proposai.
Senator de Cotret: i will look into that matter and, if ai all
possible, i shall table that document.
TANKER TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL ON WEST COAST

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, yesterday i asked a
question with respect to a statement attributed to the Honourable John Fraser, Minister of the Environment, in which he is
quoted as having said, on the west coast, that there may be
some merits involved in oil tanker shipments travelling the
[Senator Oison.]

west coast of Canada. The Leader of the Government undertook to provide information with respect to that alleged statement. Has he yet received any explanation from his colleague
regarding that rather startling comment. If he does not have
any information, will his colleague, the minister responsible for
economic development, respond?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, i did not receive a
reply from the Minister of the Environment. He may have said
that the second proposai was preferable to an all-water route. I
doubt that he would have said that it was preferable to the
Foothills proposai.
[Translation]
CROWN CORPORATIONS
DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, my question is for
the Minister of State for Economic Development. The statement he made earlier has me very worried and confused. On
the one hand, he says the provinces will be able to bid on the
purchase, for example, of profitable government operations
like PetroCan or any other crown corporation. I imagine it will
be the same principle in ail cases. The idea behind it was to
privatize that profitable part of PetroCan. So, a province with
a savings account called, for example, "Heritage Fund", or
any other name, could in that auctioning of crown corporations
put its hand on a large number of them and increase the
disparities between the regions and the provinces, thus creating
a very serious problem for the country as a whole.
Senator de Cotret: i would like to point out to the honourable senator that the question i answered had been put in the
context of the eight crown corporations that have been identified by the President of the Treasury Board as those that
would be returned to the private sector. In that press release
there was no mention ai all of the case of Petro-Canada which
was still being considered by a task force set up by the
government. So i think my answer applies only in the context
of the question that was put, namely the eight crown corporations that have been identified by the President of the Treasury Board. So the question aI that time was: Are we going to
turn down outright or as a matter of principle any expression
of interest by one or several provinces in Canada in having an
equity position in one of those crown corporations? My answer
very clearly is that we would prefer to have them returned to
the private sector but there is no objection in principle to
considering a proposition coming from one of the provinces.
Senator Marchand: Would there be any objection to Alberta acquiring PetroCanada, for example?
Senator Flynn: No, that is not what he said.
Senator de Cotret: Once again, i answered the question in
the context of the eight crown corporations that were identified by the President of the Treasury Board, and Petro-Canada
was not one of them. The fate of Petro-Canada was considered
by a study group which made its report last week, a report that
was tabled in the House of Commons and will soon be brought

October 17, 1979
October 17, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

to the attention of the cabinet. A decision will be announced as
soon as possible about Petro-Canada.
In the context of the eight crown corporations identified by
the President of the Treasury Board, I said we would clearly
prefer that those crown corporations be returned to the private
sector but if a province expressed the wish to participate in the
equity of those corporations, the interest of the province will be
considered.
Senator Marchand: I will not talk about Petro-Canada
because, according to the minister, Petro-Canada was not on
the list to which he refers. However, that means that a
province outside Quebec, for example, could control Canadair
in Montreal or de Havilland in Toronto?
Senator de Cotret: To answer that question, once again, all I
can add is that, as a matter of principle, we are not automatically excluding an expression of interest from a province.
Whether we will then approve or accept it is another matter.
But, as a matter of principle or policy in this matter, we are
not automatically saying a province cannot express an interest.

Senator Flynn: Well, I don't know what you mean by
consultation with the person who would be the object of
charges. I could ask that person to explain some parts of the
evidence that has been gathered. I think that is only normal.
But I have not done that in this case. I do not see why, if there
are some grey areas in the evidence, I should not ask for an
explanation ahead of time. When you speak of political considerations, it all depends on what you mean. Certainly no
partisan political consideration will enter into my decision.
Senator Frith: Well, then, before I proceed with yet another
supplementary, is there such a grey area in this case?
Senator Flynn: I have not reached a conclusion. I will tell
you when I reach it. If I decide to lay charges, it will be
because the area is not that grey.
Senator Frith: Did the Director of Investigation and
Research make any recommendation to the minister, indicating any grey areas and recommending prosecution?

Senator Flynn: I could, of course, discuss with you or tell
you all of my conversations with Mr. Bertrand, but I don't
think it would be proper for me at this time, when no charges

Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Frith: Do I understand that the Minister of Justice's conception of his duty under this particular legislation is
not simply to consider the question of whether there is evidence presented to him by the commission or by the director
and whether that would lead to an indication of a criminal
offence, but that there are other considerations he would
study-if not partisan political, then matters of policy, matters
not related to his duty as the Minister of Justice-that he
would consider the evidence and the law and recommend
prosecution if there was sufficient evidence to indicate that
there might be an offence?
Is there anything else that he has taken into account, that he
intends to take into account, not generally but in this particular case?
Senator Flynn: I would say not at this time, but when I
spoke of political considerations that were not of a partisan
nature, I was thinking, for instance, of how sometimes it is not
in the public interest to lay charges. That does not apply to the
present case, but since the question was so general I must be
careful. In some cases, for example, where there has only been
a technical offence, I have seen, repeatedly, cases in which the
Attorney General has decided that it would not be in the
public interest to lay charges. That applies to a decision of the
Attorney General of Ontario concerning someone in the other
place.
Senator Frith: If the honourable minister is going to consult
only when he thinks there is a technical offence, I take it that
he thinks this is just a "technical" case or he would not be
making these consultations with others. Is that right?
Senator Flynn: Anyway, i don't need the advice of my
friend to tell me how I should behave as the Attorney General
of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: You can keep your counsel to yourself. I
don't care.

it in the form of questions, which so far he has succeeded in

Senator Perrault: It is not a point of order.
Senator Walker: If the former Leader of the Government
will be good enough to be patient, my point of order is that it is
impossible to discuss such current cases in the Senate, because
otherwise we would be talking constantly about legal cases.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, it is apparent that my
learned friend, the Minister of Justice, does not need my legal
advice, but apparently my learned friend, Senator Walker, has
accepted a dock brief on his behalf. However, I believe that
the honourable the minister is sufficiently distinguished as a
lawyer to defend himself-although I shall be glad to take on
both honourable gentlemen if that is the way they wish it to
be.
My final supplementary to the Minister of Justice is as
follows: Do I understand that in this case, for reasons that the
minister thinks are sound, and on precedent-and I would like
to hear what the precedent is that the minister feels is soundhe will be taking into consideration representations by ministers and other persons unrelated to the question of evidence in
law?
Senator Flynn: Unrelated? I do not think I would agree with
that. I cannot use any advice that is unrelated, as I cannot use
the advice which the honourable senator has given me because,
generally speaking, I consider it to be unrelated.
I have said that I shall reach my decision on the proper
grounds-I repeat, on the proper grounds-and I do not need
the advice of the honourable senator to do so.

of the one who first spoke of his secure possession of the truth.
But there is also the great self-conceit of my friend which
looks very much like the secure possession of the truth.

3. Do they have ta pay ail or part of their passage or

4. Do they have to be sponsored by individuais or

8. Are the "boat people" covered by the Citizenship

THE ECONOMY
GOVERN MENT SPEN DING POLICY

Senator Everett: Honourabie senatars, I have a question for
the Ninister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and Minister
of State for Economie Devciopment. In his previousiy men[Senator Marchand.]

October 17, 1979

October i 7, 1979

tioned speech ta the Chamber of Commerce in Montreai, he
said that the cabinet had estabiishcd a firm limit on the size of
the federai budget, and that funds for new programs mnust
came fram the savings from existing anes. Given that for two
years the previaus governmcnt had firm iimits an spending
that werc ta be nat more than the increase in the growth of the
nommnai GNP-and, indeed, those targets were met-and
given the fact that the Treasury Board has for some time had
two budgets, anc budget being continuing programs and anc
being new programs and major departures fromi cantinuing
pragrams, I faii ta sec and I shauid iikc the minister ta
expiain ta this chamber-haw the present policy varies from
the poiicy of the previaus gavernmcnt.
Senator de Cotret: Honourabie senatars, I shaii try ta give
you a brief answer ta that question, but I could certainly
cxpound upan it at great iength. This has ta do with the whole
approach to dccisinn-making that the new government has
taken in respect ta the cabinet committce system; that is,
cabinet committees that are bath decisianai and responsible
fi nanciaily.
In arder ta abbreviate my answcr, let me speak in terms of
the Econamie Dcvciopment Committce, for example. The
committee is given an envelope which represents the total
arnount of funds the cammittc can spend in the caming fiscal
ycar. That amaunt is fixed by inner cabinet. It is an amaunt
that has buiit within it certain nccessary reserves shouid any
cast aver-runs accur, and the total amount of that envciope
must bc rcspcîcd. Therefore, within the envciopc, anc can
bring abaut shifts from programs in anc area ta programs in
another arca. if it is sa dcsircd, ta influence the course of
ecanomic deveiopmcnt in this country-in the case of the
Economic Deveiopmcnt Comrnittee. But it cannot increase its
expenditures, or for that matter its tax expenditures, bcyond
the total limit set by inner cabinet for that particular envelope.
Since poiicy decisions are coupied with expenditure dccisians, you have, in rny view, a much better handie on where
you arc going in the arca of gavernmcnt spcnding; far that
matter, how you arc spcnding taxpayers' dollars.
Senator Everett: This is a most intcrcsting explanation, but
it stiii Icaves us with the probicm that there is no change in the
rIcthod af aperatian. lIn the iast twu years, under the previaus
administration, there was a spcnding iimit, and if a particuiar
departmcnt wanted more funds for a ncw pragram or for a
major departure from an existing program, they had ta get it
from existing pragrams. I sec no difference there, and I arn
mnereiy asking the minister if he can point out a difference in
the spcnding restraint aspect of the prescrnt poiicy.
Senator de Cotret: I think the spending aspect of the prescrnt
poiicy regraups the departments that have a basic mission in
the economic field and those that have a basic mission in the
social field, and aiiows for transfers ta be made within these
cammittees as betwccn certain cxisting priarities or cxisting
programs and ncw priorities or ncw pragrams. This gives the
dccisian-making proccss in cabinet a much different dimension
than that which existed previously in that it tics the expendi-

SENATE DEBATES

turc decision with the policy decision in a much more direct
manner.
Senator Everett: It seems to me that what you have are
groups making the expenditure decisions instead of the departments under the control of the Treasury Board. Nevertheless,
the restraint has not changed. Would the minister not agree
that it is the same restraint process whether the group does it
or whether the individual department under the overall
restraint of the Treasury Board does it?
Senator de Cotret: In terms of the overall restraint, to the
extent that the previous government could make a staunch
commitment-and I underline the words "to the extent that
the previous government"-to have expenditures grow by no
more than X, and that we are making the commitment that
expenditures will grow no more than Y, then, from a commitment point of view, there is no change. However, I firmly
believe that given this new system whereby you tic expenditure
decisions to policy decisions much more directly, and whereby
you join and link the departments that have responsibility in a
certain field such as social policy or economic policy, you
improve, by a very wide margin, your possibility of effectively
living within the limits that you set for yourself.
Senator Everett: We will get into the question of the
committee system and how it operates at some future date, but
I do thank the minister for his statement that the restraint
program that is being operated, as outlined by him, is the same
as the one outlined by the previous government in the last two
years.
Senator de Cotret: I should like to make the point clear. If
one government says, "We are going to restrict expenditures to
a rate of growth of X per cent," and another government says,
"We are going to restrict growth of expenditures to a rate of Y
per cent," those two statements are equivalent. They are
obviously the same type of statement. The question is: How
can you posture a government to meet that commitment?
What I am saying is that the system we now have in place, in
my best evaluation, is one that makes it casier and more
possible for the government to live up to its commitments than
the system that was in place under the previous administration. The expenditures increased at a tremendously rapid rate
over the last ten years and led to the kind of deficit position we
have in the country today.
a

(1450)

Senator Everett: Indeed, the methodology may be different,
but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Over the last two
years the government did meet its targets. We will have to see
whether your new system in fact does that.
CROWN CORPORATIONS
DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a further
question to the Minister of State for Economic Development.
In a press conference after the speech to the Montreal Chamber of Commerce he is quoted as saying: "We're now working

out the modalities of arranging the sales" of returns of the
corporations to the private sector. He is reported as going on to
say, in part:
A company like Canadair Limited of Montreal that ...
has been run like a private company is not easy to sell.
I am a little mystified, honourable senators, as to what would
be easy to sell if it is not a company that has been run like a
private company.
Senator de Cotret: With all due respect to the honourable
senator, and with all due respect to the media, I think there
are a few words that may be missing from my statement. I
think what I was saying was that, even though a company like
Canadair has been run like a commercial company, it is not
easy to sell. The reason it is not easy to sell is this. If you look
at the debt structure of Canadair you will find in that debt
structure a very large number of loans that have been guaranteed by the Government of Canada. That is one example of
one difficulty in the sale of Canadair. If you are going to turn
over the equity of the corporation to the private sector, you
have to address the question of what you do with the guaranteed long-term debt of the corporation. Are you going to leave
the guarantees in place? Is the government, in other words,
going to be fully responsible for the long-term debt, while the
equity is being transferred from public hands to private hands?
If not, how are you going to re-arrange the capital structure of
the corporation? All I was saying was that, even though
Canadair is a company that is run, by and large, as a commercial operation, which it is, there are still some very important
issues that have to be dealt with in terms of the methods by
which you privatize, and I wanted to put some stress on the
difficulties of the exercise.
Senator Lamontagne: The debt aspect of the company could
be part of the stimulative budget or deficit.
HOUSING
MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
a question of the Minister of State for Economic Development.
I am appreciative of his response to my question as to whether
the government had plans for any substantial lowering of
interest rates through Central Mortgage and Housing. I
believe it is now called Canada Mortgage and Housing. Am I
correct?
Senator de Cotret: That is correct.
Senator Buckwold: Has the government any such plans in
order to assist those who are involved in buying houses? I was
disappointed, as I am sure thousands of Canadians will be
disappointed, to hear the response that there are no plans at
the moment for such a reduction. My question is: What other
plans or programs will be proposed to assist Canadians, especially lower income Canadians, who want to own their own
homes but who are unable to do so now because of the
historically high interest rates, and will therefore be precluded
from doing so? I would hope there will be some other plans

86

SENATE DEBATES

that would assist them in other ways than interest rates in
order to purchase their own homes.
Senator de Cotret: I am sure the honourable senator anticipates my answer to that question. Even when interest rates
were somewhat lower, my party was very conscious of the

difficulties facing many Canadians, and particularly young
Canadians, who wanted to become home owners for the first
time. It is very much in that spirit, of allowing Canadians to
build a stake in their country, to become home owners, to be
able to get into a market that is very expensive from many
points of view, that we proposed a mortgage interest deductibility program to remove part of the burden of home ownership and allow more Canadians who want to own their own
homes to have the opportunity to do so. As you know, we will
proceed with that program.
Senator Buckwold: I have a supplementary question. You
will be glad to know, Mr. Leader, that I am not going to make
a speech.
Senator Flynn: Sometimes I like to hear you.
Senator Asselin: You are improving.
Senator Buckwold: Thank you. The time will corne when we
start talking about that. The fact is, if I can do one line of
editorializing, although you are going to be giving with the
right hand, I have a feeling that you will be taking much more
with the left hand as a result of your interest policy.
My question now as a supplementary is this. With these
high interest rates, I think we can anticipate a significant drop
in the number of housing starts that will be undertaken in
Canada in the near future. I think this will have very dangerous effects on employment and on the economy. Are there any
plans to assist the housing industry to meet this crisis?
Senator de Cotret: I am sure that question is under active
review by the interested departments, which will need to
monitor and determine the exact impacts on the construction
industry. However, I should like to point out to the honourable
senator that the mortgage interest deductibility program does
far more than just remove the recent increase in the mortgage
interest rate. I would also like to point out that you cannot
have it both ways. You cannot claim on the one hand that it is
a tremendously expensive program and on the other hand that
it will not do anything. If you look at a one per cent increase in
the mortgage interest rates and at a program that is going to
return, through mortgage interest deductibility, $400 million a
year to the hands of Canadian home owners, one per cent is
equivalent to $40 billion more of mortgage interest credits.
Therefore, certainly it is going much further than offsetting
the increase in rates. It is a very positive inducement to home
ownership in this country, particularly as the prograrn will be
phased in over four years to 100 per cent.

October 17, 1979

the reports that are now being received, that foreign interest
rates, meaning non-North American interest rates, are rising
in order to offset the rise in the U.S. federal reserve rate, can
the minister give us an assurance that the interest rates in
Canada, which are already reaching levels that will stifle
capital investment and consumer demand, will not rise to the
point where we have an economic stall in this country; and
further, will the minister assure us that the interest rates will
not rise further than they have risen now?
Senator de Cotret: I can assure the honourable senator that
the actions of the Governor of the Bank of Canada and the
actions of the Minister of Finance in this respect are the best
possible decisions in the current context for the well-being of
the Canadian economy, and that further decisions will be
taken with an eye to furthering our economic development in
this country and assuring the best possible condition for
Canadians in a very difficult international situation.
Senator Austin: With respect to the minister, that is nothing
but a placebo, and I think he should be answering questions on
their merits rather than assuring us that somebody has the
confidence to take all these decisions for us.
Senator de Cotret: Given that your questions are hypothetical-what will happen in Europe, what will happen to the
spread between the Eurodollar rates and the rates in New
York, what will be the response of the federal reserve in the
U.S., what should be the response in Canada-we could talk
all day about hypothetical questions. Those events are being
monitored on an hourly basis, if not a minute-by-minute basis,
by the Bank of Canada. When particular developments happen
I shall be more than happy to explain the decisions that we
have taken.
Senator Lamontagne: That is the lame duck government.
Senator Austin: What the minister is saying is that the
government does not have an interest rate policy. Is that
correct?
Senator Flynn: Not at all.
Senator Walker: That is what you are saying, Senator
Austin.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
EXPORT TRADE

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I have an additional
question for the Minister of State for Economic Development.
I believe the minister will be aware that Canada's merchandise
trade surplus for the first eight months of 1979 now stands at
only $857 million, and that has to be compared with a surplus
of $2.1 billion for the same period in 1978.

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of State for Economic Development. In view of
[Senator Buckwold.]

Is he also aware that recent announcements of reducing oil
shipments to the U.S. will reduce even further Canada's cash
flow from oil sales and will not be offset by an increase in the
price of natural gas to the U.S. market?

October 17, 1979
October 17, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Does he believe that Canada will have a positive merchandise trade surplus in 1979 and, if so, by how much?
Senator de Cotret: There is no question in my mind that our
merchandise trade surplus in 1979 will not reach the level it
reached in 1978, which, if my memory serves me well-and I
stand to be corrected on this matter-was a record level.
The reason for that, of course, is that our major trading
partner, the United States, is undergoing a fairly severe recession. We are feeling the consequences of that in our export
markets, which are not growing at the pace they were growing
in 1978 or, for that matter, in 1977. The Canadian economy,
nonetheless, is expected in 1978 to be generally stronger than
the economy of the United States. In our best estimates we
will not, in a technical senseSenator Lamontagne: Not according to the Conference
Board forecasts.
Senator Roblin: The opposition asked the question; you
listen to the answer.
Senator de Cotret: At the Conference Board I used the
objective forecasts and I still do, and I will endeavour to
continue to do so as long as I am sitting in this chamber, and I
will be happy to discuss them with you.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator de Cotret: Given that our rate of growth in Canada
is likely to be stronger than that in the U.S., there is no
question that our import growth will continue at a stronger
pace, and as our export growth is going down, our merchandise
trade will not be as great as it was last year. It is a source of
concern. Nonetheless, to the extent that it comes from a
stronger performance in Canada than the one in the U.S., I am
not sure that we would like to correct that by seeing the
Canadian economy any weaker than it is right now.
INDUSTRY
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, my question is for the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
In view of the staggering deficits being forecast in the
automotive sector during the current year and more particularly in the area of automotive parts, and in view of the fact that
some non-United States automobile manufacturers have
indicated an interest in purchasing parts from Canada, is the
minister considering expanding the duty remission program
that is presently in effect?
Senator de Cotret: I will have to answer that question
generally, and I apologize for a general answer to that.
There is no question we are concerned about developments
in auto trade. Some of those developments are purely cyclical.
The U.S. auto market is very depressed, but the Canadian
auto market is rather healthy. We have had a very large
increase in imports versus a very poor performance in exports.
There are structural problems with the move to smaller cars.

We are monitoring the situation very closely. We are looking
at the implications of this new situation on the auto pact.
The question is under study, and I will be happy to report
further, as this study progresses, in terms of the specific steps
that we will be taking to ensure that we have a viable
automotive sector in this country in the years to come.
Senator Bosa: I have a supplementary question. I was
referring more to expanding the duty remission program that
is presently in existence with third countries.
Senator de Cotret: I am not sure that I understand. I am
sorry; I did not hear the question.
Senator Bosa: I was referring to reducing the current third
country automotive parts duty remission program, not to the
auto pact.
Senator de Cotret: That is part and parcel of the review we
are giving the whole auto industry at the moment.
YUKON TERRITORY
ENERGY RESOURCES

Senator Lucier: Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the
Leader of the Government in the Senate. Last night, in reply
to a question by Senator Buckwold, Senator Flynn said:
I do not know of any offshore resources for the Yukon
Territory.
Senator Flynn: I was wrong.
Senator Lucier: I hope he does not pass that information on
to Dome Petroleum. They have been drilling there for some
time, and they think they have some resources.
Honourable senators, I hope this question is not taken
lightly. During the period when the minister was the Leader of
the Opposition in the Senate, 1 invited him to visit the Yukon.
In view of the serious implications of the letter sent by the
minister, causing the Commissioner of the Yukon to resign
and seriously upsetting a lot of people in the territory-and,
honourable senators, this letter has serious implications not
just for the people of the Yukon but for all the people in
Canada-l would now ask the Leader of the Government to
take up my invitation to come to the Yukon to show the people
there that someone in this government is concerned about their
feelings and their future.
Senator Flynn: I certainly would be glad to accept the
invitation. In fact, I intended to visit the Yukon this summer
with the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group, but
because of new duties I had to give that up.
In any event, I will be discussing this situation with my
colleague Mr. Epp, and I will see what can be done to assess
the effect of the letter you have read, and decide whether there
should be a visit by either the Minister of Justice or other
members of the government to the Yukon to investigate and
try to correct the situation, if need be.
Senator Lucier: I have a supplementary, honourable senators. I am not trying to be facetious about this. It is a difficult

situation that I find myself in. As well as discussing it with
Mr. Epp, or, in fact, instead of Mr. Epp, I would ask you to
discuss it with Mr. Nielsen, because he is the one making al]
the policies that Mr. Epp is throwing out without really
knowing what he is passing on.
Senator Flynn: I will take this observation into account.
GRAIN
STATUS OF GOVERN MENT ADVISORY GROUP

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, I have a question
directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It
has to do with the Grains Group.
As the minister is aware, I am sure, the Grains Group is a
small advisory group, drawn from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce and
the Department of Transport, to advise on the production, the
sale and the movement of grain. With some exceptions, it
draws its resources, or, at least, it did draw its resources, I
understand, from the estimates of his department.
My first question has two parts. Is this group still active,
and does it still report to various departments in the saine
manner as it did previous to the election? Since it bas a
mandate for two years, and in the past that mandate has been
renewed every two years, when is the mandate up for renewal,
and will it be renewed?
Senator de Cotret: To answer the first part of your question,
I would be hard pressed to tell you if that group reports in the
same way as it used to report. I have not met with that group.
If it used to report directly to the Minister of the Department
of Industry, Trade and Commerce, either it bas not met or it
has not had occasion to report to me since June 4. I should be
happy to look into the exact reporting relationships of that
group, and I will take notice in terms of the date of the expiry
of the mandate of the group and whether it will be renewed.
I should be happy to respond to that question tomorrow.
Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, to say the least, I am
a little surprised and somewhat shocked by the answer, since
grain is one of the most important factors in our export sales,
and certainly one of the most important factors in the earning
of foreign exchange.
It is difficult to separate sales from delivery. In the past few
years we have been able to grow and to sell more wheat, oats
and barley than we have been able to deliver. Certainly, sales,
whether to Russia or Poland, depend a great deal, and will
continue to depend a great deal, on our ability to deliver. In
view of that, I would suggest that the minister make himself
fully familiar with both the delivery and export systems. He
will then be in a position to present our case to prospective
customers and assist in helping Canada maintain its position in
the marketplace.
I shall now put my supplementary question. In light of the
government's promise to increase exports by 20 per cent in its
first year, I would ask the minister, when looking into this, to
[Senator Lucier.]

provide us with the export figures for the first two months of
the current crop year.
* (1510)

Senator de Cotret: Certainly. I should like to underline for
the senator the very urgent attention we gave this whole
problem of moving grain to the market, and ensuring that we
can meet our export commitments. As he knows, our rolling
stock has been allowed to deteriorate to a frightening level. As
he well knows we were not able to move the same amount of
grain to market as our commitments required. We were falling
behind, and that is why we announced earlier the acquisition
of 2,000 hopper cars and why we also announced, on the part
of the federal government, the renovation of 2,000 boxcars to
help move grain to market. That is also why we announced the
Prince Rupert terminal.
We have certainly taken action in that field. The Minister of
Transport is very concerned about grain handling and is
ensuring we move grain to market, as well as taking measures
to increase the potential we have in that field. So, it is far from
a topic that has escaped our attention. Quite the opposite, it is
a topic that has been front and foremost on our agenda of
action over the past few months. As I said, action has been
taken in this field.
TRANSPORTATION POLICY

Senator Steuart: A final supplementaryAn Hon. Senator: Where was Otto Lang?
Senator Steuart: Yes, I can tell you where Otto Lang was.
I wonder if the minister could tell me if be is aware that
under the previous government we bought 8,000 hopper cars
and that in the last crop year-not the one just past but the
one previous to that-we moved over a billion bushels, which
was about two-and-a-half times that ever moved under a
Conservative government. Is the minister aware that over the
last four months-you can laugh, but you better look up the
facts, because you obviously don't know a bushel of wheat
from anything else, and you don't know what has really
happened.
Senator Asselin: Ask the question.
Senator Steuart: You had better determine that, because if
you wish to improve the systems, you should know what
occurred in the past, and you obviously do not.
My question is: Will the minister determine why, in the last
four months, the movement of wheat bas dropped off from the
previous crop year and the crop year prior to that? I ask him
to tell us that when he is boasting of how his government is
doing.
Senator de Cotret: I shall be very happy to find out the
facts, not only for the last four months but for the last four
years and, for that matter, the last 40 years.
Senator Steuart: Then you will find out that you are totally
wrong.
Senator Flynn: Don't make a speech. Keep your strength.

SENATE DEBATES

Senator de Cotret: I am aware of the efforts that have been
made in the past to move grain to market. All 1 am suggesting
is that, given the present environment in which we live, given
our present productive capacity and the present market conditions abroad, we were not in a position to move as much grain
to market as we would have liked. We have taken action to
correct that situation, and we shall continue to take action to
correct that situation.
Senator Steuart: May I ask the minister how much grain we
moved last year, and how much grain we moved the year
before? Does he know that?
Senator de Cotret: I shall be happy to provide the specific
numbers at the next sitting of the Senate.
Senator Flynn: You provide them in your next speech.
Senator Moigat: Honourable senators, I am gratified to
learn the concern and urgency the minister attaches to the
whole matter of grain transportation. I am sure that he is
aware that in January of this year, at the request of the
Manitoba government, there was a conference held in Winnipeg dealing with all elements of grain transportation. The
federal Minister of Agriculture attended, as did the premiers
of the western provinces.
The Minister of Agriculture for Manitoba, at the beginning
of October, requested a further meeting. He addressed a
communication to the Minister of Transport, the Honourable
Mr. Mazankowski, but after a week he still has not received a
reply. Could the minister indicate whether a reply has now
gone out, and if so, when the meeting will be called?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I shall be happy to
ask my colleague, the Honourable Donald Mazankowski, the
status of that request. I have no idea as to what happened to it,
but I shall ask him about it.
Senator Molgat: Given the impassioned statements made by
the minister a few moments ago regarding his great concern
for the grains trade and grains transportation, and the fact
that his own area of responsibility is tied in to this, I am
surprised that he is not aware as to whether or not a response
to this request from a provincial government went forward.
Apart from the question of petroleum, this is probably the
most vital element in the economy of western Canada.
Is it not the policy of this governmentSenator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I should like to
make a point for clarification. I was asked whether I was
aware of a letter sent by a minister of the Manitoba government to my colleague, the Minister of Transport, and what
happened to that specific letter and the request contained
therein. My response was that I would be happy to check with
my colleague as to the disposition of this matter-whether he
has received the letter, and, if so, whether he answered it. I fail
to see from that answer how it can be inferred that I am either
uninterested in the problem or that we are not co-operating
and consulting actively with the provinces.
On the contrary, I have just completed a tour of most of the
provinces of Canada. Meetings were held with several federal

cabinet ministers and their provincial counterparts to discuss
the problems that were of particular interest to them. I can tell
you now that Mr. Mazankowski was on the trip to the west
and we discussed many issues, such as energy, transportation,
and grain transportation and handling with the western provinces. We are keeping in close contact with the provinces.
The fact that I cannot answer the honourable senator
specifically regarding this one letter will, I hope, be excused. I
will get an answer tomorrow to the question. I certainly cannot
be aware of all the correspondence that is being handled by all
departments of government.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, the question is not
really whether the minister is aware of the specific letter, but
whether he is aware of the request of the Manitoba government that the meeting be reconvened?
Senator de Cotret: The answer is no, but I shall be very
happy to check that out with my colleague, the Minister of
Transport.
Senator Asselin: You will learn.
Senator Molgat: He bas given me the perfect answer. This is
the new federal-provincial co-operation.
ENERGY
SECURITY OF FUEL SUPPLIES

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I would like to ask
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce whether he
would give this chamber today any information about the
extent of any surplus of domestic heating oil and gasoline fuel,
and whether it is adequate to meet this winter's needs; if not,
what specific contingency measures are in place to ensure
Canadians a warm winter at affordable prices in their homes
during the coming months?
Senator de Cotret: I will take notice of that question and
refer it to the Minister of Energy, and give a specific answer in
terms of the reserves tomorrow.
Senator Smith (Colchester): It would be a good thing to
encourage the honourable senators opposite to keep on talking.

reduce, our efforts, not only because of a moral obligation but
also for the sake of our own ultimate survival. I say that in all
seriousness.
Today, no nation is an island. Wendel Wilkie's One World
and MacLuhan's Global Village are not catch phrases describing a condition in the remote future. They describe the here
and now. The explosive development of communications technology-satellites, television, transistor radios, airplanes-has
contracted the world and provided all of us with instant
information. The poverty that plagues the Third World is now,
right here in our own backyard. We know about their poverty
and they know about our wealth.
Honourable senators, this is not a matter of party politics.
Canada has usually managed to achieve a bipartisan foreign
policy in regard to the United Nations and its agencies, such
as UNICEF, UNESCO and WHO. The majority of parliamentarians-and, I am sure, the public-recognize the need
to support the Canadian International Development Agency.
The new Minister of State for CIDA, the Honourable
Senator Asselin, is a man of experience. He has been around.
He has visited the developing countries and knows their problems at first hand. He has long been in the Senate where we
provide the second thought that so often rectifies the ill-considered first thought that comes to us from the other place.
He has already made a good beginning in his new role, and I
congratulate him on that. At the Conference on Science and
Technology 'in Vienna last August he undertook to supply
additional funds for technical aid to the Third World. He set
as a target figure about one per cent of officiai development
assistance, which is approximately $12 million. I hope he will
be able to stay with that undertaking. I hope, too, that he will
use all of his experience and wisdom to persuade the Secretary
of State for External Affairs, as well as the committee examining CIDA's programs and structure, not to reduce the appropriations for CIDA, or to insist upon further "tying" of
contributions.
Just this week, Canada has pledged over $1 million in
assistance to Dominica. The recent hurricane turned most of
the little houses on that island into piles of wood, destroyed
crops and polluted the water supply. There was great loss of
life. Canada will now provide insecticides, fertilizers and tools.
We will also help to rebuild roads washed out by heavy rain,
and we will help to revitalize the coconut industry.
e

(1530)

I congratulate the minister on providing this emergency aid,
even if it took such a long time to spring into action. It is the
sort of thing we should be doing. We have a special historical
relationship with the Caribbean so it is only proper that our
sympathy with the anguish of Dominica should take a positive
form.
I am quite aware that the government has serious financial
problems, that cuts in spending are necessary for this government, just as they were for the previous government. But,
surely, cuts indiscriminately right across the board would show
a poor sense of values. There must be priorities. The welfare of

others is one of the central values of our society. We must
support that concern not only here at home but abroad,
because we are all interdependent.
The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Shridath Ramphal,
has put it more dramatically than I can, and he certainly
speaks with greater authority. At the Commonwealth Universities Conference in Jamaica this spring he said the following:
Perhaps it is this insight of the world as a community of
people needing each other for survival, and having a
common interest in the quality of the human condition
world-wide that will, more than any other single factor,
determine the fate of the dialogue between North and
South, between rich and poor. But it will determine much
more than that: for international cooperation and development, or, as I prefer to see them, conjointed, international
cooperation for development, is not a thing apart. It is
not, as we once conceived it, a little bit of goodness
measured in aid, like alms on Sunday; it has to do with
the structure of human relationships in all its facets.
Honourable senators, I have worked briefly for CIDA in
Jamaica and in Barbados. During those periods I acquired
respect for the intelligence and ability of the women and men I
worked with. I admired their courage and patience, their
determination to build a better society in defiance of terrible
economic pressures and a tragic history.
I learned a great deal from the opportunity of working with
people in a different culture, as so many other Canadians sent
abroad by CIDA have donc. I have formed great empathy for
them. Their essential humanity reached out to my own.
One of the most important things I learned is this. The Four
Horsemen do not respect national boundaries. They are now
riding across Asia and Africa and South America and through
the islands of the Caribbean, and they ride fast. If we do not
use our wealth and technical know-how to stop them, soon
they will ride from south to north. Having failed to help others
to stop them, we will be unable to help ourselves.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I want at the outset
to congratulate Senator Bird on the fine speech she has just
made, and I want to make some preliminary observations.
Later during my speech I may come back to the subject of
foreign aid.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, although I have been sitting in this
assembly for many years, it is for me today a new experience
to be back before you as a member of the federal cabinet. It
gives, I think, a new dimension to the activities and the debates
of our upper house. The fact that three of us were appointed to
high offices is not only an honour for the Senate as a whole but
also a unique opportunity for all of us to have more influence
on government decisions and policies. I know that the sum of
experience and knowledge to be found in this house is an
important asset for our government.

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Perrault: Circumstances changed.
Senator Asselin: So circumstances changed. The same thing
applies in our case. If circumstances change, we have a right to
change views. Only fools never change views. What happened
after the 1974 election? That saine government that had been
elected because they had promised the people not to implement
the proposai put forward by the Conservative Party, wage and
price controls, made an about-face and forgot their promise to
the people. They simply implemented the system we had
proposed during the 1974 campaign. And this only goes to
prove what I said earlier that if a political party, after making
election promises gets elected and realizes that certain promises do not serve the interest of the people, it has a duty not
to implement them. I sec no weakness in a government that
would act that way. When my honourable friend who just left
indicated we have a list of 46 election promises, I asked my
staff to look up the Liberal Party's program during the last
election. Do you know how many election promises your party
made during that campaign? Exactly 122 promises! I have

But when Senator Lamontagne accuses this Conservative
government of failing to take such and such decision, I say he
is not sincere. A government which has been in office for only
five months cannot rectify all mistakes accumulated during 16
years by the previous regime.
Honourable senators, I say that Senator Lamontagne-of
course we are quite prepared to take his advice, any practical
advice which Senator Lamontagne might want to give us,
advice we could use, advice which could improve our economy-but I say that he was not serious when he blamed the
Conservative government for failing to take such and such
decision after we have been in office only five months.
Honourable senators, when the Leader of the Opposition
made his long speech-I congratulate him, it was a good
speech but he will learn quickly to speak as Leader of the
Opposition and I hope he will make constructive criticismshe asked many questions of the government. He said simply:
why did the government take so much time to convene Parliament? Why did it take almost four months to call us when the
economic situation is so disastrous?

SENATE DEBATES
the session were detailed. We chose to be brief. I believe that it
gave a good idea of the intentions of this government. We
referred to individual rights, to the legislation on freedom of
information. We mentioned changes designed to increase the
power of Parliament and also to strengthen the authority of
committees and increase their resources. Mention was made
also of the appointment of a permanent Speaker; of the
creation of special committees to look into the needs of the
handicapped and the disabled; of the ways in which non-profitable organizations could play a greater role. In the future, at
the other place, five- or-six-member ad hoc committees will
work more expeditiously and report more quickly to the House
of Commons on the results of their work, and on their recommendations. We have also spoken of federal-provincial relations. I shall come back to that in detail further on in my
speech. You have noticed the new attitude of the central
government. That new attitude, which the Speech from the
Throne made obvious, is one of cooperation, of collaboration
with the provinces.
Honourable senators, when the Prime Minister spoke in the
other place to the Speech from the Throne, he said this, and 1
quote:
Our restraint program is intended to free resources to the
private sector to encourage investment, to encourage business expansion and to encourage job creation, which we
believe is the best way to generate the revenues which in
turn will help us balance the budget of Canada. We
intend to reduce the burden of government on the econon and offer practical incentives to individual Canadians
to build a stake in our country.
That is the philosophy of the Conservative Party, the
philosophy that will guide the Conservative government in
coming years. In other words, therefore, we will give more
responsibility to private enterprise, and we will sec to it that
the state does not stick its nose in every aspect of the Canadian
economy. We want to put a stop to the socialization of our
enterprises, something the former government had been in the
process of doing for several years.

[English]
Honourable senators, I now want to come back to the
subject of foreign aid, which has been brought before the
house this afternoon by my dear colleague, Senator Bird.
In forming his first cabinet, the Prime Minister decided to
correct something which, unfortunately, was only too truc in
the past. The Secretary of State for External Affairs was
often, because of the pressures of that position, unable to
devote enough time to the operation of the Canadian International Development Agency. By an order in council of June 5,
the Ministry of State for CIDA was created, and subsequently
the Secretary of State for External Affairs delegated many of
her powers of authorization in respect to CIDA to me.
Day-to-day operations and policy, of course, are not separate. On questions of aid policy, the Honourable Flora MacDonald and 1 will function as a team. She is a lady for whom I
iSenator Asselin.]

October 17, 1979

have the greatest respect-a respect which she receives from
ail parties in both charrbers, 1 believe-and I look forward to
working closely with her on the foreign policy review.
1 should also mention that as a member of the Cabinet
Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, and after discussions with Senator Flynn, it has been decided that I will
answer questions on external affairs, national defence and
CIDA in this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Asselin: I will do so to the best of my ability, as
usual.
Senator Perrault: Keep us out of war, now.
Senator Asselin: It has been almost a decade since the last
foreign policy review was carried out. This review, leading into
the 1980s, will be a change of substance as well as of operating
procedures or mechanics. Our foreign aid is an integral part of
our foreign policy. As I discovered in Africa this summer, aid
has been a major national instrument in our relations with
one-third of the world's people; but these are times of serious
economic difficulty in Canada, as I have stated before. We
cannot, honourable senators, give as much help as we might
like. We are not being hypocritical, as the Leader of the
Opposition in the other place tried to suggest last week, when
we say this; we are being realistic. No one should be more
aware of the fiscal restraints which affect Canada's aid policy
than Mr. Trudeau. After all, he presided over that chain of
events which put us in this position. I ask al] honourable
senators to judge where the hypocrisy lies.
The Leader of the Opposition suggested last week that on
the subject of aid Miss MacDonald, Mr. Crosbie and I had
contradicted each other. There is no such contradiction. We all
agree that we cannot afford to increase our aid spending. We
must ensure that our money is spent efficiently, and that it
helps the population it is designed to help. Aid policy will be
reviewed in the light of our commitment to assist in the
development of those countries in the Third World which have
the resources, the initiative and a strong desire to move ahead.
Today we are partners in development; tomorrow we might be,
or we will be, partners in trade.
Aid policy will also be reviewed in the light of our humanitarian commitment to the poorest countries in the world,
where needs are more basic and more urgent. We have already
taken some new initiatives in this regard. We have increased
the budget for our work with Canada's non-governmental
organizations working in the Third World in order to benefit
more from their experience, and we have increased the budget
of the International Development Research Centre, as agreed
at the United Nations Conference on Science, Technology and
Development in Vienna, and as stated by my dear colleague,
Senator Bird.
There is a recognition that research and development must
play an increasing role in the national development strategies
of the Third World. But other difficult decisions must be
made, and that is why we will have a parliamentary committee
examining this subject. I expect it will be a joint committee,

October 17, 1979

for I want to see the expertise from all sides of this chamber
put to good use.
This past summer, when I visited Cameroon, Zambia,
Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya, I saw very real affection for
Canada and Canadians, and had the opportunity at that time
to see many CIDA projects at first hand. I must say that not
all of what I saw pleased me. I think we must improve our
record. We have already taken some steps to correct these
problems. Our development aid projects are something which I
think all Canadians should be proud of. Mistakes have been
made in the past, reported here in Canada, and CIDA's image
has been tarnished. If there is one commitment I want to make
today it is to restore the Canadian public's pride in our foreign
aid.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Asselin: Last week, Mr. Trudeau said that Canada
was losing credibility with the Third World. I saw no such loss
of credibility this summer in Africa, nor in the many discussions I have since had with ambassadors and foreign ministers.
They all understand the new government's fiscal constraints,
and, above all, they have confidence in this new government.
They know we will help as much as we can, that we will
correct past errors, and especially that when timetables have to
be changed or projects postponed, they know that their governments will be consulted and asked for input beforehand. They
know that this government sees the aid relationship as one of
partnership, and they have confidence that we will bring the
same openness and consultation which we have brought to
federal-provincial relations to our aid policy.
* (1610)

Honourable senators, I should like to refer briefly to Mr.
Trudeau's comments on human rights and foreign policy. He
stated that without economic justice, human rights have no
meaning. 1, for one, have no reluctance in supporting the
statements of the Honourable Flora MacDonald. There is no
reason to apologize for our stand that supports human rights in
a world where they are increasingly under attack. I will not
apologize for the message that this government has delivered
loud and clear to the Government of Vietnam.
Honourable senators, before I end this speech, I should like
to pay tribute to the man who was the architect of the
Progressive Conservative victory last spring-Prime Minister
Joe Clark. To understand Joe Clark and those values which he
holds, you have only to look at the first Throne Speech of his
government. He believes in open government, something we
have lacked for many years now. He believes in Parliament,
and he intends to restore to it the powers and prestige it must
have in our system of government. Most of all, he believes that
it is time the government of our country acknowledged that
this is a confederation in which the provinces are partners in
nation-building.
This summer, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government
Conference in Lusaka, I had the opportunity of watching our
new Prime Minister at his second major international conference. I can tell you, honourable senators, that he made a great

impression on his Commonwealth colleagues. Again and again
the comments made by the heads and members of the delegations were that Joe Clark may be very young, but he has a
keen and incisive mind that enables him to understand complicated situations quickly. They were impressed. Their judgment is that he has an excellent political future as head of our
government. That was the verdict of Mr. Clark's international
peers.
I remember last winter and spring reading countless articles
of the doomsday scenario where English Canada elected
Progressive Conservatives and French Canada elected Liberals, accentuating even further the divisions in our country.
Well, the election came; the former government went; and
doomsday never arrived. From French Canada there has been
no surge of hostility towards the new government as was long
predicted by our political adversaries.
As we head into this session of Parliament, we will see many
new initiatives and changes of direction for our country. The
new government's mandate was one of change. Canadians are
cautious people by nature and, to a cautious people, change is
often unsettling, but we are resolved to get our country working, again and, with the participation and co-operation of
Canadians, we will succeed. I am convinced that with all of the
energy and talent available to us as a government we will enjoy
the goodwill and confidence of Canadians, and that they will
fully support the change in direction and new strategies we
intend to implement.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I cannot conclude this first speech as a
member of the government without saying a word on what I
think of national unity. We have been asked several questions
since the Speech from the Throne. We have been asked why is
this government keeping quiet when we are facing a major
crisis with respect to national unity? Why is this government
keeping quiet in its Speech from the Throne about the referendum Quebec will be holding in the coming months? We are
obviously aware that Canada is now going through a crisis of
political maturity. We are aware that a great many Canadians
are not satisfied with our political structures, our constitutional structures, that they want changes, rapid changes, to keep
this country together.
We thought of replacing the negative approach, the
approach of confrontation the former government had vis-à-vis
the provinces by an approach of negotiation and dialogue.
Since we have been elected to run this country, and since we
have formed the new government, we have made diligent
efforts to offer all provinces the cooperation of the new federal
government. We did not do so out of vanity. We did it quite
simply to try and change the atmosphere that prevailed previously, to try to open the windows and give Canadians a little
more oxygen, to stop that useless confrontation the federal
government had engaged in with the provinces for so many
years.
Surprisingly, honourable senators, our approach was successful. We have, since we were sworn in, greatly increased

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
contacts with our colleagues in other provinces. We have
discussed with them their problems which were often common
to the federal and provincial governments. We have managed
in several cases to solve problems without any fuss, without
accusing one another. Furthermore, this new approach has
enabled us, I think, to iron out certain difficulties that existed
previously between the provinces and the federal government.
Let us not hide it. We must not hide the fact that we had
reached the point where every day there was a new declaration
of war between Quebec and federal ministers. It was nearly
shameful in the face of all Canadians to hear people serving
the same interests insult one another publicly on issues that
often were of no importance. That did not help national unity.
So, honourable senators, we set out to try and serve Canadians with this new approach. Indeed, we are told we are keeping
quiet in the referendum fight. You are asking us to comment
on a question that is not yet known. When are we going to take
a stand on a question we do not know? Some would like us as a
federal government to launch an immediate war against something, against a question we do not know. Come on, let us be
serious. Let us wait until the question is put by the government
in question and then the federal government will take its
responsibilities. Do not ask us to table immediately papers or
constitutional alternatives with respect to the changes one
would want to sec implemented in Canada. Do not ask the
federal government to assume that responsibility by itself. But
do ask all parties involved in this crisis of national unity to
work out their own approaches. Do not ask us to do more than
what is being done now by the leader of the Quebec Liberal
Party, Mr. Ryan, who has not yet put his constitutional
alternatives before the people. Do not ask this government to
do more than the Liberal Party has donc, since it has refused
up to now to table its constitutional alternatives.
Senator Lamontagne will undoubtedly refer to Bill C-60.
Let us be serious. Are we going to ask Quebecers to believe
that Bill C-60, designed to reform the Senate and the Supreme
Court and to make linguistic changes as well in a new Constitution, has thoroughly altered federalism? In addition, when
Senator Lamontagne and some others ask us: "What is your
constitutional position"? I answer: "What is yours"?
Senator Lamontagne: I never asked that.
Senator Asselin: If you did not ask, others did. Mr. Chrétien
does as well as Mr. Lalonde, who constantly appear on television and accuse us of having no constitutional policy. Have you
any constitutional policies? It is Bill C-60. However what does
Bill C-60 mean? Abolish the Senate, replace it by a new
house, alter the structure of the Supreme Court, introduce
language rights in the new Constitution. Do you think this will
change a single vote in Quebec? Not a single vote in the
referendum.
Senator Lamontagne: Do not get excited.
Senator Asselin: I am not excited, I am answering you.
Since the beginning of the session, Senator Lamontagne has
been busy ironically denigrating the new government, more
especially with charges such as the ones he made last evening.
[Senator Asselin.]

October 17, 1979

October 17. 1979

Anyway, just read my speech this afternoon. I made some
excellent comments about you. You will get your money's
worth.
I say to you, honourable senators, that we will not do more
at present than other political parties in Quebec and the
federal Liberal Party are doing to thwart the separatist threat
in Quebec.
e

(1620)

There is something I have never said before publicly and
that I want to say now. I only hope that our English-speaking
compatriots will not intervene massively in the Quebec question. If they do, they will only provide the Quebec government
with tools and instruments, and that would defeat our purpose
which is to convince the Quebec people to vote "No" on the
referendum question, if it is phrased the way we think it should
be. Let us be careful, honourable senators from the anglophone provinces, be careful before deciding to jump head first
into the Quebec battle to defend federalism. This battle will be
fought between Quebecers. As a Quebecer, I will take part in
it. I will say to my fellow Quebecers what my impression and
experience of federalism has been over the past 20 years. I
know a thing or two about federalism. I am aware that I do
not know quite as much as Senator Lamontagne about it, but I
am sure that if I need help and advice, thanks to his great
generosity and consideration for the government, he will not
refuse them.
Senator Lamontagne: You have Senator Tremblay.
Senator Asselin: We are certainly delighted to have Senator
Tremblay with us and 1 am pleased to welcome him. It seems
he is a friend of Senator Lamontagne, but at least he has seen
the light. You never did see it. That is why he has joined our
ranks.
Honourable senators, what I mean to say is that the present
government is ready and willing. We shall certainly not do
miracles. We shall probably make mistakes. We have challenges to meet in the area of the economy as well as national
unity. That is the task which all honourable senators must
carry out, at the invitation of the government, for we know, on
the government side, that when the time comes to decide, you
will go along with the best interests of the Canadian people.
[English|
Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I welcome the opportunity, as Chairman of the Canadian Consultative Council on
Multiculturalism, and as a member of this chamber, to participate in this debate, particularly as it affords me the opportunity to share with you some concerns about Canadian society.
First, I should like to extend my congratulations to the
mover and seconder of the motion for an Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne, Senator Bielish and Senator
Charbonneau.
I should also like to welcome collectively all those senators
who have joined this chamber since the last session. It has
certainly been a welcome change, and they have brought an
infusion of new blood which has provided new vitality to this
chamber.

October 17, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

I should also like to say some words of congratulation to the
new Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Flynn,
and to wish him well in the very onerous responsibilities that
he has undertaken as Minister of Justice. To add to his
responsibilities I understand that he is also the main spokesman for the Province of Quebec. One is not prevented from
building up a sense of admiration for a member of this house,
even though he may be on the other side of the fence politically. In friendship one can overlook a blind spot in the political
ideology of a friend.
I should also like to congratulate our new Speaker, Senator
Grosart. Senator Grosart was a very active debater in this
chamber. I was amazed at his profound knowledge of so many
different topics and subjects. He was often on his feet, and he
spoke without notes. I am sure he enjoyed that, and now that
he is the Speaker he probably has this conflict, that he enjoys
his new role but regrets that he cannot participate in the
activities that he liked so much before. I am sure he will
discharge his new responsibilities in a statesmanlike manner,
and we wish him well.
There are many challenges that face our society, and there
is much to be done if we hope to meet the needs of our vast
and multi-faceted society. The seventies saw important steps
taken towards recognizing the history of this country and the
contributions made by all of its people towards the building of
our great nation. Last night I was greatly encouraged to hear
Senator Macquarrie speak of the history of Canada, and the
necessity of renaming buildings such as the East Block, which
should be named after Sir John A. Macdonald. The building
known as the South Block ought to have a historical name to
bring to public notice the contributions made by heroes of this
country.
In addition to persons such as Sir John A. Macdonald, the
Right Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie King, Sir Robert Borden
and all others who have held office as Prime Minister of
Canada, there ought to be recognition for the many other
heroes who contributed to the development of this country. For
instance we have Sir Casimir S. Gzowski, who was, in 1849,
the first Polish immigrant to come to Canada. A bridge in the
Niagara Peninsula is named after him and a postage stamp
was issued to his recognition. Enrico Tonti was the assistant to
de LaSalle. I do not want to take away any credit that de
LaSalle ought to have, but he confined his activities mostly to
going back and forth between Canada and France in order to
raise funds to finance further exploration, while Enrico Tonti,
his assistant, remained here to explore the country, to build
ships to cross the lakes, and to develop communications with
the Indians. It was Tonti who did much of what de LaSalle got
the credit for. People such as he ought to be recognized.
I have spoken of the contributions to this country by people
of Italian origin on previous occasions-Giovanni Caboto, the
discoverer of Canada, in 1497, Giovanni da Verazzano, the
navigator and explorer, in 1526, Lieutenant Marini, a soldier
who was wounded on the Plains of Abraham in 1759, and
Carlo Burlamacchi who changed his name and who, as Brigadier General Charles Bourlamaque, played a key role in the
80072-7

Seven Years War that preceded the battle on the Plains of
Abraham.
There is a need for recognizing these people by naming
buildings after them in order to give emphasis to this aspect of
Canadian history so that people of all ethnic groups will know
of their predecessors who have made significant contributions
to the development of this country, and through this form of
recognition they can derive a sense of real belonging-a sense
of being part of the history of Canada.
In 1971 an announcement by the federal government of a
policy of multiculturalism also instilled a feeling of real
belonging to millions of Canadians. Provinces like Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario now have their own
multicultural policies, and British Columbia has recently taken
steps in this direction.
The Speech from the Throne in describing primary goals of
this new Parliament says:
To enhance the rights, freedom and opportunities of
individual Canadians ... to consider measures to build
upon the diverse regional and cultural strengths of
Canada.
a

(1630)

These ought to be the primary goals for each of us. Unfortunately, the philosophy of multiculturalism has yet to reach full
acceptance by all segments of Canadian society. There are still
some who are confused and some who imagine that Canadian
identity must be something single or uniform. Canadian identity is a composite of the cultural heritages of each of us,
whether he be born of Irish, German, Italian or Indian ancestry. What is Canada if not the soul and spirit of the immigrants and native people who together created this nation?
What is the spirit of a people if not their collective memories,
their culture? With the resources of today, to fail to keep the
united Canada spirit of our ancestors alive would be to do
injustice to the torch we have been handed.
I am pleased to note that the government intends to amend
the Immigration Act by embedding in its preamble the multicultural fact of Canada, which better reflects the pluralistic
essence of our society in addition to its federal and bilingual
nature. I did show my displeasure to the previous government
by proposing an amendment in a committee of the Senate
when the bill was discussed. I was not a member of that
committee, so Senator Asselin chivalrously moved the amendment for me.
Of even greater significance-and I wish to applaud it-is
the government's position regarding recognition of the diversity of Canada in their review of cultural policy. I note this with
great pleasure, as previous attempts of this nature have been
only a matter of afterthought. I go back to the setting up of
the B&B Commission in which only the reaction of some of
the more vocal minority groups forced the government of the
day to add the study of the "others"
Later still, the paper A Timefor Action mentioned the need
to address ourselves to the multicultural nature of our country,
yet when Bill C-60 was introduced no significant mention of

SENATE DEBATES
multiculturalism was evident, and it was only later that the
then minister responsible gave an undertaking to introduce it
as an amendment to the bill.
To me, matters such as these are not token gestures to be
dealt with on an ad hoc basis. They are the principles for
forming the kind of society that we talk about, a society where
member communities respect one another. It is time that
governments of the day recognize the desires of all Canadians
to participate to the fullest extent in the future of Canada. If
the government is serious about encouraging the development
and expression of the diversity and plurality of Canadian
society, there is the opportunity to do so through order-incouncil appointments.
If we are to ensure a better quality of life for all Canadians,
we must take measures to eliminate social tensions and conflicts, we must display a willingness to understand and to help
all ethnic groups in our society, and we must encourage
sharing and building together by people of different backgrounds in a climate of mutual respect and understanding.
An important key to this end is communication. The media
with their vast audience have a social responsibility to provide
that communication. Public attitude is much influenced by
the media. It is in this area that the media can be of great
assistance in preventing distorted stereotyping.
Prejudice can exist even in the most enlightened minds, but,
once instilled, prejudice and misconception cannot be easily
eradicated. The surest way to incite prejudice against a community is to stereotype its people. Because of some sensational
happenings, the media have often focussed their entire attention on these happenings, and this has been donc frequently to
the point that some reporters make no distinction between the
few rotten apples and the community they come from.
By way of example, at the conclusion of the CBC programs
Connections, Mr. Warren Davis stated that: "Some ethnic
communities are not effectively policed." Mr. Davis made no
distinction between policing criminals and policing a
community.
The televising of the Connections programs by the CBC in
March 1979, was purported to be an inquiry into organized
crime. In fact, they were mostly a rehashing of old material,
and I am sure that the police learned nothing new from them.
However, the effect of the programs, as I will show in a
moment, did reinforce an already existing negative image of
the Italian community.
I do not want to say that this was intentional on the part of
the CBC, but results of a Gallup Poll study, that I requested
be commissioned by the Multiculturalism Directorate of the
Department of the Secretary of State, disclosed conclusive
evidence that the programs increased the stereotyping of Italians in Canada. Data collected by the poll indicated that 47
per cent, almost one out of two, of the persons who watched
Connections linked Italian Canadians with "crime". Among
those who did not sec the programs, that number went down to
37 per cent. So there was almost a 23 per cent increase in that
type of thinking as a resuit of watching those programs. The
[Senator Bosa.]

October 17, 1979

same survey revealed that 40 per cent of the viewers of those
programs said that Italian Canadians are more involved with
organized crime than other groups, while only 25 per cent of
those who did not see the programs concurred. These are
frightening results. Unfortunately, that is the public perception
of Italian Canadians and crime, but what are the facts?
Professor François Ribordy's Culture Conflict and Crime
Among Italian Immigrants (1975) used, as the focus of study,
the significant Italian community in Montreal. Professor
Ribordy established that the amount of Italian criminality is
very low, and that it represents only one-tenth of the expected
rate. His findings are confirmed by the resuits of similar
research in foreign countries which demonstrated the low
crime rate among Italians.

e

(1640)

A study published by the Ministry of the Solicitor General
in 1974, entitled An Estimate of the Present and Future Costs
Involvement of Immigrants in Crime in Canada, concludes
that the rate of crime among immigrants is about one-half the
rate of crime among Canadians.
Canadians of Italian origin have every right to be proud of
their heritage and to feel of their rightful place in Canada.
Their forefathers have made significant contributions from the
discovery of this country throughout its history to the present
time. This community has brought a vibrant, warm-hearted
presence to Canadian society, but programs like Connections
can do nothing but arouse feelings of suspicion and hatred in
the intracultural light while, at the same time, instilling in our
youth burdensome guilt feelings which are not and should not
be theirs to shoulder. The repercussions of such programs, the
accusations, the slights, and the mistrust could result in the
crippling of a child's own self-image, manifesting itself in
unwarranted self-hatred for himself and his ancestry. It is the
warping of the minds of children that truly bring to light the
seriousness and tragic nature of the problem.
I hope that individual reporters will recognize this problem
and, now that we have the benefit of the survey, have a greater
sense of awareness in the psychological repercussions that a
steady dose of unbalanced reporting can have on a significant
segment of Canadian society. I do not want to prevent the
press from reporting legitimate news, however sensational, but
in the light of the circumstances programs like Connections
ought not to be shown unless the stereotyping element is
removed. Let's fight organized crime with all our might, but
let's not harm an entire community in the process of doing so.
As a result of discussions with myself and others, the
President of the CBC took steps to have a seminar organized
this fall that would, at least, begin to sensitize CBC personnel
to the complexities of our pluralistic society. Mr. Johnson has
recently informed me that these consultations have been postponed for the time being. i hope it will not be too long before
this meeting takes place. As our national broadcas[ing system,
the CBC must offer positive leadership as opposed to being one
of the main culprits in the area of media stereotyping.

1 heartily welcome the review of cultural policy indicated in
the Speech frorn the Throne. 1 purposely say "cultural policy-,
and not "cultural policies" as does the Speech, because 1
strongly believe that we should have one policy, and only one
policy, for ail Canadians. The parliamentary comrnittee undertaking this review mnust be reminded, however, that its work
will be incomplete if it does not take into consideration the
views of the Canadian Consultative Council on Multiculturalism and those of the ethnocultural communities.

During the past few years, 1 have becorne acutely aware of
their concerns and their need to be heard. Although rny terni

lasi three years will assist me in providing some input concerning legisiation that cornes before this chamber respecting
matters affecting ail segments of Canadian society.
The pre-election Progressive Conservative statement on multicultaralism, for example, predicted that control of federal
funding for multicultural endeavours would be given to the
CCCM, as weIl as permission to review practices in the varjous

had been received from the House of Commons to acquaint
the Senate that the name of Mr. Demers had been substituted
for that of Miss Nicholson on the list of members appointed to
serve on the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of

I should like to associate ourselves thoroughly with the
remarks he has made, because we have here, in this woman's
work in the very distressing social atmosphere of Calcutta, an
example of devotion to the interests of humanity that is hard to
equal.
There is really no further word that I could add, because her
good works speak for themselves. They are the most eloquent
testimony that one could imagine for the devotion she has
shown for a great humanitarian and religious purpose. So we
have much pleasure in joining with the expression of congratulations made by Senator Haidasz on this very important
humanitarian award.

NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
CONGRATULATIONS TO MOTHER TERESA, CALCUTTA, INDIA

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, we were happy to
learn that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded to
Mother Teresa the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize.
Mother Teresa, a humble Roman Catholic nun, bas shown
great humanitarianism, and has given hope and inspiration by
her untiring sacrifice to bring solace to the poor and afflicted.
This heroine of the Calcutta gutters has demonstrated that
health and food for the sick are basic human rights, without
which real and universal peace is not possible.
In expressing our great satisfaction on this auspicious occasion, I move, seconded by Senator Hays:
That the Honourable the Speaker convey the congratulations of the Senate of Canada to Mother Teresa on
being awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, along with
our hopes and prayers for her continued success and
perseverance in this commendable work for mankind.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, on behalf of all of us
who sit on this side of the house I should like to say how much
we appreciate the thoughtfulness of Senator Haidasz and
Senator Hays in presenting this motion to the house.

[Translation]
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I rise to speak on a
different yet related subject which also concerns the contribution of women in all spheres of human activity.
This morning, in the Senate antechamber, the Canadian
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs
marked the 50th anniversary of the decision rendered by the
judicial committee of the Privy Council to the effect that the
word "persons", under section 24 of the British North America Act, encompassed persons of both sexes and that consequently women were eligible for Senate appointment.
It is somewhat ironic that this should have been discovered
only 50 years ago. But the occasion deserved to be marked and
deserves to be marked in this special way in the Senate today.
Last week, Senators Bielish and Quart drew our attention to
that important anniversary. A plaque, in the Senate antechamber, bears the names of the five Alberta women: Mrs. H. M.
Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Emily Murphy
and Irene Partby, who took their case to the Privy Council.
In retrospect, it is unfortunate that not one of them was ever
called to the Senate but it can be pointed out that, as early as
the following year, that is in 1930, the Honourable Cairine
Wilson took ber seat in this place, and that her bust stands
close to the commemorative plaque I have just mentioned.
Since that time, several distinguished women have been and
still are members of the Senate. The first francophone woman
to be called to the Senate was Mrs. Marianna Jodoin whose
bust also stands in the antechamber.
It was recalled that Senator Muriel Fergusson-and I can
see her now in the gallery-was the first woman to preside

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

over the Senate. She was followed by Senator Renaude
Lapointe. Indeed, both did the Senate proud, assuming with
singular distinction the responsibility of Speaker of the Senate.
The present Prime Minister-and in that regard I must
concede he does not differ much from the former-has proved,
concretely, many a time, his intention of giving the women of
Canada their rightful place in the various government institutions. I underline, amongst others, the appointment of Mrs.
Jean Wadds to the position of High Commissioner in London.
As Minister of Justice, I had the pleasure of announcing the
appointment of Justice Claire l'Heureux-Dubé to the Quebec
Court of Appeal, the first woman ever to sit on that court.
I am convinced that, as time goes by, more and more women
will assume the role that is rightfully theirs in every sphere of
endeavour, their contribution and their participation becoming
increasingly important and necessary everywhere.

[English]
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, today is a notable
day for a number of reasons. First of all, I want to associate
myself and the official opposition with the remarks and sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Government respecting
the very important anniversary being marked today. Together
with him, I welcome the presence in our gallery of a former
Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable Muriel Fergusson, the
Honourable Thérèse Casgrain, and other former lady senators.
I note the presence in our chamber still of Senator Renaude
Lapointe, who served us so very well as Speaker of the Senate,
and I also wish to extend congratulations to those women who
have been appointed to this chamber recently. All of us extend
congratulations to those newly appointed to this chamberafter all, regardless of whether they be men or women, they
are all "persons."
Senator Quart acquainted us with the history behind the
change in our Constitution 50 years ago when women were
regarded finally as persons in the eyes of the law. I recommend
to all senators the useful intervention of our colleague Senator
Quart, which is found on page 29 of Senate Hansard of
October 10, 1979. She summarized the situation very well in
its historical perspective.
This is, indeed, a significant day to recognize. It may seem
ludicrous to us in this day and age to think of women-such as
those distinguished persons who grace this chamber as women
senators, and those honoured by plaques and other forms of
recognition on Parliament Hill-as anything other than persons in the eyes of the law in our Constitution, but it is true
that only 50 years ago there was considerable doubt about the
matter. Indeed, you do not have to go very far back in the
history of common law to find women being regarded merely
as chattels, as the personal property of their husbands. Well,
thank goodness our society and our law have today progressed
far beyond that sort of attitude. We owe a debt of gratitude to
the people of years gone by, especially the pioneer women of
this country, who worked so diligently to launch us on that
course of progress.

* (1410)

While we take satisfaction in the fact that these positive
changes took place 50 years ago, and in other ways since that
time, let us not forget that the struggle goes on. In that regard
I commend the government for the appointment of a woman
judge in the province of Quebec, as announced in this chamber
this afternoon by the distinguished Minister of Justice.
There are many examples that one can think of where our
laws and practices still tend to discriminate unfairly against
women, and we must all be as diligent and conscientious as
those pioneers who went before us to attack these modern-day
discrepancies where we find them. Today's anniversary serves
as a good reminder of how far we have come, and we celebrate
that, but also as a reminder of how far we have yet to go, and
we renew ourselves today to carry on with that job. Is it not
significant, honourable senators, that the very day that we
honour and remember a milestone on the Canadian historical
calendar of human rights, a very great woman, Mother Teresa,
has been accorded the Nobel Peace Prize for her magnificent
work.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: Could there be any more tangible evidence of the great contribution, the superb abilities-yes, and
the compassion which have been brought to bear on human
problems by women? Here we have Mother Teresa, whose
work for humanity and the problems confronting all mankind
goes far beyond mere religious or racial considerations and
extends to all "mankind" and "womankind," all "persons" and
people.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I be permitted, as I believe
honourable senators would wish me so to do, to report to the
Senate, on this very important occasion in the history of the
Senate, that 1, on your behalf, attended the ceremonies this
morning in our antechamber. I am sure honourable senators
would wish me to report to them the admiration of all those
who were present of the initiative taken by the former Speaker, Senator Lapointe, in organizing and arranging this very
important occasion in the history of this chamber and in the
history of Canada.
I would like to point out, if I may at this time, that not only
is the Honourable Muriel Fergusson here-I still call her
Senator Fergusson, and I think we all do-but with her is Dr.
Geraldine M. Farmer, First Vice-President of the Canadian
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, who
participated in this interesting and exciting ceremony this
morning.
Senator Flynn: And also Madame Casgrain.
The Hon. the Speaker: I also had the privilege just before 1
took the Chair of having a chat with Senator Casgrain, who is
beloved by all of us and by Canadians everywhere.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, ail of us in this
chamber, regardless of party affiliation, deeply regret the
decision taken by Senator Langlois, and no one regrets it more
than the Leader of the Opposition. From the day I came to
this place, Léopold Langlois has been of inestimable assistance. You will not find in any Senate rule book a list of the
qualities that make a great parliamentarian. Those of us who
have been in politics for some time are aware of that fact. We
know that you cannot codify qualities of ability, loyalty,
dedication, inspiration and judgment, which are invaluable in
the life of any political party, whether it serves in opposition or
in government. Senator Langlois has brought ail of these
qualities to this chamber, and I suggest that his loss to us will
be significant in the sense that his skills will not be available to
us on the same day-to-day basis as has been the case during his
time as deputy leader and house leader.
I can tell honourable senators that there have been at least
four occasions in the past two years, because of pressing
personal reasons-and senators have some knowledge of some
of those reasons-when Senator Langlois has come to me and
stated, "It is my desire to resign." I must say that 1, together
with some of my other colleagues, prevailed upon him to stay
on as deputy a little longer in order to assist us, because we
needed him. I should tell you that the personal burdens and
challenges which he has borne, in addition to his responsibilitics as deputy leader and house leader for the Liberal Party in
this place, have, at times, been enormous, and would have been
too much for anyone of only normal ability and temperament.
We are going to miss him. His shoes will be very large shoes
to fill.
[Translation]
I am sure I am expressing the feelings of ail the honourable
senators as I sincerely thank Senator Léopold Langlois for his
great contribution to the Senate. As deputy leader, he has
been of great help to me. It is quite comforting to know that
we will still be able to use his great talents as a parliamentarian in the Senate.
[English]
Senator Walker: Honourable senators, I want to pay my
tribute to Léopold Langlois. He is a great veteran of the Royal
Canadian NavyHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Walker: -who had a very distinguished naval
career, ending up as the captain of a corvette engaged in active
service. He is a great navy man and a typical navy man. He
has that bonhomie, that good nature and that happy camaraderie which we al] like so much and which make him a very
remarkable senator.
[Senator Flynn.]

October 18, 1979

He is the leader of a group from the navy who are in the
Senate today, including Andy Thompson who, under the command of Senator Langlois, lost his finger when he forgot to
withdraw it at the proper time just as a shell was being fired.
Then there is Paul Lafond, who won the Distinguished
Flying Cross when, singlehandedly, flying his aircraft he sank
a German submarine. He is here today, and we should pay
tribute to him.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Walker: Léon Balcer served with the retiring
deputy leader, and whether or not he served with distinctionand I am sure he must have-he too is part of that group of
wonderful French Canadians whom we aIl very much respect.
Then there is Senator Quart's son, Gerry, who also served
under our retiring deputy leader.
Finally, there is Dan Lang, a great friend of the deputy
leader, who had a very distinguished career as the commanding officer of a motor torpedo boat in the North Sea. Sometimes, when you get a little wine into Dan, you can get him to
tell you some of his stories.
This aIl leads me to mention how much goodwill we have,
and how we are united in this chamber, above aIl other places,
with French Canadians. We love them because of their qualities and not necessarily because they are French Canadian.
We have great camaraderie and, on this side of the house, we
appreciate more than I can say the fact that we have individuais like Senator Langlois holding positions such as the one he
has held with such distinction for so long. He succeeded even
when Paul Martin was the able Leader of the Government,
and how he did that I will never know, but he got along with
him and he smiled the way he is smiling now. For a long time,
I think his bête noire was the present Leader of the Government in the Senate. They are a couple of French Canadians
who rubbed each other the wrong way, but only in connection
with politics.
I extend best wishes to him on behalf of ail senators. We are
very proud of him and we will seldom have his like again.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I trust that the position I occupy today, next to the Leader of the Government in
the Senate, entitles me to add something to what Senator
Walker has so well said about our friend Senator Langlois.
When I was asked to take this post, one of the things that
encouraged me to do so was the knowledge that I had been to
a good "school." By that I mean that for some time I had my
seat on the other side of the house when Senator Langlois was
running our affairs from this side of the house. I dare say that
from time to time I might have been described as a bit of a
nuisance, but he always treated me with such courtesy and
with such an evident desire to respond to any legitimate
requests I had-and I guess some of them were illegitimateand to be helpful in the conduct of my duties that I felt there
was a good example for anyone who undertook to do a job of
this kind.

SENATE DEBATES

October 18, 1979

I was even more encouraged when I realized that when
sitting here I would be sitting directly opposite him. As I have
already said to him privately, I kept an eye on him because,
when he went like this, moving his head up and down, I knew I
was probably doing it right; and when he went like that,
shaking his head from side to side, I had an idea there was
something wrong. I do not know which seat in this chamber
my friend will occupy in the future, but I hope it will not be
too far away from his present one because I am still going to
keep an eye on him. I have a lot to learn from him, and I
appreciate the helpful attitude be has always displayed
towards me.
I am not entirely sure that I am going to equal his record of
sitting in this chair for two Parliaments. That is an enviable
record, and, in recent years, the Conservative Party has not
been able to equal a record of that kind-that is, considering
the number of years involved, not the number of Parliaments-but I hope that when I do relinquish this task I will do
so with the sarne confidence and feelings of satisfaction in a
job well done that I know my honourable friend is entitled to
enjoy today.
I join with all other senators in expressing our appreciation
for the work be has done for the Senate and for Canada, and
wish him well in the many good things that I know be is going
to do in the future.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I am going to fire
my last broadside from the position I now occupy, but I can
assure you that it will be a very gentle and soft one. The only
words I can use to express my heartfelt feelings at this time
are: Thank you; thank you very much for everything.

reports, and according to official U.S. documents, there was no
firm position on this issue taken by Canada before the end of
August. The first official statement from Canada came in an
aide-mémoire delivered to the United States on September 28,
the very last day, honourable senators, upon which submissions
could be received by the U.S. government.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Question.
Senator Perrault: The question is: What was the reason for
this four-month delay? Certainly, we are all too well aware of
the fact that the government ministers were not occupied with
meeting Parliament during that long period of time.
Senator Flynn: What is the question?
Senator Perrault: If the minister pleads that Foothills itself
was changing its proposals, what exactly was the nature of
these alleged changes? Were they technical alterations, or did
they affect the substance of Foothills' plan? Secondly,Senator Flynn: I thought it was fifthly.
Senator Perrault: I know honourable senators realize the
importance of these questions.
Senator Marshall: Is this a speech or a question?
Senator Perrault: Despite the government's claims that they
kept reassuring the Americans all along in informal meetings
that Canada backed the Foothills project, the U.S. government
officially noted on August 24 that Canada had notSenator Smith (Colchester): Question!
Senator Perrault: My remarks constitute a question.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Question!
Senator Perrault: The panic that appears in the honourable
senator's eyes indicates his embarrassment at the question.
Senator Flynn: Of the questioner.

QUESTION PERIOD
ENERGY
MOVEMENT OF OIL FROM ALASKA TO LOWER FORTY-EIGHT
STATES-WITHDRAWAL OF APPLICATION BY FOOTHILLS PIPE
LINES LTD.

Senator Perrault: I have a question for the minister responsible for economic development.
Mr. Minister, I should like to pursue the question of this
government's support, or lack of support, of the Foothills oil
pipeline project, which was shelved by the company earlier this
week, threatening Canadian job opportunities and raising the
spectre of heavy oil tanker traffic off the west coast of Canada.
I still have had no satisfactory explanation with respect to the
merits of the west coast tanker route which appear to exist in
the mind of at least one of the minister's ministerial
colleagues.
Here in the Senate, as in the other place, we have heard
some passionate words from government ministers, protesting
their support of Foothills, but their action or inaction speaks
much louder than their purple prose. According to press
80072-8

Senator Perrault: There was a delay of at least three months
by this government, as confirmed by the United States. As for
the last month in question, from August 24 to September 28,
can the ministerSenator Flynn: Come on!
Senator Perrault: Can the minister give us details of the
representations made by Canada to the United States, so that
we can judge for ourselves how strenuous and how specific
they were? We got the list of meetings earlier today from the
Prime Minister in the other place. What we want from this
minister is a report on the content of these meetings. What did
Canada say? And no equivocation, please.
Senator Flynn: After what you said?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, I might have to
await Hansard to read the details of your questions to be able
to remember them all.
Senator Perrault: I should be delighted to repeat them.
Senator Flynn: We would not agree to hear you again.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator de Cotret: I will make my statement very clearly,
and appropriately to the point. We have backed the Foothills
proposal, as 1 indicated yesterday. We have backed the Foothills proposal throughout. We have backed the Foothills proposal since we took office. There have been, according to the
question, a number of claims and counterclaims, and I am not
about to engage in a discussion of what is reported in the press.
I might just underline, however, the declaration reported in the
press this morning by the Foothills company itself, which
indicates that in no way did it find the government lacking in
support for that project.
It is a project that, from a number of points of view,
provided the most significant benefit to Canada. From the
economic point of view, from the point of view of job creation
and from the point of view of the environment, it was by far,
out of the alternatives that were placed before us, the project
that was the most encouraging. The Government of Canada
never hesitated, either in informal discussions throughout the
summer with our counterparts in the United States or through
the formal aide-mémoire, to indicate strongly that the Foothills project had the full blessing and full support of the
government, and that the government concurred in the carrying out of that project.
Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question. Would the
minister advise this house whether the government endorsed
the withdrawal of the project before the National Energy
Board hearings in Vancouver?
Senator de Cotret: I do not think we are in a position, as a
government, to endorse or repudiate any such decision that is
being taken. As I indicated yesterday, it was a surprise to us
when the decision was taken. I should only like to underline
once again that, as far as we understand it, the decision to
withdraw was a decision to withdraw temporarily. We certainly hope that the company wili re-introduce a proposal by the
end of the month, or shortly thereafter. It was a surprise to the
government. It was not something that had been discussed,
and certainly it is something that we deeply regret.
Senator Oison: I have a further supplementary question. Is
the government aware of what Foothills* senior officers, in
particular Mr. Phillips, describe as the "strategic advantage"
for a withdrawal at that lime? Was the government aware of
that before it happened; and if so, would he explain what is the
strategic advantage to Canada of withdrawing an application
that is obviously endorsed by the government?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, I can only repeat
what I have said. You ask if we were aware of the advantage
of the "strategic" considerations before the fact. I have just
answered to your previous question that the decision by Foothills to withdraw was a decision that was a surprise to the
government. By the same token, we were certainly not aware
of any strategic considerations that the company, Foothills,
may have been considering at the time of the withdrawal.
Senator Oison: As a final supplementary, I have to say that
this is really no answer at all.
Senator Flynn: It was no question at al].
[Senator Flynn.]

October 18, 1979

Senator Oison: The government says, on the one side, that it
fully supports it, and then says, on the other side, that it did
not even have sufficient communications with Foothills to
know they were going to withdraw.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Question!
Senator Oison: Have there been no communications with
Foothills? I asked the question very clearly.
Senator de Cotret: And I think I answered the question very
clearly. The question was whether or not Foothills had
explained to us beforehand what those "strategic" considerations were. I answered it very clearly. The answer is no. The
answer is that the Foothills decision was one that was a
surprise to this government. I answered questions on that
asked in this chamber yesterday, and questions asked by the
honourable senator earlier today.
Senator Oison: A final supplementary.
Senator Flynn: I hope so.
Senator Oison: Would the minister undertake to find out
from Foothills what those strategic advantage considerations
are'? There are words that are being bandied about and they
don't give any explanation for il. If he can find out why it is
good for Canada, we would like to know.
Senator Flynn: Why don't you go and ask?
Senator Lamontagne: He is not the government.
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator is asking me to
find out from Foothills what is best for Canada. I don't think il
is appropriate for the Government of Canada to ask a company like Foothills what is good in the interests of Canada. If
there are strategic reasons for their withdrawal, I am sure they
will be brought to the attention of the government in due
course.
Senator Oison: I think they would answer you quicker than
they would me.
Senator Argue: I have a supplementary question. In view of
the stated support by the government for the Foothills pipeline
route, would the minister say whether the government will be
making strong representations to President Carter in support
of this route, assuming a re-application will be made, when the
President comes to Canada? Will he assure us that Canada
will be doing everything possible to make certain that the
dangerous route on the Pacific west coast is not followed?
Senator Flynn: Of course.
e (1450)

Senator de Cotret: There is absolutely no question. I should
like to note, however, that the honourable senator's question is
hypothetical.
Senator Oison: The President is coming, for sure.
Senator de Cotret: The President is coming, for sure; and,
for sure, we will be having discussions with the President; and,
for sure, we will be talking about energy. In that context,
honourable senators, if the question of Foothills comes up and

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

if at that time Foothills has reinstated its application, our
position will be the same.
We have studied-as the prior government did, no doubt,
and I would certainly hope so-in great detail the various
alternatives to move this oil; and there is no question, as I
mentioned before, that from our point of view the proposal
that is of greatest importance and significance to Canada, both
in terms of economic benefits and in terms of environmental
benefits, is the Foothills proposal. So, if the proposal is before
the decision makers at that point, both in Canada and the
United States, we obviously will re-emphasize and reiterate
our full support for that proposal.
Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I appreciate the minister's answer. My question, then, is obviously one that follows.
Does the government expect, in view of its position and in view
of everything it knows must follow that position, that there will
be in fact an application before the board at the time of the
President's visit? I think it is certainly clear that this is
absolutely essential to the welfare of Canada.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, my understanding
at the moment is that the company expects to reintroduce its
proposal by the end of the month. That is my understanding.
Should that change, I shall be happy to communicate that fact
to honourable senators, and also perhaps to shed light on the
reasons underlying any change in corporate position.
Senator van Roggen: I have a supplementary for the minister. Has the government given consideration to Canada's
supplying the landlocked Northern Tier refineries with additional oil to look after their pressing needs for sweet oil in the
shorter term, so that pressure on the United States to go ahead
with the building of the Northern Tier line will be removed,
while we can take the longer view on the overland route from
Alaska-the minister knowing that there are not yet the
reserves discovered in Alaska to support that line-and,
indeed, by that mechanism, have the opportunity of bringing
Beaufort Sea oil, Canadian oil, down the Dempster lateral,
which is so important as a part of that?
It seems to me that one of the only ways that Canada can
indeed persuade the United States to bide its time for the
Foothills route is to be forthcoming with some solution for
those northern refineries. I am interested in knowing whether
Canada has given consideration to that possibility.
Senator de Cotret: Your specific question, senator, I will
have to refer to my colleague, the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources, to ascertain the extent to which consideration
has been given such a proposal.
My understanding of that situation is that the President of
the United States is bound to make a recommendation to
Congress on the situation by, I believe, December 6, but I
stand to be corrected on that. That is my understanding. I am
not sure to what extent we can actually bide our time in terms
of the decision, but I should be happy to discuss it with the
Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.
Senator van Roggen: Your government is now showing a lot
more dispatch in this matter than it was this summer when

Mr. Hnatyshyn, as I recall, some time in August, said you had
not made a decision as to what you would support. So, I am
suggesting that between now and the President's visit, which is
only three weeks from now, the government should get on with
its decisions in these matters and it should corne up with some
firm proposals for the Americans, or the ball game is over so
far as a Canadian pipeline is concerned.
Senator de Cotret: In terms of the allegation you make,
senator, I point out to you that the government, since June 6,
has on eight occasions-eight occasions-explained its position
on the pipeline situation to American officials. So it has been
made abundantly clear from two days after we assumed power,
and throughout the period, what our preference was. And it
was concluded by the official aide-mémoire, which was
required by that date, and which was actually filed by that
date.
So I do not think that you can suggest that this government
has in any way shirked its responsibilities-or hesitated, for
that matter-in respect to indicating a position which does not
really require a tremendous amount of analysis. I think that
when you look at the three alternatives, even summarily, it
becomes quite obvious that the economic benefits to Canada
and the environmental benefits to Canada derive from an
overland route.
Senator van Roggen: Was the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources misquoted in the press in August, prior to your
aide-mémoire's being delivered to the United States on the
very last day on which it could be delivered?
Senator Perrault: I have a supplementary in relation to that.
Here we have a message from the minister today suggesting
that there was clear-sighted, strong resolve to support this
Foothills project throughout the summer. Yet on August 23and I quote from the transcript-the Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources stated:
Well, I think the position that we are taking as a new
government is that we are going to review the alternatives
and I simply think it is premature to indicate a position on
the matter now.
How can you have it both ways, Mr. Minister? How can you
say on the one hand, "We had this strong position throughout
the summer months? We knew where we were going," and
how can the minister, on August 23, suggest there could be
alternatives; there could be reasons to abandon this proposal
entirely? That is the clear implication of this quotation.
Senator Smith (Colchester): That is your implication.
Senator de Cotret: That is your implication from the quotation, senator. If you remember the facts, at that point there
were changes made in the Foothills proposal, and the minister
was suggesting that there was no third government preference
in terms of the old Foothills proposal and the new Foothills
proposal.
The question of backing an overland route was never in
question. It was just a question of which of the two proposals-the new or the old-the government preferred. That was

SENATE DEBATES
the question under review. And I think that is fully consistent
with our position.
We are not having it both ways. We have had it one way ail
the way, and our position has been very clear from the outset.
Senator Perrault: Why was it necessary, then, to go down to
the last agonizing moment, the final day that submissions were
required by the United States? Why did it take that long?
Why did it take so long for the government to decide which
option it would choose?
Senator Smith (Colchester): No, it did not take that long
for the government to decide.
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my information, starting
two days after this goveriment took power we made our
position clear to the United States, and we repeated that
position over those two months, or two-and-a-half months,
seven times. i do not feel that the fact that we submitted the
official aide-mémoire on the date on which it was requested is
in any way an indication that we waited to the last minute to
indicate our preference.
Senator Smith (Colchester): The leader does not want to
confuse the President.
Senator van Roggen: Before this matter is closed, honourable senators-I would not like the heat of this exchange to
obscure the question, and I understand the minister will need
to consult the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources-i
would be interested in hearing any concrete proposais that
the government has formulated for presentation to the President to preserve a Canadian position so that the recommendation of the American agencies to go via the Northern Tier
route is not the only choice left to the United States. That
seems to rest in Canadian hands, and some imaginative proposais will have to be forthcoming.
I appreciate the fact that you would not have that at your
fingertips.
Senator de Cotret: As i undertook to do, I will discuss this
matter with the Minister of Energy, and I shall be more than
happy to report back as soon as possible on this matter.
Senator Steuart: I have a further supplementary on this
matter. I heard the talk in the other place today and I heard
the talk here, and Mr. Hnatyshyn, in making his statement at
that time, did not imply there was a change in the position of
the government because there had been a change in the
application, or a change in the route, or some big change by
Foothilis.
What were those changes? From my following of this
subject, the route was still overland, and there were no tankers
involved. What were these dramatic changes that suddenly
made the Minister of Energy sort of hesitate-and, in fact,
withdraw publicly the government's support for this route?
What were the changes?
0 (1500)
Senator de Cotret: I would be happy to indicate exactly the
changes that were made in the Foothills proposal, but certainly
[Senator de Cotret.]

October 18, 1979

when the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources said that
the matter was still under review, as i indicated in my answer
to the Leader of the Opposition, it was very much with respect
to the reviewing of the changes that had been made in the
Foothills proposal. That is why, along the lines you mentioned,
I suggested our position never changed. We were always in
favour of an all-land route because, as I mentioned earlier, it is
of economic and environmental benefit to Canada. That position has never changed.
INDUSTRY
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, further to my questions
yesterday concerning the enormous deficit in the automotive
industry, i have a question for the minister responsible for
economic development.
The Minister of Regional Economic Expansion said earlier
today that a meeting is going to be held soon to discuss with
the President of General Motors the reasons behind GM's
decision not to proceed with the construction of a new plant in
Quebec. Since the meeting is to involve Senator de Cotret, can
the minister say if the Government of Canada has, as of now,
formulated any specific proposais to take to that meeting and,
if so, could the minister advise us as to what they are?
Senator de Cotret: I would be happy to elaborate further on
the meeting with the President of General Motors. However,
let me say, first of ail, that this meeting was agreed to between
him and me while I visited with businessmen in Toronto
approximately two weeks ago. We agreed to meet later on this
month to discuss an aluminum foundry which they contemplated constructing, and to allow him the opportunity of
bringing us in government up-to-date as to where that decision
was in terms of their corporate plans.
I might elaborate somewhat upon that. The proposal to
build a $650 million aluminum foundry in Quebec was first
raised approximately a year and a half ago by the corporation.
They approached the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec at that time for some financial assistance
should they decide to build in an area designated by DREE.
The government at the time agreed. At that point the proposal
was for a foundry costing between $400 millon and $425
million. Offers of financial assistance from both governments
were forthcoming. However, this spring General Motors decided not to proceed with the project, so the offers expired.
In early July GM came back to the Government of Canada
and the Government of Quebec and told us they wished to
reconsider the location-the possible location-of the aluminum foundry and asked the federal government whether it
would support through DREE, and the Government of Quebec
whether it would support through the mechanisms it has at its
disposal, the establishment of a foundry that would now cost
$650 million. We responded, as you are aware, in the positive.
That decision was communicated to the company on July 17
or 18, and was good for three months. The company has now
advised us that they do not seek an extension to the proposai,

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

not because théy have decided to put the aluminum foundry
some place else, but because the decision itself on whether or
not the company would move with an aluminum foundry has
not been made, and they do not expect it to be made in the
near future.

which have a say in it. That is the state of that particular
situation at this time.

In the interim, they have found other mechanisms, particularly increased use of diesel motors and other products,
primarily plastics, in the construction of automobiles to allow
them to meet the energy conservation guidelines that have
been set. As you will appreciate, moving to aluminum is a
major change in technology for the company. It is not a
question of their relocating the aluminum foundry at one of
their other sites, but rather a question of their postponing the
decision on whether to move to new technology at all.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

We are still planning to meet with the officials from General
Motors to discuss the matter more fully. We are concerned
about the geographic imbalance of the automobile industry in
Canada, and I can assure honourable senators that this government will be actively pursuing discussions with General
Motors and other automobile manufacturers to ensure a
proper geographic balance of the industry in Canada.
INDUCEMENTS TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT

Senator Bosa: A supplementary question. In view of the
concern expressed, particularly in the United States, about the
so-called "bidding" among various levels of government to
attract industry, especially the automobile industry, can the
minister say what the federal government's response will be on
this very delicate question of international and interprovincial
trade?
Senator de Cotret: In terms of location bids, that is an issue
that has been of some concern to me since assuming office. I
can report to the Senate that I have had several meetings with
the American ambassador, at which we brought up the question of competing bids from various states in the United
States, various provinces in Canada and various municipalities,
to attract major investments, not only by the automobile
industry but other areas of industrial activity.
It is a practice that is deplored by my government and
deplored, I believe, by the Government of the United States.
However, the complexity of the matter is considerable since it
involves a great number of states and all the Canadian provinces. In many ways, it is a mug's game, a game in which you
really do not win in the long run. You can attract some
industries and yet lose others when a government offers them
significant subsidies to relocate.
So the question is tabled. It is under active review by our
officials at both levels, but it is a very complex question since it
involves at least 48 states, 10 provinces and two territories. As
you can imagine, there are different jurisdictions involved

FOREIGN AID POLICY OF GOVERNMENT

[Translation]
Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I would like to
put a question to the Minister of State-I do not know how to
call him-who for the time being is responsible for CIDA.
Before I go on, I would like to tell the minister that in spite of
the cold he wanted to give me during his speech yesterday, my
voice is still pretty good.
Senator Asselin: I am very happy for you.
Senator Lamontagne: I understand the minister is now
ready to answer questions in this house about external affairs
and national defence. But before he takes on his new responsibilities I would like to ask him, in his capacity as Minister of
State for CIDA, whether he is a real minister or a half
minister or particularly whether he was perhaps promoted to
deputy minister.
In other words, is he really in charge of the external aid of
the Government of Canada in all its aspects, including the
general direction of the policy in that field, or is he only an
official responsible for carrying out the decisions of the Secretary of State for External Affairs?
Senator Asselin: To answer my colleague's question, I will
table the order in council confirming my appointment as
Minister of State for CIDA.
Senator Lamontagne: That does not answer my question
directly because I would like to know whether the minister is
entirely responsible and whether he is also responsible for
defining the general direction of Canada's external aid policy.
Senator Asselin: The honourable senator should read over
the speech I made yesterday concerning external aid; he will
find all the answers in it.
Senator Lamontagne: Since the minister is telling us he is
entirely responsible for that sector of policy, I would like to ask
him whether he drafted the speech made by the Secretary of
State for External Affairs in Toronto on October 4 last, and
whether the Secretary of State for External Affairs did indeed
read the speech the minister wrote for her.
Senator Asselin: That is a question I will have to put to the
Secretary of State for External Affairs. I will have to take that
question as notice. I will ask her for an explanation and give an
answer later.
Senator Lamontagne: I want to ask a supplementary question: At the same time could the minister give another answer
and say how he can reconcile the speech made by the Secre-

SENATE DEBATES
tary of State for External Affairs in Toronto to announce her
new policy in external affairs, how he can reconcile that new
policy to help friends outside Canada and the statement made
by Parliament's spokesman, Mr. Douglas Roche, a member of
the other place, who in a speech delivered before the United
Nations in New York said that from now on the United
Nations would have to make a fresh start so as to eliminate
poverty in Third World countries by the year 2000, adding:
e

(1510)

[English]
Committing ourselves to this common obligation reaching
beyond all national frontiers and power structures[Translation]
It is now a question of helping only those nations we like and
those that are rich.
[English]
-could well provide a fresh start for the last two decades
of the century.
[Translation]
If the minister is ready to answer today, how can he
reconcile the statement made by the Secretary of State for
External Affairs with the other made by Mr. Roche?
Senator Asselin: Mr. Roche asked all governments extending foreign aid to help those nations to develop their economies. This has been the program of al] governments in the
past, and it is still that of this government.
Senator Lamontagne: You should read again the speech
made by the Secretary of State for External Affairs.
Senator Asselin: I already have.

CONSUMER AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS
POSSIBLE PROSECUTION OF WESTERN TRANSPORTATION
ASSOCIATION-RESPONSIBILITIES OF ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
CANADA UNDER COMBINES INVESTIGATION ACT

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Justice. In answer to my question yesterdayThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I hesitate to
intervene, but a problem has arisen due to the number of
senators who rise from time to time to ask questions. There are
some who continue the practice of catching my eye, and I have
indicated to them from time to time that they have caught my
eye, but at the same time that they rise, other honourable
senators, who are not aware that I have indicated to another
senator that he will have the floor next, rise to ask questions.
Under the rules, it is my responsibility, subject to appeal to the
house, to indicate the senator who, in my opinion, has risen
first.
Senator Everett: I am happy to defer to Senator Frith, Mr.
Speaker, provided that I follow immediately after.
Senator Frith: I thank my colleague, Senator Everett, and
you, Mr. Speaker.
[Senator Lamontagne.]

October 18, 1979

Yesterday, in a question posed to the Minister of Justice, I
asked whether the Director of Investigation and Research had,
under section 15 of the Combines Investigation Act, made a
recommendation as to prosecution in the Western Transportation Association case.
It was my impression that he had not answered my question,
but I had to study Hansard to be sure that he had not. In
fairness to him, there were other questions included in that
exchange.
I would now like to ask him very precisely whether or not
the report referred to him by the Director of Investigation in
that case under section 15 did contain a recommendation as to
whether or not there should be a prosecution.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, since yesterday I have
reflected on the line of questioning by Senator Frith as il
relates to my responsibilities as Attorney General. I have very
grave doubts about the ethics of this line of questioning at a
time when I have to consider a problem in relation to which I
have to make a decision of a quasi-judicial nature. If I were to
discuss matters of that kind with the honourable senator in the
form that he puts his question, it could compromise the case
for the Crown or the defence.
I can file as an appendix to Hansard a general policy
statement with regard to matters concerning the Combines
Investigation Act as it relates to the duties of the Attorney
General of Canada. I could recite that policy, if it is the wish
of Senator Frith that I do so. But for me to tell the honourable
senator everything that goes through my mind in considering a
given problem would be a very dangerous process.
I am a bit like a judge who, having a case under advisement,
receives a telephone call from someone like Senator Frith who
tells him what his views are.
An Hon. Senator: Some phone call!
Senator Flynn: I do not intend to be dragged into that type
of exercise. I hope that Senator Frith will understand, once
and for all, that when I make my decision, I will do so in
accordance with what I consider to be my responsibility, and it
will be my responsibility alone. Once I have made my decision,
he may then question me as long and as often as he wishes,
and in any manner that he wishes. In the meantime, I do not
intend to prejudice either the case of the Crown or any possible
defendants by going into details of the situation at this point.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, leaving aside the question of ethics that was raised and dealing directly with the
responsibility of the minister, he knows very well his function
is not a quasi-judicial or judicial function. I have prosecuted
cases for the Crown under this act, and I can tell the minister
that there is no compromise whatsoever in saying whether or
not a prosecution has been recommended. I am not asking the
minister for the details. As interesting as it might be, I am not
interested, and I do not think the people of this country are
interested, in what goes on in that mind, but, to gel back to the
question asked yesterday, and asked again today, they might
be interested in knowing whether or not the Director of
Investigation recommended prosecution.

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

The minister is still free to carry on with ail of those things
in his mind after he has answered that question. Did the
Director of Investigation recommend prosecution, or did he
not?
Senator Flynn: I cannot answer that question because I do
not know.
Senator Frith: You do not know?
Senator Flynn: No.
Senator Frith: You do not know whether or not prosecution
was recommended?
Senator Flynn: No.
Senator Frith: Have you read the report?
Senator Flynn: The meeting was to apprise me of the
investigation that had been conducted. If I recall correctly, I
received no specific recommendation as to that matter. But,
again, the honourable senator should realize that by inviting
me to reply to this, he could be prejudicing the case of any
defendants or perhaps the case of the Crown in the event that I
would say "yes" or "no" to the recommendation that is made
to me. That is probably too difficult for him to understand. He
knows so much.

Senator Lamontagne: Don't get into that. Answer the
question.
Senator Flynn: Weil, I would like you to rise and put a
question to me. You are ignorant as far as this matter is
concerned, so stay put and mind your own business.
[Translation]
Senator Lamontagne: Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of
privilege. I would like to say to the Leader of the Government
that he was not the one who gave me my medals or my
academic degrees.
Senator Flynn: I would not have been able to do so.
Senator Lamontagne: Moreover, I can tell him that I was a
member of an inquiry commission to review the Combines
Investigation Act and that I may be more familiar with it than
he is.
Senator Flynn: You have probably forgotten it completely.

(1520)

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I understand that the
Minister of Justice would rather I asked him another question,
but let us dispose of that one first. The reference that is made
under section 15 is normally made by way of a written report
by the Director. Was there such a written report in this case?
Senator Flynn: I will not answer that question again. But I
wili say that section 15 provides that:
(1) The Director may, at any stage of an inquiry, and
in addition to or in lieu of continuing the inquiry, remit
any records, returns or evidence to the Attorney General
of Canada for consideration as to whether an offence has
been or is about to be committed against this Act, and for

such action as the Attorney General of Canada may be
pleased to take.
He may also ask to appoint and instruct counsel to assist
him in any inquiry. But, as I said, I am not able to say whether
I was asked to instruct counsel to assist or whether there was a
final and formal determination as to whether some charges
were to be laid. But again, I am referring to the law, and I am
offering to give the honourable senator, or I may recite it to
him, the record as far as the provisions of the Combines
Investigation Act and the responsibilities of the Solicitor General are concerned. I am willing to table that, or to recite it. I
don't mind. I am willing to lecture the honourable senator, if
he wants that, and possibly also Senator Lamontagne, since he
saidSenator Frith: So you will not answer the question.
Senator Flynn: What question? I have answered. I said I
would not tell. That is an answer. Do you understand what
"no" means? There is another one-word answer-it has three
letters.
Senator Frith: To quote one of the favourite phrases of the
Minister of Justice when he is asked for information, and
about the lecture he proposes to give, "in due course."
However, let us get back to the question. I will insist, and
you might as well know that I am going to keep coming back
to the question, and the question is: Was there such a recommendation? I am not asking what the recommendation was,
but was there such a recommendation, a recommendation as to
whether there should be a prosecution, or not? I take it you
saw the report. Surely it is not that you cannot remember. Do
I understand that to be the case, or are you just not going to
tell me or anybody else, for that matter, whether there was or
was not such a recommendation? Because, honourable senator,
that is very relevant to the other questions that you have
invited me to ask-and those are about the famous or, as it is
sometimes called, the infamous meeting. Now in order to ask
about the famous or infamous meeting, I would like to know
whether there was such a recommendation one way or the
other, and certainly I will leave this question if what you are
saying is, "I shall not tell you." Is that what you are saying?
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Frith: AIl right. So now we know about freedom.
How sweet it is to hear about this freedom of information.
Senator Perrault: Open government!
Senator Frith: And open government. But instead of freedom of information and open government, what we have is fog
from a super, hypercharged fog machine. In any event, that is
the answer; you will not tell us whether there was any such
recommendation.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I rise on a point of privilege.
An Hon. Senator: Order.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Of course, I hesitate to embark
upon any criticism of the course of action followed by such a
learned gentleman of such great experience as the honourable

SENATE DEBATES
senator opposite who seems to be seeking to be educated by the
Attorney General of Canada.
An Hon. Senator: What is your point of order?
Senator Smith (Colchester): I did not say a point of order; I
said a point of privilege. I say that the privilege of this house is
being abused by the honourable gentleman when he tries to
elicit, prior to the decision made or to be made by the Attorney
General, respecting the prosecution or non-prosecution of some
Canadian, whether or not he is aware or has conducted himself
in such a way as to be aware of certain factors which are
relevant to the way in which he makes up his mind. I say that
is despicable, that is reprehensible and is totally inconsistent
with the privileges of this house.
Senator Perrault: That is out of order too. The house is
totally abused by this type of comment by the honourable
senator.
Senator Smith (Colchester): It is total abuse of the rules of
this house.
Senator Perrault: The senator's remarks are totally out of
order.
Senator Smith (Colchester): The honourable gentleman
takes the bait again, just like a sucker.
Senator Frith: Speaking to the point of privilege, I can
clearly see that we are drawing a little blood over there.
Senator Perrault: Type zero.
Senator Frith: I am appreciative of all lectures and I find it
very edifying to have lectures not only from the Attorney
General, who I am sure has had much more experience in
combines cases than I have had, although I must say I have
had some, but of course, nowhere near the kind of experience
that the hesitating Senator Smith (Colchester), who hesitates
to get up on his feet on a point of order, has. In any event, let
us pass on.
Honourable senators, I would like to pass the question of
despicability or whatever it was that he was talking about, and
I would like to get back then to the next question. Where we
are right at the moment, honourable senators, is that the
Minister of Justice has said that he will not tell. And as far as
any secrecy is concerned, I can say that on both occasions that
I prosecuted it was public knowledge before the prosecution
took place, before the Director and the Restrictive Trade
Practices Commission-which did not come into this one
because it was referred beforehand under section 15-that a
recommendation had been made to the Minister of Justice for
a prosecution. And that is all I was asking. I was not asking
what the recommendation was. I was simply asking if there
was such a recommendation. Anyway, the answer is no; no
information-closed-door policy.
Let us go on to the next question. Incidentally, I might add
that both prosecutions resulted in convictions, for your
information.
The next question for the Minister of Justice arose also out
of the questioning of yesterday, and that relates to the question
[Senator Smith (Colchester).]

October 18, 1979

of the precedents that exist for consulting other ministers
before deciding on a prosecution. The precedents that were
asked for in the other place, and were disclosed, were precedents dealing with something under the Official Secrets Act
and the Toronto Sun. Are there precedents with reference to
the Combines Investigation Act for the Minister of Justice to
consult other persons with reference to a prosecution when
there has been a reference under section 15, and if there are
such precedents, can we have them?
Senator Flynn: I do not know that there is any distinction
between the responsibility of the Attorney General under the
Combines Investigation Act and any other act, and I cannot
see the difference, but I could quote several authors on this
point.
e (1530)

I have again offered to Senator Frith to read into the record
the opinion that was prepared for me and the authorities in
support of that opinion. I don't know if I should do so. I don't
think it is very useful, because I think Senator Frith does not
want the truth. He wants simply to embarrass me or to create
a problem.
Senator Lamontagne: I think he does it very well.
Senator Flynn: Senator Lamontagne, you are so clumsy. I
don't know why you always intervene.
Senator Lamontagne: I learned from you.
Senator Flynn: Well, you always put your foot in your
mouth.
Senator Lamontagne: It's your mouth.
Senator Flynn: You should keep quiet. I know you have
received degrees and honours, and you are a good worker, but
as far as judgment is concerned, no degree would grant you
that.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, may I rise on a question of privilege?
An Hon. Senator: Oh, come on!
Senator Frith: Just a moment now. I know this business of
privilege and order is a bit of a bore, but is the Honourable
Leader of the Government, just so I will know, and Minister of
Justice imputing motives? He suggested that I don't want the
truth. Is he imputing some motives to me?
Flynn: No.
Frith: Did you not say that I don't want the truth?
Flynn: No, I didn't say that.
Frith: I think that is exactly what you said.
Senator Flynn: No, no, to speed the case.
Senator Frith: Well, tell me what you said.
Senator Muir: Don't be so thin-skinned!
Senator Flynn: Should I ask the reporter to repeat it? I am
sure the only thing I said was to the effect that your motives
are not really to find out the truth but to embarrass me. If that

Senator Flynn: You are not honestly seeking the truth.

Now may I ask the Minister of Justice to table the precedents that he has for the consultation that we have been
discussing in this line of questioning, and then we can leave
that? If he tells me that these are the precedents on which he
relies, then we can go on to the third and last part of my
question.

Senator Flynn: I certainly will do that, although I don't
know exactly how I should do it. I think in order to inform all

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I never had any feelings that the Minister of Justice needed my advice in order to
be a fool.
In any event, i should like to ask now a question that, in my
respectful submission, is not connected with the citation he has
given, because what we are asking here is not for a judicial
review of his decision but for information. We are asking for
information in a house of Parliament.

e

(1540)

That brings me to the meeting about which he invited us to
ask questions. I would therefore ask him: who attended that
meeting, and was it at his request that the meeting took place?
Senator Flynn: Yes, it was at my request, on the advice of
my officials. My officials advised me ta call that meeting even
before I knew about the problem. They said, "There is a
question that we want to put to you, and we suggest that such
a meeting should take place."
If there were any sinister purpose in having that meeting, I
could have called on two of my colleagues, the Solicitor
General and the Minister of Transport, and the three of us
could have discussed the matter alone. However, officials of
the three departments were present. At 8 o'clock I was told,
"You have to sec them at 8 o'clock."
I could tell the honourable senator who was there from the
Department of Justice. It was Mr. Don Christie, Associate
Deputy Attorney General: Mr. Douglas Rutherford, Mr.
Lawson Hunter, Mrs. Ingrid Hutton, and Mr. Roger Leclaire.
Those persons were from my department. I know that Mr.
Bertrand was there from the other department, also Mr.
George Post, Deputy Minister of Consumer and Corporate
Affairs, and Mr. Jean Claude Thivierge, Deputy Director.
There were two other officials from the Bureau Services
Branch: Mr. George Orr and Mr. William Carroll. I did not
know the other officials.
If we had anything to hide, then it was a very poor place for
that, as events have revealed.
Senator Frith: The honourable the minister would say, of
course, that there was nothing to hide. What was the interest
of the Minister of Transport in this consultation? Was he
advising on matters of law?
Senator Flynn: 1 do not know whether the honourable
senator has read what I said previously. 1 said it was in
connection with trucking, which involves federal legislation
dealing with transport.
Senator Frith: Did his interest in trucking lead to some
question as to whether or not there should be a prosecution, or
whether the prosecution should be delayed?
Senator Flynn: I said yesterday that there was no question
of delaying the prosecution. 1 asked for further information. I
would be willing, in fact, to confide the whole file to my
honourable friend if he would regard the information as being
confidential. 1 would urge him once and for all to understand
[Senator Flynn.]

October 18, 1979

the responsibility I have, and which he has, to let me decide
the matter on its merits and not by being pushed, such as he is
trying to do at this time. I have that responsibility. What is the
honourable senator trying to do? Is he trying to push me into
saying yes or no? Is he trying to tell me on which side he wants
me to fall? At least then I would know what kind of advice he
is giving me.
Senator Frith: The question is entirely one that is found in
the terms of the answer just given, which is: Is the decision
being made on the merits of the matter, and will the minister
tell us what are those merits?
Senator Flynn: I have said repeatedly that 1 would decide on
the merits alone on all the relevant aspects. Does the honourable senator wish to give me advice on what is or what is not
relevant? Does he want to discuss this matter in public? Does
he want to prejudice the case on one side or the other? Is that
his intention? If it is not, that nevertheless is what he is doing.
Senator Frith: The answer is yes, I do want to know what
are the relevant issues. If the issues are purely questions of the
report, as to whether the evidence found in the investigation by
the director disclosed an offence under the act or under the
Criminal Code, then I am not concerned; I am not asking
about that. I am asking: Is that the only issue? My further
question is-and it is a perfectly proper and relevant question
for the people of this country, for the legislature and this house
of Parliament: Is that the sole consideration, or, if the Minister
of Transport was present at the meeting, are there any other
considerations which, with respect to any citation which the
Minister of Justice wants to give, are relevant in the political
and legislative domain?
If the honourable the minister is telling me that the Minister
of Transport was present to talk about legal questions-which
are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justicethat is in order. I am not telling the minister how to decide
that. Of course he has ta decide that. But if the minister is
asking me whether I am trying to say that there are someSenator Flynn: You are sayingSenator Frith: The minister asked me a question, and I am
answering it. The answer is yes. If it is a question of whether
he is taking into consideration, in making that decision,
representations from the industry, then the decision that the
minister has to make is a political decision, not a legal one. If
he is saying that the Minister of Transport was there for no
other reason than to talk about the law and evidence in the
case, then I would accept that.
Senator Flynn: Accept whatever you like. I really don't care.
It appears to be a hopeless task to make the honourable
senator understand what the responsibility of the Attorney
General really is. I repeat, probably for the tenth time, that I
am going to decide the matter in accordance with my responsibility, as defined in the law; and if the honourable senator is
not satisfied with the decision that I reach, he can do whatever
he likes. If he is satisfied, I hope he will clamp down on his line
of questioning.
Senator Frith: Volontiers.

SENATE DEBATES

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed
that the document referred to earlier by Senator Flynn be
printed as an appendix to the Debates of the Senate of this
day, as requested by him?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For text of document see appendix, p. 126.)

Senator Muir: May I ask the Honourable the Leader of the
Government whether he will give this legitimate question due
consideration and bring it before his cabinet colleagues,
because there are those within the senior echelons of the
RCMP who are vitally concerned about this matter and would
like to see this done?
Senator Flynn: I will.

Senator Muir: I should like to direct a question to the
honourable the Minister of Justice. I hesitate to rise in this
august body with so many thin-skinned legal beagles on the
other side of the house. If you will forgive me, Mr. SpeakerThe Hon. the Speaker: Order. Does the honourable senator
have a question or a point of order?
Senator Everett: Is the honourable senator speaking on a
point of order?
Senator Muir: I certainly have a point of order, and then a
question.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable senator is on a point
of order.
Senator Muir: On the point of order, Mr. Speaker, I do not
think that this Question Period should be monopolized by one
honourable senator in this august body. Certainly others
should have an opportunity to ask questions. With your permission, Mr. Speaker, may I ask a question?
The Hon. the Speaker: Continue.
Senator Muir: My question is directed to the Minister of
Justice and the Leader of the Government. I hesitate to ask
the Leader of the Government a question because I obtained
my law degree in the coal mines of Nova Scotia, although
after hearing the questions which have just been posed in this
house, even 1, having come from the coal mines, can understand how ridiculous they are. I spent 22 years in the other
place, and I do not think that any honourable member there
would be allowed to get away with anything like we have seen
in this chamber today.
My question is: Is the government giving consideration to
the placing of the RCMP under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice rather than the Department of the Solicitor
General? This is no reflection on the present Solicitor General,
but many people, including senior officials of the RCMP, feel
as I do that the RCMP should come under the jurisdiction of
the Department of Justice.
Senator Flynn: I suppose that after the questioning by
Senator Frith, no one would want the Minister of Justice to
take over any further responsibilities. My reply is that I have
not heard of any such intention, and I would say that so far as
the present Minister of Justice is concerned he would not want
to have the RCMP under his control.

EXCHANGE VALUE OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Everett: I wish to direct a question to the Minister
of State for Economic Development. Approximately a week
ago I asked him whether the statement of the Governor of the
Bank of Canada, made at the time the bank rate was
increased, indicated that it was now the policy of the central
bank and the Government of Canada that there be a floor
under the Canadian dollar. I wonder whether the minister has
been able to obtain an answer.
9 (1550)

Senator de Cotret: I have asked the Minister of Finance to
give me a written answer to that question, but I have not yet
received it. As soon as I do I will be very happy to communicate it to you.
THE SENATE
CONDUCT OF QUESTION PERIOD

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I hesitate to
intervene, but it is obvious that events are galloping along here
rather fast. We are overlapping many things. We have had
honourable senators rising on questions of privilege which have
not yet been decided by the Chair, and because they have not
been referred directly to the Chair we have had points of order
raised, followed by questions. We have had a senator rising on
a point of order, or, I should say, not strictly a point of order,
but asking a question.
I am not being critical, but I notice senators looking at me
and wondering why I am not intervening, I think I should
point out at this time, to those who may not be aware of the
situation, that it is a traditional convention of this place that
the Speaker does not normally intervene except to preserve
decorum. I have not yet noticed our being at the point where
decorum is not present, although I did begin to suspect that we
might be getting close to it. The other time when the Speaker
is expected to intervene is when he is directly appealed to to
decide or dispose of a point of privilege or a point of order.
The tradition in the Senate is that senators themselves, as
mature legislators, can decide these things and work out these
problems among themselves. I can assure honourable senators
that I am having the greatest difficulty in retaining my
objectivity in view of certain past responsibilities that I have
had in this place. It is not easy for me not to intervene, but I
do realize the reasons why I should not.

SENATE DEBATES
Perhaps I should recall to you rule 20, which relates to the
conduct of the house in Question Period. It says:
(1) When the Speaker calls the question period, a
senator may, without notice, address an oral questionThe rest of the rule is there, and honourable senators may read
it.

I would like to call attention also, in a particular manner, to
paragraph (4). I am not saying that it is my intention to
enforce this rule. I merely draw it to the attention of senators
for their consideration with regard to the extent to which it
should apply. This paragraph reads as follows:
A debate is out of order on an oral question, but brief
explanatory remarks may be made by the senator who
asks the question and by the senator who answers it.
I leave it to the judgment of honourable senators as to what is
the meaning of the word "brief"'.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, as one of
those-and I am perhaps the only one-who raised a question
of privilege, I hope it will have been noted that I did not appeal
to the Speaker to rule on the question of privilege, but, rather,
I brought it to the attention of the house, though a little more
warmly than some might have appreciated, and a little more
warmly than I might have donc in other circumstances. However, I specifically refrained from appealing to His Honour the
Speaker, and I appreciate that he has now made it very clear
that perhaps I followed what might have been a reasonable
practice in not doing so.
BRITISH COLUMBIA
TREATMENT OF DRUG ADDICTS-JUDGMENT OF COURTOF
APPEAL

Senator Perrault: I have a question for the Honourable the
Minister of Justice which relates to a recent British Columbia
Appeal Court decision which struck down that province's
program-both compulsory and voluntary-for the treatment
and rehabilitation of people addicted to drugs, especially
heroin. The minister will know that this is a serious concern in
British Columbia, and in many other parts of Canada as well.
It may not be possible for the minister to provide a complete
answer today, but if the various provincial actions in this field
are now ruled constitutionally invalid, what are this government's plans to take action at the federal level to deal with this
very serious problem?
Secondly, the province of British Columbia is reported to
have invested something like $5 million in this program, now
judged invalid, and employed a staff of some 300 people. Does
the federal government have immediate plans for legislation,
or other action, to help recoup a substantial loss for the people
of that province if the whole program is to go down the drain?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have already met
with Dr. McClelland, the Minister of Health for British
Columbia, and with the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Vogel.
[The Hon. the
Speaker.]

October 18, 1979

Mr. Gardom, the Attorney General, could not attend the
meeting.
We have reviewed that case. There is some difficulty in
deciding whether the British Columbia Appeal Court decision
means that the whole act concerning this program is ultra
vires, or if only the provision concerning compulsory treatment
of heroin addicts is ultra vires. In any event, we have discussed
the situation, we shall seek clarification of that part of the
judgment, and I understand that leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada has been applied for. There are
ways of, let us say, continuing the program in the meantime.
There are other ways that have been explored, with the object
of finding a solution which would enable the program to
continue, for example, without any compulsion, if it is decided
by the Supreme Court of Canada that compulsion is ultra
vires.
THE ECONOMY
INCREASE IN PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I would like to ask
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce whether he is
aware that the nearly 1 per cent rise in the consumer price
index announced earlier today verges on double digit inflation,
and that this is mostly due to the increased cost of petroleum
products. I would like to ask him further what action the
federal government is taking to keep down prices, and especially the outrageous price of petroleum products which Premier
Lougheed is demanding, which are to the detriment of the
people of other provinces of Canada.
Senator de Cotret: First of all, yes, I am aware of the
increase in the consumer price index. Secondly, yes, we are
concerned about the increases in petroleum prices. I think it is
fair to say that we have identified very clearly, in relation to
our terms of office, that we consider inflation to be the number
one problem facing this country.
I was going to say that I am not at liberty to discuss press
reports. I am, of course, at liberty to discuss such reports, but I
have no intention of discussing such reports with regard to
what Premier Lougheed might or might not want to do, or
what, for that matter, Premier Lougheed has or has not
presented to the federal government. As you know, the whole
question of energy prices is under very active discussion and
review by the federal government in consultation with the
various provinces, and a policy will be announced very shortly.
Senator Haidasz: A supplementary question. When can we
expect an announcement of the government's policy on the
so-called Ottawa increase in the price of petroleum products?
Senator de Cotret: Shortly.
Senator Argue: I wonder if I might ask another supplementary question. This arises out of the great concern of agricultural producers that the cost of fuel not escalate, since this, by
itself, would result in a very serious increase in the price of
food. Has the government under consideration a policy of
taking action by way of subsidy, or some other kind of

October 18, 1979

assistance, that would result in holding down the cost of fuel to
agricultural producers, even at a time when fuel costs are
going up?

THE PUBLIC SERVICE

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I know it is late, but I
have a few short answers to previous questions. Senator
Steuart asked: Will the government promote projects that
might add to acid rain pollution? The obvious answer from the
minister is: No, not without adequate safeguards.
Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, I appreciate the
answer given to me by Senator Flynn, but I did ask a supplementary dealing specifically with the pollution threat by the
building and operation of the hydro development in Coronach,
Saskatchewan, which is near the American border with Saskatchewan. I asked if the Leader of the Government could give
me some assurance that the government has indicated to the
International Joint Commission that it supports the development of this plant, and if it has received any assurance that
this will not add to the pollution in that area.
Senator Flynn: I will inquire about this specific case. This
construction was started a long time ago. My reply applies to
future plants that could create that problem. However, I will
inquire as to the specific case to which Senator Steuart refers.

POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING JOINT PARLIAMENTARY
COMMITTEE TO STUDY EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS

VISIT OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

(1600)

Senator de Cotret: In answer to your question I can honestly
tell you that we do have under consideration a variety of
measures or programs that would deal with Canadians who
might be more adversely affected or less able to absorb certain
energy cost increases that may be coming down the road.
Senator Argue: I appreciate the minister's answer. I just
emphasize that not only is it important to the farmer as a
producer that he has some control over his cost of production,
but it is also important to the consumers of Canada that every
possible step be taken to keep down the price of food.
Senator de Cotret: I take your comment and i reiterate that
we have under very active consideration this whole consultation that is now going on on energy pricing and on energy
self-sufficiency.

[Translation]
Senator Marchand: I have only a short question to ask the
Leader of the Government. In view of the reply I received
from the Minister of State for Economic Development concerning the D'Avignon report, I want to say that I had the
opportunity to glance at this report yesterday. No, I am sorry.
I think it was the Leader of the Government rather than the
honourable minister who gave it to me. However, when we add
to this the statement by the Minister of Supply and Services
concerning pork-barrelling and the great upheaval that has
occurred in the last few months in the public service, I
wonder-and I refer here to the answer I received-if it would
not be a good idea to ask a joint committee of the Senate and
the House of Commons to study this whole problem.
I know that this could not be done in a single day since the
wheels of democracy turn rather slowly in this regard, but
could we be told as soon as possible whether the government
has really made such a decision so that we may alleviate the
concerns of hundreds and thousands of public servants? This
question is certainly vitally important for the honourable
Minister of State for Economic Development if he wants to do
something more in his job than has been done until now.
Senator Flynn: I do not believe that a decision has been
made at this time. However, I believe that the suggestion is
valid. I shall certainly discuss it with my cabinet colleagues.
Similar suggestions will probably be made in the other place
also. I do not think that there are any objections to this; quite
the opposite.

THE ENVIRONMENT
POLLUTION BY ACID RAIN

AGENDA-CANADA-UNITED STATES AGREEMENT ON
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS

Senator Flynn: In answer to Senator Bosa's question of
Tuesday regarding the auto pact, I have ascertained that while
the agenda has not yet been finalized for the discussions next
month between Prime Minister Clark and President Carter,
the auto agreement is obviously of great interest to each
nation, and it would seem likely that the automotive industry
would be included in those talks.
GRAIN
STATUS OF GOVERNMENT ADVISORY GROUP

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I also have answers
to provide to questions that were asked yesterday. Senator
Steuart asked a question with respect to the grains group. He
asked whether there were any specific reporting changes made
with respect to the grains group. The answer is: No, the grains
group is still reporting as it always has. It is under the
chairmanship of the minister responsible for the Wheat Board.
However, the funding for the grains group is under the budget
of the minister responsible for industry, trade and commerce.
Senator Steuart also asked a question concerning the
renewed mandate of the grains group. I should like to point out
that it is not a question of mandate renewal; it is a question of
mandate review. This review takes place every two years. The
review date was up earlier this year just prior to the general
election, and it was postponed for six months. The review is
now under way. It is the intention of the minister responsible
for the Wheat Board and chairman of this group to recom-

SENATE DEBATES
mend flot only a renewed but also a strengîhcned mandate for
the grains group. This review will be cornpleîed very shortly. 1
hope those answers adequately respond I0 the questions that
wcre raised yesterday.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPI Y-DEBAIL CONTINUED

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday consideration of His
Excellency the Governor Gencral's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Senator Bielish, seconded by,
Senator Charbonneau, for ain Address in reply thereto.
Senator Nurgitz: H-onourable senators. it is with both
humility and a sense of duty that 1 risc to support the Speech
from the Throne and make my mnaiden speech in this chamrber.
Believing that 1 would be spcaking yesîerday, 1 Iistened very
carefully to the speeches on Tucsday night. and knowing what
1 have 10 say and how long tl will take me to Say il, I want 10
warn honourable senators that my remiarks will not have the
brilliance or the depth of Senator Lamnontagne's comments, or
the wit and charm of my good fricnd. Senator MacQuarrie,
but, hopefully. honourable senators, you will remember iny
first speech l'or ils brevity.
May 1, first of aIl, say how plcased 1 ami Io address vou, Mr.

that on this occasion one should not be touo partisan but.' asidc
from wishing you good health, 1 do want 10 say that I wish you
manx, years in the Chair.
Before addressing myself 10 the Speech from the Throne, I
should like to take a moment or two 10 spcak of mny native
province. thc province 1 seek to represent with others in this
chamber. Il is hard for me not to be just a littie emotional in
thinking about my province and my country inr addressing you
on this, my first occasion. Manitoba vwas, ais you in this
chamber know, one of those areas of Canada 10 which carne
many who sought refuge fromn poverty and oppression abroad
10 begin their lives anew afier unlimiîed suffcring and deprivalion. In the early 1900s thcrc was a large tide of eastern
European immigration. Among those refugees were my own
parents who werc corng from what vas. in their youth.

much, yeî 1 guess they really sought everything. They sought
freedom from anti-Semitismi and oppression. frecdomi froni
hunger, and freedomn 10 work and to provide for themselves.
They built their lives humbly. like s0 many thousands of
others-long hours at the scwing machines in the garment

My own involvement in the public life of my province, my
country and my party is very much a response to my great
sense of' debt 10 Canada for the opportunities my parents and
their children received fromn a young and growing nation.
There were. I arn sure, many who had greater opportunities,
but none swho appreciaîed morc the opportunities they had.
For a moment, if 1 niay. honourable senators, I should like
10 mention briefly my house leader in this chamber. miy
honourable colleague from Manitoba, a former premier of that
great province. who has throughout my life in polities been my
idol and mentor. He has served here with great distinction, and
he made himself an outstanding Manitoban when he was
premier of that province.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Nurgitz: On this occasion an expression of admiralion and respect for him scems particularly appropriate.
Before spcaking in support of' my govcrnment's Thronc
Speech, rriay, 1 say one final word by way of introduction.
Although rny partisan conimitiment is vcry decp, and onc of
intense conviction, 1 sec tl as my responsibiliîy to work with ail
honourable senators Io servc iny country and mny provrnce in
this chamiber. and 1 intend to do so Io the very best of myv
abilIi lv.
Honourable senators, in rny view, the Specch read by the
Governor Gencral represents a sound, coherent and reasonable
approach to the challenge facing Canada. There are some who
have criîicized it for not promising enough. 1 applaud a
governmenî that prefers promises il can keep 10 unfillcd
promises that spread furîher cynicism and alienation. On that
note, let mie say how impresscd 1 have been in my first days
here. 1 hope. honourable senators, that these active Senate
days continue, and if îhey do so 1 arn saîisficd that the kind of'
crrticrsmn one has heard of' this chamrber and ils members will
tum 10 admiration and respect.
My observation of the performance of so many here has
imipressed mce grcatly. 1 spcak of both sides of the Senate swhen
1 say that. 1 hope that after listening and leamning 1, îoo, wiIl
make some small contribution 10 these deliberations and t0 the
workings of this chamber.
The progranm offered in the Speech fromn the Throne scenms
10 me, at Icast as a novice-I noîiced Senator Frith sard hie

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Working with the provinces is giving away the store for
some. I believe that what the Prime Minister understands
better than so many in our country is that the store is not his
to keep or give away, but is a joint responsibility of ail
jurisdictions to advance, enhance and protect. That he would
first work with his fellow premiers in a spirit of co-operation is
a great tribute to this man's courage and leadership.
Surely we ail agree that a confrontation method is not a
satisfactory one. From my reading of the newspapers, it seems
to me that since May 22 the Government of Quebec has not
been shooting the kind of shots we heard in earlier days.
Surely, honourable senators, we agree with the words read
by His Excellency when he said:
To make federalism work, it is essential to change the
attitudes of the past and the federal government must set
the example. Accordingly, it is a primary goal of my
Government to bring about a new era in federal-provincial relations. Consultation and cooperation will be the
hallmarks of that new era. The time has come to reconcile
our differences.
Honourable senators, i am pleased to add my support to the
Throne Speech, and i commend it to the honourable members
of this chamber as a worthy blueprint for progress and good
government.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to open
my remarks in participating in the Throne Speech debate by
offering my congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker. I am sure
the expression has been made, and very sincerely made, a
number of times that we are extremely happy with your
selection.
We wish you well, Mr. Speaker, although we realize that
you are facing a somewhat changed situation. I realize that it
will take some patience and some understanding, which we
know you already possess, to deal with this change. I welcome
the change, and i am certainly not criticizing it. I refer to the
fact that we have several ministers of the Crown here. However, we would be remiss in our duty to the Canadian people if
we did not examine them on a daily basis, because certainly
they have to answer here or else by way of press conference. i
am sure you, Mr. Speaker, would agree with me that we in the
opposition have a service to perform in this respect, although I
suggest that it may take us a little time to adjust to this
change.
i would add this. You may also, Mr. Speaker, have to forget
some of your admonitions while occupying the position of
Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I hope that we will not be
reminding you of that too often, although you made some very
important submissions when occupying that position. 1, for
one, am willing to take them in the spirit in which they were
offered in defending the position that you occupied at that
time.
i think, too, that it is important that we evolve our rules. I
say that because not many hours after our first Question
Period in this session I heard comments out in the corridor
that we have to have some new rules, that we do not have stiff

or rigid enough rules in the Senate to handle the Question
Period. They are not as stiff, as rigid and as structured, if you
want to call them that, as they are in the other place. I spent
many years over there when they were going through the
agonizing adjustment of their rules, for reasons that I will not
now explain. I agreed with some of those reasons and I
disagreed with others.
However, i hope that we wili have the good sense-and i am
sure that you, Mr. Speaker, will add greatly to the injection of
good sense-to evolve, not rigid rules, but practices and that
sort of thing, so that this chamber can perform its public duty
without getting ourselves so rigidly structured that we hurt this
institution in moving along. I know that some honourable
senators will get a littie impatient from time to time, but in the
process of evolution I think we will find what has often been
referred to as a reasonable procedure arrived at by reasonable
people.

e

(1620)

Senator Roblin: Hear, hear.
Senator Oison: 1, for one, want to give an undertaking to
you, Mr. Speaker, that, if I can, I will be part of that
reasonable approach.
I wish also to offer my congratulations to the mover, Senator Bielish, and the seconder, Senator Charbonneau, of the
debate we are now involved in. i am sure that ail senators will
agree with me when I say that they have demonstrated a keen
sense of understanding of the people in the areas they represent, and I wish them well. I particularly express my congratulations to Senator Bielish, who is from Alberta and who comes
to this chamber with a wealth of background knowledge of the
rural scene in Alberta. i certainly hope that on many occasions
we shall be able to find common ground so that we shall be
able to promote the interests that both she and I are familiar
with because we both grew up in that environment.
To get to the Speech from the Throne, someone has said
that it is the usual and normal speech. I have heard many
Speeches from the Throne, and they do not outline the total,
specific government policies for the session. I am familiar with
that. But I am not quite sure that it can be accurately
described as "usual and normal," because it seems to me that
if it needs a title of some kind it should be entitled the "Three
C's Speech"-committees, conferences and commissions.
Almost everything of any substance talked about in the Speech
from the Throne is going to be referred to some committee,
some conference or some commission. That is not the usual
Speech from the Throne.
The other thing that is not usual about the Speech from the
Throne is the absence of anything respecting what i regard as
the most important economic and social issues facing Canada
today. For example-and if I missed it, I am sorry, but I read
the Speech more than once, so I do not think I missed it-it
contains nothing about energy policy; not even to the extent of
making a passing reference to it. I know that the government
has been involved in this, because I read the newspapers from

SENATE DEBATES
time to time, but they did not even indicate that they had come
to any decision as to what they are going to do.
I am going to spend most of my time today talking about
petroleum prices. They were not mentioned. I know there are
discussions going on but, surely, in a document as historic as
the first Throne Speech by a new government they should have
at least referred to one of the most important problems facing
the country. Unfortunately, it is not included.
I was surprised at one other matter that came up after the
Speech from the Throne. i want to mention it at least in
passing. It is the matter of the answer I got a few days ago
from the Minister of State for Economic Development about
the effect of rising interest rates in Canada.
It seems to me that the first thing that this government
really ought to establish is its credibility. I know it is going to
carry out some of its election promises simply for the purpose
of establishing credibility, although events since the election
must have persuaded the government that the people of
Canada are not interested in the government's keeping such
promises as dismantling Petro-Canada and moving the
Canadian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. There
are many other matters.
I can understand that the government is going to pursue its
election promises in order to establish some credibility, so it is
going to make at least an effort to keep them. But it seems to
me, if it wants credibility, that the government should avoid
the kind of statement the Minister of State for Economic
Development made in this house when he said that rising
interest rates have no direct relationship to bank profits. There
is no doubt that he is a distinguished economist, but he also
attributed to the Minister of Finance the statement that the
Minister of Finance is unable to sec any direct relationship
between rising interest rates and bank profits. This was, of
course, in response to a question I asked as to what he was
going to do about the windfall profits going to the banks
because of these rising interest rates. If he wants to establish
some credibility, that is not the right kind of staternent to
make.
I can precisely indicate, honourable senators, if you wish me
to, exactly what happened to bank profits during those months
in which interest rates were rising, as reported by the banks on
a quarterly basis, as they arc required to, starting, for my
purposes, with July, 1978.
I did not say it was the fault of this government, although,
when in opposition, they said a lot about the previous government's responsibility to keep interest rates down. But to say
that there is no relationship, in my view, is a ridiculous
statement.
The published statements of the banks, dated October 31,
1978, show that the profit of the Royal Bank for that quarter,
compared to the profit for the same quarter the year before,
went up by 38.5 per cent; that of the Bank of Commerce by 28
per cent; that of the Bank of Montreal by 58.6 per cent; and
that of the Bank of Nova Scotia by 29 per cent, and so on
down the list. This was during a period when there were these
[Senator Oison.j

October 18, 1979

rapidly escalating interest rates, which, of course, everyone
knows are triggered by whatever the Bank of Canada does. It
sets the lending rate; the chartered banks set the prime rate;
and then all the custoners pay whatever their negotiated
position is with the bank as to so much over the prime rate.
I also remind honourable senators that this has continued. I
also happen to have before me the published statements of the
profits of the banks for the third quarter of 1979. I am not
going to spend any time on this today because there will be
another opportunity. The percentage increase is not as great,
but it is still increasing. I still take the position that these rates
are regulated by the Bank of Canada, and that windfall profits
that accrue to corporations such as the banks really ought to
be looked at very carefully to see if there is not some way to
recover such profits from those banks and use them for
something of economic benefit to Canada-perhaps for such a
purpose as helping those people who will be severely hurt by
higher interest rates. Perhaps they should be used for helping
those who are going to be hurt severely.
* (1630)

I do not wish to argue that the interest rate should not move
in defence of the Canadian dollar or in defence of foreign
investment, with the risk of an exodus of large amounts of
capital from Canada. That is not the argument. The argument,
honourable senators, is that to some people and to some
businesses in Canada, very severe economic damage is being
donc by the escalation of interest rates.
It is not a small group of people or businesses that will suffer
severe economic damage by this escalation of interest rates.
Almost all loans from banks are out at prime plus. In other
words, they do not have any fixed rate such as 9 per cent, l1
per cent, 12 per cent or 13.75 per cent. It is prime plus some
other figure, and it might go up again.
In budgeting for revenue, many businesses have not taken
into account the matter of a 50 to 70 per cent increase in the
cost of capital for inventory, or for whatever purpose they use
bank credit. I do hope the government takes this matter
seriously, because there are people who are caught absolutely
helpless in these situations. They cannot pay their debts
because they have no control over the escalation of interest
rates. As I said, I hope the government takes this seriously,
because the banks are now reaping windfall profits as a result
of these escalations. I hope the government does not dismiss it,
thinking there is no relationship between the two.
Honourable senators, I now wish to turn to another matter,
that of petroleum prices in Canada. It is popular across
Canada to condemn Alberta for wanting to move petroleum
prices closer to international levels. As a matter of fact, there
was a commitment given by the previous government that it
was going to move petroleum prices gradually to narrow the
gap, if that is the right phrase. What in fact happened in 1979,
at least, was that the gap widened. The international price
went up faster than any increase in the domestic price, which
went up by a dollar a barrel on January 1 and another dollar a
barrel on July 1.

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

I think we should look behind this a little more to see
whether or not it is beneficial to all of Canada to have
petroleum prices move up, and also to see what is going to
follow if they do not.
We are going to have to practise a little more conservation
in Canada, and nobody disagrees with that. It has been said on
a number of occasions that Canadians are the largest users of
hydrocarbons in the world. I suppose that is true, but it must
also be taken into consideration that we live in a climatic zone
where we need to use huge quantities of these products for
heat in the winter. We use more hydrocarbons for heat than
does the United States and, indeed, many other countries.
However, despite that fact, I think everybody would agree that
there is room for more conservation in Canada.
There does not seem to be any other solution that has proved
more effective in conservation than moving the price up so as
to discourage those who have the option of using more fuel
from using it. I do not think there is much disagreement on
that.
A second matter that comes up, and I am sure most people
do not understand it, is that we cannot continue to live under
the illusion that all oil in Canada is cheap oil. First of all, I
should make one thing very clear, that is that there are
sufficient petroleum products already discovered in Canada to
last us for not decades but for-I was going to say hundreds of
years, and probably that is true. However, most of those
petroleum products are more expensive to produce than simply
draining off the top 20 per cent of a light and medium crude
field. There does not need to be the argument that we do not
have enough oil in Canada, because it is not true.
I read a report not long ago indicating that if all the heavy
oil, tar sands and oil in conventional fields were added up,
Canada would probably have about five times as much oil as
the Middle East, but the cost of recovering it and putting it
into usable form is very much higher. I think Canada has to
face that fact. We are no longer able to take just the top 20 or
30 per cent out of the so-called conventional oil fields and have
that put into the market, and think that can go on forever.
I am not going to make my speech today on the cost of
putting heavy oil or tar sands oil into service stations or into
the tanks of heating oil distributors, because I am sure that has
been discussed at length.
At page l1 of the Ottawa Citizen of Wednesday, September
19, 1979 there is the following headline: "Insiders admit
inefficiency of oil business 'tragic' ". I will quote just briefly
from that article. It reads:
Oil men could vastly improve Canada's energy outlook
by working harder in their own back yards to exploit
known supplies, say federal, provincial and industry
spokesmen.
Industry tradition is that the tax system reward leaves
behind at least two-thirds of oil which has already been
found, while drilling shifts to ever more costly, sensitive
northern and offshore zones.
The article goes on to state:

average rates of recovery from reserves still
-overall
hover around 30 per centHonourable senators, I am not talking about heavy oil, but
conventional oil. About 30 per cent of conventional oil is all we
are getting at the moment. These experts state that this is
quite an improvement because a decade ago we could expect to
get about 20 per cent of that oil.
a (1640)

The article also states:
The methods needed for more efficient production are
so different they are likened to finding new oil fieldsTo increase the recoverability from these fields will be expensive. There are many new technologies coming in-steam
injection, water flooding, and other technologies of that
nature. I am not going to try to explain those to honourable
senators, but I think we should look very seriously at giving
some direct incentives to those oi companies that are willing
to carry out research in that field. They should be rewarded.
The Alberta government is already doing just that.
Those people who criticize the Premier of Alberta and his
government for some of the positions they are taking should
realize that the giving of incentives and rewards for increasing
recoverability from the fields and discoveries that are already
known is a very important part of Alberta's energy policy. I
hope that the federal government takes that into account, too.
Some people think that, with depletion allowances and a
number of other things, they already have a great advantage,
but if we want to do Canada a service, and if the government
wants the oil industry to be of service in the government's
objective of self-sufficiency by 1985 or 1990, incentives and
rewards provide a very specific, and probably the most useful,
inducement.
The tax incentives have not been specific enough, and an
examination of that area ought to be carried out. When you
come to the bottom line, you find it is going to cost more
money to bring this oil to the surface and put it into use. Let
us not kid ourselves into believing that the oil companies or the
provinces stand to make a bonanza through increased oi
prices. It may be that they can skim off some of the easy,
cheap oil at the top of these oil pools and make a few dollars
on that-in fact, quite a few-but the oil that will come on
stream after that to fill the reserves requirements for Canada
is going to cost a good deal more money than the initial
discoveries.
I shall have more to say about that matter another time. I
think it is so serious that we are going to have to push and
continue pushing for a higher recoverability of our conventional reserves, and also to recognize the fact that when we get
into such ventures as tar sands oil we will either move the price
up, or we will not get those reserves. The reserves are there,
but they cannot be produced without much more costly
operations.
There is a popular notion across Canada today that there
are a whole lot of people out in Alberta who are going to bleed
the rest of the country white; that everyone in Alberta is a

SENATE DEBATES
millionaire, and then sorne. Thcy forget that there are constitutional matters involved in some of the proposais that have
been made. It happens 10 be a fact that the resources of
Alberta belong 10 Alberta, and, unless il is changed, 1 hope
that fact will bc respected.
The Government of Alberta, 1 suggcst. is managing those
resources rather well, as did the previous governmnent. If other
provinces wish 10 put a tax or a royalty on their natural
resources. il is their privilege to do so.
I happen to remnember when the previous government put a
royalty of anywhere front 12'/2 1o 16''2 per cent on oil, wcllhead
value, when il was flot vcry popular bo do so. That was a poliey
that they set out on, and it was done when oil was eoming mbt
the east coast for much less than $3 a barrel and, in some
eases, for less than $2 a barrel. Alberta at that time chose 10
lcvy a royalty on what was being produced fromn the natural
resources in Alberta. It would have been very easy t0 have
made an argument 10 gel the governiment, the administrators.
of this natural resource out of the business and lower the price
10 compete with offshore oul. They chose not to. Thcy have
changed t0 royalty since, particularly in relation to so-called
-new oil" and -old oil"-and I arn not going t0 gel mbi that
argument. It scems 10 me that because there now happens to
bc a flow of money mbt Alberta's treasury and il will only
ast until the oil reserves are used up-there is a legitimate
argument 10 be made for grabbing that money and redistributîng il.
I want to say one other thing. The idca bas been bandied
about that if they cannot achieve redistribution îhrough
negotiation, îhey can circumvenî the agreemnent by sorne
changes in the tax equalization formula, or perhaps the imposition of somne harsh federal law in relation 10 encrgy appropriation and the righî of the ledieral administration 10 set
prices. I hope that this governmnent is not îempîed 10 do that. 1
îhink il is fair 10 remind honourable senators that Alberta
cautioned the federal govcrrmcn and ils senior advisers about
puîîing natural resource revenue mbt the revenues of Alberta
many years ago. But whcn they did il, il mnovcd Alberta ouI of
the arca where there were tax equalization paymcnts bcing
made 10 il. Il was a mistake, and now those chiekens are
coming home 10 roost. This government bas an opportunity 10
correct that situation by taking natural resource revenue out of
the tax equalization formula calculation.
A recent caleulation is that f'or every $1 a barre] increase in
the price of oil the federal trcasury has 10 pay $65 million 10
the recipient provinces under the tax equalization formula. It
does flot take much arithmetie to undersîand that if the
domestic price reaches the international price, which is about

One suggestion is that if the governrnenî îook natural
resource revenues out of that calculation, îhey would nol be
caught in that squeeze. The governimcnt may flot do that, but I
suggest that il was the wrong îhing Io do back when resource
revenue was put mbt that formula in the first place. I would

also suggesî îhaî il would perhaps be more difficult now,
because there are some provinces that will gain a great deal
from the federal îreasury simply because the price of cil goes
up, wiîh natural gas coming in behind aI 85 per cent of the
BTIJ equivalent price of oul.
Honourable senators, 1 think we should look aI this very
seriously. While the government might gel a few dollars by
trarnpling provincial righîs with respect to natural resource
revenue, they should consider the longer îerm implications of
doing so. This applies flot only 10 Alberta. Il applies 10 British
Columbia and Saskatchewan, and perhaps Newfoundland in
lime. We have 10 educate the Canadian people. They have 10
undersîand thaî if they want petroleumr products on the scale
that thcy are used 10, or even on a more conservative basis,
then the oil corning on sîream 10 produce those products is
going 10 cost more than it bas over the pasî few years.

Now, honourable senators. I hope that one other îhing will
bc watched carefully in this ehamber, and that is that the
commitlees of this bouse continue 10 do the good work îbey
have donc in the pasî. We must take the government's legislative mecasures from lime 10 lime and refer them 10 a commitîc
wbere we can sec îhings that can bc irnproved, particularly
insofar ais they relate 10 administration. We must make the
necessary amendm-ents and scnd îhem back 10 the flouse of
Cominons for their concurrence. I hope we can do that with
the dcgrce of non-partisanship we have had in the past. In
other words, bonourablc senators, the plea 1 arn making is that
while wc certainly migbî display a litîle partisansbip--flot very
rnuch, but a little-on the floor of this bouse because of our
responsibilities in the Question PeriodSenator Roblin: Enough to bc interesting.
Senator Oison: Enough 10 be inîeresîing, îbaî is rigbî, but I
hope that that is flot carried mbt the commilîces, because if il
is, we shaîl bc doing great damage 10 Ibis institution, and
furîhermore we shaîl be doing a disservice 10 the people of
Canada wbo expeet us 10 do that job. I arn sure the government would flot expeet us 10 do any less than fixing up or
rcpairing-"irnproving," I guess, is the word-the public bills
îbaî corne bere. In spite of the facî that wc on this side have a
rnajority bere. we would flot be expected to do any less. The
govcrnrnent over there is sorncwhat less expcrienced than tbe
previous one. and so we rnighî expecî 10 gel a few more rnessy
buis, so wc would flot be expecîed Io do any less of that
improving during this session.
AIl in ail. I look forward to Ibis session wiîh a great deal of
entbusiasrn and exciternent, because 1 îhink wc are perforrning
an addiîional service f'or the people of Canada. I hope we will
flot forget sshat our basic responsibiliîy is-10 be the second
chamber that takes a look aI the governi-nent bills and policies
and inmproves îhern in the way we have donc in the pasî. In
doing so. I îhink we will be doing our service 10 the people of
Ca naida.

Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I wondcr
if 1 rnigbt ask the honourable senator who bas just spoken one

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

question-and it is not intended to be in any way controversial.
I just want to understand the point he was trying to make, and
which, in fact, he did make very well, namely, that there
should be some incentive available to producers to more fully
exploit the resources which exist, in the sense of getting more
than 30 per cent or whatever it is they get from them now. I
did not quite follow whether he meant that that incentive
should be partially, at least, in the way of tax incentives or
whether he was talking of something else.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I was talking about
two or three things. The tax incentives are only one aspect of
it, but certainly the other incentive is that the industry gets
some, perhaps a reasonable proportion, of the increase in the
price of oil. I mention that because there are some people who
feel there should be some surcharge put on all of those, as they
are called-and it is not my term-windfall profits. So I think
it is a combination of both.
Senator Marshall: Honourable senators, although it will be
repetitive, I welcome the opportunity afforded me today to
participate in the debate on the motion for an Address in reply
to Speech from the Throne, and I hope you will bear with me
as I grasp that opportunity.
May I, first of all, take this occasion to congratulate you,
Mr. Speaker, on your appointment to the Chair of this august
chamber, an appointment which you so richly deserve and to
which you will add grace.
I would also like to add a word of appreciation to our
previous Speaker, Senator Lapointe, who recently retired as a
result of the exigencies of our democratic system.
Furthermore, I would like to add words of welcome to the
new Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, Lieutenant-Colonel
Tom Bowie, who, I am sure, will carry out his duties with
dedication, and whose presence we will respect.
And it is with a sense of comradeship that I welcome the
new senators recently appointed, a group of capable and
dedicated Canadians, who, I am sure, will contribute much to
our deliberations over the coming years.
I was a bit struck, however, by the youth in the new
appointments. At one time I thought I was one of the younger
ones, but that is all changed, as other things will change.
Finally, honourable senators, I congratulate the mover and
seconder of the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, Senators Bielish and Charbonneau, who both
exemplified by their words of dedication a capability to serve
their country well in this chamber.
It is already some 19 months since I had the honour to enter
this chamber, and although I may be considered somewhat of
a veteran, I still feel some trepidation in rising before such a
body of distinguished Canadians to say a few words which
may be of value as part of the many speeches which will be
recorded in both houses of Parliament related to the Speech
from the Throne. When I entered this chamber, after some 10
years in the other place, I was impressed most by the spirit of
non-partisanship which prevailed and which I experienced.
And now, as a result of the fortunes of democracy, I am cast

as a member of the government side, I was'more than pleased
to note that the Leader of the Opposition in his speech, to
which I listened attentively, reflected that he and his colleagues will continue to display the same spirit of co-operation
that we displayed and offered as members of the opposition.
Surely this statement of co-operation augurs well for the
reputation of this chamber, and assures us and Canadian
citizens, whose rights we protect, that the positive legislation
which will come forth in the future, and which is, indeed,
already coming forth, for our consideration will be expedited
for our country's benefit.
After listening to the Question Period today, honourable
senators, I wonder if the decorum which was displayed in
previous sessions will continue.
Senator Nurgitz quoted from the Speech from the Throne,
and I too would like to quote from that Speech two short
paragraphs which to my mind put into perspective the direction that we must take in guiding our future. His Excellency
the Governor General said:
My Ministers were given a mandate to change the
direction of the Government of Canada, as we enter the
1980's. The basic purposes of that change will be to
enhance the rights, freedoms and opportunities of
individual Canadians, and re-establish the spirit of partnership and renewal which are fundamental to our
Federation.
The mandate of my Ministers is also to build upon the
special strengths of Canada. We front on one mass
market and three great oceans, with access to the world.
Each of our regions contains vast physical resources
which can be the basis of industrial strength well into the
future. Confident local identities are emerging-rooted in
language, custom and community-and yielding a cultural vitality unique among nations. My Ministers believe
that the way to build a whole nation is to respect our
individual parts, and you will be invited to consider
measures to build upon the diverse regional and cultural
strengths of Canada.
Certainly, honourable senators, these words are appropriate.
They are appropriate to our new directions. The words, however, are not new, but I repeat that they certainly are
appropriate.

(1700)

It would be so simple for me to blame past governments for
our failures and the difficult times we are facing at present,
but it surely is obvious that we have serious problems. We have
the ravages of inflation and unemployment, and we have the
serious task of reconciling economic development and environmental protection. We have regional economic disparity and,
unfortunately, we still have poverty. We have a feeling among
our middle class that they are being imposed upon. We have a
feeling, also, of alienation between citizen and government,
and this has to change. Certainly, honourable senators, none of
us can claim that we have handled these problems with any
degree of wisdom or efficiency.

SENATE DEBATES
But despite the seemingly insoluble problems which we keep
repeating, we in Canada must not despair, because, despite the
evidence of our failures, Canada has been a remarkable success. Our country is a wondrous piece of real estate, rich in
beauty, in diversity and in natural resources. Canadians enjoy
one of the highest standards of living in the world. We have
been a modest force for decency. We are a free nation.
Sometimes our freedom is taken too much for granted. But as
a result of our richness, we are gaining new stature in the
global spectrum. We must build on our strengths and attain
the objectives that we strive for, if we only listen to what we
preach.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Marshall: I have been listening to Throne Speeches
for the last 12 years and each time they offer the same words:
that there is a need for new directions and new visions; that we
must take advantage of our natural resources. These are fine
and exemplary words. Indeed, so much so that each time I
hear His Excellency read the Speech from the Throne I want
to stand up and pledge allegiance to Canada ail over again.
But, after the eight days of debate, we seem to revert to the
common political practice of confrontation. However, the
Throne Speech debate gives a good number of us the opportunity to present individual comments related to what we each
feel will contribute to Canada's goals.
My contribution to this debate has to do with my province,
Newfoundland. My province is certainly one of the regions
referred to in the Throne Speech. It contains vast physical
resources, has its confident local identities rooted in custom,
yields part of its country's cultural vitality, which is unique,
and is a region for which we must consider measures to build
upon with its rich natural resources.
Honourable senators, obviously the subject that is, and will
be, uppermost in aIl our minds over the weeks and months
ahead is energy. In this context I offer Newfoundland's potential in Canada's thrust for self-sufficiency by 1990. I would
also point out some of the mismanagement of our resources in
the past, both on a federal and a provincial basis, in one small
but important area when we take into account Canadian
requirements for energy, its economic and social effects, and
our particular need for self-sufficiency in Atlantic Canada.
Honourable senators are aware of the potential hydro
resources at the lower Gulf Island site in Labrador, and also
the potential availability of oil and gas deposits off the Labrador coast. It is worthwhile reviewing for a few moments just
what has happened with regard to the hydro potential in the
past decade, to emphasize the opportunities that were lost.
In early 1974 a report was submitted to the then Newfoundland Government on the feasibility of delivering power to
Newfoundland from the Gulf Island hydro electric site which
would, among other factors, intertie with the Upper Churchill
Falls power development when completed. The project would
deliver l1 billion kilowatt hours of energy annually, the
equivalent of 18 million barrels of No. 6 fuel oil, and it was
found at that time, five years ago, that it was technically and
[Senator Marshall.}

October 18, 1979

economically feasible. It is significant to point out, too, that if
the project had been given the go-ahead in 1974, the cost
would have been in the area of $1 billion.
Important, too, was the fact that the cost of the power
delivered would average 12.2 mills per kilowatt hour through
1990, and that power could be brought on stream by 1979this year when we are grasping for alternative sources of
energy.
Here we are in that same year, 1979, when little or nothing
has moved. The estimated cost of development now is around
$3 billion. One has to wonder if it is still cost efficient. This
year we could have had another 3,000 megawatts of power
coming on stream, or the equivalent of some ten million
barrels of oil, without mentioning the 2,600 jobs that would
have been available over the past five years as a result of the
development and the new industry which could have been
attracted.
Consider, too, honourable senators, the complete lack of
projection of our energy needs at that time when the vast
project was undertaken to develop the Upper Churchillwhich was an engineering feat unprecedented. What did Newfoundland have to do to finance the project, with aIl the
economic expertise at her command at that time? It had to
agree to self ail of its output, except for 300 megawatts, to
Hydro Quebec for 65 years, from 1969, for a price of less than
three mills. At the going rate of 17 or 18 mills, which Hydro
Quebec is reportedly selling it for now, the loss of potential
income to Newfoundland is some $400 million per year. When
one considers that the contract has another 55 years to run,
with inflation added at 10 per cent a year, how many billions
of dollars would Newfoundland have had for a heritage fund?
Certainly in the ten years of the present life of the contract,
Newfoundland would have had some $4 billion, which is a
pretty good return on an investment of $1 billion, if we had
gone ahead with the project in 1974. And for the next 55
years, honourable senators, at a 10 per cent inflation rate, who
can count the untold millions of dollars that would have
accrued to Newfoundland? Certainly at the present selling
rate, we are talking of some 22,000 millions of dollars. If I can
be permitted to use Smallwoodian jargon, that is millions and
millions of dollars.
Reverting to the development of the lower Gulf Island and
Muskrat Falls, in order to make the project cconomic now
Newfoundland needs 800 megawatts of power from the Upper
Churchill, but herein lies a problem because Quebec refuses to
return more than the 300 megawatts provided for in the
original agreement and is holding a ransom over Newfoundland's head which involves a trade-off of interests. In return
for a new contract they seek to establish reservoirs on Newfoundland territory behind power dams on some five rivers
flowing south from Labrador across Quebec to the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. Unfortunately, they have the upper hand because
when James Bay power comes on stream Quebec will be
largely self-sufficient and Churchill Falls power will have to be
sold on a buyer's market.

October 18, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

So I ask you, honourable senators, with apologies for having
to give the boring details, as we strive for self-sufficiency by
1990, as parties blame each other for a lack of energy policy,
who in the name of all that is decent were the experts who
projected needs for the 1980s back in 1969 when the vast
unprecedented Churchill Falls power came on stream? Where
were they back in 1969 when they should have been projecting
our needs in the seventies and the eighties? Certainly if our
economic experts knew what they were talking about, we
would now be self-sufficient in energy in Atlantic Canada, and
we would not be facing the dilemma of having to subsidize
that region for its energy needs, and having it exist on handouts from Ottawa.
*

(1710)

I ask honourable senators opposite who were in power in the
years referred to: Where was the federal government's direction of effort, mentioned in the Throne Speech, to invest in
their proposed new visions? Where were their directions in the
development of Newfoundland's natural resources that we saw
in the annual Throne Speeches? Even if the project goes
ahead, we shall still face other problems of transmission of the
power to potential markets.
Quebec does not consider that Newfoundland has the right
to transmit power across its territory, and obviously insists that
we must sell that power to them.
An alternative possibility is to transmit the power across the
Cabot Strait to Nova Scotia, to feed into the Atlantic provinces' power grid, and that province has expressed a willingness to assist the Lower Churchill development. However, it
would be a much more costly route and would require new
technological capability. However, it shows the co-operation
offered by that province.
If we take into account the projected Bay of Fundy tidal
power, which has a potential of 1,085 megawatts, we in the
Atlantic region have a known capacity at this time, with the
development of the Lower Churchill, of some 7,000 megawatts
of hydro-electric power. Without mentioning other developed,
or potential but undeveloped, sources, the Atlantic provinces
could become self-sufficient in their energy needs, and again

would not have to depend on outside sources for the provision
of energy.
I understand that 7,000 megawatts of power would produce
28 million barrels of oil and would represent 6 per cent of
Canada's total production. The Atlantic region is dependent,
for 82 per cent of its energy, on oil. That speaks for itself. We
should take advantage of our natural resources, about which
we heard in the Throne Speech, and we should get on with the
job of developing and making Atlantic Canada self-sufficient.
That is a realistic proposal.
This type of development of our natural resources will
change the direction of government in the 1980s, as mentioned
in the Throne Speech, and this type of project will re-establish
that spirit of partnership and renewal so fundamental to our
federation.
There are many other points that I would like to mention,
but the hour is getting late. Finally, I would like to say that we
in eastern Canada have serious economic and social problems,
such as the disease of poverty, unemployment, and the highest
cost of living in the country. It seems to be beyond our ability
to cope with such problems.
The Prime Minister has already shown unprecedented
action in yielding control over offshore resources to coastal
provinces, and has set an example of the new harmony and
co-operation that will prevail in our federal system. Hopefully,
as a result of this new spirit of co-operation, the eastern
provinces-those provinces which are embarrassingly termed
"have-not" provinces, and I include Quebec-will receive an
injection of renewed hope. Not only will it allow the Atlantic
provinces to reach new economic goals, but it will allow them
to shake off their dependence on equalization payments.
Although the details of working out the implications of such
control will require long and detailed federal-provincial examination, it brings new hope to the poorer regions of this country.
It is for this reason, honourable senators, that I feel confident that the Throne Speech has already shown the meaningful intent of the Prime Minister to re-establish the spirit of
partnership which is fundamental to this great nation of
Canada.
On motion of Senator McElman, for Senator Austin, debate
adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, October 23, at 8 p.m.

An inquiry may be brougbî t0 the attention of the Attorney

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
ENERGY
MOVEMENT OF OIL FROM ALASKA TO LOWER FORTY-EIGHT
STATES

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, my question is for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and relates to
the issue of a proposed western oil pipeline for the movement
of oil from Alaska.
In questioning earlier today in the other place, it became
obvious that the Secretary of State for External Affairs, the
Honourable Miss MacDonald, and other ministers of the
Crown, played a decidedly minor role in conveying messages to
the United States as to Canada's preference for the Foothills
proposal of an overland route for the proposed pipeline.
This is in direct contradiction to answers given in this
chamber last week by the minister, who suggested that several
of his colleagues had been involved in discussions with their
U.S. counterparts, stating Canada's preference for the Foothills proposal and our opposition to any route involving tanker
traffic.
My question now is this: Will the minister tell us-and i
suggest that it would be in the public interest to produce dates
and give specific information-about the occasions on which
ministers of this government spoke to their U.S. counterparts
on this issue, with whom they were in contact, and what, in
detail, they said?
We are not asking for the divulgence of certain material,
some of which, necessarily, could be confidential.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I should like to say,
first of ail, to the Leader of the Opposition that had he listened
closely to the statements made in the other place today, he
80072-9

would have certainly heard the Secretary of State for External
Affairs state, quite directly, that she had raised the question
with Secretary Vance the last time they met. That was a very
clear and, to my mind, unequivocal statement.
I have already indicated that throughout the summer,
through a number of informal channels, we as a government
have indicated to American officiais, on eight occasions, that
we definitely favour the Foothills proposal, and I stand by that
statement.
Insofar as the exact dates on which these communications
took place, I shall be happy to inquire and inform this chamber. I should like once again to emphasize the fact that we as a
government have always supported the all-land route. We have
always supported the Foothilis project. We have repeatedly
made that clear, both at the officials' level and in the aidemémoire tabled this evening by my colleague. We have always
made that position abundantly clear to the U.S. government,
and it strikes me as rather strange that this line of questioning
would be pursued so aggressively when even the president of
the company has indicated publicly, in interview programs,
that he has enjoyed the full support of the government in
pursuing the Foothills alternative.
Senator Perrault: I know that aul of us are impressed with
the eloquence of the honourable the minister, but there is a
very definite lack of specific information here. When the
minister talks in terms of various members of the ministry
making vigorous representations to the Government of the
United States, we expect to be given the dates on which such
representations were made. The Secretary of State for External Affairs said in the other place today that she had conveyed
certain sentiments to Mr. Vance. We do not know the circumstances of those comments. Is there a memorandum with
respect to that meeting?
A matter as important as this one obviously is should carry
with it a good deal of supportive evidence, and no such
evidence has been made available to members of the Senate.
i should like to ask another question. Is this government
going to support, under any circumstances, a proposal to move
oil from Alaska to the lower forty-eight states, which would
involve increased tanker traffic, with aul of the ecological and
environmental dangers that would entail for Canada's west
coast?
Senator Asselin: Question!
Senator Perrault: Is that conceivable?
*

(2010)

Senator de Cotret: i answered that question during the
sittings of last week. i will answer it again. Our stated
preference, clearly indicated to the United States government,
time and time again, at the official level and at the level of
ministers and in the aide-mémoire, has been that Canada
preferred by far-and we indicated that preference clearlyan ail-land route, the Foothills proposal. We have serious
difficulties dealing with the environmental issues that would
arise from tanker route down the west coast. That position has
been made very clear, and if my honourable collcague would

SENATE DEBATES
read the aide-mémoire he would realize that we make it very
clear in that document that we are very much concerned about
the environmental spin-offs from a tanker route.
As to what we will do in the future if such and such should
happen, that is a hypothetical question that I am sure we will
answer if and when that situation arises. But our preference is
clear, and we have made that preference very clearly known.
Senator Perrault: The preference may be clear, Mr. Minister, but surely the question is: Is there any circumstances
under which the Government of Canada would support an
option which would lead to increased tanker traffic, whether
the government prefers the option at the present time or not?
Do you foresee that possibility, because that is of very grave
concern to many Canadians?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, the practice of
forecasting, foreseeing and soothsaying is one that I have left
behind in my past. I am not going to answer a hypothetical
question. I would be very happy to deal with the specifics of
the situation as they develop.
Senator Perrault: We are not attempting to plumb the
clairvoyant resources of the minister, but we would like him to
state emphatically here that this government will not support,
under any circumstances, an alternative which would lead to a
dangerous increase in tanker traffic on the west coast of
Canada. That is the only commitment we ask. It does not
require the qualities of a seer or a clairvoyant to reply to that
request.
Senator de Cotret: I shall make one very clear statement on
that, and that is that in any policy decision that the present
government takes it will take into full consideration, and act
in, the best interests of Canadians from coast to coast.
Senator Oison: A supplementary question, honourable senators. The government is so clear that it is going to support an
overland route and will not support a proposition increasing
tanker traffic along the west coast, so I wonder if the minister
has considered the legal ramifications of announcing this kind
of preference for one of competing applications for an oil
pipeline now before the National Energy Board, even before
the National Energy Board has heard the evidence and submitted their recommendations to cabinet.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I shall now quote
from the aide-mémoire because I should like to make clear
exactly what was said. Reading from the second paragraph, I
quote:
The Canadian Government cannot, of course, make any
final decisions until completion of National Energy Board
consideration of the applications now before it, on which
hearings are scheduled to commence on October 2, 1979.
As the US Government will be aware, a major preoccupation of the Canadian Government is the environmental
risk associated with crude-carrying tanker traffic off the
West Coast of Canada and into the waters of Juan de
Fuca Strait and Puget Sound. This concern relates to the
current levels of such traffic as well as to the prospect of
its increase resulting either from increased Alaskan or
increased off-shore crude. The Canadian Government's
[Senator de Cotret]

October 23, 1979

objective, therefore, must bc to minimize the risk of
environnental damage on the West Coast from oil tanker
traffic and to seek means whereby current risks, including
those in the sensitive inner waters of Juan de Fuca Strait
and Puget Sound, may if possible be reduced.
With these considerations in mind, the Canadian Government strongly opposes the Kitimat option and has a
clear preference for the*Foothills overland option because
it would reduce the number of tankers travelling along the
West Coast.
APPLICATIONS BEFORE NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD

Senator Oison: Does it follow then that the hearings now
involving Trans Mountain before the National Energy Board
arc really a charade because those recommendations coming
from the National Energy Board have to go to cabinet for
approval or rejection? If you have already announced that you
arc going to reject it, why go through the charade of having
the hearings?
e (2015)
Senator de Cotret: We have not made any announcements.
We have indicated the very clear preference. The hearings are
going on. I would only like to emphasize once again what 1
emphasized last week in this chamber, that the Foothills
proposal has been temporarily withdrawn-and I underline the
word "temporarily."
The government will act, as I mentioned carlier, in the best
interests of Canada. We have indicated a clear preference. The
normal process is going on, and we will sec that process
through.
Senator Perrault: Is there positive assurance, Mr. Minister,
that the Foothills application will be reinstated before the
National Energy Board before the end of October? Have
members of government been in contact with principals of
Foothills to determine the situation?
Senator de Cotret: No. I would have to say that the precise
answer to your question is "no." There is no specific assurance
that that will be the case. We have been told, and I believe it
has been said in the media, that the application was being
withdrawn temporarily.
I have had a brief, initial conversation with the president of
that corporation, and we have agreed that we will meet to
discuss the matter in full detail in the coming days. We are
trying to arrange a meeting, as a matter of fact, for early next
week, at which myself, my colleague the Minister of Energy
and my colleague the Minister of the Environment, would have
an opportunity to sit down and explore the matter further.
THE CONSTITUTION
RLCONSTITLTION OF SPECIAL SENATE COMMITTEF

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Deputy Leader of the Government. Is it the intention of

October 23, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

the deputy leader to reconstitute the Special Senate Committee on the Constitution of Canada which was established on
June 28, 1978 to study Bill C-60. It was just on the verge of
reporting when the 30th Parliament was dissolved and could
not complete its report. Is it the intention of the deputy leader
to reconstitute that committee?
Senator Roblin: I thank my honourable friend for the
question, and say that the matter is under discussion. I have
had some talks with the Leader of the Opposition on that
precise point, but I think we would prefer to continue our
discussions further with Senator Stanbury, who was the chairman of that committee, before arriving at a positive conclusion. The matter, however, will not be overlooked.

ENERGY
MOVEMENT OF OIL BY TANKERS

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the minister in charge of pipelines, et cetera. Has this
administration reaffirmed to the United States government
Canada's opposition to the construction of a massive oil refinery at Eastport, Maine, the supply of which would require
large tankers to use Head Harbour Passage, in the Bay of
Fundy, which is one of the most difficult and dangerous
passages anywhere along the coast of Canada? This opposition
was repeatedly expressed by the former administration, and i
should like to know if this administration has reaffirmed the
opposition of Canada to such a proposal?
Senator de Cotret: i will have to take notice of that question
and refer it to my colleague the Secretary of State for External
Affairs, and to my colleague the Minister of Energy, before
giving you a definite answer on whether reaffirmation of that
position has been made.

GRAIN

I also asked about the movement of grain in the last two
years, and I hope I can get that information as well.
* (2020)

Senator de Cotret: On the latter two questions, I hope to
have the answers for the honourable senator in the very near
future.
In terms of the Grains Group and the number of meetings
held, I would hesitate to quote a specific number. All I can
say, in reply to the honourable senator, is that I have been
assured by the minister responsible for the Wheat Board, who
is the Chairman of the Grains Group, that there have been
numerous meetings with the Grains Group since the government came to power, and that the Grains Group was extensively consulted in the acquisition of hopper cars and the renovation of boxcars; that the group has been active throughout that
period and is filling the role that it has traditionally filled.
As i mentioned the other day, the minister responsible also
assured me that, in terms of the mandate of the Grains Group,
he was considering requesting not only an extended mandate,
or a renewal of the mandate, but also a strengthened mandate.
In his view, the Grains Group had played a very important role
in the discussions that had gone on over the past four to five
months.
Senator Steuart: As a supplementary, is the minister telling
me that the Grains Group, as a group and not individually, has
met on several occasions with the Minister of Transport, the
minister in charge of the Grains Group?
Senator de Cotret: That is my understanding. i stand to be
corrected. I shall be happy to verify if they have met as a
group, and will give the honourable senator the specific dates
on which they met.
My understanding, from conversations with the minister
responsible, is that the Grains Group have met and had been
involved in the decisions that were taken in grain handling over
the summer months. I shall be happy to verify that
information.

STATUS OF GOVERNMENT ADVISORY GROUP

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, i should like to direct
a question to Senator de Cotret. Last week I asked a question
about the Grains Group. He was kind enough to reply that it
was still active and still operating.
I should like to ask him today if he could supply me with the
number of occasions since the new Conservative government
took over that the Grains Group bas met as a group-that is
all three of them. I would like to know how often they have
met, when they have met and with what ministers they have
met.
I asked him a series of questions last Wednesday, among
which was a request to give me information about the movement of grain in the last four months. He volunteered that he
would be pleased to give it to me for the last four months, the
last four years, or for the last 40 years. I haven't got it yet, but
information respecting the last four months would be fine. I
hope he hasn't got his officials working on the last 40 years.

INDUSTRY
CONSTR UCTION-EFFECT OF HIGH INTEREST RATES

Senator Bosa: My question is for the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce. Has this government considered, or is it
considering, a two-tier interest rate, which would continue to
encourage capital to flow into this country and prevent capital
from flowing out, and which would also assist the ailing
building industry? I have learned from a reliable source that
some companies are on the verge of bankruptcy because of the
high interest rates.
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge, we are not
considering a two-tier interest rate system in this country. I
know of very few such systems that have been able to operate
successfully. I will be happy to consult my colleague, the
Minister of Finance, to verify the accuracy of the answer I
have just given.

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Bosa: 1 bave a supplementary question. Does the
minister know what measures the goverfiment bas taken 10
alleviate the difficulties presently facing the building industry?
Senator de Cotret: As I mentioned last week, we have
indicated lime and lime again that one of the important
measures tbat we would introduce is a tax credit against
mortgage interest payments; and certainly, to the extent tbat
interesl rates are affecting the building industry, sucb a measuire wouid be of considerable help 10 the industry and would
provide considerable relief to those Canadians wbo arc seeking
relief, who are atîempting 10 buy a borne for the first time, and
10 those wbo are already homeowners and wbo bave 10
renegotiate their morîgages. 1 believe the measure will be of
immense help 10 that category of Canadians wbo are affected
by the increase of mortgage inlerest rates aI the moment.
Senator Bosa: I bave a furîber supplcinentary. The minister
is îelling me that the proposed morîgage inlerest tax credit will
stimulate the building industry. But that is a permanent
measure; it is not something that was devised by this goverfiment 10 stimulate the building industry.
Can the minister tell us wheîber be bas any intention of
providing the building indusîry with sometbing like the smalî
business incentive program, or the boans that are made 10
farmers 10 assisî îbem tbrougb Ibis difficult period? Is there a
similar program being considered for the building industry?
Senator de Cotret: That is a reasonable question, and 1 hope
the bonourable senator will not consider my answer in any way
as being an attempt 10 avoid giving a direct answer. 1 believe
he wili bave 10 await the presentation of the budget by the
Minister of Finance t0 gel the specific answer 10 that question.
Senator Bosa: When?
Senator de Cotret: Soon.

ENERGY
PROFITS OF- MULiTINATIONAL OIL CORPORATIONS

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators. I would like 10 ask
the Nlinistry of Industry. Trade and Commerce bow the
federal government can continue to tolerate and even jusîify
furîher the windfall profits of Canadian subsidiaries of multinational oil companies in the face of whaî is almost a tbreat
that consumers will face an oil shortage Ibis winîer if demnands

Senator de Cotret: First of ail, lcI me put any doubts aside
about our facing an oil shortage Ibis winter. I can assure tbe
bonourable senator îbaî we are not going to face an oil
shortage Ibis winter, and that my colleague, the Ninister of
Energy. Mines and Resourees, is monitoring the situation very
closely. As a malter of fact. I bave specific answers 10 questions raised last week that I would like 10 table later on with

The honourable senator has raised a question about the
profits of oul corporations. There have been reports recentlyn the Iast few days, as a matter of fact-of certain very
significant increases in profits. 1 would like to point out once
again that profits in and by themselves are nol a cause for
concern. A cause for concern might be what is 10 be done with
those profits. To the extent that those profits are re-invested in
the industry by which they are generated, in order to create
more employment, develop more sources of supply and ensure
that we as Canadians are in a better position 10 cope with the
demands that are placed on the industry in the years to corne,
then those profits are good. To the extent that they may be
distributed abroad. or invesîed in other industries, tbey may
constitute an item that would cause concern. The situation,
bowever, is being monitored constantly. Certainly we would
want and expect that the profits generated by the industry will
be re-invested in that vcry iiidustry 10 improve the industry's
productivity, efficiency and supply.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
(OVFRNMENT
FORE IGN AID POLICY OF<

Senator Oison: 1 wonder if 1 might direct a question 10 the
Nlinister of State for CIDA, and ask him whether or flot the
government bas now insîituted and provided bim with a new
set of guidelines for use wben considering approval of grants
for development, food aid, military aid, and so on.
Senator Asselin: The only tbing 1 can say 10 the honourable
senator is wbat 1 have said before, namely, that the government intends 10 establisb a committee of Parliament t0 study
forcign aid and forcign policy. Wc hopc tbat this commTittee is
going 10 bc established as soon as possible, in order that we
may receive ils conclusions by the montb of June.
Senator Oison: Weil, honourable senators, 1 would like to
suggest to the Minister of State that food producers, flour
millers, et cetera, would like to know wbat the guidelines are
because lhey have 10 make important decisions respecting
these matters. in view of the fact that the Secretary of State
for External Affairs bas announced that political considerations, and other tbings, will now corne mbt the situation. and
that food aid is not simply going 10 be based on humanitarian
grounds, as il was in the past.
Senator Asselin: As far as 1 know the situation, 1 can assure
the bonourable senator tbat the guidelines have flot been
changed up 10 now. If there are any changes coming up 1 arn
sure the producers are going to be awarc of tbem.
Senator Oison: A final supplementary. Does tbe minister
think it is fair and just for other people in Ibis industry 10 bave
10 wait until June before a new set of guidelines is issued?
Furthermore, if that is so. can he guarantee la those people
wbo are involved in producing these food produets for foreign

THE PUBLIC SERVICE
STATEMENTS BY SENIOR OFFICIALS

* (2030)

ENERGY
SECURITY OF FUEL SUPPLIES

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. I was
quite interested in his reply to Senator Haidasz that there will
be no shortage of oil this winter in eastern Canada. I would
draw to his attention an article in the Ottawa Citizen of
October 17 under the heading "Gas pump lineups may be
facing Maritimers, N.B. minister says." The interview was
with the Honourable Mr. Fernand Dubé who is the New
Brunswick finance minister and also minister responsible for
energy policy. The newspaper report reads:
Fernand Dubé who is also finance minister, said in an
interview gasoline will be in short supply over the next
nine months with a small deficit forecast for Atlantic
Canada for the entire period.
He said there will be an adequate but fragile supply of
heating oilIt goes on:
Dubé said the supply of oil in every form will be short
for the next nine months, "which means that if people
don't cut down there will have to be drastic measures."
He said those drastic measures would probably result in
line-ups at gasoline pumps.
Would the minister explain to us this difference of view, and
perhaps gain for us the information that must be available to
Mr. Dubé but which he obviously does not have?
Senator de Cotret: First of all, I do have this information for
my honourable colleague. Either my honourable colleague did
not read the Citizen of October 18 or the Citizen thought it
better not to publish the follow-up story which might dispel the
scary headlines which appeared on October 17.
As soon as that statement was reported, officials of the
National Energy Board got in touch with the deputy minister
responsible in New Brunswick and were assured that the
minister, first of all, had been misquoted in that newspaper
article and, secondly, that the minister was going to make a
statement that very afternoon to set the record straight. What
he was really saying at that time was that conservation was a
serious business and had to be pursued very actively.
To the best of my knowledge the minister did make that
correction and did indicate that he had been misquoted, but
either those stories did not appear in the local press or my
honourable colleague did not see them. However, there is no
indication that there is going to be any kind of shortage of that
nature in the maritimes in the coming months or for the next
nine months. It was an out-and-out misquote.
Senator McElman: I am grateful for this reassurance of the
minister.

Senator McElman: I should like to direct a question to the
Deputy Leader of the Government. On the weekend I viewed a
television interview given by Mr. Marcel Masse, the Clerk of
the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet, and I might
say, a man for whose ability and integrity I have the utmost
admiration. However, in the interview he suggested that senior
bureaucrats should speak out publicly to explain or defend-I
believe that is the word he used-their activities in administering the policies and programs of the government. My question
is: Is this a new departure in Canadian affairs that senior
bureaucrats should speak publicly, and would this indicate a
diminution of ministerial responsibility?
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I really have no
means of ascertaining what Mr. Masse said. I did not hear the
interview in question and, therefore, really feel that it would
not be my place to comment upon it. It has to stand by itself.
However, I would say that the Government of Canada, as
everybody knows, is giving consideration to relations between
Parliament and the civil service, and matters of that kind. I
would not be surprised, nor would I be disappointed, if an
attempt was made to draw a clearer line around the term
"ministerial responsibility".
It seems to me that in this country we have been inclined to
adhere to a view of ministerial responsibility that was appropriate in the days when ministers really were able to run their
departments from a detailed point of view, which is perhaps
not so appropriate today, when they certainly must be responsible for policy. Whether or not they should take the same
responsibility for every act committed by any person in the
department is a matter, I think, open to debate.
If one examines the concept of ministerial responsibility as it
has developed in the United Kingdom it will be seen that there
has been a trend in the direction of trying to draw a line
between what is an administrative responsibility, for which the
deputy might answer directly to the house, and what is a
ministerial responsibility with respect to matters of policy,
which I strongly suspect will remain quite unchanged.
I must tell honourable senators that these are entirely
speculations on my part, but I do think this question would be
a very appropriate one to discuss when we are considering the
relations of Parliament with the executive, which is on the
agenda for consideration in the near future.
Senator McElman: I thank the honourable senator for his
reply. In light of the fact that this is comment by the highest
profile public servant of this administration, the Clerk of the
Privy Council, would the deputy leader on our behalf inquire
whether this was a kite-flying operation, or whether it is based
on some substance? It should be quite within his capacity to
speak with the honourable gentleman and inquire what was
involved.
Senator Roblin: I suspect that this is a matter in which the
Prime Minister might interest himself, if anybody did, because
of the position occupied by Mr. Masse. I should be glad to

SENATE DEBATES

inquire whether there is any intention by the Prime Minister to
make a statement on the subject.

EXPANSION OF CANADA'S ROLE

Senator Haidasz: I should like to ask a question of the
GOVERNMENT POLICY

Senator Bosa: I should like to address this question to the
appropriate minister. I have learned from a reliable source
that a delegation of hog farmers made representations to this
government not to proceed with metrication as it applies to
their industry. Will the appropriate minister reassure this
house that this government is proceeding with that policy; and
if not, what is the policy of this government in that respect?
Senator Roblin: I presume my honourable friend is inquiring
about the general attitude of the government towards metrication. I think it is a matter of public knowledge that the
minister in charge has established a committee which is now
engaged in reviewing the progress of metrication. I think it is
the Minister of State for Small Businesses and Industry who
has this matter in hand. No doubt the complaints of the hog
farmers will be included in the review he is making.
FISHERIES
PROPOSED WHITE PAPER-INVOLVEMENT OF WEST COAST
INDIANS

Senator Williams: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Deputy Leader of the Government. In
the Speech from the Throne we read:
You will be asked to consider a White Paper on future
development of our fisheries resources, prepared in consultation with fishermen, the fishing industry and the
provinces.
My first question is: Will the Indian fishermen, who comprise a large section of the fishing fleet on the west coast, be
involved and included? Secondly, in the future development,
will the government give consideration to involving and including the three rivers that pass through what is known as the
panhandle of Alaska?
To make it clear, let me point out that a good portion of the
return of migrating salmon reproduces in the Canadian areas
of these rivers. The fourth river is the Yukon itself, which
flows through the whole width or length of Alaska--call it
what you may-where some of the salmon travel over 2,000
miles to reach areas of reproduction. Will this be given consideration as a future development? I ask this because our
fisheries in Canada are not involved and included in the
harvesting of this salmon migration.
Senator Roblin: I thank the honourable senator very much
for his observations, because

I think

they are very much to the

point. I will see to it that this is brought to the attention of the
Minister of Fisheries when he is developing his policy in this
respect.
[Senator Roblin.]

Defence matters. On the occasion of the Twenty-fifth Annual
Session of the North Atlantic Assembly now being held in
Ottawa, what specific action has the federal government taken
to expand Canada's role in NATO, other than agonizing over
a decision respecting a much needed fighter aircraft for the
Canadian armed forces?
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, that would require a
very long answer, and I am not in a position to give it tonight.
If you will permit me, I will take that question as notice and
give an answer at a later date.
PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS
FIRE PROTECTION

Senator Molson: Honourable senators, I should like to
address a question to the Deputy Leader of the Government. I
know it is not one that he can answer immediately, and
therefore perhaps it should be put in writing, but I think it has
a certain urgency.
Would he find out for the Senate what arrangements there
are for the protection of these buildings in case of fire? I am
sure most honourable senators present saw the fire this evening
across the square, which destroyed a very handsome building
that is part of the scene on Parliament Hill. I know that some
of us who watched saw a very small amount of smoke for a
period of approximately forty minutes before it really began to
be a conflagration. My immediate question to myself was:
What arrangements do we have?
None of us can forget that over sixty years ago these
buildings were gutted. Are we dependent on the Ottawa Fire
Department? If not, are we dependent on the armed forces or,
God forbid, have we got Public Works to take care of us? I
think it is sufficiently important, having been reminded by that
most sad and unpleasant sight of that very serious fire tonight,
and is a question that is well worth asking and obtaining a
satisfactory reply to, in order to be assured that there are
satisfactory arrangements for the protection of these valuable
buildings.
Senator Roblin: I should be pleased to bring my honourable
friend and the house a full report on the fire protection
measures for this building as soon as I can.
Senator Bosa: I should like to ask a supplementary question.
Will the Deputy Leader of the Government also ask if it is
intended to install a sprinkler system in this building?
Senator Roblin: I can only say that I know of no such
intention at the moment. I think that when the report is
produced on the fire protection measures that are in force it
will provide an opportunity for those interested to read them
and, if they are thought inadequate, to make representations,
or perhaps initiate a debate on the subject.

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Haidasz: Would the deputy leader also make a
private tour of corridor 160-S where there are two offices
accommodating senators' secretaries, plus the office of the security staff of the Senate, plus the printing facilities, plus the
stationery supply and other offices? In that corridor there are
piles of boxes three or four feet high taking up over half the
space of the corridor.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I shall certainly be
happy to ask the fire commissioner to take a stroll through
there. I am sure he would be better able to comment on the
suitability of the arrangements than I am. However, I thank
my honourable friend for bringing this matter to our notice.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE

In answer to a question concerning the supply to independent dealers, the minister asked me to assure you that his office
is keeping a daily watch on the issue. He sent a telex to
refiners and terminal operators stating that viability of deficient resellers must be maintained. He requested, specifically,
the industry to co-operate by not altering substantially their
trade-class mix, by continuing to supply customers according
to requirements, by not arbitrarily denying contract renewal,
and by taking on new independent reseller customers.
He has also required the National Energy Board to review
space allocation in the Interprovincial Pipeline.
I would like to assure honourable senators that a copy of the
telex is available to them if they wish to see it.

LOSS OF SALE OF CANDU REACTOR TO ARGENTINA

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, if I may, I wish to
answer some of the questions that were asked of me last week.
First of all, in answer to a question by Senator Lamontagne,
I tabled last week the English translation of the text by Mr.
Castro Madero, dealing with the Argentinian situation.
Tonight I would like to table the French version. As was the
case with the English version, this is a preliminary and certainly an unofficial translation of the text provided to us by the
Government of Argentina.
Therefore I table:

by the President of Atomie Energy Commission, Argentina, with respect to contract decisions for Atucha Il and

ORDER IN COUNCIL APPOINTING MINISTER OF STATE TABLED

Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, last week an inquiry
was made as to my status of minister within cabinet. For the
information of Senator Lamontagne, I should like to table a
copy of the Official Gazette of Canada, dated June 27, 1979,
where on page 2428 is registered the order in council under the
Ministries and Ministers of State Act designating me Minister
in Charge of the Canadian International Development
Agency.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
POSSIBLE SALE OF ASSETS OF CANADAIR

ENERGY
SECURITY OF FUEL SUPPLIES

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, in answer to questions raised by Senator Haidasz dealing with the question of
supply, I discussed the issue with my colleague the Minister of
Energy, Mines and Resources, and he has assured me that
actions have been taken to ensure adequate supply of heating
oil in the months to come.
He has curtailed crude oil exports to keep the pipeline fed so
the Canadian refiners will be fully supplied, and he has
facilitated the exchange of western Canadian oil for additional
eastern imports. Officials, in addition, are keeping close touch
both with the industry and with the provinces. And at the
moment, the national outlook for the first quarter of 1980 is
that programmed supply should be adequate to meet forecasted product demand, given normal weather conditions, with an
acceptable closing inventory level.
Both the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and
officials from the National Energy Board are keeping in close
touch with resellers seeking, by all possible means, to create
the conditions for them to get product supply.

Senator Denis: Honourable senators, may I put a question
to the Minister of State for Economic Development with
regard to the possible or probable sale of Canadair?
Considering that it is possible, though not very probable,
that Quebec may become independent, which would make of it
a foreign country; considering that you said that you would not
sell to a foreign country, I should like to know: first, whether
the minister has been approached by the Quebec government
about the possible, probable or eventual sale of Canadair and,
second, whether the minister, or the government, will take a
chance in selling Canadair to the Quebec government without
knowing what may happen after the referendum, etc.?
Senator de Cotret: First of all, I should like to answer no to
the first question: we have not been approached by the Quebec
government with regard to the eventual sale of Canadair.
In answer to your second question: the honourable senator
may rest assured that this government really intends to keep
Quebec not only an integral part, but as a very viable part of
the Canadian confederation, of a renewed confederation. That
is what it is striving for at this time. To my mind, the matter of

SENATE DEBATES
the Quebec separation is most hypothetical and should not be
introduced in a debate concerning a company like Canadair. I
am convinced that Quebec will remain an integral, a viable
part of our Canadian confederation.
Senator Denis: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary.
What the minister says, we know. That is what we imagine.
That is what we think. It is probable. But since it is possible
that the province of Quebec may become independent, are you
going to wait to be convinced before selling Canadair to a
foreigner?
Senator de Cotret: It is an entirely hypothetical question
which I would prefer not to answer in its present form as it is
purely hypothetical. I would simply like to repeat what I said
last week. We will, of course, consider any purchase offer from
one province or another for any crown corporation that is to be
returned to the private sector.
However, as we want to return those corporations to the
private sector, we would prefer, of course, not to sel] them to
one province or another. That applies to Quebec as it applies to
Alberta, to Ontario or to ail other provinces.
We would prefer to sec those corporations which are considered to have a commercial role to play in the private sector,
returned to the private sector. But we are not necessarily
excluding the possibility of one province or another expressing
an interest. We would then deal appropriately with the
request, the petition, or the offer that could be made by one
province or another concerning the disposition of one or
another of those crown corporations.
Senator Denis: I understand the intention of the government. But what I would like to know is whether the government intends to put in the contract-since you say it is possible
a province could buy a part or ail of Canadair-can the
government assure this house that there will be a proviso to the
effect that if the province of Quebec were to become independent afterwards, the contract would be cancelled. What I want
to know is what will the government be doing in the
meantime?
Senator de Cotret: The senator pointed out I had said it was
possible, even probable, that a province would acquire a crown
corporation. I am simply saying that we are not automatically
excluding the possibility of a province indicating an interest.
We will then deal with the situation.
Senator Denis: This was discussed, so do not repeat the
same thing.
Senator de Cotret: You are asking me a question, so wait for
the answer. What will happen is another thing altogether. You
are asking if we would allow them to purchase it. Well, they
have not even expressed an interest. So why ask questions like
that?

Senator Denis: This was discussed in the papers.
Senator de Cotret: The Government of Quebec indicated
very clearly it would prefer to see the corporation sold to
[Senator de Cotret ]

October 23, 1979

Quebecers. Mr Landry, a minister, told me so himself. He
never told me the Government of Quebec itself wanted to
acquire that corporation.
Senator Denis: You contradicted yourself. You said earlier
you had not been approached about that. You are now saying
Mr. Landry told you so. So you met. So you were not telling
the truth when you said that.
Senator de Cotret: No, noSenator Denis: Just a moment. This is very important
because we are talking about a sale worth $40 million or $50
million. So if you sell Canadair to provincial interests and in
the spring that province becomes an independent country, then
I am asking the government to take its precautions. That is
what I ask. It does not cost anything to include in the sale
contract, if they became independent, or otherwise, a clause
indicating the contract would then be cancelled.
Senator Asselin: That is not whatSenator Denis: Is it your intention-I hear the Minister of
State for CIDA-is that your department?
Senator Asselin: I do not know.
Senator Denis: If I may, is there really a Department of
CIDA? The Minister of CIDA can ask all the questions he
wants later on, but I want to know what precautions the
government has taken if it does not want to sell Canadair to
foreign interests.
Senator Asselin: Let him reply.
Senator Denis: He can defend himself.
Senator Asselin: Your question is hypothetical.
Senator de Cotret: We have said very clearly and repeatedly
that we would sell certain crown corporations to the private
sector, to Canadians. You asked the question earlier and you
even accused me of having misled you by saying that Quebec
never showed any interest in the matter.
Senator Denis: You spoke to Minister Landry.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, I spoke to him as I speak to the
ministers of ail the provinces, but he showed no interest.
Senator Denis: You talk about movies and so on.
Senator de Cotret: Yes and of many other things which are
ail quite interesting.
Senator Denis: But you always repeat the same thing.
Senator de Cotret: The Quebec government indicated that it
had an interest in the matter, namely that the corporation be
sold to Quebecers, but it never said that it was interested in
purchasing the corporation itself. If they are interested, they
should tell us, and we shall then sec what provisions we can
make, as we will do if Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan or any
other province shows any interest in acquiring a crown corporation. We will decide then. What we want is to return the
crown corporations to the private sector. Our interest is very
clearly defined in this sense, but we want to return these
corporations to the Canadian private sector. This is a matter of

October 23, 1979

principle which has been firmly established. Therefore, I do
not sec exactly where this hypothetical question is leading us.

I might say by way of information that the question of
establishing these committees is being pursued vigorously. I
hope we will be able to advise the Senate as to these matters
shortly.

THE HON. HORACE ANDREW (BUD) OLSON, P.C.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

APPOINTMENT AS DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, if the Question
Period has concluded, may I say that, while last week all of us
were sorry to hear of the resignation for personal reasons, of
Senator Langlois as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and
Opposition House Leader in the Senate, I am now happy to
announce that Senator Olson has been chosen for that post,
with the support of all Liberal senators.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I think the welcome
expressed on this side of the house speaks eloquently for our
approval of this move. Although I was not privileged to
participate in the voting for Senator Olson as Deputy Leader
of the Opposition when this position was voted on in the
Liberal caucus, I should say that had I been there he would
have received my franchise. I am glad to see him sitting where
he is and glad to welcome him into a very small club consisting
of him and me. We carry an honourific title, but I think most
senators will realize that we Joe-boys-perhaps that is not
quite the word I am searching for-have a little work to do.
Senator Olson: Honourable senators, I should like to express
to my colleagues who were at the caucus my appreciation for
their confidence in me. I should also like to say that I sincerely
hope I will be able to fill the shoes of Senator Langlois.
Senator Langlois set a very high standard while carrying out
his duties as deputy leader, a standard I do not expect to
achieve too quickly.
To my opposite number, Senator Roblin, and to you, Mr.
Speaker, I should say that in carrying out my duties as
Opposition House Leader, I will try to be as co-operative as I
can to ensure that the business and decorum of this chamber
will be carried out in a satisfactory manner. I would, however,
caution the Deputy Leader of the Government and his colleagues in the cabinet that from time to time during Question
Period my other duty as Deputy Leader of the Opposition will
emerge, and in that respect, of course, I will try to do what i
can. However, I cannot guarantee that there will not be times
when we are severely provoked at some of the answers.

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 18, consideration-of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Bielish,
seconded by Senator Charbonneau, for an Address in reply
thereto.
Senator Austin: Honourable senators, my first words in
rising to participate in this debate on the Speech from the
Throne are words of congratulations to our new Speaker.
Senator Grosart will play for this chamber and for the Parliament of Canada an important role in representing us in many
circumstances, outside of Ottawa and outside of Canada. The
impression which is given by our new Speaker will be an
impression which represents this chamber and also Parliament.
I believe I speak on behalf of all senators in saying how
confident we are that Speaker Grosart's abilities and experience will speak well on our behalf.
Our new Speaker also has a role to play of great importance
in the development of the work of this house as it enters a new,
dynamic and, I venture to say, even more responsible period
than it has recently had. I have every confidence that our
Speaker will discharge his duties away from partisanship and
with clarity and fairness.
I should like also to say a few words regarding Senator
Lapointe, who served us so well as Speaker in the last Parliament. The grace and charm of her nature exemplified some of
the attributes to which this house aspires. She created an
excellent impression for the Senate and for Canada wherever
her duties took her, and she always held the affection of all
senators in this chamber. Now that her duties have changed,
we on the opposition side of the chamber look forward to
seeing the more partisan side of her nature, one which, in the
past as a member of the editorial staff of a major Quebec
newspaper, struck terror and, even more, stabbed truth and
clarity into the hearts of the impure. Beware those of us in this
chamber who are impure.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, in view of the fact
that we are still in the process of forming our committees, I
wonder if the Senate would agree that it is desirable to stand
the first three items on the Orders of the Day until such time
as these committees are set up.

80072-10

* (2100)

Honourable senators, in the last Parliament there was much
debate about the role and nature of this chamber and about its
future. The Trudeau government introduced Bill C-60 for the
purpose of discussing many constitutional questions, and it
raised issues about the representational effectiveness of the
Senate. Under Senator Stanbury, a special committee of this
chamber undertook a serious and significant review of the
Senate and its role. I hope, honourable senators, that the
substance of the work of Senator Stanbury's committee will be
carried forward at an appropriate time.

SENATE DEBATES
There are, of course, many views, both in this chamber and
elsewhere, as to how an appointed chamber can best discharge
ils responsibility to assist in providing the Canadian people
with an effective and useful contribution to the working of the
Canadian democracy. I spoke at length on this subject in this
chamber on December 14, 1978, and I do not now intend to
repeat my remarks, although I certainly stand by them. The
Clark government has said that it sees no constitutional reform
of this chamber as being required and that il believes that, by
its appointment of new senators and thrce ministers, this
chamber will be given an opportunity to demonstrate the
validity of the reasons for which il was created in the first
place. I think that is a challenge for us, and one worthy of us
ail. Indeed, we will be judged in future years by how effectively the attitudinal changes which have been introduced by the
Clark government affect the Senate and how they enhance the
work we do and how our work is appreciated by the people of
Canada.
I welcome the new senators who joined us at the beginning
of this new Parliament and look forward to working with them
and to their contribution to the public service. I would like to
say just a few words on what I believe to be the role and duties
of this chamber. As senators have said before me, we are nut a
partisan body responsible at every point for the criticism or the
defence of the government of the day. The government will not
rise or fall on what happens in this chamber.
As a result of the presence of three ministers, we do of
course have the responsibility to ensure that, in the discharge
of their ministerial duties, they are held accountable to the
Canadian people. Our vigorous Question Period is proof positive that the Senate is fully capable of ensuring that government ministers in the Senate will not feel lackadaisical in their
responsibilities.
At the same lime, the presence of three ministers in this
chamber does not alter the fact that the Senate's principal
purpose is one of keeping under review the behaviour of the
executive branch of the government to ensure that it is not
arbitrary and that such behaviour is within the conventions of
the Constitution as we know and practice them in Canada. We
do this in many ways, but principally through some of the best
committee work performed anywhere in this Parliament,
whether in the examination of legislation or in the analysis of
policy questions which, at least when we begin the analysis, are
nut required as partisan issues in the country.
i believe it vital that senators, who wish to express their
partisanship in the thrust of question-answer during the Question Period in order to discharge one of the responsibilities of
this chamber, the accountability of the ministry, set aside
day-to-day partisanship in other Senate work so that the
Senate as a parliamentary institution can play ils full role as a
deliberative body, capable of seeing and acting beyond partisanship, on behalf of the public interest. As we would say in
the west, once we leave the Question Period, senators should
check their political pistols at the committee room door.
[Senator Austindj

October 23, 1979

I should like to congratulate the mover and the seconder of
the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, Senators Bielish and Charbonneau, on their first
contributions. Theirs is a commendable beginning. Each
speaks from a knowledge of important regions and sections of
this country. I hope they remain in active service in our work.
There is one aspect of Senate representation to which I
should like to speak at this point. We in western Canada have
had a long-standing complaint that, with our increasing population and our increasing economic strength, we have not been
appropriately represented in the federal process. The House of
Commons, of course, stands as a chamber that is represented
by population. This chamber, as acknowledged by students of
the origins and role of the Senate, is the place where regional
representation is expected to be emphasized.
The western region is not effectively represented in this
chamber. The Premier of British Columbia, Premier Bennett,
in past constitutional debate has argued that British Columbia,
if il were to have recognition in relation to ils population and
ils economic strength, should have a minimum of 12 senators.
I know that ail honourable senators would like to see more
effective western representation in this chamber, and I would
propose to the government that a bill be brought in increasing
the representation in the four western provinces to 10 senators
for each of those provinces. This would bring the representalion of my province and the other western provinces to the
level which is now established for each of those great provinces
of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It would add 16 senators
in ail to our body and make a great deal more effective the
work of senators from cach of the four western provinces.
I know that what in effect may be created is the possibility
that the Progressive Conservative Party would have an additional 16 senators. I know that the leader of that party and his
aides would not of course want to bring about such a result,
although I can imagine that they would wish to have some say
in the appointments in question.
Senator Bosa:
appointments.

They would

not be

partisan in their

Senator Austin: Well, I believe that Mr. Clark would
undoubtedly want to consult the Leader of the Opposition in
the appointment of those western senators. But without getting
into partisan issues, I simply ask this chamber and the government to recognize the problem of western representation in
this chamber and to proceed expeditiously to act on this
particular submission.
I have read and reread the Speech from the Throne without
feeling any sense that the Clark government understands the
basic questions which are troubling Canadians. How could a
comprehending government fail to deal with the twin threats
of political separatism and economic separatism which have
been thrust to the center of the national stage in the last 10
years? Where were the words of guidance to the people of
Quebec about the relationship of the federal government to the
issue of sovereignty association as outlined by Prime Minister
Levesque? What role will the Clark government play in the

October 23, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

key referendum debate in Quebec? How will the Clark government communicate on behalf of ail Canadians their desire for
a nation of political unity?
Ail we got was the broadest of rhetoric-words such as
"re-establish the spirit of partnership and renewal which are
fundamental to our Federation." But where is the leadership
which Canadians require if this nation is to be composed, first
and foremost, of Canadians rather than of Quebecers and
Ontarians, and so forth? If the government cannot speak for
and defend the national spirit of our country, who will?
Many Canadians were disappointed, too, with the absence of
a sense of direction at the economic level. Again, there is
rhetoric-"While our economy faces serious immediate problems, my Government believes the economic potential of
Canada is the strongest in the world."
What are we told? That a new expenditure management
system has been introduced; that the size of the public service
will be reduced, and that crown corporations will bc sold to the
private sector.
There is no honourable senator who will support any wastage in the limited resources that are available to Canadians to
conduct their lives, but I am one of those Canadians who
resents greatly the inarticulate premise in the Throne Speech
that government in Canada is somehow an entity to be considered hostile to the people's interests, somehow a malign
presence in the affairs of the Canadian people, somehow more
a burden to be carried than an instrument through which ail
Canadians act together to express their goals, both personally
and as a community.
I think Canadians have proven better than the people of any
other country what an effective instrument government can be
in the improvement of the life of the citizen without, as the
Throne Speech says, in any way damaging the economic
potential of Canada. Canadians have succeeded, through the
instrument of government, in creating one of the strongest and
best distributed economies amongst its citizens.
* (2110)

Look around the world and you will see that Canada is the
envy of the world both for the economic opportunity and for
the protection it provides its working people. Through the
instrument of government we have been able to put in place a
health care plan which is the envy of the world, and the same
is true with respect to our pension plans for senior citizens,
with respect to support for the unemployed and with respect to
support for those who due to circumstances are unable adequately to provide for themselves from time to time in their
lives. We have put a net of support for our people below which
no Canadian will be allowed to fall.
We have been able to do that because the Government of
Canada through the Parliament of Canada with the confidence
of the people of Canada has ably understood and expressed the
needs of individual Canadians. And, honourable senators,
those needs are not at an end. I sincerely hope that when the
Clark government says its ministers were given a mandate to
change the direction of the Government of Canada they did

not mean that they intend to build a private economy based on
ail the rewards going to the most productive, and ail the costs
going to those who are least able to defend themselves against
the initiatives of the mighty.
Again I see an inarticulate premise of social Darwinism
lurking in the rhetoric in the Speech from the Throne. While
the government encourages new initiative and talks about
measures to help individual Canadians build a stake in our
country, there is no indication of any special awareness that
the disadvantaged in our country, and they comprise an important part of our country, must be protected against initiative
which is not always socially responsible and enterprise which
does not always proceed out of a sense of conscience.
Frankly, I am fascinated with the total dependence of the
government on the private sector. I am a defender of the
private sector in many ways, but the government is building an
expectation in the people of Canada that somehow the private
sector in this country is capable of righting ail the economic
wrongs in our economy, is capable of producing, without help
from government institutions and without some concept of a
broad national economic plan, an economic result which will
give Canadians both wealth and an effective and equitable
distribution of that wealth. Were i active in the private sector
I would say to the government, "For God's sake don't burden
me with ail that responsibility; we may not be able to succeed,
and then what will happen to us?" The expectations that are
being created by this government for the performance of the
private sector are literally beyond reasonable reach of achievement. And what will be the result if that proves to be the case?
It will be the antithesis of the policy of this present government. There will be a charge against the private business
sector by the people of Canada that they have not performed,
that they are not capable of performing, and that they are
without the ability to support the public interest of the people
of this country. the public will feel misled, and an undeserved
day of retribution for the private sector will follow.
I ask the government to reconsider the nature and fullness of
the burden it is placing on the private sector in this country.
The private sector has a vital role to play. It can and should be
the leading agent of public policy in the development of the
resources and of the industry of this country. But the public
policy itself, its goals and purposes, is not the business of
business but of aIl the people of Canada, and their cares and
concerns are in the trust of the Government of Canada. What
the Clark government is doing is passing the buck, and if I
were a leader in the business community I would not accept it
on the terms offered.
Another area in the Speech from the Throne which disturbs
me is the rhetoric about a new era in federal-provincial
relations. How many times have we heard that in years gone
by? The Clark government says:
Consultation and cooperation will be the hallmarks of
that new era.
And who can be against a serious, meaningful effort in that
direction? But where is the language in the Throne Speech
that recognizes the emerging demands of Alberta to have a

SENATE DEBATES

natural gas exceeding 700 years and reserves of oil exceeding
300 years. Those figures subsequently, of course, turned out to
be anything but true. I do not accuse the industries of deliberately misleading. When you draw conclusions, you use certain
premises. Perhaps in this case those premises were not adequate premises or did not take into account certain factors
because they were not known at the time. There could be many
reasons. But I will never forget the embarrassment of a
minister of the Crown having to rely on data supplied by
foreign-controlled companies in order to describe what was the
nature of the Canadian oil and gas situation.
In 1970 I became Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources at the request of Prime Minister Trudeau, and he
gave me one clear mission. That was to lead a study of how the
oil and gas industry in this country operated and how the
energy system worked. This was not because he told me he had
anything in mind with respect to the industry, but because he
simply did not understand that vital sector of the Canadian
economy and he felt Canadians did not understand how it
worked either.
We undertook, honourable senators, to review the Canadian
energy system. That report was produced in June of 1973
under the title, "An Energy Policy for Canada."
Six weeks later OPEC made its first major price move. We
had been accused of being flagrantly irresponsible in predicting that OPEC would move the price of oil from $3 to $4 in
1974 and $4 to $5 in 1975 and from $5 to $6 in 1976. The
accusations came from the oil and gas industry. By October of
1973, three months after our report had appeared, the price
was at $6.
Within the context of that report we decided that we should
examine the role of a state petroleum corporation. We saw
that, with the exception of the United States, the major
western industrial states had their own state petroleum
corporations.
We asked ourselves these questions: What brought on the
advent of those corporations? What was the policy need they
were responding to? Were those corporations effective in
satisfying those needs? Were there parallel requirements in
Canada?
By the spring of 1973 our studies had led to the conclusion
that state participation in the oil and gas industry was a
requirement of Canadian energy policy. Nothing that has
happened in the meantime has changed my view of that
conclusion. The report I have mentioned has a full chapter on
the underlying rationale for a state petroleum corporation. I
invite honourable senators, who are interested in what I believe
is a vital area of national policy, to look at that report and to
look at that chapter.
Let me simply give a few of the key reasons why PetroCanada seemed justified at that time. First of all, as 1 have
been clearly saying, we lacked an adequate knowledge of the
Canadian resource base. We did not even understand the
methodology for an analysis of the Canadian resource base.
We needed a vehicle which had the competence to do that.

Second, we lacked in the Government of Canada any knowledge whatever of how the oil and gas industry operated. We
lacked a technical expertise to evaluate its operating procesures. We lacked the insight to judge its rate of return
considerations. We did not know what a fair reward was for
the industry and we did not know what a fair price was for the
Canadian consumer.
Third, the Canadian oil and gas industry largely controlled
by foreign companies, as I have said, was also largely controlled by foreign executives. While Canada had discovered oil
at the time of the First World War and had discovered oil in
attractive quantities just before the beginning of the decade of
the fifties, we had not developed in any serious way the
executive and technical competence to run our own oil and gas
industry.
Bright Canadians, who had that competence, and there were
many, were quickly moved off to the United States orelsewhere
to serve the corporate interests of the multinationals.

I can recall someone telling me with pride many years ago
that the head of Exxon was a Canadian who was born, I
believe, in Medicine Hat. Cold comfort for a Canadian energy
policy.
A more critical factor, and perhaps the critical factor, is
that we saw that the private sector would take only that degree
of risk which promised a commercial reward, that it would
take that degree of risk which was consistent with its commercial discount factor in risk taking.
Honourable senators, I wish to make it clear at this point
that I am not critical of that particular criterion I believe that
we should ask our private sector to take only that degree of
risk; otherwise we would be expropriating private capital for
some form of national purpose decided upon by some government entity.
But it leaves open the key issue of who will take those
degrees of risks that are beyond commercial risk taking, which
nonetheless must be taken if we are to know our resource base,
if we are to define it, if we are to understand, for policy-making purposes, whether in five, ten, twenty or thirty years we
may be able to bring onstream resources within Canada that
are vital to our security.
Honourable senators, there was no private corporation
which could, with consistent responsibility to its shareholders,
say that it could conceive of such long-term programs or that it
would enter exploration in high risk areas such as the Atlantic
offshore, the Labrador Straits, or the Arctic islands of this
country, or in the high technological risk areas such as the oil
sands or heavy oils. No private corporation would do that
without being able to see and understand when the cash would
come back. Corporations had to be able to see a return coming
from somewhere. As to defining the resource base for all
Canadians, they could not comprehend that as the responsibility of the private sector, and neither can I.

SENATE DEBATES
So it was into that requirement that state participation was
introduced in the Canadian oil and gas system. It was for that
need that Petro-Canada was created in the energy policy mix
of the mid- 1970s.
Honourable senators, there is no change in those circumstances. We still have that need. It is not a need that can be
fulfilled by some government agency simply with a role to play
in some distant project remote from commercial experience.
The Prime Minister has said that certain of those roles can
be fulfilled by private Canadian ownership and that the public
aspects, which investors should not take on, can be picked up
by some agency, spending the taxpayers' money in doing those
things. That money has to be spent by competent professionals.
It has to be spent in a vehicle in which there is a wide range of
technical experience, from raw exploration right through the
whole integrated package, that can be brought to bear on the
remote frontier project. It cannot be done by half a dozen
people who are given some money and told "Go out and do
something."
Of course, they could contract those programs to the private
sector. But they would pay the private sector the commercial
rate of return which is expected by the private sector.
What Petro-Canada offers is an endowment which is based
on the commercial discount factor, a cash flow that is available
from present operations, which can be invested in the high risk
areas on the concept of a social discount factor. Not that
Petro-Canada would lose money; not that Petro-Canada would
be wasteful; but that Petro-Canada would be willing to take a
higher order of risk in finding those answers for ail Canadians
than would commercial investors. The profit to Petro-Canada's
shareholders, the Canadian people, would not be in money but
in knowledge about their energy security.
Honourable senators, I have seen nothing in the public
affairs of Canada that so disappoints me, that is so incoherent
and downright silly as the report rendered by the committee
headed by Don McDougall. That committee, I have to say in
its defence, was not given a mandate to examine the question
of the need for Petro-Canada. It was given terms of reference,
as stated by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources on
September 7, simply to look into the modalities of how PetroCanada might be unwound and disbanded. What were the
ways that could be achieved?
Up until this point, honourable senators, we have not heard
a reasoned case being argued by the government with respect
to the destruction of Petro-Canada. Therefore it comes as a
shock that Prime Minister Clark finds the report of the
committee quite attractive.
I am pleased with one aspect of the Petro-Canada debate.
That is my understanding-which no doubt the Deputy
Leader of the Government will correct if it is not true-that
nothing will be donc to Petro-Canada and its subsidiaries
without legislation being introduced. I take it, Senator Roblin,
that we shall have a full opportunity to examine this question
when the real policy and purposes of the government are better
known'?
[Senator Austin.]

October 23, 1979

Senator Roblin: Is the honourable senator addressing a
question to me? Does he wish me to reply to it now?
Senator Austin: When I resume my seat I will be delighted
if the Deputy Leader of the Government would address himself to that one question, which I will restate: Will the Government of Canada, prior in any way to dealing with PetroCanada or any of its subsidiaries, proceed by introducing
legislation regarding Petro-Canada and its subsidiaries so that
the full purposes and proposais of the government can be made
known to the Canadian public before action is taken by the
government?
Honourable senators, in concluding, may I say that there
are many other issues related to energy policy on which I
would wish to address myself, but time does not permit me to
do so. I would like to talk about oil and gas pricing, the
imperative need of the federal government to obtain a fair
distribution of any rise in the price of energy in this country so
that it can conduct, under its national responsibility, programs
of equity that will fairly protect all Canadians in terms of the
impact of rising energy costs in this country. I would also like
to discuss the question of nuclear power. I welcome the
government's announcement in the Throne Speech that a joint
House of Commons and Senate committee will be established
to look into those vital issues, because I for one am desperately
worried about the availability of clectrical energy in this
country beginning with the next century if we do not proceed
to maintain some portion of our base power generated from a
nuclear system.
That does not mean that we do not have problems in the
nuclear industry. The question of waste disposal is an enormous problem. What we do need is a reasoned and reasoning
process and understanding by the people of Canada of what
nuclear power is and is not, its risks and its benefits to us. I
believe that the proposed joint committee, if it is allowed to do
its work fairly, will be of great benefit to Canadians.
Honourable senators, I know that there are others who are
waiting to address this chamber. Frankly, I never tire of
addressing this chamber; but my colleague Senator Frith is
pulling at my jacket and I will defer to him.

(2140)

Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I am not entering the
debate at this stage, but I would like to respond to the question
raised. It is my understanding that the Prime Minister has said
that Parliament will have an opportunity to fully consult on
the question of Petro-Canada when the government's policy is
known.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, in speaking to the
Speech from the Throne, I would like to echo what my learned
colleague, Senator Austin, has said about not wanting to let
the occasion go by without congratulating some of our colleagues particularly our Speaker, whose long years of hard
work and devotion to this chamber are going to do credit to his
office, to himself, to this chamber, to ail senators and to our
country. I congratulate him very sincerely. I know my feelings
are shared by all members of this house.

October 23, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Of course, it is very hard to say something about our
previous Speaker which, first, has not been said, and, secondly,
that might not sound routine, because the depth of admiration,
respect and gratitude for what she has done for our chamber,
and the genuine affection in which she is held, are so completely shared by all senators, and, in fact, by all parliamentarians
who have known her. i can only hope she will understand the
depth of my sincerity, and that of other senators who have
spoken, when I say how glad we are to have the opportunity to
congratulate her and thank her for all she has done for us.
Without necessarily accepting the concept of having cabinet
ministers in this chamber, I do want to say, it having been
decided by the present government that there are going to be
cabinet ministers in this chamber, that we are all pleased and
proud that they have chosen Senator Flynn and Senator
Asselin, who are held in such high regard on all sides of the
Senate. i cannot say that i knew of the qualifications of
Senator de Cotret before, but i must say that i have been
watching him, and i am impressed, first, with how he is so
often, to use his own words, happy to provide information. i
have been trying to rate his answers on the three scales that he
uses himself. Sometimes he says he is happy to provide information; at other times he says he is very happy to provide
information; and on some special occasions he says he is more
than happy to provide information.
Senator Asselin: But you get the information.
Senator Frith: But we get the information, as Senator
Asselin has said.
I must say that Senator de Cotret is very forthcoming,
though sometimes he does recall to my mind one of the briefest
book reviews ever written. It was written by a student who was
asked to review a book about penguins. His review, one
sentence long, was "This book tells me a great deal more about
penguins than I really care to know." In any event, we cannot
criticize Senator de Cotret for being close-mouthed.
I would like also, honourable senators, to congratulate all
those who have spoken so far in this debate, particularly the
new senators whose maiden speeches were eloquent and
impressive.
Honourable senators, i want to address my comments on the
Speech from the Throne to one particular aspect, namely, that
of offshore mineral rights. On this subject the words of the
Speech from the Throne are as follows:
During the past four months, my Ministers have made
every effort to change the climate of federal-provincial
relations which has prevailed in recent years. As a result
of their efforts, there has been visible progress. An agreement on lotteries bas been concluded and agreement in
principle has been reached with certain coastal provinces
concerning offshore mineral resources. Bringing about
this change in relations is fundamental to my government's philosophy.
The government feels, as is mentioned earlier in the Speech,
that they have a mandate to change the direction of Confederation. With the decision as to offshore mineral rights that i

have just mentioned, they have made what i believe is a
historically important change in the federal system. It is not as
if they had not warned us that they were going to do that, but
that change, and the understanding of that change, turns on
three questions. First, what is the existing direction that they
are turning away from? Secondly, where are they taking us
with their decision? Thirdly, are they strengthening or weakening the Canadian Confederation by making this change in
direction?
First, what is the status that is being changed? It is quite
clear, by way of background, that under the Constitution
provincial governments have control of the natural resources
within their boundaries. No one argues about that. However,
what about the resources offshore of coastal provinces-that
is, not within their territories, but off their coasts? This
question of offshore resources has been a difficult political and
legal problem in Canada since the early sixties, when the
possibility of recovering offshore oil and gas potential first
arose. It was at that point that both levels of government
began to think seriously about the question of which of them
had the legal right to this potential.
Of course, Canada is not the only country with these
problems. It is a problem for all federal states where legislative
and property rights are divided between two levels of government. Non-federal states-that is, unitary states-do not have
that problem, because in those states the only government that
can have an interest is the national government, and that is as
it should be, because the rights of the state to its offshore
resources depend-and this is important in understanding
what is happening-not only on its internal legislative jurisdiction, but more properly on the state of international law as it
develops through the continuing Law of the Sea Conferences
of the United Nations. Although there is no formal recognition
in international law that the continental shelf is truly within
national boundaries, it is recognized that the rights of a state
to its adjacent seabed arise because of its dominion over the
super-adjacent land.
0

(2150)

The real difficulty is that international law does not and
never has conferred any status at all on individual provinces.
In our country it is Canada, and not the provinces, which has
status in face of the world community. To give offshore rights
to the provinces will create a very difficult set of problems
when Canada has to negotiate matters on an international
level because, in exchange for having recognition in international law, or dominion over the offshore area, each country
has to agree to undertake certain responsibilities with regard
to environmental control and other quid pro quo.
What is the present state of affairs in Canada? As honourable senators probably know, from a reading of the many
discussions between the provinces and a general acceleration of
this issue, the matter came to a head before the Supreme
Court of Canada. The reference is now a famous case called
the British Columbia Off-shore Minerals case. The Supreme
Court was asked to express its opinion on whether British
Columbia or Canada had proprietory rights-that is, the right

SENATE DEBATES
to explore and exploit a legislative jurisdiction-over resources
situated in the territorial waters and continental shelf off the
coast of British Columbia.
I might say, in parenthesis, honourable senators, that I am
not suggesting that the British Columbia Off-shore Minerals
case is absolutely definitive because, as you will see from the
basis upon which the Supreme Court of Canada made its
decision, the case for each province has to be looked at
individually although there are some common elements, particularly the ones I have referred to with regard to international law.
Briefly, the British Columbia argument before the Supreme
Court of Canada was based on the position that it held when it
entered Confederation. It argued in favour of the application
of certain sections such as section 109, for example, of the
British North America Act, which became applicable to British Columbia as a province, preserving to it all lands, mines
and minerals which it had owned as a colony. It argued that
those lands remained vested in the province at the time of its
joining Confederation. The Supreme Court of Canada was not
satisfied that the territorial sea was ever within the jurisdiction
of British Columbia, first, because the western boundary of the
colony had been established by statute as being the Pacific
Ocean, and that boundary had remained unchanged to that
day and, as a result, precluded a claim to any part of the sea;
and, secondly, because they relied on a principle of British
common law that the extent of the realm ended at the low
water mark and that the territorial waters within three miles
of this limit were not within the realm.
Turning to the claim of the federal government, and getting
back to the principle already mentioned, the Supreme Court of
Canada held that Canada retained exclusive jurisdiction over
these waters and cited international treaties with regard to
them as evidence of the recognition of Canada's sovereignty
over them. It also held that since the lands were outside the
bounds of British Columbia, they could not fall within any of
the enumerated heads of section 92 and, therefore, the legislative jurisdiction with respect to them must belong exclusively
to Canada.
The decision favouring the claim of the federal government
to these offshore mineraI rights was essentially based on the
Constitution, on the 1958 Geneva Continental Shelf Convention, and on general principles of international law. On these
principles it is clear from the British Columbia case that the
federal government had and has exclusive jurisdiction with
respect to British Columbia offshore minerals.
With regard to the maritime provinces, the position is not
perfectly clear, and the analogy is not complete particularly
with reference to Newfoundland-and this is going to be
significant in terms of what happened-because of the fact
that Newfoundland had international status before it joined
Confederation in 1949. Therefore, on the purely legal analysis,
Newfoundland's position, in its claim to the offshore mineral
rights, is stronger than that of any other province.
[Senator Frith.]

October 23, 1979

In order to understand what is happening with this government's proposal regarding offshore mineral rights, we should
look at the international background of this proposal. As I
mentioned, Canada is not the only country with these problems. In fact, the United States and Australia have both
struggled with it and, as far back as 1947, the Supreme Court
of the United States held that the federal authority over the
lands of the territorial sea was paramount.
Other suits of a similar nature followed in 1950, and again
the right of the federal government was upheld. Congress tried
to pacify the states by passing the Submerged Lands Act in
1953 allowing each coastal state title to three miles of submerged seabed off its coasts. In that same year Congress
passed the Outer Continental Shelf Act which provided for a
system of gas and oil leasing in federal offshore areas. The
states concerned were Louisianna, California, Texas, Alaska
and the entire east coast tier of the United States, according to
the research that i have been able to obtain on this subject.
Exactly the same problem arose in Australia and, in 1967which is the same year as the Supreme Court of Canada
decision-after five years of negotiation, the jurisdictional
issue remained unsettled. The Commonwealth agreed to pass
mirror legislation on the theory that one or other set would be
valid. They also set up an elaborate dual permit system issuing
from the Department of Mines for each state but on behalf of
either government. They hoped to settle matters on the basis of
consultation between levels prior to administering grants and
licenses and, although this plan was useful for immediate
problems, naturally the question of jurisdiction arose again
because it was difficult, if not impossible, to get all states to
agree with the central government.
In 1973 a major action was started to determine the rightful
jurisdiction and, finally, in 1975, the High Court of Australia
found in favour of the federal government-the same as the
Supreme Court of the United States had done-and that
decision specifically and explicitly followed the reasoning in
the Canadian and American courts. It noted that, upon federation, the status to acquire new lands and new territorial rights
in the offshore, accruing because of international law, were
vested in the Commonwealth and not in the individual states
within the nation. Even that judgment did not stop the process.
From there constitutional conferences sought means of sharing, not transferring, the rights, the royalties and the

jurisdiction.
e (2200)
In 1978 an important bulletin issued from the Australian
Attorney General's office stating the main items of agreement.
A full year later, in June 1979, just June of this year, a similar
bulletin issued saying that the title to the seabed under the
three-mile territorial sea would be given to the states, and
there will be a joint commonwealth-state authority to regulate.
The Australians realized, it seems, what they were doing. They
agreed to a sharing of the royalties. In their case it was 60 per
cent for the states and 40 per cent to the Commonwealth. That
is not even as favourable as the arrangements made by our
former government to share the revenues 75/25, and they also

October 23, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

retain a power of veto on major decisions concerning national
interest.
From all that we have seen, it is clear that giving away
offshore resources is not an easy question. Also, certainly to
my knowledge, no other national government in the world has
entirely given up its right to control natural resources on its
continental shelf. The background, therefore, raises a real
question about whether this government believes that it bas the
duty to abdicate its responsibilities in this regard. That is the
background.
The actuality and what bas taken place is that the previous
government, as I mentioned, entered into an agreement in
February 1977. That was an agreement between the Governments of Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island. They were to proceed to the preparation of an
agreement. I am looking at the agreement now. They defined
the area; they set up a system for settling the area and some
divisions within the area; they set up a board and set up how
the revenue was to be computed. The division was that 25 per
cent of the revenue was to go to the federal government.
Senator Asselin: It was a political settlement.
Senator Frith: Exactly.
Senator Asselin: That is what we are doing.
Senator Frith: Precisely. As Senator Asselin has pointed
out, the solution in all cases-in the United States, in Australia and in Canada-has been a political settlement. The
reason I have gone into the background of the legal rights is
that any settlement depends on what the legal rights are and
what is being settled. These are precisely political settlements.
The agreement made was 25/75 as far as Canada was
concerned in 1977. Then in 1979 the present Prime Minister,
fulfilling a promise he had made, released some correspondence between himself, and, in particular, Premier Peckford of
Newfoundland, which, as will be remembered, is the province
that clearly had the strongest claim to its offshore mineral
rights because it formerly had an international status, and in
all cases all the principles seem to turn on that international
status. No other province could make that claim.
The letter from Prime Minister Clark to Premier Peckford
is dated September 14. It refers to earlier negotiations and
says that, in accordance with certain principles-they recognize four principles that are listed in the agreement-the
Province of Newfoundland should own the mineral resources
of the continental margin, and that is consistent with and
subject to the division of the legislative confidence as between
Parliament and provincial legislatures. The Prime Minister
then writes to other provinces and tells them he is prepared, in
effect, to make the same agreement with them.
Just so we can complete the background, the suggestion is
also made that certain constitutional changes will have to be
made. That might well refer to section 3 of the British North
America Act, which speaks of boundaries and permits the
federal government and provinces to agree about changes in
boundaries, subject to the interests of other provinces affected.

Of course, there are some legal pitfalls there in the context of
the international law background, which we have already
touched on.
Senator Rowe: I missed the date of that correspondence
between Premier Peckford and Prime Minister Clark.
Senator Frith: The letter from Prime Minister Clark to the
Premier of Newfoundland is dated September 14, 1979. He is
replying to a letter from Premier Peckford to him-that is, to
Prime Minister Clark-of August 23, 1979.
Senator Rowe: I thought i heard the word "December," but
it could not be.

Senator Frith: September.
I now come to the third and final part of my submissions on
this subject, honourable senators, which is whether or not these
changes are in the interests of the Canadian Confederation. It
cannot be denied that during the past five months the new
government has made every effort to change the climate of
federal-provincial relations that has prevailed in recent years.
The visible progress that has been made to date has arisen
from those efforts, and includes, as mentioned, an agreement
on lotteries and, as is stated, an agreement in principle with
certain coastal provinces concerning offshore mineral
resources. The real question that arises is whether or not these
agreements constitute evidence of the spirit of partnership and
renewal, or whether they in fact constitute a dangerous abdication of federal power and responsibilities.
Does a mandate built on 37 per cent of the popular vote
confer upon a government which speaks, or should speak, for
Canada and all Canadians the right to give away 100 per cent
of its resources? Everyone who has had anything to do with
politics in any way in this country knows that the task of
governing Canada, a federal state, a huge geographic area,
made up of so many different regions, is a very trying one, but
that is the job of any Canadian government. It is its duty to
make difficult decisions in the face of conflicting provincial
interests in such a way as to unify the spirit and share the
wealth amongst the citizens of the nation, and that has been
essentially the history of every government of this country. We
cannot do that, I submit, by creating little resource emirates in
different areas of the country.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that there is a fundamental difference between abdicating responsibility over lotteries and abdication of federal rights in a matter as important
as offshore resources. The whole raison d'être of a federation
requires that the central government be able, by virtue of its
constitutional powers, to maintain that delicate balance, that
centrifugal force, that keeps our country from spinning off into
autonomous little areas.
I do not believe the federal government should have foregone the revenues generated by Loto Canada for the federal
treasury. But I see a fundamental distinction between that
form of abdication and the far more serious abdication of
federal responsibility for the development of resources which
will secure our future energy supplies.

SENATE DEBATES
* (2210)

I spoke about the formation of little emirates. It is not
reasonable to begrudge the right of Alberta or Newfoundland
to grow and prosper because of natural resources which are
situated within their borders, or even adjacent to their coasts.
We do not, however, or cannot assume Candide's faith in
Leibnitz' theory that everything is for the best in this best of
ail possible worlds. And even in that event, the duty to make
the difficult decisions for the good of the whole country, not
just for Alberta and Newfoundland, does rest with the federal
government.
For most Canadians, the quarrel over constitutional matters
are too complicated and confusing to be seriously considered,
but i believe Canadians should realize the implications of a
policy which goes a long way towards further balkanizing the
nation. Il is easy to say that you will give offshore rights to aIl
those coastal provinces who want il, and in that way avoid
confrontation. But surely it must be made clear that not ail
coastal states have great oil potential. About 1.1 million square
miles of submerged land lies off the Atlantic coast, 70 per cent
of that offshore lies off Newfoundland and Labrador. It has
been estimated that the major potentials lie off the coasts of
that province. Nova Scotia bas some gas, but the other Atlantic provinces do not have good prospects in the smaller areas
off their coasts. So Newfoundland stands to gel wealthy at the
expense of the other provinces.

i would like to ask the government if ils policy is going to
extend to the Arctic, for the waters of that area are even more
promising than those off Newfoundland. The new government
bas the stated policy of giving offshore resources to the
provinces, and we know the speed with which they are trying
to create provinces up there. Both these areas are really
frontier areas in terms of exploration, and the companies
operating in them depend largely on federal tax incentives
which heavily subsidize the difficult exploration. So what
happens is that the people of ail of Canada put up the money
to find the offshore resources and, then, if this proposal and
these agreements are carried forward, only the people of the
provinces will share in the fruits of those investments.
Quite apart from the fact that the people of Canada have
underwritten a great deal of exploration for those sources of
oil-with the help of Petro-Canada, we might note-is Ibis
new partnership really a relationship of partners at ail? While
the new government may think of our federation as a partnership between the two levels of government, it might also
consider that the federal government is really only the prêtenom, or the agent, for al] the people of Canada. To transfer
these resources to the provinces will only make the responsibility of the federal government in this regard far more difficult.
Honourable senators, five months of government and the
Speech from the Throne make it very clear that we in this
country are facing an historical, ideological difference. Certainly there are many Canadians who support the ideology of
this new government, and there are many who do not. But il is
a significant difference. If it were not for the results, I could
[Senator Frith.]

October 23, 1979

say, "Vive la différence," but the agreement to give al] federal
rights in offshore resources to the coastal provinces is a very
serious and virtually irreversible decision. Just try to gel them
back after you have given them.
An Hon. Senator: Just try.
Senator Frith: Exactly. Il is a serious step in itself, but as a
part of the whole package of such abdication of federal
interests-crown corporations dismantled, Petro-Canada and
Loto Canada thrown away, for example-it means that
Canadians should ask themselves whether il is clear, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, the present Prime Minister bas
been elected to preside over the dismemberment of the Canadian Confederation.
Senator Roblin: Oh, shame.
Senator Rowe: Before my honourable friend takes his seat, I
wonder if I may ask a question with reference to one statement
be made a moment ago?
He stated that it seems clear that there are very important
oil and gas resources off the coast of Newfoundland and
Labrador, and he also earlier conceded the likelihood that
Newfoundland's case is different from that of other provinces
such as British Columbia-I think that is pretty well almost
universally acknowledged-but he also said that in the event
oil is developed there Newfoundland could gel rich-and i
think these were his words-at the expense of the maritime
provinces.
i do not follow that at ail. If, for example, important oi]
resources are found in the Bay of Fundy, to the benefit of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, would that mean they were
getting rich aI the expense of Newfoundland?
I would like some clarification on that before we leave il. Il
seenis to me to be a pretty important matter.
Senator Frith: They would be getting rich at the expense of
others partners in Confederation, because ail the partners in
Confederation would have put up the money, as they have
donc, through tax incentives for those exploring to find
resources, and then, because of this agreement, not sharing the
revenue. They would gel ail the results of the exploration while
not putting up ail of the costs.
Il would be like any partnership that says they are going to
put so much money in order to develop their potential, and
then one of the partners saying, "But, if we make any money, i
gel il ail. i do not share il with the others who put up the
fioncy.
Senator Rowe: What I think my friend means is that
Newfoundland would become rich at the expense of the rest of
Canada, not the maritime provinces.
Senator Frith: Not only the maritime provinces.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, in other
times at Ibis hour of the night I would ask your permission to
move the adjournment of the debate. Tonight, however, I find
myself in a somewhat different situation which may or nay
not be more difficult.

With reference to offshore minerai rights, 1 must express my
appreciation to Senator Fritb for bis dealing witb the problemn.
However, I will disagree with some of the things he has said. 1

1 tbink that bis use of tbe words "littie ernirates" to describe

me to draw from that, because we did not have an opportunity

and thus could well lead to a conclusion different from that
reached in the British Columbia Reference.
Honourable senators, 1 say there is such an historical difference in Nova Scotia and in other Atlantic provinces, and I
hasten to agree again with Senator Frith. I will have to be
careful not to forget that I disagree with what I think he felt
was the most important part of his speech, that being that
Newfoundland appears to have the best case of all four
provinces. But that is not to say that the other provinces have
not got perfectly good cases. Newfoundiand's case rests on a
somewhat stronger basis, if it does, simply because its entry
into Confederation did not occur until 1949, as everyone
knows, and by that time certain things which had been only
claimed for a long while had become recognized to the benefit
of Newfoundland, which I do not begrudge that province at
all.
*

(2240)

It never occurred to me in respect of Newfoundland, as it
now appears that they may benefit from some of these offshore
rights, that they were going to get rich at the expense of Nova
Scotia or Prince Edward Island or New Brunswick. It only
occurred to me that here in the Atlantic region at last it looked
as if somebody was going to prosper from a resource which
nobody had known previously was there, but which now looks
as though it might be developed and bring wealth to Newfoundland. I do not begrudge them a moment of that, or a cent
of it. I hope it is successful beyond their dreams in improving
their lots as individuals and as a province. In the process, even
if nothing happens off Sable Island, we in Nova Scotia will be
bound to benefit from it, not as much as if it were nearer to us
than to them, but what matters that? This is one area where if
development is good for Newfoundland, they deserve it, and it
is also good for the other Atlantic provinces. And any argument i make today or any other time on this matter, I make it
as well for Newfoundland or for Prince Edward Island or for
New Brunswick as i do for Nova Scotia, although, of course,
my heart lies somewhat closer to Nova Scotia than to any
other place.
Again I say I think it is fundamentally important at this
stage to make it perfectly clear to every person concerned with
this matter, whether in the other place, in this house or in the
public at large, so that it may be understood by all, that the
British Columbia Reference does not decide the ownership of
offshore minerals on the Atlantic coast, and certainly even by
the specific statement by the court itself in delivering its
opinion, nothing else is decided. It is open to any other
province to make whatever claim the facts and the law will
justify, and where there are different historical facts the claim
has to be viewed in a different light.
Of course, in considering the right as between Canada and
any of its provinces, one bas to start with the British North
America Act. I am not going to recite the whole act-perhaps
half of it will be sufficient-but I would like to draw attention
to the fact that section 91 sets out those matters specifically
within the jurisdiction of Canada, and I recognize the great
breadth of the rights which can be found under the provisions

with reference to peace, order and good government in the
residuary powers of Canada and in the exceptions which are
contained in section 92, the section which enumerates the
provincial rights. The exception, for instance, where Canada
has the right to declare any work in any province to be for the
general advantage of Canada, or of any two provinces, and
thus bring it within the jurisdiction of Canada. I am aware of
all that and I believe I have given all those very wide powers
full consideration in coming to the conclusion I am placing
before the Senate tonight.
With reference to Senator Frith's argument that only
Canada as a nation, as a sovereign state, can deal with other
powers with relation to matters affecting Canada, I refer him
to the British North America Act, not to disagree with him
insofar as it concerns who deals with other powers on the part
of Canada-it must be Canada-but to demonstrate to him
that the framers of this act did not contemplate that provinces
could not have rights which were the subject of negotiation
with other provinces, because section 132 specifically reads:
The Parliament and Government of Canada shall have
all Powers necessary or proper for performing the Obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof, as Part of the
British Empire, towards Foreign Countries arising under
Treaties between the Empire and such Foreign Countries.
And now, of course, directly between Canada and such foreign
countries. And so while I appreciate that that is an argument
which is frequently used, I say it does not in any way prohibit
the provincial ownership of offshore mineral rights or any
other rights simply because it has to be the subject of negotiations, or might have to be the subject of negotiations, between
Canada and the foreign power. I say the act contemplated
that.
Now, there are many other sections of the act besides
sections 91 and 92 that are relevant. For instance, section 7
says that the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
should have the same limits as they had at the time the act was
passed. So that anything that belonged to either of those
provinces at that time belongs to them now unless they have
given it up, and that does not appear in the British North
America Act with respect to any other province. This reserves
and brings into Confederation as part of New Brunswick or
part of Nova Scotia whatever rights and boundaries whether
at sea or otherwise which either one of those provinces possessed prior to Confederation.
Section 109 states among other things that all mines, minerals and royalties belonging to Nova Scotia and other provinces
at the time of the union shail continue to belong to that
province after the union. Again this brings into the union but
preserves as the right of the province whatever right that
province may have had with reference to minerals, wherever
the object of those rights was located, if it had the right in
1867.
There is some argument about section 108 which is alleged
to convey Sable Island to Canada because it uses the words in
saying what belongs to Canada, "lighthouses and piers, and

SENATE DEBATES
Sable Island." Weil, the people who say that that conveys
Sablc Island to Canada are driven to say that merely incidentally in a schedule to section 108 the whole island is transferred from the ownership of Nova Scotia to the ownership of
Canada, and however lightly anybody may have regarded an
island, even in those days, which was mostly sand, surely tl is

As 10 the historical facts, Nova Scotia's recorded history is

Nova Scotia, and sea as well, was very much in the mîinds of
those European countries who wcre doing the cxploring and
colonizing of thc lime in North America. Il was the subjecl of
a great many miliîary and diplomatic activities.
The Treaty of Utrecht, made, as 1 say, in 171 3, was betwecn
Gireat Britain and F-rance. It provided for many things, but the
important îhing to note now is îhaî it conveyed to Britain "ail
Nova Scotia or Acadia with ils ancient boundaries--and ail

Jsiand--and ail rights whalsoever-". And certainiy neither

And Sable Island is already some 80 miles out t0 sea. So there
is 260 miles of water which even as long ago as 1713 those îwo

of the history of the iaw reiating to Nova Scotia.
Fifîy years later, in 1763, the Treaîy of Paris was signed.
The parties to that Treaty were Britain, France and Spain and,
immediateiy upon signature, iî was acceded 10 by Portugal.
These, honourabie senators, were ail] the greal countries of

This, then, was nol mereiy a bilaîcrai treaîy but was international in a much wider and truc sense. In fact, it was
international in the compiete sense insofar as it eoncerned the
counîries whieh were then îaking any interest in the seas off
Nova Scotia, in any event.
It deait. of course, wiîh many parts of the worid, but among

Agaîn 1 say il wili thus be cieariy seen that these breaties,
and in this case the four countries, were purporîing to deal
with not just the land mass but as far lu sea as Sable Island
and 30 leagues beyond.
This saine sort of bhing can be seen in the commissions
granbed 10 the governors of Nova Seotia or Acadia at that
lime. The governors' commissions fromi the first. such as, for
instance, the one t0 L ord Cornwallis in 1749, made mention
not only of being governor of Nova Scotia but over the

time, and in the following years up to Confederation, were
pursuant to their commissions authorized and instructed to
pass such laws as, with the assistance of the council and the
assembly, might be proper and desirable. From that time
forward the assembly did function and the statutes passed used
the phraseology: "Be it therefore enacted by the Governor,
Council and Assembly as follows."
A large number of statutes were enacted from 1758 to the
time of Confederation in Nova Scotia. They dealt with many
different subject matters. But the governor, council and
assembly did not hesitate to legislate in respect of matters
offshore. Many of these statutes, including all public statutes
that were then in force in the province, were consolidated in
what was called the Consolidated Statutes of Nova Scotia,
1864, being the third consolidation of such statutes. In them
can be found the statutes I have mentioned and will mention,
as well as many others.

argued that that is where the ownership of the continental
shelf began.
But President Truman took great care to make clear that
that was not his position. In his declaration he did not say that
he was just now asserting title for the first time, as something
just acquired. Rather he put it in terms which indicated clearly
that though the jurisdiction had long existed, the technology
for extracting the minerals and other valuable matter in the
bed under the sea of the continental shelf had not readily been
available but was now becoming available, that the United
States was going to use that technology, and he wanted
everyone to know it.
Referring again to Nova Scotia, as will be seen, jurisdiction
as far as 30 leagues southwest of Sable Island was dealt with
in the Treaty of Utrecht and confirmed by the Treaty of Paris.

as British Columbia was concerned, at the time it entered into
Confederation. In any event, the court was very careful to say
that their whole decision applied only to British Columbia.
So I do not accept that the Supreme Court decided, or ever
intended to decide, anything about the continental shelf except
in relation to British Columbia; and clearly once they decided
that British Columbia did not own the land under, or exercise
jurisdiction over, the territorial sea, it could not possibly
extend its ownership from something that did not exist to take
in the continental shelf.
But in the Atlantic provinces that is not so. They did own
the territorial sea at the time of Confederation; they did have
the capacity to exercise ownership over the extension of that
territorial sea to the margin of the continental shelf; and
history shows that they did have the jurisdiction and that it
was granted to them as far back as 1713 and confirmed in
1763.
Further, from the earliest times, the lime of the Romans,
the time when the Dutch were a great power on the sea,
writers on the law of the sea appear to have claimed that
coastal states did have jurisdiction over the seas off their
coasts as far as necessary for them to provide for their
security-and they seemed to have extensive views as to how
far it was necessary to go to maintain that security.
I have to agree, of course, that there is an English case of R.
v. Keyn mentioned in the British Columbia case, and mentioned frequently in dissertations relating to this matter, where
1l judges by a majority of one decided that the realm of
England ended at the low water mark, and that beyond the low
water mark was within the jurisdiction of "the admiral." That
case was decided in the early 1870s and has been much
disputed ever since, though I have to say it seems to have been
given some weight by the Supreme Court of Canada in the
British Columbia case.
It is to be noted, however, that the United Kingdom Parliament was not satisfied with such a conclusion, for in 1978 it
passed a statute, the effect of which was to overcome some, if
not all-and perhaps all-of the problem resulting from R. v.
Keyn. Here there was clearly recognized the jurisdiction to
legislate beyond the low water mark, beyond whatever was
necessary to take care of the decision in R. v. Keyn. Just as the
Parliament of Britain had jurisdiction to legislate their relation
to their coastal waters, so they had delegated long before that,
and the four Atlantic provinces exercised before that, the right
to legislate far at sea.
a

Again, I say, as in the case of the territorial sea, the
Supreme Court of Canada case does not cover the ownership
of offshore minerals in the continental shelf off the Atlantic
provinces.
Returning for a moment to Sable Island, clearly, by the
Treaties of Utrecht and Paris, Sable Island was treated as an
integral part of Nova Scotia. It is submitted that this practice
of treating it as part of Nova Scotia continued without interruption until Confederation, and, indeed, was not interrupted
[Senator Smith (Colchester).]

October 23, 1979

then. For instance, Chapter 21 of the Third Consolidation of
Nova Scotia Statutes 1864, to which I referred earlier, established a board of works with jurisdiction over the island. Here
you will find mention of the humane works with reference to
lifesaving. It is directed to supervise and manage all other
buildings and property on the island belonging to the province-there is that word "property"-or which may be placed
by the province under its care "with all the lighthouses, buoys
and beacons erected or to be erected-" and also Sable Island
as well as all the establishments for humane objects thereon.
This statute also provides that the money necessary shall be
drawn from the receiver general on the accounts presented
annually to the assembly.
Chapter 23 of the same consolidation deals particularly with
Sable Island. It authorizes the board of works to make rules
for the government of Sable Island, for administering relief to
shipwrecked persons as well as for the general management of
the island. It also specifically states that in all proceedings in
any court Sable Island shall be held to be within the county of
Halifax.
Honourable senators, you will be glad to know that I am
very close to the end of what you have so kindly allowed me to
say.
This is only a thumbnail sketch of the claim of Nova Scotia,
and, to some extent, that of the other Atlantic provinces to the
offshore mineral resources-resources to the outer edge of the
continental shelf, as well, in the case of Nova Scotia, as the
right to Sable Island.
The action of the Prime Minister in undertaking to transfer
completely control of these resources to these provinces is of
the greatest importance to them. No doubt, as has been seen
tonight, there will be substantial debate about carrying out
this transfer; but in this debate all who take part, or listen, or
read, can have no excuse for failing to realize that the Atlantic
provinces claim with vigour, with determination and with
confidence, that they are on sound legal ground whenever they
say that the British Columbia reference does not decide their
claim, and that moreover it is not applicable to them.
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have another claim on
moral grounds, though admittedly not on legal grounds. I have
mentioned it briefly before, in an indirect way, and it is simply
this. They were two of the original partners in Confederation.
When Canada acquired that tremendous part of what is now
our country, some of which was used later to create or enlarge
other provinces, Canada then consisted of a very small number
of provinces, and Nova Scotia, as well as New Brunswick, as
well as the other two provinces, were part owners of all of that
vast territory.
The portions-the very large portions-of this territory that
were used to enlarge or create other provinces carried with
them to those other provinces untold value in natural
resources, much of which is undiscovered even now. At that
time it was not possible, because of the geographical situation,
to extend such expansion to the maritime provinces or to
Newfoundland-certainly to the maritime provinces. Thus a

October 23, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

direct share in this great wealth was denied them, that was
available to the other provinces, though it was denied, of
course, by geography and not by any specific human act.
Surely now, when there seems to be a good chance that they in
turn may benefit from the discovery of resources in which
geography does allow them to share, they should not be
deprived of the opportunity to do so in the fullest and most
generous measure.
Thank you, honourable senators, for your kindness.
Senator Godfrey: I have a question for the honourable
senator. If Nova Scotia was so convinced, and if it is so clear,
that they have the legal right to these offshore mineral rights,
why were they reluctant to go to the courts to establish their
rights, and why did they make a settlement on the 25/75 per
cent basis?
Senator Smith (Colchester): To begin with, of course, the
government of the time contained no one of the political belief
to which i now adhere. Secondly, as I understood it at the
time, and as I reluctantly accepted myself, as an interested
citizen in public life, it was simply that here was a chance to
get 75 per cent of the revenue to be derived, and to have the
federal government share in the administrative costs in the
way set out in the agreement. This seemed better than perhaps
could be obtained by any other means without taking some
risks. No lawsuit or claim is ever so sound that you can be sure
how it is going to turn out when it gets to court. It was
received, as I think I said in the very beginning, by many,
including myself, as something that was better than no loaf at
all. It was never received by myself, and never received by
many Nova Scotians as any full and complete satisfaction of
their claim.
Senator McElman: I have a question for Senator Smith
(Colchester) if he would allow me, please.
In the latter part of his remarks he said that this was a
thumbnail sketch of the position of Nova Scotia and the other
either Atlantic or maritime provinces. Is it not a fact that the
Premier of New Brunswick, Mr. Hatfield, still supports the
agreement that was made with the Government of Canada for
the 75/25 division, and that that 25 per cent encompassed
costs that the federal government would bear with regard to
administration, cleanup of oil spills, and so on? Is it not a fact
that he still supports the 75/25 division?
Senator Smith (Colchester): I do not have any doubt about
that, and there are very good reasons for it. After all, he does
not have Sable Island, and he does not have the Grand Banks.
In any event, he was a party to the agreement in the first
place. Obviously, if he thought it was the best he could get
then, he is not going to denounce it now. I am sure, however,
that he believes that the Atlantic provinces have the kind of
claim i have put forward, and the kind of right I have put
forward.

e

(2320)

Just because he accepts-as I did myself at the time-the
agreement of 1977 was better than nothing, I would not be
inclined to accept any assertion, except from him, that he has
ever abandoned the views which he once held that the ownership of these rights were, as I have described them, in respect
to Nova Scotia.
Senator McElman: Like Senator Smith I recall very well the
long period of years of negotiation on the offshore which goes
back beyond the time i was associated with provincial administration. Although we did not feel that the British Columbia
ruling had any effect upon us, following that ruling it was felt
to be unwise for the three maritime provinces not to proceed
with a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada. Our case
was-I shall not say "thin", but would the honourable senator
agree that it was not quite as "thick" as we would have liked it
to be to go before the Supreme Court.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Ilt is pretty hard to disagree
with that, in a sense, because no one can ever be sure of
winning a lawsuit, no matter how strong his case is. The
honourable senator and I see pretty well eye to eye in this
matter although I think it would be a more accurate description to say, as I said, that while you are never satisfied with a
part when you think you own the whole, sometimes you are
satisfied with a part when you see it is going to be very
difficult to obtain the whole or that you may risk, as must be
the case with any lawsuit, losing everything. When you know
that the other fellow is adamant and he has the funds and the
resources, and you cannot be sure of winning your case, then
very often, as we who practise the law know, you advise your
client, with great regret, that it is probably better to take part
of the loaf than risk the whole loaf.
So far as i am aware, the view was that if the present party
now in office in Ottawa ever came to power, it would carry out
this transaction. This view has been stated by the present
Prime Minister. This party has always held that view and has
always put it forward. When I say "always", I do not mean
since time immemorial, but certainly within the last 15 years
or so.
On motion of Senator Steuart, debate adjourned.

TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL SESSION-OPENING CEREMONIES IN
SENATE CHAMBER

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, 1 have the
honour to report that the opening ceremonies of the TwentyFifth annual session of the North Atlantic Assembly will be
held in this chamber on Friday morning, commencing at 9.30
o'clock. Subsequent sessions will be held in the Conference
Centre.
I might say that the Senate venue for this international
assembly meeting is according to established Senate precedent.
The North Atlantic Assembly, created in 1955, is the interparliamentary assembly of member countries of the North
Atlantic Alliance. It provides a forum where West European
and North American parliamentarians meet regularly to discuss issues of common interest. The aim of the Assembly is to
promote and further the aims of the Atlantic Alliance as
detailed in the North Atlantic Treaty.
The North Atlantic Assembly has 172 members who are
nominated by their national parliaments. They will be welcomed to Canada on that occasion by the Prime Minister.
Our colleague, Senator Hamilton McDonald-Senator
Hammie McDonald as we know him-is the distinguished
head of the Canadian delegation, the membership of which
includes Senators Austin, Lang, Lafond, Walker and Yuzyk.
It also includes 18 members of the House of Commons. The
secretary of the delegation is Colonel Tom Bowie, who is
known to all of you.

FIRE PROTECTION

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, Senator
Molson directed a question to the Leader of the Government
last night, and in doing so he stated at that time that he
regarded the subject of his question as a matter having a
"certain urgency." He asked the Leader of the Government to
find out for the Senate what arrangements there are for the
protection of these buildings in case of fire.
I am informed that my office has been asked by the office of
the Leader of the Government to make the necessary inquiries
and to report, in due course, to the Senate. I may say that I
have already initiated those inquiries. They are not yet complete. The matter has been referred already to Mr. Alex Hope,

QUESTION PERIOD
a

(1400)

[English]
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
GOVERNMENT AID TO EXPORTERS

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, a question, first of
all, to the Honourable the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce. The minister is reported in the press to have stated
to the Canadian Export Association's annual meeting that
Canadian business must become more aggressive-"aggressive
competitors" were the words he used, wearing his rugged free
enterprise hat, and he warned that goverriment intervention on
their behalf was ended. That announcement was made. In view
of these reports, would the minister tell us those measures that
are going to be terminated under his leadership as Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce to put Canadian business on a
more "rugged," "free enterprise," "competitive" basis with the
world?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I never made any
statement to the effect that the government would not be
supportive of Canadian business.

Senator Perrault: The Globe and Mail report went on to
say:
Senator de Cotret was referring to what he said was the
previous government's tendency to do the private sector's
job for it, including market surveys and trade negotiations.
Now, that is a rather specific statement by the Honourable
the Minister. Can the minister tell us where the previous
government failed the Canadian people by assisting in trade
negotiations? May I suggest that the previous government's
record to assist trade was substantially better than the disastrous negotiations with respect to Candu in Argentina, the
disastrous Canadian efforts on behalf of reactor sales in Japan,
and the Middle East trade debacle. Perhaps the minister may
wish to describe for us these areas of failure by the previous
government referred to in the Globe and Mail article.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, once again I have
not had the benefit of reading the report the leader is quoting
from. I never made any mention of market surveys. I can
assure you that the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, as it always does, is very actively engaged in providing
business with the most up-to-date and accurate information on
market potential around the world. Apart from market surveys, the leader mentioned something else that I was discontinuing, or alleged to be discontinuing.
Senator Perrault: I would be pleased to quote again from
the first page of the Globe and Mail business section for today:
Senator de Cotret was referring to what he said was the
previous government's tendency to do the private sector's
job for it, including market surveys and trade negotiations.
Do we have here today, then, a denial by the minister that
these remarks were ever made to any reporter or during the
course of his remarks to the Canadian Export Association?
Senator de Cotret: Absolutely. I never talked about market
surveys in any way, shape or form. And regarding trade
negotiations, honourable senators, I must say that I am quite
surprised, because I took pride in and made a point of mentioning to the members of the Canadian Export Association in
the course of my remarks the initiatives that this new government has taken to open up and further our trading interests
with China. I had the pleasure last week of hosting the visit of
the Honourable the Minister of International Trade from
China, at which time I signed the renewed trade agreement
that exists between China and Canada. I also signed an
economic protocol to expand our economic co-operation in a
number of areas.
A few weeks ago I mentioned to the association that I had
signed on behalf of EDC a line of credit of $2 billion to China.
I also mentioned the strong and forthright discussions that
took place between the minister and myself during the three
days of his visit to open up new market opportunities in this
market, which I consider to be a very important market for
Canadian exporters in the decade ahead of us. So I fail to see
any lack of commitment; quite the opposite, honourable sena-

SENATE DEBATES
tor. i can tell you that this government is going to be very
aggressive in trade and we expect Canadian business to be
aggressive also. What I did say, and what I will say again, is
that the government's role in this field is to open the door, to
give the opportunity, to establish the links, to provide the
assistance that is normal in the course of business, and after
that to call upon private industry to sell their products and to
develop those markets that we have opened for them. And we
will be very strong in that.
Senator Oison: The press report is wrong, then.
* (1410)

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I say that
many of us are reassured to hear these positive remarks from
the honourable the minister; but there is such a monumental
discrepancy between the reply he has given this afternoon and
the press accounts which appeared today in one of the most
widely-read and respected newspapers in Canada that I
wonder if the honourable minister would be prepared to table,
or make available to honourable senators, a copy of his
speech? And I know that he will wish to write a letter to the
Globe and Mail denying and dissociating himself from the
remarks attributed to him in that article. It seems to me that
would be an appropriate course of action. i suggest it may be a
serious misquotation, if we are to assume that it is a misquotation, and i have no wish to dispute what the minister said this
afternoon.
Senator de Cotret: i am sorry. It is not even a misquotation.
i never talked about market surveys. Never did I mention the
words "market surveys" in any of my remarks at any time, so
far as I can tell, since I assumed office. i have not made any
point about market surveys. I have often mentioned the fact
that the department is ready to help and to support any
exporters with up-to-date, comprehensive and objective information about the economic conditions and markets that are
available to us. Certainly, in terms of trade promotion, i have
made a number of remarks about the importance we attach to
it and I would still like to underline to the honourable senator
that i am anxiously awaiting the report of the Hatch Committee on Trade Promotion, which I hope will put before us a
number of proposals by which we can further help our exporters in this country in being more aggressive in foreign markets.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, i am delighted. i
know I speak on behalf of other members of the opposition
when I say we are pleased to hear a recital of the facts by the
minister according to his best recollection of that occasion.
Presumably, as well, thcre was no criticism of the previous
government, a reassurance that some of us welcome.
TRADE PROMOTION PROGRAMS

Senator Perrault: May I ask another question with respect
to trade? The minister's cabinet colleague, the Minister of
State for International Trade, Michael Wilson, says that there
will be a rejuvenated private sector working with the new
government to help close the enormous trade gap. Well, that is
good news. He says also that new tax incentives will be
[Senator deCotret.]

October 24, 1979

introduced for exporters, i presume in the next budget, and the
government will also, he says, promote more trade with industrializing countries on the rim of the Pacific Ocean. "The
Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce," we are told,
'"will consider how better to reflect trade considerations in
foreign policy and rationalize federal support programs to
meet industrial requirements." That seems to go along with
the statement made this afternoon by the honourable minister.
Is the minister able to state any further detail with respect
to these programs that we may anticipate in view of the very
disturbingly large international trade deficit?
Senator de Cotret: No, but I will certainly concur in the
apprehension and concern expressed by my honourable colleague about our very high current account deficit. It is
certainly not a situation we would like to see continue. We
certainly are endeavouring, by all the means possible, to turn
the tide and see Canada moving towards a reduced current
account deficit over the years to come.
I mentioned briefly some of the initiatives we took with
China. i also mentioned briefly the report of the Hatch
Committee on Trade Promotion. We are reviewing our financing packages available to exporters. The Minister of State for
International Trade has mentioned certain measures that
might be introduced in the budget to further foster our exports
from Canada, and those, of course, will be announced in due
time.
There is a thorough review of foreign trade underway with
all these various components and certainly we hope to be in a
position to announce very shortly new measures and new
initiatives to further our trade opportunities, both within our
traditional markets of Japan, the U.S. and the ECC, and also
with new emerging markets such as China, Mexico, South

RELATIONS BETWEEN CANADA AND MIDDLE FAST COUNTRIES

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, there was no statement made concerning the Middle East situation. I should like
to ask the minister this question: Following the return of a
distinguished Canadian, the Honourable Robert Stanfield,
from discussions held in many Middle Eastern states with
respect to their attitude toward Canada, have meetings been
held between Mr. Stanfield and the minister to discuss what
initiatives may be necessary, and what changes in Canadian
foreign policy may be desirable, in order to restore some of our
lost opportunities in the Middle East? Has a program been
developed to establish better relations between Canada and
certain disaffected Middle East countries?
Senator de Cotret: The answer to the question is no. I have
not had the opportunity to meet with the Honourable Mr.
Stanfield since his return from the Middle East.

ENERGY

REINVESTMENT IN CANADA OF INCREASED PROFITS TO OIL
COMPANIES

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question for the Leader of the Government following the
remarks of the minister in expressing his concern for the
current international balance of payments. Has the government developed a plan to ensure that the increased profits
accruing to many oil companies, as reported in today's press,
will be reinvested in Canada to improve future oil supplies
coming from Canadian resources?
Senator Flynn: All I can say in reply is that the government
is considering all matters in defining an energy policy. The
problem is certainly one that will be taken into account.
Senator Oison: I take it, then, that the government does not
have a plan to ensure that the considerable increase in profits
will be reinvested in Canada?
Senator Flynn: Not a plan that can be announced at this
time.

to congratulate Cardinal Léger on his being the first recipient
of the prize commemorating the former Prime Minister, the
Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson.
Also, our government, as all previous governments, is obviously committed to this institution called the United Nations.
Without the UN I think many conflicts, which have been
brought under control, would have broken out with much more
damaging effects.
Also, I think the United Nations, even if they do not provide
permanent solutions to international problems, remain a forum
where member states can discuss, propose and look for solutions to problems and international conflicts.
As I have said, the new government is fully committed to
this institution, as were its predecessors, and we will certainly
participate in and contribute to the organization and its general assembly.

CANADIAN PARTICIPATION-AWARD OF LESTER B. PEARSON
PEACE PRIZE TO PAUL-ÉMILE CARDINAL LÉGER

Senator Macquarrie: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Honourable Senator Asselin, who has
important international responsibilities. In view of the fact that
today is United Nations Day, and in view of the fact that the
United Nations Association of Canada, of which both the
honourable senator and I are members, has today designated
His Eminence Paul Emile Cardinal Léger, as the first recipient
of the Lester B. Pearson Peace Prize, which His Eminence
described today as the Canadian "Nobel Prize", may I ask the
honourable senator, who is a distinguished internationalist and
a great friend, if he might take this opportunity to reassure
this chamber and this country that despite arguments about
procedure and otherwise, Canada, a charter member of the
United Nations, still regards the UN as a basic cornerstone of
our foreign policy?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, you will of course
understand that my colleague had advised me of his question
and his statement. He did not want to surprise me.
Nevertheless, it is with great pleasure that I acquiesce to his
wishes and, on behalf of the government and the Secretary of
State for External Affairs, pay tribute to Cardinal Léger who
at noon today was awarded the Lester B. Pearson Peace Prize
by the Governor General. I think this house will unanimously
recognize the qualities manifested by Cardinal Léger, who has
worked so hard in his mission abroad to add to Canada's
prestige and who has done great missionary work in Cameroon, and elsewhere.
I therefore believe that it is with great honour that the
Senate endorses the words expressed by the Governor General

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
This concerns an announcement he made a few days ago that
Canada had established an import quota against imports of
chicken from the United States. My question arises from the
fact that farm organizations and chicken producers are very
much disturbed by the establishment of what they think is an
inordinately high quota, based on Canada's traditional imports
of chicken. My question is: Was this discussed with farm
organizations before it was announced, and why did the government not establish a lower quota, particularly since there
has been such a very, very high increase in imports in the last
few years from the United States?
Senator de Cotret: With regard to your first question,
honourable senator, I will have to consult my colleague, the
Minister of Agriculture, to ascertain to what extent there was
consultation before the announcement was made. There obviously was consultation prior to that, in terms of the desirability, expressed by the producers, of establishing an import
quota. As you well know, under the rules of the GATT, such
an import quota has to be negotiated. It was negotiated with
the United States, with the results that were announced
recently.
As to the last part of your question, I will endeavour to
inquire from my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, the
exact reasons why the quota was set where it was. It was
obviously the result of negotiations-fairly technical negotiations-at which we were very conscious, I am sure, of our
obligations to our own producers.
Senator Argue: A supplementary question. In view of the
fact that since 1972, I believe it is, imports of chicken from the
United States have increased some 15 times or more, and in
view of the fact that we are, I believe, abiding by the GATT,

SENATE DEBATES
since we are doing this as a result of having a marketing
agency in place that does control the supply in Canada, why in
the name of heaven did the government not establish a lower
quota? I know this has to be donc with consultation, but I
believe we would be within our rights and within our authority
to have established a smaller quota. This might have taken us
to GATT, though 1 doubt it very much. 1 think we would be
within the law by having already established an agency that
controls supply.
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to take that question as
notice and give you the precise answer as soon as I have had a
chance to consult my colleague.
Senator Bosa: Will the minister include in his reply why the
quota was increased from 1 per cent to 6 per cent per year,
when that particular market increased only at the rate of 2 per
cent?
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to take that question as
notice also.
ALLEGATIONS (\CERNING

LGG MARKETING BOARD

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I ask an auxiliary "fowl" question? Allegations were made in the other place,
and again oni national television this morning, to the effect that
the mane of the Egg Marketing Board receives over $100,000 a year, and that a member or members of his family are
on the payroll of the Egg Marketing Board. There are other
very serious allegations.
I wonder whether the government intends to investigate
these allegations immediately in order to ascertain whether or
nlot personal reputations are being damaged unfairly, or
whether there is some validity to the allegations.
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy once again to raise the
question with the minister responsible and report back to the
house exactly what steps are being taken, and exactly what the
situation is with respect to the allegations that were made.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL RELATIONS
OFFSHORE RESOURCES

Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, I have only one
question for the honourable senator minister of everything. My
question has to do with the discussions that went on in this
bouse last night about the decision by the Prime Minister of
Canada to give up the jurisdiction over offshore natural
resources. After listening attentively to the speech of Senator
Smith of Nova Scotia and watching, not the minister because
be was not with his monitor who is usually sitting beside him,
Senator Murray, and who seemed to agree with Senator
Smith, I would like to ask the senator minister if he could tel]
this house what the policy of the federal government is with
respect to federal versus provincial responsibility in fisheries.
Senator de Cotret: I would be very pleased to obtain an
answer but, as the honourable senator must realize, this is a
constitutional matter, and in spite of my responsibilities in the
[Senator Argue

October 24, 1979

economic field, I can assure him that I have no direct responsibility in the constitutional area. I will be very pleased to obtain
an answer for the senator but that is certainly not one of my
areas of responsibility at this time.
Senator Thériault: A supplementary. Honourable senators, I
have difficulty understanding the minister's answer because
after listening attentively last week when he defined his
responsibilities in the economic area, which involve coordination between other departments, including the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans of Canada, knowing also that this is a
discussion that has been going on for several years, and until
the change in government in the month of May the national
federal government had always refused to give the provinces
jurisdiction over the control of fisheries, as I said earlier, after
listening attentively to the honourable senator from Nova
Scotia last night when he described and dealt with the responsibility of provincial governments, which includes fisheries, I
wonder along with all fishermen's associations in the Atlantic
provinces what the intentions of this government are in this
area.
Senator de Cotret: May I repeat, this is a constitutional
matter but, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no
change in the division of responsibilities between the federal
government and the provinces in the area of fisheries. There
has certainly been a change in our policy vis-à-vis offshore
mineral resources, but not in the area of fisheries. I would be
very glad to look this up and give a precise answer. But that is
certainly not a policy I an familiar with. I do not think
anything was announced in this area.
Senator Rizzuto: Honourable senators, 1 have a supplementary. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister of Justice, might answer the question.
Senator Flynn: I beg your pardon?
Senator Rizzuto: The Leader of the Government in the
Senate, as Minister of Justice, might still answer Senator
Thériault's question if Senator de Cotret is not prepared to
answer the question which is not in his area of jurisdiction.
Senator Flynn: I believe Senator de Cotret answered there
had not been any discussion on this specific matter of fisheries.
Stili I might draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that
we have on the order paper Bill S-3 to amend the Coastal
Fisheries Protection Act, the effect of which is to transfer the
administration of part of that problem to the provinces. That
will cone in due time. Perhaps Senator Thériault would read
the bill and draw his own conclusions.

Senator Asselin: We still have diplomatic relations with
Uganda, but as concerns foreign aid, since the government of
that country is not that stable, our bilateral assistance to
Uganda has been reduced to a minimum.

Senator Asselin: Yes.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
CANADIAN LIVESTOCK AID TO UGANDA

Senator Hays: During the late sixties Canada, through
CIDA, provided Uganda with several hundred head of cattle
to improve their genetic pool. Could the minister tell us what
happened to these animals; and indeed, if they are not there, is
Canada thinking about helping these starving people by
replacing the cattle so that they will have a genetic pool of
good livestock cattle from Canada?
Senator Asselin: I cannot say I am aware of the purpose of
this question about the cattle given to Uganda by Canada in
the sixties. The honourable senator should know much better
than 1, because he was Minister of Agriculture at that time.
However, we might study the possibility of sending the honourable senator over there to make his own investigation.
THE ECONOMY
EFFECT OF OIL PRICE INCREASE

Senator Haidasz: I should like to ask the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce whether he agrees with, and is
really concerned about, the alarming statement of the Ontario
Treasurer that a provincial economic study revealed that
Ontario will lose 5,000 jobs for every $1 a barrel increase in
the price of oil?

Senator de Cotret: I have not, quite honestly, had the
opportunity of reading that report. I have no direct knowledge
that that statement was made, I have no knowledge of the
methodology used to get to those numbers, and certainly at
this point I would have no comment to make on the
allegations.
Senator Haidasz: Are we believe what the minister says,
that the federal government has not made any economic study
whatsoever of the grave implications on the economy of this
country of the rise in oil prices in Canada?
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator is drawing an
inference from my previous comments that I do not think is
there. The original question mentioned a very specific study
made by the Government of Ontario, and quoted some very
specific conclusions. I said that I had not seen the specific
study, I had not looked at the methodology and was not in a
position to comment on the results. That is not at all to say
that the federal government has not looked in great detail at
the economic implications of various changes in the price of
energy, be it the price of crude, the price of natural gas, the
substitution of one for the other, or where we go in terms of
our policy of reaching self-sufficiency by 1990. Of course we
have extensive studies into that matter, and they will be made
public as time goes on and as the debate evolves.
Senator McElman: I should like to ask a supplementary
question. If all these studies have been done, is the minister not
in a position to tell us what a dollar a barrel increase in the
price of oil would mean to the industrial heartland of Canada,
Ontario'?
* (1435)

Senator de Cotret: To answer that question, I would have to
assume a number of the conclusions of the exercise that is now
going on between the Prime Minister of Canada, the Minister
of Finance, and the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources
with their provincial counterparts.
Of course, we have made a number of studies. Depending on
what agreement is reached between the producing and consuming provinces, depending on how the increase in the price
of crude is allocated, what is done with the increased revenues,
then the results change. And that is why I say the studies will
be made public in due time, but at this point they would be
fraught with assumptions that may or may not turn out to be
true, and I would certainly not be in a position to comment
about that while the negotiations are still proceeding.
Senator Olson: Where is the freedom of information?
Senator McElman: I have a supplementary question that I
should like to ask. Is the minister telling us that at this point
when they are negotiating with Alberta for an increase in
price-which is variously described as being $1, $2 and $4 a
barrel-they do not know or they cannot communicate to the
Canadian people what the implications of that will be for,
again I repeat, the heartland of manufacturing, industrial
Canada, Ontario? Surely the questions raised by the premier
and the provincial secretary of that province cannot have
passed over the heads of this administration.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator de Cotret: As I said, the negotiations are under
way. They are going very well. They are difficult negotiations.
This is a difficult issue. Certainly we have made studies. We
have positions on the table that are being actively discussed by
ail the parties directly implicated, and we will be very happy to
table whatever necessary documentation when agreement is
reached. I do not think it is appropriate at this point.
Senator Oison: Background information only after the
thought. That is a 180-degree turnaround.
Senator McElman: Is the minister then suggesting that it is
inappropriate that the Government of Ontario is, at this point,
revealing to the Canadian people the implications of this?
Senator de Cotret: No, not if it so wishes.
Senator McElman: Is it fair to leave the Canadian peopleand so the people of Ontario-with the implications from one
side of the picture only, while the Canadian government sits
pat with its information and its studies?
Senator de Cotret: We are not sitting pat. We have made it
very clear that through a process of consultation and co-operation-i know these are rather unfamiliar words to many who
are associated with the past governmentSenator Oison: Freedom of information. That is not it.
Senator de Cotret: In this kind of process we have made
very clear that we are trying to strike the best deal possible for
the Canadian people. We feel it is very important for Canada
to become self-sufficient in energy by the year 1990.

hypothetical at the moment-not be made public. I do not
think it would serve any useful purpose to table that information at this time.

Senator de Cotret: It never had an energy policy.
INDIAN AFFAIRS
JURISDICTION ON CRIMINAL MATTERS

Senator Williams: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. This
question relates to the unnecessary and unjustified killing of an
Indian by a provincial police officer while on an Indian reserve
in the Province of Quebec. I should like to know what the
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is going
to do about this explosive matter, which could lead to more
people being injured or possibly killed on that reservation. The
incident is important in that it occurred just at the time when
the peacekeepers of that reservation had come to an understanding with the provincial police and the City of Montreal
police.

Senator Flynn: I may tell Senator Williams that I discussed
this matter yesterday, while in Halifax on the occasion of the
CCMC meetings, not with the Deputy Attorney General, but
with the Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs of the
Province of Quebec. I was told that the Government of Quebec
is aware of the matter. They mentioned that they were looking
into it. I think my information is as good as yours.
Senator Williams: I thank the Minister of Justice for his
statement. I have never implied at any moment that my
information was better than his; however, neither have I
considered his to be better than mine. As I said, this is not an
isolated incident. As a matter of fact, one of the members of
the band was fired upon five times by the provincial police last
summer.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER ON RESERVATIONS

Senator Austin: I have a supplementary question. I wonder
whether the Leader of the Government, in his capacity as
Attorney General of Canada, can advise us whether he has
responsibility for occurrences relating to law and order on
Indian lands. Can he tell us whether the government's responsibility as trustee for people who live on Indian reservations
includes a separate jurisdictional base for the Attorney General of Canada?
Senator Flynn: My understanding in this regard is that the
administration of justice in areas within a province are the
responsibility of the attorney general of the province
concerned.
With regard to the case at hand, I understand that a police
car followed another car on to the reservation. It was either a
provincial police car or a municipal police car. I understand
that the police officers entered the reservation to try to catch
the driver of a car who had committed some kind of traffic
offence, and that an incident occurred in a rather curious
fashion. I do not underestimate the implications that may be
drawn from the incident, but I think an investigation should
establish exactly what took place before conclusions are
drawn.
As far as my capacity as Attorney General of Canada is
concerned, I know I have no responsibilities at aIl falling on
my shoulders. As I said, the Minister of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development may feel it is his duty to look into this
matter to see what the implications may be as far as his
responsibilities are concerned, but I have no responsibilities in
my capacity as Attorney General of Canada.
AGRICULTURE
REPRESENTATIONS FROM CANADIAN CHICKEN MARKETING
AGENCY

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, my question is for the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. The minister
usually answers questions very candidly and straightforwardly,
but it seems to me that both yesterday and today he did not do
so. As a matter of fact, I thought he dodged the question put
80072-11

by my colleague, Senator Argue, and a supplementary question put by myself, concerning the importation of chicken from
the United States. This is a matter that would appear to me to
come directly under his ministry. If I am wrong, perhaps the
minister could indicate whether it comes under the jurisdiction
of the Ministry of the Secretary of State for International
Trade. The question is: Did the minister receive representations from the Canadian Chicken Marketing Agency concerning the devastating effects that the increase in the quota of
imports of chicken will have on Canadian producers?
Senator de Cotret: In answer to your first question-and I
am not trying to dodge it in any way-the actual negotiations
of an import quota such as this falls under the responsibility of
the Minister of Agriculture.
The Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce administers thereafter the issuance of import permits. The Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce administers this, but
the actual negotiations, either for an import quota or for
export restrictions on commodities such as uranium, or what
have you, are done by the department of the minister responsible. It was in that context-I was not trying to duck the
question asked by Senator Argue-that I asked to be given a
little bit of time to inquire of the Minister of Agriculture as to
the exact nature of the negotiations. The quota was set where
it was set as a result of those negotiations.

•

(1450)

In terms of representations by the producers' group, I would
expect, again, that those representations were probably made
to the Minister of Agriculture. They were not made to me.
Senator Bosa: A supplementary question. In view of the
staggering deficit that has been forecast in our current trade
account-a forecast that is, I believe, in the neighbourhood of
$10 billion-surely the minister ought to know what effect this
change is going to have on that deficit.
Senator de Cotret: First of ail, let me assure ail honourable
senators that this government is not forecasting a deficit of $10
billion on our current trade account. There is no suggestion
that the deficit, whether for this year or for next year, would
reach $10 billion. I am aware that there are some in the
private sector who have indicated that the deficit could reach
that magnitude, but that is certainly not the view of this
government.
In terms of negotiations on limiting imports, by the very
nature of limiting imports we are going to put a limit on any
further deterioration in our current trade position. The limiting of imports will have to have a beneficial impact on the
deficit.
Senator Bosa: A further supplementary. I hesitate to name
the source from which I am quoting my information, but it is a
reliable one. I do not quote the source because I can recall the
present Minister of Justice once rebuking me for doing exactly
that.
I have before me the following quotation:

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
The deficit in international trade in goods and services
may reach $10-billion in 1980-81, up sharply from an
estimated $7-billion deficit for this year, International
Trade Minister Michael Wilson says.
Is he not an authority? Does he not speak on behalf of the
government? Is that not an authoritative source of
information?
Senator de Cotret: That remark-and it was made yesterday, I believe, before the Canadian Export AssociationSenator Perrault: That is right.
Senator de Cotret: It was made in the context of pointing
out that, in some sectors, there are assumptions that the trade
deficit could be as high as $10 billion next year. While the
minister did make that statement, it is not a government
forecast. It was made to underline the fact that if some people
are already starting to talk in these terms, it is time we became
much more aggressive in the area of trade. That is not a
government forecast. The minister was quoting sources in the
industry who have made their own assumptions, their own
forecasts, in suggesting that it might reach $10 billion.

TRANSPORT
AIRPORT MAINTENANCE

Senator Norrie: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government. It has been brought to my
attention recently that maintenance crews in our airports are
being reduced in great numbers, with the result that at some
airports they have only one or two runways operating. In my
opinion, this constitutes a danger in the winter to the travelling
public. I would ask that the government leader reassure us that
this will not continue to be the case.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I shall secure an
answer to that question from the Minister of Transport.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

[English]
THE ECONOMY
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE
TRANSACTIONS

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, before getting to my
main question for the Minister of State for Economic Development, I might say that he startles me with the doctrine that a
forecast made by a minister is not a government forecast.
Perhaps he can enlighten us as to when a minister, in making
forecasts, is or is not speaking on behalf of the government.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I tried to make it
clear in my previous answer-and I shall do so again-that the
minister was quoting private sources when he made reference
to the current trade account deficit possibly reaching $10
billion. He did not make any forecast, either personally or in
the name of the government, of a $10 billion deficit in the
current trade account.
Senator Austin: I can accept that, but I think a minister
should be more careful, because such statements will be adopted by reference unless, when referring to them, he specifically
disclaims them.
To go on, I should like to give the Globe and Mail a chance
to be right one out of three times this afternoon. In its Report
on Business, the Globe and Mail states that the Canadian
dollar yesterday dropped as low as 84.16 cents and that the
recovery to 84.36 cents was aided by stepped-up support
operations from Bank of Canada currency traders acting for
the government.
I asked the minister a question on October 11 last with
respect to the policy of the government in intervening in
currency exchange transactions in order to stabilize the trading of the Canadian dollar. Could the minister now give this
chamber his advice, on behalf of the government, as to the
activities we can expect from the Bank of Canada in intervening in these transactions.
Senator de Cotret: I shall be happy to refer that question to
the Minister of Finance and provide an answer as soon as
possible.
Senator Austin: I do not mean to be nasty, Senator de
Cotret, but that was your answer on October I1.
Senator Flynn: It is still valid.

FOREIGN AID POLICY OF GOVERNMENT

Senator Hays: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of State for CIDA. Did I understand the minister
to say that the government is reducing aid to countries like
Uganda?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: No, I did not say that aid had been eut off.
However, as long as the new government in Uganda cannot
ensure its stability, our aid as far as bilateral projects are
concerned will be reduced. On the other hand, the food
assistance program has remained the same.

problem.
I understand now that there are some questions to be
answered, so 1 shall withdraw my call for Orders of the Day
for the time being.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, perhaps at the end of
questioning, the Speaker might invite ministers who have
replies to questions previously asked to rise and provide those
answers. I am in the hands of the house as to whether that
should be done at that point or at the beginning of Question

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
THE ENVIRONMENT

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have a reply to
Senator Steuart's question about the construction of a hydroelectric plant in Coronach, Saskatchewan.

GRAIN
TRANSPORTATION POLICY-STATISTICS RESPECTING WESTERN
CANADIAN GRAINS TABLED

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I would also like to
answer Senator Steuart's question of October 17-some time
ago, unfortunately. 1 now table some specific statistics dealing
with grain shipments and grain exports.
Senator Steuart: For 40 years?
Senator de Cotret: Well, not quite for 40 years yet, but we
are still working on that.
Senator de Cotret then tabled:
Three statistical tables respecting movement of western
Canadian grains for the periods from June I to October
11, 1978 and May 31 to October 10, 1979; namely,
Producers' Marketings-Prairie Provinces, Cumulative
Total of Shipments from Prairie Country Elevators and
Total Exports of Canadian Grain.

POINT OF ORDER

ENERGY
MOVEMENT OF OIL FROM ALASKA TO LOWER FORTY-EIGHT
STATES

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, a question was
asked last evening by the Leader of the Opposition with
respect to the specific dates and the people involved in making
our representations to the Americans in relation to the pipeline
issue.
The first meeting was on June 6, a meeting of the Ambassador of Canada with the then Secretary of Energy, Secretary
Schlesinger. A second meeting took place on June 15, involving a representative of the Ambassador of Canada in Washington with officiais of the Department of the Interior of the
United States, and then there was a meeting on August 3
between the Ambassador of Canada and representatives of the
State Department of the United States.
* (1500)

There was a meeting on August 21 between the Ambassador
of Canada and officiais of the State Department and the
Energy Department of the United States; a meeting on September 6, as I have indicated frequently, consisting of consultations on energy, including senior officiais in Ottawa; a
meeting on September 21 between the Ambassador of Canada
and Secretary Duncan; and a meeting on September 23 between the Embassy of Canada and officiais of the State
Department in addition to the meeting which I mentioned
yesterday between the Secretary of State for External Affairs

Senator Frith: I rise on a point of order. It is suggested that
the tabling of answers to questions previously asked should
come at the end of the Question Period. Does that mean that
those answers are to end the Question Period, and that further
questions cannot be asked arising out of the answers tabled?
Senator Flynn: No, no. They could.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, in answer to
the question posed by Senator Frith, I would say that there is
no rule to that effect. I was merely attempting to create a
situation where I would not cali Orders of the Day when there
are questions pending or when ministers or others are prepared
to answer previous questions. I think honourable senators will
appreciate the reluctance of ministers and others to rise when
they might feel that they were cutting off questions. Therefore
I would say in reply to Senator Frith there is no such rule, and
we shall carry on as we have done up to now without further
intervention from me.
Senator McElman: Honourable senators, it is not too often
that I disagree with the Honourable the Leader of the Government, but in this case I would pray to do so and make the
suggestion that when ministers bring with them at the outset
of a sitting answers to questions posed the day before or at
previous sessions of the Senate, it would be most useful if those
were given at the start of the Question Period. This would
enable senators who are pressing for information in a given
area to ask supplementary questions and it might very well
also obviate some questions that would arise and be answered.

October 24, 1979

Senator Flynn: I have no objection to that. His Honour the
Speaker could invite ministers who have answers to questions
previously asked to provide the answers right at the beginning.
There is no problem with that. If that is the wish of the house,
then I am in your hands.
Senator Perrault: May we discuss it?
Senator Flynn: The Leader of the Opposition suggests that
we discuss it, and we will report the conclusions to which we
have come.

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

speak about some aspects of the record of the new government.
I freely admit that after only five months there is not much
record. One would not expect to have much record. Looking
back on the record, I am not too disappointed. There is not a
great deal to talk about. They are very promising. The government was very promising before the election, and it has been
very promising since the election. However, there are some
things about the record that are positive and some things that
are negative, from my point of view, and some things that are
rather surprising.
Honourable senators, for a few minutes I will deal, first,
with some of the things that I find surprising.
When I think about the Conservatives, some of the members
opposite and many of the members in the other place, and
think back over the years-a year ago, two years ago, three,
four or five years ago---one thing that stands out is that the
Conservatives, almost to a man, or a woman, were against
political patronage. Whenever political patronage by the
former Liberal government reared its head, the Conservatives
of the day, both in the other place and in this place, heaped
scorn upon the government. In fact, they were almost as
sanctimonious in their approach as the NDP, and that is
almost impossible, because the NDP across this country have
almost got a corner on being sanctimonious, especially about
political patronage, except where they have been in power. The
Tories promised that if they ever came to power there would
be an end to political patronage. Everything would be as clean
as a whistle. Everything would be on the merit system. The
spoil system for the winners would be ended.
To give them credit, even after the election I recall a
statement by Mr. Walter Baker, now a minister of the Crown
and house leader in the other place, who actually came out and
warned professionals-I recall him especially warning lawyers
and other professional groups-that when the new government
looked to hand out business or assignments to the legal profession, to architects, to engineers, to consultants, it would not be
done on a political basis, but that it would be done strictly on
merit. Well, honourable senators, I can tell you that the shock
wave that went across this nation among the Conservative
lawyers, engineers and architects was so great that it could
have been measured on the Richter scale. They were absolutely in a state of shock, especially the lawyers. These lawyers
had laboured in the vineyard for 17 long years, had attended
meetings, and had even run in Quebec, which is almost the
height of loyalty and honour that they can do their party. They
had stood around for 17 years, drooling on the outside while
they watched those Liberal confrères of theirs getting all the
goodies. Then they had finally achieved success, and the door
had been unceremoniously slammed in their faces. They were
bitter, to say the least.
It reminded me of a story an old senator once told me when
I first came into politics. He said, "Son, you want to remember
something. When you get into politics, everybody in politics
wants something." He said, "The lawyers want to be judges.
The businessmen want to get contracts. Everybody wants a job
for their son or their daughter or their uncle. Everybody wants

something." He said, "You've even got those wild-eyed radicals that want good government."
Well, this was what the poor Tories across Canada, the
professionals, were reduced to: hoping against hope that the
reward might be good government. But then a change came.
Out in Jasper, at one of the longest continuing cabinet meetings ever held in this country, one day, while I was watching
television, on came Roch La Salle, one of the new 0.5 or half
ministers from Quebec. He announced with great glee and
great pride that he intended to rebuild the Conservative Party
in Quebec based on patronage.
Senator Perrault: Shame! Shame!
Senator Steuart: I was shocked, I have to admit it, but,
shortly after, he was half carried away by a couple of young
fellows who appeared out of the trees. Soon after that there
appeared before the television camera the Prime Minister
elect, Mr. Joe Clark, and he put a good face on it. He said,
"Well, now, we are not really going to have patronage, but we
are going to make changes. We are going to take some of those
terrible Liberals off the payroll, but we are going to get the
best people. Surely the best people must be Conservatives. So
in that regard, well, there may be a little patronage."
Senator Perrault: Shocking!
Senator Steuart: Well, there was a kind of sigh of relief, like
a chinook that came out of the West, from all of the professional people, especially the lawyers across Canada.
I want to tell you one thing. You have to give the Conservatives credit. When they jettison a principle, they don't fool
around. They don't fool around. Because what did they do
next? The next thing you know they had hired one of the party
faithful, Jean Pigott, a former Conservative MP, and they had
installed her in an office here to supervise the hiring. I think
her official function was to do the senior job placement.
Well, I read an article by Dalton Camp, and I believe
everything Dalton Camp has said about the Conservative
Party for the last 20 years. I believe he is the guru of the
Conservative Party. While he didn't exactly put it this way, he
left the impression that what Mrs. Pigott was really doing was
applying the blood test or the saliva test to all the candidates,
because if you are going to hire Tories you had better make
sure they are third generation, true-blue Tories. So that is her
job.
Senator Perrault: They just get a few cookie crumbs.
Senator Steuart: Well, she might be called the cookie
monster by those who failed the blood test.
This brought up another problem, a serious problem,
because if you are going to hire Conservatives you have to fire
somebody, especially if you are on the verge of getting rid of
60,000 civil servants. If you are going to fire somebody, that
implies that you might have a hit list. One of the things the
Conservatives promised and came out and said was that "We
have no hit list."
I am sure that civil servants, like Mr. Pitfield, Mr. Hood
and poor Bryce Mackasey, felt a lot better, when they were

SENATE DEBATES
fired, to know that they had just been hit by a stray bullet. It
was flot a hit Jist. [t was flot by design. It was just by chance,
sort of a shotgun approach.
Senator Perrault: Anti-aircraft.
Senator Steuart: Before I continue, let me make it clear that
J don't really blame the Conservatives. 1 remember that John
Diefenbaker always claimed that one of the things that heiped
to put him out of office was that he didn't really clean house
when he had the chance. So 1 don't blame them. I seriously
don't blame them. 1 think any new government should have
around them people they can trust, people who are loyal and
people who have the same philosophy.
But 1 warn you, and 1 warn you very seriously, in your haste
to clean out the Liberals and 1 imagine they are easily
identifial5le and there really won't be too many of them-don't
overlook the NDP.
You know, when J was a member of the Thatcher government for seven years in Saskatchewan, we took over from the
CCF, the sociaiists who had been in for 20 years, and we may
have dismissed the odd civil servant.
Somie Hon. Senators: Oh. oh.
Senator Steuart: Quite a few of them were odd; J can tell
you that. As a matter of fact, they uscd to say that the height
of optimism was a civil servant in Regina who brought his
lunch. 1 don't think that was quite truc, but I tell you we did
replace a few of them. They foilowed the same patterni: they
would go home; they wouid pack their bags; they wouid phone
the press; they wouid make a very bitter statement about what
kind of a backward fascist government we were; and then thcy
would [cave for Ottawa, where they were immediately hired by
the federal government. J freely admit that the Liberais hired
them and you inheritcd them. They are stili here and they hoid
many key positions. And 1 tell you this: you wiii ignore thein at
your peril.
*(1520)

0f course, if you take any action, the press will criticize you.
1 have always been amazed at the press in Ottawa, and almost
anywhere cisc in this country. They have been watching the
politicai process for over 100 years aind they are stili shockcd
by how it works. Mind you, when politicians look at the press,
they are pretty shocked by how thcy work too. So it sort of
evens things out.
The NDP wili be stunned. 1 tell you. they wiil react. As a
matter of fact. 1 watched their leader, Mr. Broadbent, shortiy
after Roch La Salie had gone out and toid the truth, thcreby
breaking the eleventh commandment of the Conservative
Party. J watched him, and he was outraged. [n fact, 1 thought
he was going to have a double hernia, he was so outraged, that
any party wouid stoop te hiring their own friends when they
got into power.
I found that very interesting. As i said, J fought for 20 years
unsuccessfully against Tommy Douglas. We neyer beat hîm
until he went federal. However, Tommy Douglas ran for 20
years successfuliy berating the Jimmy Gardiner machine-and
[Senator Steuart.

Otbr2.1724, 1979

Jimmy Gardiner did have a pretty good machine. 1 will tell
you something: Tommy Douglas developed a political
machine, with political patronage, that would make Jimmy
Gardiner's look like comparing a Cadillac owned by Douglas
to a N4odel T owned by Jimmny Gardiner. There was no
comparison. Yet Tommy Douglas could go around saying very
sanctimoniously and he knows a lot about sanctity; he went
Let's take off the gloves and sec
to college to learn about itwhose hands are really dirty", and no one would really believe
that in hiring his own friends and indulging in a littie political
patronage his hands were in fact dirty.
[n 1971 Allan Blakeney became the Premier of Saskatchewan. To give honourable senators an example, within one ycar
he had dismissed every deputy minister in the province of
Saskatchewan-every one of them. [n fact. he got so carried
away that four of those he fired were his own supporters.
0f course, no one believes this about Allan Blakeney,
because Allan Blakeney is a Rhodes Scholar, talks very slowly
and is considered by the national press and almost anyone else
as being much too intelligent to indulge in that kind of
hanky-panky. But come out to Saskatchewan. If you want a
job, if you want to get a contract, if you want to do anything,
if you are not a faithful member of the NDP, you had better
forget about it. So when you hear Mr. Broadbent talking. take
it with, flot a grain of saIt but a bucketful of saIt.
1 said that 1 was going to speak about somne of the surprising
things, some of the positive aspects. Some of the latter, which
have already been referred to, include the attitude of the new
goverfiment towards the Senate. That has been encouraging. [t
is challenging, and 1 am confident that the Senate will risc to
the occasion and will become a much more effective and
positive force in the Parliament of Canada.
J think also that the promise of open government is good,
and 1 hope that the government will not only talk about it but
will carry it out. [n my view, legislation such as a sunset law is
overdue and can be very valuable. Certainly, there are other
positive things on which the new government has embarked.
J want now to talk about some of the negatîve things. J shaîl
net talk about PetroCan, as others, with more knowledge of
the subject. will do so. 1 will flot even talk about lsrael. Earlier
today a question was directed to Senator de Cotret in which he
was asked whether he had conversed with Bob Stanfield. Wc
ail know and respect Mr. Stanfield, and I really wish that the
Prime Mvinister would Jet himi stay home. J-e has been traipsing around the world, and in fact, people are calling himi
'"Stanfield of Arabia"'. J believe he now has to return to the
M4iddle East. J think the reai reason why the Prime Minister
does flot want to taik to him is that if he does se for even one
second he wili get the report, and J believe it will be the
shortest report in history. Mr. Stanfield wiJJ waik in and say,
"About moving the embassy: Don't!" and that will be the
end of it.
However, as J have said, J am flot going to talk about that. I
propose dealing for a few minutes with conditions concerning

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

the sale of grain, and transportation problems affecting farmers generally, but western farmers in particular.
Honourable senators, for over 10 years, leading up to 1979,
the Conservatives in the other place-and perhaps also in this
place, although I am not aware of it happening in the Senate-joined hands with the NDP and criticized, opposed and
blocked almost every move that the Liberal government of the
day made to sell more grain and to upgrade the transportation
system, or even to help the farmers of this country in general,
and particularly those in western Canada.
They were particularly critical of any study that was made,
or of any task force that was set up. The only exception, I
believe, was the Hall Commission. They were not critical of
that. Whether it was due to the fact that Mr. Justice Hall is
universally respected, I do not know. I notice that he is
everybody's favourite royal commissioner. He has worked for
the governments of Saskatchewan and Ontario, and is now
engaged, following appointment by the federal government, on
a study of medicare. He is a fine gentleman and also a fine
Tory. I am not sure whether the terms are necessarily interchangeable, but he happens to be both.
Let us consider the Snavely Report, the Prairie Rail Action
Committee, and even the latest Booz-Allen Report, which is
now in the hands of the government and which points out
excellent ways in which the grain handling system can be
improved and made more efficient.
For years the Tories had all the answers. They said, "We
have had enough studies. We don't need any more studies.
What we need is immediate action"-and they promised
immediate action. One could say that five months surely is not
a very long period in which to give the new government time to
take action. But let us remember that these fellows have been
in training for 17 years, and they had al] the answers during
the whole of that time. They were ready to go. I thought they
would be out of the block like a shot. I thought we would see
grain moving and records broken. In fact, the new minister
promised that they would increase the record by 20 per cent
this year. I hope they make it, but I did not think they would
make it even before the First Narrows Bridge was knocked
down in Vancouver.
Let us see exactly what they have done. I have with me a
report that immediately after they took office in June the new
government received the final Booz-Allen report which contained dozens of proposals for changes in our grain handling
system to improve efficiency. Most of the equipment is now
available. What was the Tory response? First, they are proceeding with the purchase of more hopper cars, which, of
course, is a continuation of the policy set up by the Liberals.
Secondly, they are going to repair more boxcars to save them
for grain-again a continuation of Liberal policy. They are
proceeding with negotiations to build a terminal at Prince
Rupert. Those negotiations were opened months before the
Conservative Party became the government, and indeed the
sum of $30 million was set aside, as a beginning, toward the
development of this important terminal-again a continuation
of the Liberal program.

They appointed Hugh Horner. For those honourable senators who do not know Hugh Horner, he is the brother of Jack
Horner. Hugh Horner is the Horner who has not seen the
light: he is still true-blue Tory. He is a fine man, but he is also
devoutly anti-Wheat Board. I can tel] honourable senators who
are not aware of it that the vast majority of farmers in western
Canada support the Wheat Board. They want it, and they do
not want to see it destroyed.
Hugh Horner was appointed as a grain movement coordinator. The move was in the planning stage at the time of the
previous government. To date, the new coordinator is largely
impotent because he has no legislative authority to give orders.
His only accomplishment so far has been to assume the powers
previously exercised by the Wheat Board, and many believe
that in this case the board has been weakened.
In addition, the new government is now proceeding with
more studies which they previously condemned. For example,
they appointed a task force of Tory MPs chaired by Jack
Murta, who is the Conservative member of Parliament for
Lisgar in southern Manitoba. The assignment of this committee is to study al] those studies which have been done up to
date, including the Booz-Allen report, and to file a report this
fall with the new minister, Mr. Don Mazankowski. Such a
report has been filed, but it has also promptly been buried.
According to the best information we can find, from people
who were contacted, this Tory task force has proposed such
things as massive farm trucking programs, heavy use of inland
terminals and special selective delivery quotas to favour large
delivery points on heavy rail lines. If this is truc, no wonder it
was buried. Parliament and the public have a right to this
report. I would point out that the task force was funded not by
the Conservative Party but by the Government of Canada, and
if it has recommended measures which detract from the
Wheat Board operation, and discriminate against small farmers and small towns, that bias should be known to the public.
Furthermore, this task force has now been rolled over into an
advisory body under the new grain coordinator, Mr. Horner.
Again, many serious and responsible farm leaders are worried
about what this particular group may have in mind with
regard to the Wheat Board.
*

(1530)

They have, of course, gone further than that. They have set
up a second task force, or study group, that is also at work at
the present time, headed up by Doug Neil, the Conservative
member for Moose Jaw. His assignment was to look at the
very few rail lines in the prairies left in an uncertain condition
after the work donc by the Hall Commission and the Prairie
Rail Action Committee. The efforts of the previous government removed most of the doubt about the status of most
prairie branch lines. It is a fact that when the Liberals left
office they had already extended permanent protection against
abandonment to a full 80 per cent of the rail lines in the
prairies, and these lines would serve better than 90 per cent of
the farmers in western Canada. These lines were guaranteed
for the future, and work had begun on upgrading them to
modern hopper car standards. There was an $800 million

SENATE DEBATES
commitment undertaken and launched by the Liberals, and
over $100 million was spent. For the still doubtful lines we had
created a western arm of the Canadian Transport Commission
based in the prairies to examine their case again, and to ensure
that no line was abandoned improperly or prematurely. The
western CTC had already begun to hold hearings and to
review the cases of those few lines left in question.
The Neil study interrupted this project, and I think it has
added a decidedly political element to the decision-making
process which was not there before. In addition, the Neil study
was instructed to take the advice of grain companies about
what lines they wanted to keep, and which ones, in their
opinion, could go; but no provision was made for hearings from
farm groups and from local communities. Recently, a report of
this study was delayed another 30 days. Again, I think farmers
are anxious to hear this report, and they have every right to
hear it as quickly as possible.
Again, we see the continuation of the actions of the former
government-no new actions, just studies and more studies,
carrying on with the programs already in place.
Honourable senators, to shed further light on the government's plans, I went to the statements of Don Mazankowski,
the new Minister of Transport and the minister in charge of
the Wheat Board. I have here such a statement that I saw in a
little magazine called "Transpo", put out by the Department
of Transport. It says:
"Don Mazankowski discusses his priorities in Canadian
transportation."
Then, in an insert, it says:
"Here are some of Transport Minister Don Mazankowski's transportation goals and objectives:"
The first one is very interesting, and very laudable. He says:
-Move swiftly to re-establish Canada's reputation as a
reliable grain exporting nation by getting grain on the
move.
If we are going to re-establish a reputation, this must mean
that we already had an excellent reputation at one time for
moving grain to market and fulfilling our commitments. When
was that reputation established, and when was it lost? It surely
could not have been established during the last years of the
Liberals, especially under Otto Lang, the target of so much
abuse and criticism by the members opposite, and by the
members opposite in the other place when they were in opposition, so perhaps it was the last time the Conservatives were in
power.
Again I went to the records, which proved most interesting.
I have here figures in millions of bushels for actual export and
sale of all grains from the crop year 1955-56 to the crop year
showing the latest figures we have, 1978-1979. For the information of those senators who may not be aware of it, the crop
year runs from the end of July to August 1 of the following
year.
When I go back to the 1957-1958 crop year, I find that that
was the year the Conservatives sold and moved to market a
[Senator steuart.]

October 24, 1979

record amount of wheat up to that time. That was the time
Alvin Hamilton dashed over to China about a week after the
agreement was signed by the Wheat Board and got his picture
taken shovelling grain. There is no doubt that Alvin could
shovel it, and for many years he has been able to make it stick
on the prairies as well. That particular year, however, they
marketed a total of all grains of 453 million bushels. That was
a record. Is that what Don Mazankowski wants to take us
back to, to find a move to market of 453 million bushels?
Well, let us look at the figures from then on. If we do that we
find that the record wasn't nearly so good: 396 million, 367
million, 428 million. They never equalled that record again, in
the seven years they held office.
Now let us look at the last 10 years. The worst year of the
10 years under the Liberal administration that they ever had
in moving grain to market was 485.7 million bushels, about 30
million bushels higher than the best performance that was ever
accomplished by the Conservatives. The best year under the
Liberals was 1977-78, when almost 1 billion bushels of grain
were sold and moved to market: 845.2 million bushels of grain,
almost double the best year under the Conservatives. If you
are going to re-establish Canada's reputation, I guess you go
back to the best year they ever had. Interestingly enough, the
best year ever, 1978-1979, was under Otto Lang, the man they
heaped so much scorn and abuse on. I just put that on the
record so that it is on the record, and so that people will know
where this new government starts out from when they boast
that they will increase the sale and marketing of grain in the
first year by at least 20 per cent. They have a tough target,
and I hope they hit it. We all hope they hit it. We will be
watching them very closely.
How does Mr. Mazankowski intend to accomplish this?
What are his plans? Again, I could not find any new plans, as
laid out by the new minister, but I went to a statement by
Senator de Cotret that he made in this house in answer to a
question I put to him on October 17. I quote him:
SENATOR DE COTRET: Certainly. I should like to
underline for the senator the very urgent attention we
gave this whole problem of moving grain to the market,
and ensuring that we can meet our export commitments.
As he knows, our rolling stock has been allowed to
deteriorate to a frightening level. As he well knows, we
were not able to move the same amount of grain to
market as our commitments required. We were falling
behind, and that is why we announced earlier the acquisition of 2,000 hopper cars and why we also announced, on
the part of the federal government, the renovation of
2,000 boxcars to help move grain to market. That is also
why we announced the Prince Rupert terminal.

Senator de Cotret made this sound as though it was something new. He made it sound as though this was a brand new
thrust, made, as Mr. Mazankowski says, to return Canada to
its former position of prominence and repair its damaged
reputation. These things are commendable, but they are hardly
new.

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Let me go back to the record and point out that from 1970
to the election in 1979, the Liberal government invested $870
million in the prairies for the transportation of grain. That
included 8,000 hopper cars. In the case of boxcar rehabilitation, the amount involved was $3.4 million in 1974, and in
1978, $7.3 million. In other words, there was over $10 million
to rehabilitate boxcars; for branch line subsidies to keep these
branch lines in question operating to serve the farmers, $435.1
million; and for branch line rehabilitation $100 million.
0

(1540)

Now let us keep what the new government says is a new
program, 2,000 hopper cars, in proper perspective. The Liberal
government added 8,000 boxcars; the Conservative government says it will add 2,000; the little province of Saskatchewan
is going to buy 1,000 hopper cars; and Alberta is going to buy
1,000. The Saskatchewan government is going to turn over
their hopper cars to be used by the Wheat Board for the
benefit of all Canadians. Alberta has said that their hopper
cars will be used only to move Alberta grain to market-this is
scarcely becoming from what is now, or will soon be, the
richest province in Canada. Premier Lougheed may be acting
in the way he has for years accused Ontario of acting. I hope
the members in Alberta will say that they do not think this is
good enough and encourage him to change his mind.
What I want to point out, honourable senators, is that this
so-called new thrust is neither much of a thrust nor is it new.
There is no question that our rolling stock and our transportation system have been allowed to run down. There is no
question that what the Liberal government did from 1970 to
1979 was late. It was not too little; it was a huge sum of
money, but it should have been done earlier. As a matter of
fact, if you study the record, you will find that little or nothing
was done to improve our transportation system in western
Canada, our port facilities and our rolling stock from the end
of the Second World War until 1970. The Liberal government
must take some of the blame for this. Certainly a Conservative
government, with a predominance of Conservative members
and a Conservative Prime Minister from western Canada,
must also take their fair share of the blame. They did absolutely nothing.
Honourable senators know that our rolling stock and our
rail system do not go to pot overnight. Whether they did
enough is arguable, but let us give the former government
credit. The Liberal government made a very good start, and all
the people of Canada, particularly of western Canada, hope
that this new government is serious, and that it will do even
more. I urge the new government, as they have promised to
take action, to stop living in the past. They are the government
now. What has been done has been done. They have done their
job on Otto Lang, an excellent job politically, and a hatchet
job in western Canada. Now the ball is in their court. The
farmers are not going to listen to any more excuses from the
Tory benches. The Tories made election promises of action.
The farmers gave them their votes. Now give them that action.
Just before I close I should like to say that we are threatened-and I use the word "threatened"-that the new Con80072-12

servative government may raise the surcharge on gasoline by
23 cents. They are talking about increasing the price of a
barrel of oil in Canada by $4, and doing that every year over
the next three or four years until we bit world market prices. I
want honourable senators to consider what effect this will have
in Ontario, the heartland of our industry. I should also like you
to think about what it will do to the farmers of this nation.
If this move is intended to encourage people to conserve, we
had better think about the farmers. They cannot conserve if
they are to produce. It is going to cost them in two ways: the
fuel they use for their equipment, and the fertilizer they use. I
have been told by farmers that the jump contemplated for this
year will add two, three or five thousand dollars a year to
farmers' costs. Farmers have very little or no control over the
price of the goods they sell. If they have no control over the
costs of producing these goods, and if they are bit with a blow
like this, with no recognition of their problem by the new
government, and no softening of the blow, I warn the government that they will put most small- and medium-sized farmers
out of business.
I urge the government to think seriously about what this
move, this sudden fantastic jump in the price of fuel and
fertilizer, will do to the farmers of this nation. Certainly, I and
other senators on this side welcome the promises and the
commitment by the new government to take more action on
the sale and movement of grain. We welcome and applaud the
commitment to continue to step up help to the farmers of this
nation. If they do, we will support them. If they do not, we will
oppose them.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, having heard Senator Steuart's advice on the question of patronage, I am convinced that the Prime Minister appointed me to this place to
further my education. I realize that the honourable senator bas
a lot of expertise in the field of patronage, but I did not dream,
even in my wi!dest dreams, that he would share it so generously with us this afternoon.
About fifteen years ago I began work in this side of the
Parliament Buildings on an assignment as assistant to the late
Senator Wallace McCutcheon, an assignment that was to last
two or three years. My association with Senator McCutcheon
was an opportunity for me to learn from an extraordinarily
gifted and dynamic Canadian. My association with this place
gave me some insight into what the Senate can contribute to
our country, and a considerable respect for the eminent people
who were here, many of whom, happily, are still here today.
I wish to thank two of them-the Minister of Justice, who is
also the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and Senator
Walker-for having introduced me in this house as a new
senator on the opening day of the session.
At its best, the Senate bas always addressed itself to the
longer term interests of the country, and senators have spoken
from some philosophical and historical context or perspective
of public policy. I believe that tradition was exemplified in the
speeches we heard from Senator Bielish and Senator Charbonneau on opening day, and in the speeches of our respected

SENATE DEBATES
Leader and Minister of Justice and the Leader of the Opposition, who set a positive tone for this debate and for this session,
which I hope 1 can emulate.
On opening day, when the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister entered this chamber and bowed to His Honour the
Speaker, whose appointment he had announced earlier, I could
not help but recall that the first time I met Mr. Clark was
some seventeen years ago, when he took up his first job in this
city, for which he was hired by Allister Grosart. That is not
the least of Senator Grosart's contributions to this country. He
has made many others, not only in terms of the several
electoral successes, for which he is perhaps best known-at
least in the circles that I travel in-but when he was the
National Director he gave the Conservative Party a new and
more democratic constitution and laid down rules to ensure
that the formation of constituency associations and the nomination of candidates would be donc in a more open and
democratic manner than theretofore. That was a very important contribution to the political process of this country, and
one which I want to acknowledge, as one of his successors and
legatees in party affairs, now that he has moved on to higher
duties as the presiding officer of this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
* (1550)

Senator Murray: There were not many surprises in the
Speech from the Throne, because honourable senators, along
with other Canadians, were aware of the analysis and diagnosis that the Conservative Party had been making of the
problems of this country for the past several years. There were
no surprises because the Speech reflects the prescription, the
program, that the Conservative Party offered during the election campaign, and for several years previous to it.
[Translation]
The Leader of the Opposition rightly said the other day that
the content of a Throne Speech was not in itself a valid
criterion on which tojudge a government.
I would add that, in the final analysis the voters' verdict will
depend on the respect this government will have for the
mandate we were given last May. In due time we will want to
have such a judgment made. That is why I would like to
indicate briefly how we, of the Conservative Party, interpret
that mandate.
We, of the Conservative Party, believe the government has
the mandate to change course. The people of Canada do not
want to hear from their new government what they heard from
the former one, namely that the sources of our problems
originate from abroad and the solutions lie outside this
country.
Canadians are convinced that we have in this country the
necessary natural and human resources to solve our major
problems and that we can do it ourselves. Indeed, that was the
main theme of our electoral campaign. Following that campaign, the voters, even if they do not expect immediate results,
are entitled to expect immediate action.
[Senator Murray

October 24, 1979

There is another equally important aspect: Canadians expect
a change in the quality of government. That is not only a
matter of style, but of substance. This has to do with the
relationships that exist between the people and their government. Canadians expect their new government to pay more
attention to them, to listen to them more often and ta be more
sensitive to their representations.
The mandate that the Conservative Party was seeking last
May can be summed up in five major themes. First, to realize
Canada's potential; second, to cut government spending and
increase its effectiveness; third, to provide a better rate of
economic growth by relying more on the private sector; fourth,
to increase the rights and liberties of the ordinary citizen
vis-à-vis the state and also increase his sense of belonging to
this country; fifth, to bring in a new era of cooperation
between Ottawa and the provinces.
Those themes, our major commitments in our election campaign, appear in the Speech from the Throne. The speech
indicates generally that the government intends to carry out its
mandate by realizing Canada's potential. For example, the
most ambitious and most important program will be to reach
energy self-sufficiency by 1990. Canadians are prepared to
make the necessary efforts and sacrifices to reach that vital
objective for our economic security as a country.
The second and third themes are almost inseparable. It is
not because we feel that a balanced budget is in itself a
panacea that we are committed to compressing government
expenditures. Moreover, we are not naive enough to believe
that compressing expenditures and reducing deficits can be
donc overnight. On the contrary, we want to reduce government expenditures to free resources for the private sector, to
stimulate economic growth and produce income that will
enable us gradually to achieve a balanced budget. In part,
therefore, it is a matter of confidence. A government which
sets the example by limiting expenditures and taxes, a government whose economic policies and objectives are sound, and
not exposed to sudden turn-abouts, and which is determined to
encourage growth in the private sector, is in itself a positive
factor which inspires confidence.
Bills such as the one on freedom of information well illustrate the fourth theme I have mentioned, which is to increase
the rights and freedoms of the ordinary citizen with regard to
the state. Helping Canadians own a larger share of our
country is also one of the aims of our economic and social
policies. Our program for encouraging home ownership, and
the tax measures promised to stimulate investment in Canadian businesses listed on the stock exchange are other proofs of
our commitment to that goal.
@ (1600)

[English]
Honourable senators, the fifth major theme of the mandate
that I have described was to bring in a new period of co-operation between Ottawa and the provinces. Nowhere is there a
greater difference between the new government and the old
than in our attitude and approach to federal-provincial rela-

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

tions. Senator Frith made the point last night, but unfortunately made it, I think, in drawing a caricature rather than an
apt description of the policy of the government. Be that as it
may, for proof of the difference between us I think we need not
describe the record of eleven years of turmoil in federal-provincial relations that have past, but just look at the last few
months.
The fact of the matter is that the loyal opposition reacted
with cries of outrage when the new government carried out its
undertaking to transfer control of the lottery to the provinces.
The Liberal Party leadership sincerely believes that only
Ottawa is capable of running a lottery. They appear to believe,
further, that to give the provinces control of the lottery somehow undermines the future of Confederation.
We have more confidence in Confederation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Murray: A more substantive difference concerns
the government's decision to transfer full control over offshore
resources to the coastal provinces. We believe that this decision-which the Conservative Party advocated for some years
under both our previous leader, Robert Stanfield, and Mr.
Clark-is logical and right in that it gives those provinces the
same control over offshore resources that provinces enjoy over
resources underground.
We believe that this decision will strengthen Confederation
because it demonstrates our desire to have strong provinces,
capable of standing on their own feet and with access to the
sources of revenue that will let them carry out the responsibilities-in some cases the exclusive responsibilities-that the
Constitution imposes on them. As somebody has said, we want
the provinces to be partners, not clients.
This Parliament can impose its will on the provinces. The
Government of Canada can act unilaterally and have its own
way in various matters. But as the Prime Minister has pointed
out, national unity, the future of our Confederation and its
strength, is not going to depend on the urdoubted ability of
Ottawa to have its way, but on the willingness of all the
partners to work together.
That is the kind of leadership that we want to bring-in our
party and in the new government-to federal-provincial relations, always realizing it is the national interest that is paramount; that Ottawa has the power to act when it is necessary,
but we do not begin every negotiation by brandishing our
authority and waving a big stick.
These themes that I have touched on recur in the policy
positions the Conservative Party have taken in Parliament and
outside Parliament-at our policy conferences, for example, in
speeches by our leader and other spokesmen over the past four
or five years and, again, in the party's electoral program last
May. It is to be expected that, once in office, a political party
will reiterate those themes as government policy, conduct itself
according to that policy, and translate it into action.
Senator Lamontagne, when he was here the other night,
spoke about the credibility of this party, this government.
What is at stake is the credibility of the system. It is the

credibility of the system, I regret to say, that has been
somewhat damaged by the cynicism and the spectacular reversals of recent years.
When a political party makes its transition from its partisan
and electoral role to government, it assumes responsibility for
the administrative apparatus of government. Honourable senators who have had more experience in these matters than I will
know that the administrative side has a life and a momentum
all its own-it has its own means and its own ends.
I have never believed that, in general, the way for a new
government to make sure its mandate is implemented is to
throw the administrative side, the civil service, into a turmoil.
The answer is not to change the civil service, but to strengthen
the political parties so that the civil service can be given
political direction it can understand and follow.
Reference has been made by the Leader of the Opposition in
the Senate and others to my role in the Conservative Party.
And it is true that I am partisan. I respect the fact that not
everybody here is, but I think I recognize enough of them
around me to think that I will not be lonesome.
But the political direction that is given by a cabinet to the
public service has to be informed by some cohesive sense of
purpose that animates the ministers as a group. One of the
roles and the prerogatives of the party is to keep that sense of
purpose before the government-to keep the ministers' feet to
the fire, to make sure that the leadership remains faithful to
the mandate it sought from the Canadian people.
Governments have gone wrong in the past because politicians did not have the courage of their convictions; because
politicians were somehow embarrassed, once they attained
high office, by their political origins, their partisan origins
because politicians thought they had to become better technocrats than administrators, when they should have been consulting their own best instincts, the motives that brought them into
political life in the first place, and when they should have been
consulting the traditions of their parties and the philosophical
and historical context of their actions.
Political partisanship is the foundation not just of our
electoral system but of our parliamentary process and of our
democratic system. Much is made, and properly so, of the need
to strengthen the authority of Parliament vis-à-vis the government. But, having a Parliament capable of bringing the Crown
or the executive to account was only one step in the evolution
of our system. Parliament at that point was a system in which
individuals combined from time to time, according to their
vested interests, to confront the government-the case of the
perpetual outs confronting the perpetual ins. It was the development of political parties that were broadly based and
representative of the people and of the nation, rather than of
vested interests, that made it possible for what was a parliamentary system only to evolve into a democratic system.
Partisan involvement is not universal. There is a tendency in
some quarters to look with disdain or with suspicion on
partisans. Yet, those who do participate are the mainstay not

SENATE DEBATES
only of the electoral system but of the parliamentary system
and the democratic system.
I think there were about 250,000 Canadians who took part
as volunteer workers for the Conservative Party in the last
election campaign. I do not know the number, but perhaps a
somewhat smaller, but still significant, number worked for the
other parties. They deserve to be heard in this place and in this
Parliament. Political participation is open to everybody, and
yet the political parties are not now regarded as effective
instruments of public opinion or public service. Robert Stanfield noted elsewhere that special interest groups are in the
ascendancy, trying to bring pressure to bear on the political
institutions from the outside rather than from the inside,
where they would be subject to the mediating influences, the
need to compromise and to take account of other and sometimes conflicting interests that are characteristic of healthy
political parties.
Political parties are not now well or widely regarded as
vehicles of communication for the people and their government, or for the redress of individual grievances, or to bring
local opinion to bear on government decisions that affect the
local community.
How often have we heard it said, or perhaps said it ourselves, that we hesitate to intervene in a matter because it
might only damage the cause by appearing to politicize it, or
to upset the bureaucrats who are making the decisions.
* (1610)

Our system cannot operate without strong political parties,
and it cannot operate properly if those parties are treated by
the leadership of the parties as being merely electoral
machines. Parties themselves, I know, have a great deal to do
to make sure that they are responsive to the needs of the
people, and they certainly have to become more representative
of the whole country.
A decision was announced today-I do not have the text
before me-by the Leader of the Union Nationale Party of the
Province of Quebec that his party would desist from further
activity until after the referendum so that they might regroup
the forces of the centre and of the right in Quebec. This would
offer an opportunity for my party to do something that some of
us have long advocated in Quebec-that is, become installed
as a provincial party in that province. That is not only the
long-term solution for the Conservative Party, but it will make
an essential contribution to national unity and to Confederation.
Political parties have a lot of work to do to become more
representative of the entire country. The work that I and some
others on this side and on the other side are engaged in outside
of the chamber is dedicated to that end. I believe, and we
believe, that, far from being inconsistent with our legislative
role in this chamber, that work enhances it.
It now only remains for me to thank honourable senators for
the kindness and welcome they have shown me, and to say how
much I look forward to working in this chamber and in its
committees. I shall try to be worthy of its best traditions.
[Senator Murray.]

October 24, 1979

Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, first of ail I wish to
extend my congratulations and good wishes to His Honour the
Speaker. While I think we all recognize that there were times
when he and I did not agree on certain issues when he was
sitting opposite rather than in the Chair, I think I can say
without any reservation that every member of the Senate
respects the tremendous contribution he has made over the
years. I do not think there is another member of the Senate
who has had such a varied experience in Senate work, and who
is so dedicated to the work of the Senate.
I say to you, sir, that I hope you have a happy and gratifying
tenure of office.
I should like also to extend my congratulations to the new
officers of the Senate, although I know it bas been donc by
others who have spoken before me. What we have seen in the
past two weeks augurs well for the future.
While I welcome all the new members who have been
summoned here in recent days, I should like to extend a special
welcome to the new senator from Newfoundland, Senator
Doody. He and I have always, or at least for a good many
years, been on opposite sides of the political fence. I think I
can say without reservation that no one in public life in
Newfoundland is more respected than Senator Doody. I am
sure that he will, in time, make a significant contribution to
the work of this body.
I was impressed this afternoon, as I am sure all senators
were, by the quality of the two speeches we heard. The
speeches were totally different in a variety of ways, but they
were, nonetheless, first-class speeches. I congratulate both my
colleague from Saskatchewan and my new colleague from, I
guess, Ontario. It is not the first time that a senator from
outside Ontario has had to represent a constituency in Ontario.
Senator Forsey was from Newfoundland but represented
Nepean. I congratulate both of them on their speeches today.
At the same time, I should congratulate all previous participants in this debate.
I do say that it is a pity-and I have said this before-that
for some mysterious reason once a man in public life enters the
Senate, the news media, apparently at that point, decide that
he can no longer make any significant contribution to the
political life of Canada. For example, we have in the Senate
six former provincial premiers. I think the number is now six.
Senator Manning was premier of one of Canada's provinces
for, I believe, 26 years. He is and was a respected man who
made a tremendous contribution to the political life of
Canada. When he was premier, whether at home or at some
federal-provincial conference, the news media considered every
speech he made important enough and significant enough to
report. I have heard him make first class speeches in the
Senate, speeches which were of great import to Canada, but I
have not seen or heard one single reference to them. Why is
that? I should like someone to explain it to me. There must be
some explanation for that.
Why is a man of the calibre of Senator Manning-and I
could mention others-not considered to be significant enough

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

to be reported on? We take the time and trouble to prepare
speeches devoted to Canada's problems, devoted to the good of
Canada, yet the people of Canada do not see one iota of
reference to them. I suggest that some body or some bodies are
falling down on the job in this matter.
I was hoping that this year, with a sort of revived Senate,
there would be some change. There has been change insofar as
Question Period is concerned, but what about the speech
Senator Murray just made? He went into the philosophy of
politics. Will the people of Canada hear anything about that
tonight, or will they read about it? Unless he gets preferential
treatment, there will not be one single reference to it anywhere
by anyone. The same applies to the speech of Senator Steuart.
I was interested to read somewhere that the Leader of the
Government, Senator Flynn, said that there was a great deal
of unfinished business he hoped the Parliament of Canada
would be able to deal with during the present session and in
subsequent sessions. He singled out a revision of the Criminal
Code. I was interested to hear him say that. It happens to be
something about which I feel strongly. There are certain
matters in the Criminal Code about which the vast majority of
us are concerned.
For example, there are those sections of the Criminal Code
that refer to certain drugs, and about which all three leaders of
the national political parties are in agreement; about which the
Canadian Medical Association and, for that matter, the
American Medical Association and the Canadian Law Association are in agreement. The Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs brought in a report on that matter
recommending certain changes. That report was adopted by
the Senate nearly two years ago, but nothing has been done
about it since.

•

(1620)

I want to add my voice to that of Senator Flynn in urging
that these matters be dealt with expeditiously. How can we sit
back when we recognize that there are anomalies, discrepancies, injustices and irrationalities in the Criminal Code? We
recognize that they are there and agree that they should be
dealt with. Yet, nothing has been done. Month after month
goes by, year after year goes by, and nothing at all is done
about them.
Speaking of unfinished business, we are all glad to see that
some of the recently appointed senators are women. We are all
pleased to see more and more women entering public life, but
it is still an uphill battle for them. There is still a great deal of
discrimination against women in Canada. Some of it is unintentional; some of it is covert, hidden; some is as a result of
brainwashing that we and our forefathers have undergone
through the years, and through the centuries. Some of that
discrimination against women is a hangover from medieval
times.
I would hope that this Parliament, if not this year then
certainly in the near future, can do something more than has
been done. We may have to take legal action to force bodies
and corporations to recognize the legitimate rights of women

just as the governmental authorities in the United States,
especially at the federal level, had to spell out in legislation
what had to be done in respect of certain minority groups.
Everyone paid lip service to what had to be done, but year
after year went by and the discrimination against certain
groups in the United States continued.
I do not pretend for one moment that all of the injustices
have been remedied, but certainly everyone would agree that
there is a vast difference in the conditions among minorities in
the United States, in particular the black minority, as compared to that which existed prior to the Warren decision-the
decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in relation
to black minority rights.
We need to make specific action--more than we have
done-with regard to discrimination against women and
women's rights generally, and also with regard to the abuse of
women and the abuse of children. I have wearied this body on
previous occasions in trying to spell out my sense of indignation over the dissipation of our resources in inconsequential
ways when some of the great issues, such as the protection of
children, are virtually ignored.
Having spent years in the field of public welfare, I am fully
aware of what has been done, and I appreciate what bas been
done, but what bas been done is insignificant when compared
to what has to be done.
While I am on the subject of discrimination, there is one
thing that has been rankling in me as a Newfoundlander for
two or three years now, and perhaps now is a good time to get
it off my chest. Some time back the then Chairman of the
Board of the Royal Bank of Canada, Mr. Earle McLaughlin,
was put on the carpet by some women's group with regard to
the failure of that bank-and, I suppose, by extrapolation, the
failure of other banks at that time-to have women as members of its board of directors. I am not very cognizant of
banking practices. I do not know how large the board of
directors of a given bank might be, but I would think there
would be 20 or 25 members on any given board. At that
particular time, I do not believe-and I am subject to correction-that there was a woman on the board of directors of any
bank in Canada. Mr. McLaughlin was put on the carpet about
it, and he offered what I thought was a very flimsy and,
indeed, a totally unacceptable excuse or alibi, if you wish,
namely, the difficulty in finding women capable of serving on
these boards. The interview in question-and, again, I am
subject to correction on this-appeared in Weekend magazine,
and in that interview he offered a gratuitous insult to one of
the provinces of Canada. He said, "Where, for example, would
you find a woman in Newfoundland to serve on the Board of
Directors of the Royal Bank of Canada?"--or words to that
effect.
I was surprised at his ignorance. As the head of a bank, I
expected him to know a little more than that. I might say that
I have every respect for the Royal Bank of Canada. It is, I
believe, the largest bank in Canada. I do not, however, have
any respect for the opinions of Mr. McLaughlin, who was at

SENATE DEBATES
that time chairman of the board. Imagine anyone making such
a remark at that time!
Anyone who knew the situation could have pointed out to
him that the firm of John Penney & Son Limited, of Ramea,
Newfoundland, one of the great fish processing and fish
exporting organizations in al] of Canada, had been run for
years and years by the widow of a man who sat right here in
this chamber-in fact, almost where I am sitting-Senator
George Joseph Penney. Senator Penney, I believe, was the
senior senator representing Newfoundland following its union
with Canada. To everyone's regret, he died shortly after his
appointment, but his widow carried on the business he founded, and not only carried it on, but expanded it to a great
degree. She was a recognized authority on fisheries and,
incidentally, was elected President of the Fisheries Council of
Canada. Yet she was not competent, apparently, to serve on
the Board of Directors of the Royal Bank of Canada.
I can name others. It seems that Mr. McLaughlin had not
heard of a firm that was established in 1807, a firm with
worldwide connections and branches right across Canada, the
firm of Bowrings Limited. For years the chief administrative
officer of that firm has been a woman, and not a very old
woman at that, Mrs. Angela Cantwell. Bowrings, one of the
great multi-million dollar enterprises in this country, with
operations almost all over the world, is run by a woman, but
she is not competent to sit on the board of the Royal Bank of
Canada. I could also cite the example of Chester Dawe
Limited, one of the great wood processing and building supplies organizations in eastern Canada, which again is run by a
woman, Janet Gardiner, a daughter of the founder of the firm.
I cite those examples, perhaps at too tedious a length, as
examples of the type of discrimination that women have to
face in the province of Newfoundland. Does Mr. McLaughlin
not know that in Newfoundland there are scores, indeed
hundreds, of professional women-professors at universities,
chartered accountants, lawyers, eminent medical practitioners,
administrators, and so forth. And out of all those women not
one was competent to sit on the board of directors of a bank?
That is the sort of thing that the women of Canada have to put
up with. Of course, we in Newfoundland get a double dose of
it there.

Now, honourable senators, I do not want to unduly delay the
Senate on this next point, but I want to refer briefly to
Petro-Canada. Let me here qualify what I have to say by
saying that I have never been a baiter of big business. I am not
a socialist as such, and I appreciale that if we are going to
have a capitalistic system, then it is inevitable that we have big
business, that it has a role to play, and, by and large, it has
played a very significant role. But, at a time when the great oil
interests possess so much power, when they can exert so much
control in Canadian affairs, the last thing in the world we
should be doing in my view is abolishing Petro-Canada. I am
not sure whether it was Voltaire or Napoleon-I have seen it
attributed to both, and I daresay it has been attributed to
others-who, in a discussion on religion and atheism, said, "If
[Senator Rowe.j

October 24, 1979

God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." I say
that if Petro-Canada did not exist today, it would be necessary
to invent it. I regret that the government apparently has
decided to take certain steps which can at best emasculate that
company, and eventually lead to its abolition.
I want now to say a few words about the offshore mineral
resources, and at the outset 1 congratulate Senator Frith on
the excellent speech he gave yesterday. Obviously, he had
given some thought to the matter and had done considerable
research, and I enjoyed the concise and incisive way in which
he summarized the situation. Senator Frith, as we all know, is
one of the distinguished lawyers of Canada, and I was very
pleased that he, as have a number of other eminent jurists and
legal minds, recognized that Newfoundland is a special case in
this matter.
I am going now to reveal-I suppose that is the word I
should use-some discussions which so far as I know have
never been revealed or made public before. Two of the parties
to these discussions are dead, so I cannot have their approval
for my bringing of these matters to public attention. I was
myself a party to them in a humble way, in the background.
The other party was the then Premier of Newfoundland, the
Honourable J. R. Smallwood, and only this morning 1 talked
by telephone with him and discussed what I am about to say
now, and received his permission to do so. He thinks I would
be doing right to reveal these discussions.
Back in the 1960s at a meeting of the Atlantic premiers-it
could have been part of a full federal-provincial meeting, and
if so it was a subcommittee of the Atlantic premiers-the
matter of the offshore mineral resources came up. At the time
the great corporations were making applications to Newfoundland and, I presume, to other provinces as well, for rights to
make explorations off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. There was some doubt as to who owned those rights, and
they were in the situation where they had to get permission
from the Government of Canada as well as from the province,
in this case Newfoundland, to engage in such exploration.
They got permission from both parties.
At the time that the four Atlantic premiers were talking it
over informally, it was agreed that one of them, namely, Mr.
Smallwood, should approach the then Prime Minister, Mr.
Pearson, on the matter. I accompanied Mr. Smallwood up here
to Ottawa. We met Mr. Pearson-my recollection is that at
that time his office was in the East Block. At any rate we met
him and spent the best part of a morning discussing this
matter with him.
Mr. Smallwood argued that Newfoundland presented a
special case and he cited, as I remember, among other things,
the Terms of Union, clause 7 of which recognizes the Constitution of Newfoundland as it existed immediately prior to the
16th day of February, 1934-and I would ask you to note the
year is 1934, not 1949. The Constitution as it existed at that
date was revived at the date of union. This is very significant,
and Senator Frith alluded to it yesterday. I don't know if he is
aware of the clause, but he is cognizant of the fact that

October 24, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Newfoundland entered Confederation with certain constitutional rights already present.
Premier Smallwood, as I said, expressed his confidence to
Prime Minister Pearson that Newfoundland did have sole
rights to the resources in the offshore areas. Mr. Pearson did
not accept that holus bolus. He said-and here I am obviously
paraphrasing-"You may be right, but I am not sure." Mr.
Smallwood then said to him, "Well, look, we have two options
open to us and to you as Prime Minister of Canada representing the federal government; one is to go to the courts-and we
are prepared to go to the Supreme Court-and the other is for
Canada to cede the offshore rights to Newfoundland." So he
said we could go to the Supreme Court.
There was previous experience in that line, if you remember,
honourable senators, because for over 20 years there had been
a disagreement between Canada and Newfoundland, two selfgoverning Dominions of the British Commonwealth equal in
constitutional rights, over the boundary of Labrador. The
dispute was not between Quebec and Newfoundland, but
between Canada and Newfoundland. Eventually the Government of Quebec, something not always recognized, passed a
resolution which it sent to the Government of Canada asking
that the matter be referred to the Judicial Committee of the
Imperial Privy Council. Canada concurred in that recommendation from Quebec, and then submitted it to Newfoundland.
Newfoundland also concurred in the arrangement and the
matter was referred to the Judicial Committee of the Imperial
Privy Council.
Newfoundland's advocate at the time was the eminent British lawyer, Sir John Simon. The result of that reference was
that in 1927 the Privy Council handed down a decision in
favour of Newfoundland, delineating the specific boundary.
So Premier Smallwood said to Prime Minister Pearson that
Newfoundland was prepared to go to the Supreme Court of
Canada on the matter, but then he pointed out that there was
the other route to take. Without conceding the matter, he
suggested that assuming Canada owned the offshore mineral
rights that Newfoundland was claiming, why could Canada
not repeat what it did in the year 1912 in respect of territories
which it gave to the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario and
Quebec-territories which had been part of the Northwest
Territories?
The areas which were ceded to the three provinces were,
first, to Manitoba 178,000 square miles, to Ontario 146,000
square miles and to Quebec 354,000 square miles. I might
point out that Quebec did not have the benefit entirely of
354,000 square miles because Canada was asserting a claim to
a part of Labrador, but, subsequently, Canada was denied that
by the Privy Council decision. So a total of 679,000 square
miles was involved, and Canada gave them to three provinces.
What did it give? It gave land. Premier Smallwood said to
Mr. Pearson, "What is the difference between dry land and (to
use his term which I remember quite well) wet land? What is
the difference? I see none." Assuming that Canada did own
those offshore mineral rights, then with respect to the land

under the water off Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and British
Columbia, Mr. Smallwood urged Prime Minister Pearson to
repeat what had been done in 1912 and give it, or cede it, to
those provinces which, with the exception of British Columbia,
happened to be the have-not provinces of Canada. They happened to be the ones that needed it.
At that time there was a good deal of talk about regional
disparities and Mr. Smallwood suggested to Prime Minister
Pearson that if he, the Prime Minister, was anxious to relieve
those regional disparities in Canada, here was one way he
could do so. Premier Smallwood said, "Undoubtedly there is
oil and gas off the coasts of Labrador, Newfoundland, Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, and once it is developed it could
do a great deal towards eliminating the regional disparities
that exist there. I urge you to do that rather than go to court."
Prime Minister Pearson said, "It is an excellent idea, but I
am afraid"-and again I am paraphrasing-"that inasmuch
as this is a serious constitutional matter we should go first to
the Supreme Court. And," he said, "I as Prime Minister would
have no choice but to have it first go to the Supreme Court of
Canada. But this I can assure you . . . " There is no doubt
about my recollection of what Prime Minister Pearson said:
He said, "This I can assure you: if we should win the case, if
the Supreme Court decides that Ottawa, the federal government, owns the resources then we will be more than generous
to Newfoundland and to the other provinces concerned." He
did mention a ratio at the time, but there is no need to go into
that much detail. It was only a ratio suggested as a matter of
discussion anyway.
Our next step was in anticipation of going to the Supreme
Court of Canada. Premier Smallwood contacted the man who,
by all odds, was at the time the most respected Canadian alive,
Mr. Louis St. Laurent, and told him what it was about and
asked him if he would meet with us, and he said he would.
Mr. St. Laurent was, of course, no longer Prime Minister of
Canada. We met in the Chateau Laurier-Mr. Smallwood,
myself and one other from Newfoundland, and Mr. St. Laurent, who was by himself. We had a breakfast meeting in
Premier Smallwood's suite in the Chateau Laurier, during
which we told Mr. St. Laurent what we had in mind. He was
aware of the situation generally, of course, and we asked him
if he would present Newfoundland's case before the Supreme
Court of Canada. It is significant that Mr. St. Laurent did not
say, "No, I am sorry, I cannot." He said, "I shall have to think
that over." He did think it over and we met again, and he then
said, "There are two factors here. One is my age and my state
of health, which is somewhat indifferent at this time, and the
other is that I am not too sure of the ethics . . ."-I am
paraphrasing now, but this is essentially what he said- "...
of a former prime minister taking a case into the courts
against the Government of Canada. For these two reasons, I
am forced to decline your invitation." We asked him what he
thought of our case. I appreciate that this is hearsay, but his
reply was, "I think you have an excellent case"-and anyone

SENATE DEBATES
who knew Mr. St. Laurent will affirm that he was not a man
given to extravagant expressions.
* (1650)

Needless to say, 1, Senator Marshall and every other Newfoundlander, was very pleased when Prime Minister Clark
stated-I think the statement was first made by Premier
Peckford-that the Government of Canada would recognize
Newfoundland's claim.
I do not know how much of the background associated with
this matter was known to Mr. Clark, but I imagine that the
Government of Newfoundland, under both Premier Moores
and Premier Peckford-who had dedicated themselves, as we
ourselves had donc, to preparing a case for eventual submis-

October 24, 1979

sion to the Supreme Court of Canada-would have consulted
with Premier Smallwood to obtain some of the background
information which I have given honourable senators today.
It may well be that Prime Minister Clark was made aware
of some of that background information. I don't know, but
certainly it would appear that he has recognized that Newfoundland does have a special case, and we believe that the
Prime Minister has done what any Government of Canada
should have done in this matter. I would not attempt to express
an opinion on relations between the federal government and
the other provinces in this matter.

SENATE DEBATES

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
THE ECONOMY
INCREASE IN BANK RATE

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce with
respect to the disturbing news that once again the bank rate
has spiralled up another one per cent to 14 per cent.
I think, honourable senators, I speak on behalf of millions of
bewildered Canadians who recali the oratory in the last Parliament by the party now forming the Government of Canada, in
which they deplored the increase in interest rates.
Senator Walker: Question!
Senator Perrault: The Conservatives stated that if they were
given the power, honourable senators, they would stop this
process. They said it was disastrous and they said it would lead
to high unemployment and would affect housing.
Senator Asselin: Question!
Senator Perrault: Now, in some sort of conversion that is
baffling, they promote an increase in bank rates as almost a
therapeutic process. Indeed, high interest rates are being promoted by the new Conservative government as a method by
which the health of the Canadian economy can be restored.
Senator Asselin: Question!
Senator Perrault: This is the question I wish to ask the
honourable minister: Has the government truly measured the
effect of this disastrous upward spiral on the housing industry,
which, as the honourable senator may be aware, is one of the
most important methods by which employment can be
maintained?
Has it truly measured the effect on the consumers of this
country? Has it truly measured the effect on the unemployment situation in this country? I suppose, more fundamentally,
the question is: What agonizing reappraisal took place between
the time the Conservative Party served in opposition and the
time it took control of the government benches? What change
in philosophye (1410)
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, on a point of orderSenator Perrault: 1 know it is a sensitive matter with the
honourable senator, but it is a considerably more sensitive
matter with the people of this country.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I think His Honour
the Speaker has ruled before that questions should bc kept
short. The Leader of the Opposition should not make a speech
when asking a question. Senators should try to observe the
rules of this house. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to
make a speech, he should ask permission and receive the
consent of this house. But during the Question Period the
Leader of the Opposition should be fair and confine himself to
asking a question. He should not make a speech.
[The Hon the Speaker.]

October 25, 1979

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I appeal to the
fair-minded nature of ail honourable senators when I say that
this matter is of such critical importance that a lengthy
question on this subject should be permitted. Furthermore, I
suggest that during the honourable senator's entire parliamentary career he has not won a reputation for the brevity of his
questions, and no member of the previous government ever
attempted to muzzie him.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: I will conclude by saying that there have
been only two main economic characteristics of the time since
this Conservative government assumed power, and those are
spiralling multinational oit company profits and spiralling
interest rates which are crushing the Canadian people.
Senator de Cotret: There was only one characteristic of the
previous government's economic policy and that is called
failure.
Some Hon. Senators: Shame!
Senator de Cotret: After taking over power on June 4 we
found the state of the Canadian economy to be-well, less
than what even in our worst thoughts we expected it to be.
Senator Perrault: You were going to stop interest rates from
spiralling.
Senator de Cotret: I will tell you what we are stopping: we
are putting ail our efforts toward stopping inflation.
Senator Perrault: Now in double digits!
Senator de Cotret: That word, which was supposed to be
dead, according to certain speeches that we heard time and
time again during the past few yearsSenator Steuart: It is up againSenator de Cotret: The decision of the Governor of the Bank
of Canada, which was announced yesterday, to increase the
bank rate in this country by one per cent was made in
recognition of the fact that the interest rate spread between
Canadian and U.S. rates was now at a point where it could not
be sustained for any extended period of time without exerting
continued undue pressure on the Canadian dollar and thereby
fuelling further inflationary pressures on the system. To quote
briefly from his release-a statement in which I fully concurthe Governor of the Bank of Canada said that there was no
responsible alternative to the latest increase in the bank rate.
Senator Perrault: That is not a satisfactory explanation. Let
me suggest to the honourable the minister that one of his
colleagues, the Honourable Sinclair Stevens, said on November 6, 1978, when deploring the fact that the interest rate had
"soared" to 10.75 per cent:
-1 am disappointed that the minister still is not able to
give a definitive date.
He was referring to the budget:
In the meantime, would the minister indicate to us why he
felt it was warranted to raise our bank rate to the
historically high 10.75 per cent, such as was done yester-

October 25, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

day, bearing in mind that the only excuse is the present
rate in the United StatesHe continued to say that it was "not an economic program."
Why the change in Conservative thinking and policy represented by Mr. Sinclair Stevens when he served in opposition and
the present time when he is entrusted with ministerial
responsibility?
The honourable the minister is aware of cabinet solidarity.
What about the promises that were made during the election
campaign, when the Canadian people voted for a Conservative
Party committed to reducing or holding the line on interest
rates?
Senator de Cotret: I should like to ask, rhetorically: What
kind of government deficit were we looking at then? What
kind of inflation rate? What kind of current account position?
What kind of unemployment position? What kind of inflation
performance? It was certainly worse on June 4 when we took
office, 1can assure you.
Senator Perrault: May I answer your question?
Senator de Cotret: My question?
Senator Perrault: You asked a question.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, in a rhetorical way.
As I was saying, these things have changed. This is a
responsible action. To maintain a lower interest rate at the
moment than the rates prevailing in the United States would
plunge the Canadian dollar to significantly lower levels at a
time when we would not reap any of the benefits because our
export industries, as I am sure honourable senators opposite
know, are operating at capacity and cannot export more. As a
matter of fact, according to the investment surveys, they are
actively engaged in attempting to expand their plant, but at
the moment they are operating at capacity.
As I say, we would feel all the negative impact of such a
devaluation, which, as you know, would lead directly to a
significantly higher level of price increases in this country. I do
not think I stand for inflation, either in the short term or,
certainly, in the long term, and I do not think Canadians stand
for inflation. If we cannot come to grips with the inflation
problem now, let me suggest to honourable senators that the
problems we will face down the road will be much more
serious, and the medicine to solve them much more difficult to
swallow, than the situation that we now have.
Senator Perrault: Why was this wisdom-or what is alleged
to be wisdom-not apparent to the Conservative Party when it
stood in opposition? Why was that wisdom not available to the
Conservative Party during the course of the election campaign? Furthermore, let me suggest to the honourable minister, who says that in effect "we did not realize how bad the
situation was," that during the campaign you portrayed an
economic situation far darker and graver than it actually
turned out to be when you assumed power. Those are the facts.
But during the campaign, the economy, fiscal and monetary,
portrayed to Canadians by Conservatives from coast to coast

was nothing but gloom, doom and disaster. Never have there
been more Jeremiahs in this country.
Yet among the first statements Mr. Stevens and Mr. Crosbie made when they assumed their ministerial responsibilities
was: "The situation wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it
was." So that kind of argument does not hold water at all.
Senator de Cotret: I would like to correct a few misunderstandings on the part of the Honourable Leader of the Opposition in this chamber.
First of all I would like to bring to his attention the very
numerous speeches that my leader, the present Prime Minister,
and I myself made throughout the election campaign about the
tremendous potential that faces the country-that was certainly not doom and gloom-and the great opportunities that lie
before us in many fields based on human and fiscal resources
that were and remain second to none in the industrialized
countries of the world.
When we talked about some of the things, as an opposition,
that we felt should have been donc, we addressed the cause of
the problems. We talked about,government deficit spending
and bringing it under control. We talked about the current
account deficit and about the Canadian dollar. We made
recommendations that were never acted on on any of these
topics. What we are seeing now are the symptoms that are t.he
inevitable result of the policies pursued by the prior administration. We never talked at that point about the superficialities
of the situation; we talked about the root causes. And what
was donc? Nothing.
Let me dispel the last misunderstanding that the honourable
senator seems to be labouring under, namely, that the situation
when we took office was better than we expected. I was there.
I was there when officials from Treasury Board made a rather
painful presentation to the new cabinet as to exactly what kind
of fiscal situation we faced, and I would like to assure honourable senators in this room that I for one-and I believe my
colleagues, and of course they can speak for themselves-did
not expect to be facing such a difficult situation, where
spending had gotten out of hand to such a high degree.
* (1420)

Senator Perrault: Let me put this solidly on the record, Mr.
Minister. I quote from a very important speech made in this
country on March 2, 1979:
There is no better example than the government's action
through the Bank of Canada in pushing interest rates in
this country to an ali-time high. High interest rates block
growthThis is your leader speaking, the Right Honourable Joseph
Clark. He said:
High interest rates block growth and there is no proof
that they stabilize the dollar. Our dollar will strengthen
only when the world financial community regains a sense
of confidence in Canada which historically has been
among our greatest national assets.
He went on to say:

SENATE DEBATES
Record high interest rates work against confidence
because they work against growth.
The Prime Minister of this country stated that on March 2,
1979. He further stated:
As I need hardly remind this audience, they put in
question major construction projects by adding significantly to their capital costs. They hit particularly hard at
small businessmen, who don't have the market power to
pass along high money costs. And they virtually guarantee
more inflation by bidding up the price of money itself.
To riotous applause, this is how he concluded his speech:
Interest rates must come down if we are to get the
Canadian economy growing at its full potential. It would
be the policy of the Progressive Conservative government
to gradually bring those interest rates down.
Senator Asselin: What about a question?
Senator Perrault: I say that this government was elected
under false pretences.
Senator Asselin: What about the promises you made during
your campaign?
Senator de Cotret: In answer to your question: No, we were
not elected under false pretences.
Senator Asselin: What about promises you made?
RULES OF THE SENATE
POINT OF ORDER

Senator Walker: I rise on a point of order. Rule 20(4)
states:
A debate is out of order on an oral question, but brief
explanatory remarks may be made by the senator who
asks the question and by the senator who answers it.
Further, rule 20B states:
A preamble to a question, whether it is asked orally or in
writing, is out of order.
This is just like an auction sale we are listening to.
Senator Perrault: The auction sale was by your party in the
campaign.
Senator Walker: If we go on like this, we will have chaos in
this house. I am surprised that the former Leader of the
Government should have descended as low as he has. He is
acting like a poltroon at the moment.
The Hon. the Speaker: Senator Walker has risen on a point
of order and has asked for a ruling from the chair. I shall be
happy to hear comments on the point of order.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, certainly there are the
words contained in rule 20, but the traditions and the practices
of this house also constitute part of the rules. I think that even
Senator Walker would have to agree that from this side of the
house, in opposition, we have not transgressed that particular
standing order nearly as badly as, traditionally, senators opposite did when they were over here.
[Senator Perrault.]

October 25, 1979

Senator Asselin: Never.
Senator Oison: We did not complain about that.
Senator Asselin: Bring your evidence before the house.
Senator Oison: Speaking to the point of order, the Leader of
the Opposition has raised a question that is of urgent concern
to hundreds of thousands of Canadians. He has pointed out
that there has been a complete somersault in terms of what the
government is doing now and what it indicated it would do. It
seems to me that under those urgent circumstances there
ought to be a little latitude.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I shall try and
address myself directly to the point of order and avoid any
excursions as to the merits of the argument presented by the
Leader of the Opposition because that would lead me too far
afield. I feel that there is plenty of argument that can be made
to deal with the points he has raised.
One of the things that agreeably impressed me when I
entered this house not too long ago was the fact that, to all
intents and purposes, we must have the most abbreviated rule
book of any deliberative assembly of which I know. If you
examine the rules of this house, you will find that they are
famous for their omissions rather than for their contents. I
wondered for a while how on earth a deliberative assembly
could get along with a rule book like this, because on turning
to Beauchesne and the rules of the other place, which are
copied by most legislative assemblies in this country, we find
that the situation is quite different. When dealing with the
Question Period in the other place it will be found that there
are at least 100 rules, perhaps more than 100 rules, that apply
to the asking of questions. That has arisen because, in the
highly confrontational atmosphere of that chamber, it has
been found necessary, in order to produce any kind of coherent
conduct of the public business, that the Question Period should
not be allowed to run riot.
It is a relatively new procedure in parliamentary terms,
when one considers the long history of this association, but I
think it has been a very important, necessary and useful
innovation in the last 100 years or so, as we have seen the
Question Period develop.
In our system we do not call for written questions in the way
they do in the Mother of Parliaments in Westminster, but we
allow oral questions of the kind that we have had today. I
think we all agree that that is a good thing, because it does
permit members of the chamber to cross-examine members of
the cabinet on affairs of the day, and particularly to deal with
urgent matters that we have now. However, if we expect that
process to be fruitful, and if we expect it to be continued
within the traditions we have established here, I think we have
to exercise a certain measure of self-discipline.
It seems to me that the genius of our system in the Senate,
and the reason why we can proceed with a rule book of this
abbreviated and quite inadequate nature, is that we rely on the
self-discipline of the members of this house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

October 25, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Roblin: I think, by and large, in my experience,
with rare exceptions we have seen that self-discipline is enough
for the rules of this house to regulate our conduct, and that we
have been able to conduct our affairs in an orderly way simply
by a little restraint.
I am afraid that if we find that, due to the particular
constitution of our chamber today, we are importing the
methods and manners of the House of Commons into the
chamber itself we will also be forced to adopt their rules,
because it seems to me that unless we can adhere to the spirit
of this assembly in the way in which we do bring self-discipline
to bear, then the pressure will be on for the adoption of a more
coherent, more restrictive and more regulated set of rules such
as they have in the other place, with these 100 or more
different points on which questions are based and to which
questions have to relate.
We know, for example, that in the other place they are not
allowed to make the kind of lengthy introductory remarks that
are made in the Senate chamber. We know that in the other
place they are not allowed a continual succession of repeated
questions on the same point. We know that in the other place
one member is not allowed to ask a member on the other side a
series of questions amounting to a cross-examination, perhaps
extending over five or six questions. We know that there the
scope of the questions that may be posed is extremely limited.
1, personally, prefer our own system here. We operate in a
more subdued atmosphere. I do not expect anyone to put his
conscience in his pocket. I am not interested in cronyism in
conducting our affairs in this house. I appreciate a degree of
confrontational matter, because this is a political chamber and
it should be here. However, I think, if we recollect our better
days in the Question Period, we will see that we could get the
answers and conduct our business in an orderly fashion, which
will avoid the kind of disputes that we are having today.
I have to say that I do not feel comfortable in trying to lay
down a lesson in self-control to the members of this legislature,
because I appreciate that I am in no position to offer a lesson
in that respect. There are many members here who know far
more about it than I do, and I know that I have taken a
considerable liberty in addressing the problem in this way.
However, I do appeal to those in the house who are interested
in the question of order that is under discussion to respect, not
only the written rule in this book, but the tradition, the
procedure, the atmosphere and the ambience in which these
discussions are conducted so that we may have a Question
Period that is fruitful, that allows the opposition to get the
information they want, and at the same time conforms to our
proceedings.
*

(1430)

So, Mr. Speaker, my hope is that you will be able to counsel
honourable senators not so much to look to the letter of the
law in our rule book, because there is precious little of it, but
to look to the tradition of the Senate and to exercise a
modicum of self-discipline so that we may proceed with our
business in an orderly fashion.

Senator Olson: Mr. Speaker, I think that we can all take
some heart from the attitude of the house leader as to what
our discipline ought to be in this chamber, but I would remind
him that the reason we are now discussing a point of order is
because of the sensitivity of the members on that side of the
house. And I would also remind himAn Hon. Senator: Which ones?
Senator Olson: -that if a little bit of latitude is not going to
be given on a matter of urgent public importance, such as the
spiralling interest rates, as has been demonstrated by the
increase in the last 24 hours, then we reach a position in which
we must resort to rule 46(g), which allows a motion to be
made without notice to set aside all the business on the order
paper in order to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.
We did not do that today, even though we claim it is an urgent
matter. We thought we could air it in the Question Period.
All I can say is that we agree with what the house leader on
the opposite side has said, but when matters such as this come
up, if we are not going to be given a little latitude without
some of the sensitivity showing, then we will be forced to use
this rule and move that all business be set aside while we
discuss the matter. From the rule book and from what I know
to have been the practice in this chamber since I have been
here, I do not know of any way of getting that kind of debate
stopped except by letting it exhaust itself, so it could take the
entire day. That is the difficult choice you are giving us.
If you want to be that sensitive, fine. But then we have to
use the other provisions in the Rules of the Senate of Canada
in order to do what we think is our public duty, so we may
have a discussion on this urgent public matter. The choice is
up to the government.
Senator Roblin: I may not be entitled to speak again. If so, I
would like to have the indulgence of the house to reply to the
point. It might be admitted that any member of the house is
entitled to raise a point of order. I really cannot ask that that
right be abridged on any account, but I do think the honourable deputy leader opposite and myself are on the same
ground, because we feel that we want to use the Question
Period in the most constructive possible manner, and I think
that if we address ourselves to the problem in that way we will
not have difficulty.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, on the point of order, I
would just like to say that I agree substantially with everything
the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate has said
and with what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said.
But, I hope His Honour, in making any ruling he feels called
upon to make on this point of order, will remember the call
which has been made to the tradition of this chamber, as
compared with the traditions of the other place, and will not
ignore the fact that the tradition to be looked to must be the
tradition of this chamber when there were three cabinet ministers as members.
There is nothing wrong with that happening, but, with
respect, it is not perfectly apt to refer to the traditions that
prevailed when Senator Roblin came here and when I came

SENATE DEBATES

As you know, there are rather longtime spans between the
economic measures a government may take and the reaction of
the economic system to them. Surely very little can be done in
a four to five month period, as is the case now. Also, as the
weeks go by and our economic measures take effect we will, on
the one hand, be very happy to take the credit for the success.
On the other hand, we will be quite happy to accept constructive criticisms if, by a chance I have great difficulty to
imagine, those measures turn out to have been ill-intentioned.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
GOVERNMENT POLICY IN ADVANCE OF ENACTMENT OF
LEGISLATION

Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, my question today
was for the Leader of the Government in the Senate, particularly in his capacity as Minister of Justice. In his absence, I
trust the deputy leader will not mind his being my second
choice.
My question relates to the subject of freedom of information. We have been hearing about tradition in this house this
afternoon, and I should like to point out a tradition of the
Liberal Party, that being that when we do find something done
by the government of which we can approve, we are prepared
to say so. In this connection, I want to congratulate the
government on the freedom of information legislation introduced in the other place yesterday.
I have a personal interest in this bill which I should disclose.
I was a member of the Joint Committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons on Regulations and other Statutory
Instruments which studied this subject, and the government
bill is based upon and, in fact, adopts the report of that joint
committee. That is a further demonstration of the value of
investigative work donc by joint committees. I was also a
member of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons on Immigration, and again in that case the
government adopted 95 per cent of the committee's
recommendations.
To get to my question, even with all of the good will of all of
the parties, it is going to take six months before this freedom
of information legislation is adopted and in effect. I attended
the hearing this morning of the Finance Committee of the
other place at which Governor Bouey was giving evidence. Mr.
Bouey was asked whether or not the Bank of Canada had an
econometric model and, if so, whether they used that model to
make a projection as to the effect which could be expected
from an increase in the prime interest rate on inflation,
unemployment, economic growth, and so forth. Mr. Bouey
replied that they had such a model and had used it in this
connection, but he refused to give the results to the committee.

I want to point out that under clause 18 of the Freedom of
Information Bill introduced yesterday, he would be forced to
give that information. My question i§: What steps is the
government going to take between now and the enactment of
the Freedom of Information Bill to make sure that government
officials-and this bill applies equally to the Bank of Canada-will obey the spirit and general principles of the proposed
legislation and answer questions such as were asked of Governor Bouey this morning.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I am sure the Minister of Justice will regret not having been here to hear the first
part of my honourable friend's observations. I much regret
that he was not here to hear the last part of my honourable
friend's observations, because it puts me in the position of
having to attempt a reply on this matter.
I think we can only hope for encouragement that the
government may give for the disclosure of information which is
currently withheld. I would point out that, as I understand the
legislation, once passed, it does have a retroactive character,
taking it back, I believe, five years. So, if my honourable
friend's curiosity still remains unsatisfied at that date, he could
then certainly find out what Governor Bouey would not tell
him today.
Senator Oison: We want to know today. Today is already
after the fact.
Senator Roblin: Well, I have no influence over the Governor
of the Bank of Canada. All I can do is to convey the suggestion
of my honourable friend to the Minister of Finance, which I
shall be pleased to do.
Senator Oison: Ask the minister today and get a reply
today.
Senator de Cotret: I am sure that the statement that was
prepared for Governor Bouey which he delivered at the beginning of the hearing was tabled at that meeting. That statement-and i was just flipping through it to find the exact
page-answers the question the honourable senator has asked.
An Hon. Senator: No.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, it does. If you will give me a
moment, I will find the reference. It says very clearly that as a
result of the analysis the Governor feels very strongly that the
increase in prices that might result from an increase in interest
rates is much less than the increase in prices which would
result had there not been an increase in interest rates as a
result of further devaluation. He makes that point very clearly
in that statement. It is public information, and the Governor
has answered that question.
Senator Oison: We want to know what the econometric
model shows.
Senator Godfrey: I guess we must be reading a different
paper. I was there when Governor Bouey was asked by Mr.
Gray this morning questions about specific projections, which
he refused to answer. He said he could not answer them; that
we would have to wait. But I do not want to wait until the bill
comes into effect six months from now to hear what the

SENATE DEBATES
econometric model projected. For that reason, I shall put a
supplementary question to the minister responsible for economic development.
As I understand it, the minister has the Economic Council
under his jurisdiction, and I gather they have the same kind of
econometric model. In fact, I am told it is called CANDID
Model 2.0. My question is: Would the minister ask the Economic Council to put this information into their econometric
model-which I understand they can do and get the answer in
something like five seconds. Would the minister ask the Economic Council to do this for us so that we can get an answer to
the question which Governor Bouey refuses to answer?
Senator Perrault: Be candid about it.
Senator de Cotret: I shall be. First of ail, we have not
introduced any bill to amend the act setting up the Economic
Council. If my memory serves me correctly, the Economic
Council of Canada reports directly to the Prime Minister, and
not to any other minister. Secondly, the mandate of the
Economic Council is very clear in terms of its focus on
medium- and long-term policy. What you are asking me to ask
this agency to do-an agency which does not report to me-is
to undertake a task that is outside its mandate as established
in the legislation. I find it very difficult to do that.
Further, the CANDID model is not a short-term model, and
the answer you are looking for is the short-term economic
impact. So, I can only say that the tools are not there in the
Economic Council, nor is the reporting responsibility there
through which I could give any follow-up to your question. I
apologize.
THE ECONOMY
EFFECT OF INCREASE IN BANK RATE

Senator Haidasz: I should like to ask the Minister of State
for Economic Development what he estimates the harm will be
to the Canadian economy in terms of increased unemployment, high mortgage interest rates, inflation, and the gross
national product, as a result of the rise in the Bank of Canada
prime rate of interest to 14 per cent.

e

(1450)

Senator de Cotret: I would be very happy to answer that
question and I will do so very candidly. 1 strongly believe that
if we had not moved-that is, if the Governor of the Bank of
Canada had not moved, as he did, to increase the bank rate
from 13 per cent to 14 per cent, then the impact in the
medium and long term for this economy would have been
much worse than what will result from this admittedly tough
action to deal with a difficult problem now. I feel this is going
to lay the ground for us to move ahead in a non-inflationary
climate down the road. We just cannot tolerate the kind of
inflationary situation we are now living with, and the inflationary situation that would have resulted from not moving on
interest rates at this time.
Senator Haidasz: Then, the Minister of State agrees with
Governor Bouey.
[Senator Godfrey.]

October 25, 1979

My supplementary question now is: Would the minister
agree that efforts to attract foreign capital into Canada have
been unsuccessful to date as the net outflow of the direct
capital investment out of Canada was more than $2 billion just
in 1978?
Senator de Cotret: First of all, I would like to reaffirm to
honourable senators that, yes, I do agree with the action taken
by Governor Bouey, and so does my government.
In terms of your question, I would not relate the difficulty of
attracting funds to capital outflow the way you did, for a
technical reason, but I think your question is a very reasonable
one and well put. On balance, yes, we have been unable to
attract enough capital, and that is by definition. Because if we
had been able to attract a sufficient amount of long-term
capital inflows into this country on a net basis, then we would
not have experienced any downward pressure on the Canadian
dollar. So, obviously, there are pressures at work, and I think
that many of us know some of the reasons. There are pressures
at work that have made it such that we have had difficulty in
attracting on the capital account, and in the long term, an
amount of capital sufficient to offset our current account
deficit, and that has exerted downward pressure on the
Canadian dollar.
Senator Haidasz: Is the government then not going to
announce soon, if it has not already set it in motion, some
other way of attracting foreign capital instead of raising
interest rates every time the banks in the United States do?
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge there are
only a few means of attracting foreign capital to a country, be
it Canada or any other country. First of all, money is a
commodity that flows quite freely across borders, be they
provincial, national or what-have-you. Money flows do react to
interest rate spreads, and certainly that is an element that was
one of the underlying considerations for the reaction
announced last night by the Gove;rnor of the Bank of Canada.
A second means of attracting capital to an economy is by
building up confidence in foreign sectors in the future of that
economy, and that is certainly, I think, the purpose of most of
the measures that the present government is putting in place at
the moment, to ensure that this country will be in a position to
realize its tremendous potential in the eighties.
The third area, of course, is, in addition to the climate of
confidence, the removal of uncertainties and, as you know, we
have had some uncertainties as to the future political and
economic direction of this country. It is certainly an area
which attracts the attention of this government, and in which
we hope we will be able to make some positive changes over
the months to come.
But, critically, money will flow to where the rates of return
are the highest, and to the extent that we have not been able to
offer that in international markets, we have had difficulty in
attracting foreign funds.
Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, may I put a supplementary question. It relates to a remark that the minister made
earlier today when he attributed the increase in the interest

October 25, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

rate to the economic conditions which his government inherited on June 4. Is it not more accurate to say, in order to be in
harmony with his colleagues in the other place, that the
interest rate was increased because the American interest rate
was increased?
Senator de Cotret: I certainly did not mean to give the
inference, if I did give the inference, that the increase in the
interest rate at this time was due only to the economic
situation we inherited. But I will underline the fact that the
economic situation we inherited certainly limited the degree of
freedom with which we had to operate. When we are facing
the kind of inflation rate, close to 10 per cent, we are facing at
the moment, and when facing the current account deficitwhich is likely to be $7 billion this year-that we are now
facing, our potential to look at various alternatives in terms of
matching our domestic interest rate structure with that of our
major trading partner and that of international money markets
is much less than it would be if we were in the envious position
of having a current account surplus, for example, or if we were
in the position of having a rate of inflation of 4 per cent.
Senator Oison: Did you not know there was a deficit last
year?
Senator Bosa: A further supplementary: Has the minister
discussed with his colleagues the matter of providing some
assistance to the building industry, some members of which
have large inventories? The increase in the interest rate has
brought some of them to the brink of bankruptcy. Can the
minister advise the house what measures his government is
proposing to take to alleviate that situation?
Senator de Cotret: Yes, I have discussed this with my
colleagues, and not only with respect to measures that might
be taken in the area of the housing industry, but also in terms
of measures to be taken in the area of small business, and I
have instructed the Minister of State for Small Business to
review the situation and to make recommendations to me in
the very near future, and also in terms of the impact of high
interest rates on the agricultural community in this country.
So to that question the answer is, yes, we are looking at that
very closely. As to the second part of your question relating to
the measures we are going to propose, obviously those measures will flow from the discussions that are already under way
and will be announced in due course.
Senator Bosa: If the minister will permit me, the industry is
suffering now because of the high interest rate, and from the
answer he has given me it seems as if he is saying, "Live on,
my horse, the grass will grow in the spring." The industry
needs some assistance right away.
Senator de Cotret: I am not suggesting here that we are
undertaking six-, seven- or eight-month studies. I would like to
emphasize again that we are facing a very tough situation and
this is a very tough measure, and there is no intention to try to
move in such a way as to obliterate the definite intent on the
part of our monetary authorities to tighten up the system and
to bring inflation under control.

*

(1500)

I would only like to re-emphasize that the potential negative
impacts downstream of the kind of inflationary pressures that
are building now, and would be building, indeed, at an even
more rapid rate if we had not increased the bank rate, would
have been far worse in terms of impacts on the very industries
you mentioned than the measure we introduced last night.
Senator Oison: Was that not true a year ago, too?
Senator Lawson: I should like to put a supplementary
question to the minister. The question I have in mind, I think,
has been in the minds of most laymen. Prior to the announcement of the recent interest rate increase-in fact, prior to the
last three or four such announcements-the banks were
recording record profits. They were recording profits of 50 per
cent; 100 per cent-record returns. Now, suddenly, they are
forced to increase their interest rate again, which will make
even more money for them.
My question, which is in the minds of most laymen today, is
simply this: If the bank vaults are full, as they are, and if the
offices are full of money, and if money is pouring in every day,
even accepting the answer you have given as to the necessity of
taking this step, would it upset any grand scheme of the
government if, at the end of the year, the banks were to write
letters to their customers, saying, "We find that we really did
not need this last increase. We have made hundreds of millions
of dollars in record profits. We do not need them. Dear client,
or mortgage borrower, or whomever we loaned the money to,
we are sending 2 per cent or 3 per cent or 4 per cent back."?
Would it upset the economic scheme of the government if the
bank were to do that?
Senator de Cotret: In answer to that question, senator, I can
only repeat what I said two weeks ago. The Minister of
Finance is monitoring the situation.
Senator Perrault: Another study!
Senator de Cotret: And he is watching profits very closely.
Certainly, if we find that there is some undue development in
that field, I am sure he will introduce measures to deal with it.
But I think one must realize that in this whole equation it is
not the bank that is the lender; it is not the trust company that
is the lender; it is the saver who is the lender. These are merely
intermediaries.
When we look at the high rates of interest that have to be
paid by borrowers, we must also recognize the problems that
are facing the savers in our society, who see the value of the
money they lend, either through the banks or trust companies
or directly to borrowers, eroded by that very high rate of
inflation.
If you look at countries that have let the process get out of
hand-many of the South American countries, for example, in
the last decade-you will see what has happened. When they
let the inflationary situation get out of hand in the last decade
they destroyed the savings-investment equation completely,
and the downstream effects were disastrous. It is certainly not
something that any member of this chamber, I am sure, would
like to see happen in this country.

Our rates betore 'ycsterday, our short-tcrin rates, were
already bclow those that were prevalent in the United Suates.
We wcrc wîînessing somne very strong downward pressure on
the Canadian dollar.
If we were t0 lowcr rates in this country rîght now. the
capital outflow would increase. the capital inflow would
decrease, the pressure on the Canadian dollar would obviously
become greater and the dollar would go down. But, as you
have suggesîed, that mighî not bc ail] that bad.
But wxhat would happen is this: We would becomne. obviousy. more competitive in world markets, but, as i mcntioned
carlier, the utiliî'ation of the productive capaciîy of our exporI
industries is very high at the moment, and w'. do not have the
potential of increasing our exporîs abroad. Thus, we would not
gain fromi the devaluation in ternis of our competitive position.
We sinmply could not mnccl the additional demand generated by
the devaluation.
But the devaluation would have some quite significant
inmpacts in ternis of the domnestie price level. because \ve imiport

of inflation. Il is as simple as that. That would be a consequence we would have 10 face.
So, inflation would go up. Employnîenî, on the other hand,
would not go up because we do not have the physical plant in
this country righî nuxs lu incecase export sales. So we would
wind up wiîh the same unemployment but higher inflation.
That, i suggesî, would nlot be a situation we wouid particularly like t0 envisage.
Furîhermore, we would wind up with a deterioration in our
current account. That is a litîle bit like the situation the
United Kingdoin found itself in in the early seventies. We
would not improve our current account position, because our
exporîs would flot increase owing to the fact that we were
supply bound. and yeî on our service account, you know, a 10
per cent devaluation would, for example, when you look al our
inîeresî and dividend paymenîs, which are practically ail
denominated in foreign currency, lead t0 a l0 per cent increase
n the deficit on that account.
So with a reduction in interest rates, you would wind up
wiîh higher inflation. the sanie unemploymenî and a worse
current account position on the balance of paymenîs. and i
suggesî that that is inconsistent with the overail goals of the
economy.
Senator Oison: You have nmade ai least one wrong
assuiiplion.
Senator de Cotret: And there is no polities in that.
Senator Oison: You have made sorne wrong assumrptions.

Anyway. he mîade that speechî to theni, exmctly as 1 have
quoîed from il, in criîicizing the then Minister of Finance, Mr.
Chrétien, and the Governor of the Bank of Canada f'or raising
interest rates.
Will Senator de Coîret be honest and admit that either he
was îalking economie gobbledygook then, or was playing politics before an clection. or that xxhat he is saying now' he is
saving only because he is now in the goverrnîenî and has taken
on a more responsible position'? Jn facî, the only difference is
that the Conservatives are in and the Liberals are out, and he
is now parroîing everyîhing the Liberals said and whaî he
criîicized consisîenîly one year ago.
If anything is different. il is that the situation was worsc a

AGRICULTURE
CHICKEN IMPORT QUOTAS

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to ask a
question on a different subjeet. It may not be quite as interesting, but it involves an important area. Yesterday 1 asked the
Minister of State for Economie Development a question about
the negotiations that may have taken place in establishing
what chieken producers feel to be an exceedingly high quota
coming into Canada. The minister said that he would refer the
matter to the Minister of Agriculture. 1 do not complain about
that.
Since the Export and Import. Permits Act cornes under his
department and jurisdiction, 1 ask the minister to explain to
the house and to chieken producers why 75 per cent of import
quotas arc being given to two firms, namiely, Maple Lodge
Produets Limited and Loblaws Limited, with ail the dangers
that can flow from that action when two firms have access to
this huge importation of chiekens. It could become a destabilizing factor in Canada's chieken market.
Senator de Cotret: 1 will be happy to do so. 1 arn not sure
that this is the appropriate time to give the honourable senator
the answer to the question he raised ycsterday. 1 inquired
about the negotiations, and 1 should like to report that in
establishing the quota level, GATT directs a country restrieting imports by means of a quota to respect the historical
pattern of tradte.
In establishing the quota at the level of 45 million pounds, it
was not possible to ignore the large increases in imports which
occurred in recent years. The level of 6.3 per cent of production established as the quota level is below the proportion
imports represented in the 1976-79 period.
The views of aIl segments of' the industry were known and
given consideration by the officiais prior to establishing Canada's position for the consultations leading to agreement on the
quota size with the United States.
1 miust say that ,ve did negotiate this, and our negotiators
have assured me that in their view this was the best agreement
they could reach, given the GATT rules.
[Senator Frith.]

October 25, 1979
Otbr2,17

In terms of the question raised by the honourable senator
today, there has been no hard-and-fast decision made by my
department in terms of the allocation of the import permits.
As a matter of fact, that was one of the issues raised at my
morning breakfast meeting with my deputy ministers. 1
attempted to get as much information as 1 could. As you know,
there are certain peculiarities, if you like, in that market, and
before making any decision 1 wanted to have the opportunity
personally to review how the market developed over the years
and what was the best allocation system that could be put in
place. So no formai decision has been taken on that.
*(1520)

Senator Argue: Is the minister aware of what I believe to be
a fact, namely, that when, after a conference in 1974 of
organi7ations interested in chieken markets, it becamne apparent that a chieken marketing agency was probably forthcoming. the two companies to which I referred. from that date on,
imported by design very large quantities of chieken, to get
themselves, it is alleged by the chieken producers. into a
position to get very large quotas?
I appreciate also what the minister has already said. I ask
him, when he is giving consideration to the allocation of
quotas, to take into account the representations from the
chieken producing organizations across this country, and I
believe also from the processors, namely, that the quotas
should be divided among processors in tliis country in proportions relative to their share of the domestie processing industry, and not given in major fashion to two companies that can
disrupt, and are disrupting, the market in Ontario, and which
are having adverse effeets, 1 believe, on the market in
Montreal.
Senator de ('otret: 1 assure the honourable senator, in
answer to his second question, that 1 will give full consideration to the point of view that he has expressed today in terms
of how the quotas should be allocated among the processors in
arriving at a decision in this matter. which will be fortlicoming
very shortly.
In terms of his first question, as to whether or not 1 was
aware of the situation he refers to. I will say, in aIl honesty,
that I was not aware of the names of the firms that had been
involved in this practice. 1 was aware that one firm had
engaged in this practice in a very major way, and this is what 1
was alluding to in my last answer when 1 talked about some of
the peculiarities in the evolution of the imnport patterns with
respect to chiekens, and something 1 wanted to have much
more information on before reaching any decision. So, while 1
was not aware of the fact that there were two specifie firms, 1
was aware that there was at least one, whose identity I did not
know, and this is certainly something 1 wanted to look into in
much greater detail before reaching a decision.
Senator Argue: 1 will ask the minister if consideration can
be given to renegotiating these quotas, in light of the fact that
prior to this immediate period the importation of chieken into
Canada was almost negligible, so that the Canadian industry is
suffering from what is being donc. Can something be donc
about the escalation in the quota that is going to be allowed,

SENATE DEBATES

debate in paying homage to Senator Grosart and congratulating him on his appointment to the prestigious position of
Speaker of the Senate.
[English]
Mr. Speaker, the words of those who have personally
observed the eminent role you have played in this house for
many years have convinced me of your qualifications to discharge such a heavy responsibility. Since last Thursday when
the debate became more lively-that seems to be a characteristic of Thursdays-I have noted that not only do you have the
professional attributes to carry out your tasks, but you also
manage to bring a touch of humour to the situation. Castigat
ridendo mores, as the old adage goes.
I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for having given a novice such a
very good lesson in parliamentary wisdom and dexterity.
[Translation]
While I am congratulating the new Speaker, I would like to
pay homage to his predecessor, the Honourable Renaude
Lapointe. I especially want to tell her how I admire the
manner in which she has fulfilled her duties in this assembly
and even more for the way in which she was able to bring
prestige to the position of Speaker of the Senate outside our
institution.
It gives me special pleasure to congratulate sincerely the
mover and seconder of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, Honourable Senator Bielish and Honourable
Senator Charbonneau, for the ease with which they handled
the difficult task of addressing this assembly for the first time,
which I am now going through myself. You will therefore
understand if I start, referring to my only other occasion of
participating in your work and deliberations before today.
This occurred just over a year ago, on September 28, 1978,
before the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons on the Canadian Constitution. Members
of this committee may recall the occasion better if I say that
Senator Lamontagne was in the Chair on that day, and by the
way, I want to thank him for having referred to my appointment in such a positive manner. As you will recall, you were
discussing Bill C-60 and had invited groups and people outside
the Senate to take part in your debates. As I remembered that,
in reply to a question concerning the House of Federation
proposed in the bill, I had expressed certain opinions about the
Senate, I obviously had the wish to read the minutes of the
joint committee to sec whether I did not inadvertently express
myself otherwise than I would have wished today. I said the
following:
The role of the Senate in our system is not simply a role
of regional representation. The Senate must play the role
of a second House in our parliamentary system, and to my
knowledge, it has played this role quite actively in many
respects. I am not saying this because of any wish to
flatter those present here, but because the basic issue is
whether or not the Senate will continue to play this role of

a second House in relation to the House of Commons.
The proposal to introduce a House of Federation in the
Canadian federal institution system must in my opinion
be discussed quite separately from any suggestion to
abolish the Senate. It seems to me that we have to do so
mostly to prevent any dangerous confusion from occurring, in the event that the Senate is abolished and the
House of Federation is created, by asking the new House,
in the absence of the Senate, to fulfill certain of the
present duties of the Senate which are not the duties of
the House of Federation, but those of the second House of
a Parliament.
Needless to say, I feel better for having underlined the
positive and necessary role of the Senate in our parliamentary
system than if I had supported unequivocally the proposal to
abolish the Senate.
Senator Asselin: You missed the target.
*

(1540)

Senator Tremblay: Sheer accident, undoubtedly. But sincerely, though, take my word for it. However, in what I said
last year there was no Machiavellian intention of leaving
certain future prospects open for me. Indeed, it was in an
altogether different context than that of the Senate that I
imagined that I would be continuing my career.
How many things have changed during the past year. How
many changes took place which affected all members of this
house, not to talk about those outside who were also affected.
It is in that process of change in the course of things that I had
to change my own assignment drastically.
In the opinion of many, the invitation extended to me to
become a member of this house and my acceptance took on the
appearance of something unforeseeable and unexpected. So it
did not seem to me inappropriate or unbecoming to indicate to
you what factors played a determining role as far as I am
concerned in this reorientation, apparently paradoxical to
some.
The first factor was the very terms in which an invitation
was being made to me and which included to a large extent an
objective I had constantly pursued during my career, namely
the necessary renewal of the Canadian Confederation. I was
indeed being asked to pursue that fundamental objective as a
member of the Canadian Senate from Quebec. I was being
offered an opportunity to express in a federal parliamentary
institution a Quebec point of view on the future of Canada, a
point of view based on my experience of inter-governmental
relations.
I was being offered the opportunity to serve Quebec and
Canada in a more determining and more effective way than I
could have otherwise at this time. How could I have, without
contradicting in a certain way my previous directions, shirked
my duty to be present that such an opportunity demanded?
Another factor of no little significance also played a role in
my involvement and final decision, the previous attitudes and
behaviour of the Prime Minister and of this government on

SENATE DEBATES
federal-provincial relations. These attitudes and behaviour
were later reflected in the Speech from the Throne in particularly meaningful terms, and the Prime Minister referred to
them in the House of Commons in the following terms:
As a new government, we have set a first immediate
objective: the easing of the climate of federal-provincial
relations. This is what we did. Action has been taken in
that perspective. i think, for instance, of the agreement
signed as regards Loto Canada. An agreement in principle
has also been reached between the new government and
some coastal provinces concerning offshore mineral
resources. In the same spirit, we have decided not to
reintroduce in the Commons the bill on the referendum as
proposed by the former government. This measure was
perceived in Quebec as an act of aggression and it is
precisely the kind of attitude that my government intends
to change.
So, my government has the firm intention of altering
the atmosphere of federal-provincial relations. Concrete
measures have been taken in recent weeks and others will
be in the future. We believe that it is possible to solve
several problems without any constitutional amendment
and without revising the constitutional tool we now have
at our disposai.
Such an open-minded approach was meeting, in my view, a
need that was deeply felt across the land, at least at the
provincial government level.
It also answers the third factor I wish to refer to, the trend
that has been apparent throughout the nation in the last few
years, the urge for a meaningful renewal of our federation.
I feel I can safely suggest that a far-reaching awareness of
this is developing among governments and peoples of Canada.
This was not the case only ten years ago or so, when Premier
Robarts took the initiative to summon his colleagues from
other provinces to the historic conference on the Canada of
tomorrow. However, a lot of ground has been covered since
that conference in 1967. Ample material is now available to
convey the reflections accumulated by government organizations and an increasing number of groups outside parliaments
over the years, and especially after the chain of events, starting
from November 15, 1976 in Quebec.
In particular, there was the report by the Joint Committee
of the Senate and House of Commons on the Constitution,
that was tabled in the months following the Victoria Conference in early 1972, if I am not mistaken, and which includes
recommendations that are far from being devoid of significance. The same goes, in my view, for materials tabled last
year during the proceedings of the Special Joint Committee on
Bill C-60. There is also the letter of October 1976 from
Premier Lougheed to the Prime Minister in which the former
announced the consensus reached by the provinces on important matters discussed during the first ministers' meetings in
Edmonton, in Banff and in Toronto.
Also, we must not underestimate the importance of the
many conferences held in various arcas from 1977 onwards. 1
[Senator Tremblay.

October 25, 1979

am thinking, for instance, about the Destiny Canada Conference which hundreds of people attended in June of that year at
York University. I am thinking also of the Alternatives
Canada Conference organized by the Canada West Foundation in April 1978. The title given to those two conferences
reflect quite well the increasingly clear, in my opinion, awareness that the constitutional tools at our disposai are no longer
sufficient to solve the problem facing the Canadian federation.
The same is true of the work of the Pepin-Robarts group.
Beyond the undeniable significance of the hearings of this task
force as a tool for collective therapy, the Pepin-Robarts Commission has produced a report of excellent quality which must
certainly be considered in any adjustment of our institutions to
the requirements of the present and future.
In summary, one conclusion seems to be drawn by the
numerous institutions, groups and individuals involved in the
collective reflection process of the last few years: There now
seems to be a general desire to bring about changes aimed at
establishing a better balance between the communities which
make up the Canadian mosaic on the one hand, and both levels
of governments on the other hand, and to respect the identities
and roles of each of them.
As I should have known, many friends in Quebec who were
surprised at the new direction I was taking hastened to tell me
that I was deceiving myself by basing my decision on the
assumption that there was really a wish for change in the
country as a whole. They may be right.
For my part, I remain convinced that there has been an
important evolution in this regard in the last few years. Most
important, I am convinced that certain changes are needed in
view of the present situation.
However, we are all aware that there are considerable
differences in the ideas that Quebecers and Canadians in
general have about what changes are necessary. The situation
has evolved and continues to evolve in Quebec visibly faster
than elsewhere in Canada.
Trying to bring harmony and consistence to the rhythm and
the direction of these two evolutions which have been until now
parallel, not to say opposed, is certainly a most difficult task,
especially since the time frame is so limited.
Whether we think of the period before or after the referendum, we have very little time at our disposai in view of the
complexity of the renewal project that must be developed and
the importance of the issue involved.
As a Quebecer, I was already required to make a choice in a
very short time, and I will have to do so in any case when the
time comes to vote on the Quebec version of the renewal
required.
The honour that has been bestowed upon me by my appointment to this assembly adds to the need for me, as a Quebecer,
to participate more closely in the development of a federal
version of this renewal.
Honourable senators, I can promise you my full participation and cooperation in the work that we may be asked to do to

October 25, 1979

develop the collective project which will give back to the
Canadian federation its full meaning for all its parts.

meaning, if you want to know whether I have changed my
mind since that time, I can say that this has no basis in fact.

Senator Godfrey: Would the honourable senator permit a
question?
First of all, I would like to compliment him very much on
his thoughtful maiden speech, but I made an even more
concrete compliment to him over the past week-end by actually re-reading with great interest the testimony he gave before
the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of
Commons on the Constitution. I noticed in that testimony he
said that in his opinion all of the senators should be appointed
by the governments of the provinces. I just wondered, since he
has been now appointed by the federal government, if he still
holds to that view.
[Translation]
Senator Tremblay: Honourable senator, I think that the
answer you just mentioned should be considered in its proper
context. The comments I made last year about the role of the
Senate and that I just recalled were rather far-off at the time
when this matter was discussed in committee, and the remarks
you just pointed out analyzed the concept of a "House of
Federation", the working principle of Bill C-60, in other words
the feasibility of a House of Federation. They had a meaning
only insofar as they compared various formulas for establishing a House of Federation; under the first formula, the House
of Federation was to be composed of representatives of national or legislative assemblies reflecting the composition of the
distribution of parties in each legislature.
As concerns the second formula, I was then considering the
possibility of a House of Federation with a different role than
that of the Senate. I still believe that the representation of
provinces of member states of the Federation through the
representation of parties in the legislatures is not a good
formula. I think that governments should designate the representatives of provinces in spite of any inconvenience involved.
My answer was rather lengthy and I apologize for it because
the apparent inconsistency between what I said about the
House of Federation is only apparent as I made a remark that
you have recalled about the House of Federation and its
feasibility.
Senator Denis: I suppose that this formula was not good. It
made some sense then because of Bill C-60. But as that bill
was never passed, you said that it was a good thing but not
anymore.
Senator Tremblay: I do not really know if I fully understand
the meaning of this last remark. I apologize for not understanding its full significance.
Senator Denis: In other words, you say that the formula was
justified then.
Senator Tremblay: If the issue is whether Bill C-60 having
disappeared, all those questions become mere speculation, I
entirely agree. On the other hand, if the question had another

Senator Donahoe: Honourable senators, as I rise for the first
time in this chamber, I should like my first words to be like
those of so many who have preceded me-words of congratulations to Senator Grosart upon his appointment as Speaker of
this august body. I have not had the opportunity to witness and
evaluate the contribution that he has made in the past to the
work of the Senate, but I have had the opportunity, over a long
period of years, to know His Honour and to be familiar with
his qualities. I know that the qualities I observed and
appreciated in those days will stand him in good stead as he
presides over our deliberations.
I wish also to congratulate the mover and seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, Senators
Bielish and Charbonneau. In my opinion, they acquitted themselves in a first-class manner. It was appropriate that Senator
Bielish should have spoken on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the "persons" case, because, as she spoke, she was a
living exemplar of the correctness of that decision. In his
speech, Senator Charbonneau brought a new and interesting
point of view to the deliberations of this body, and I am sure
that he will be heard with interest in future debates.
I must also say a word or two about my predecessor, the
Honourable Harold Connolly. Because of ill health, Harold
was forced to resign his seat. He was, when good health was
granted to him, a brilliant speaker and a dedicated Nova
Scotian Canadian. I feel that his leaving this chamber was the
Senate's loss, although I understand it is true that his physical
condition had for some years prevented his making the contribution to the work of this chamber that his talents would
otherwise have made possible.
Since I have mentioned the name Connolly, I should like to
say at this stage that it was a great pleasure to be greeted by
another senator by the name of Connolly, Senator John Connolly, who served with such distinction for many years as the
Leader of the Government in the Senate. He is an old friend of
mine. I think it appropriate to mention that on one occasion I
had the pleasure and privilege of representing my province at a
constitutional conference. That conference was presided over
by the then Minister of Justice, Guy Favreau. His deputy, or
his assistant chairman-whatever the title was-was Senator
John Connolly. It was from that conference that there
emerged the formula for constitutional reform which came to
be known as the Fulton-Favreau formula.
I have said many times, and I should like to repeat in this
house today, that if everyone associated with that conference
had had his due, the formula might very well have been
entitled the Fulton-Connolly formula, because the input of
Senator John Connolly at that constitutional conference, and
in arriving at that formula, was a very real and great one.
I enjoyed Senator Macquarrie's maiden speech because he
stood up here and made it so obvious to all that he was pleased

SENATE DEBATES
and happy to find himself in the upper chamber after so many
years of distinguished service in the other place. I want to say
to him that his was an almost instant transition from the field
of parliamentary service in the other place to this place. I ask
him to imagine how I feel. Imagine my pleasure at finding
myself alongside him after the lapse of almost a decade
between my last period of service in a legislative assembly and
my appointment to this house. I thought my political life had
ended. I felt that I was destined to take my satisfaction
vicariously through my two sons who are both members and
form part of the Government of Nova Scotia, one as a minister
of the Crown, the other as the Deputy Speaker of the
Assembly and Chairman of the Assembly's Committee on the
Constitution. My second son, I think il of interest to note, was
for some time an executive assistant to no less a person than
the present Minister of Justice, Senator Flynn, the Leader of
the Government in the Senate. I was very happy to sec that the
lessons he learned at the feet of Senator Flynn were put to
good use in his native province of Nova Scotia.
I found when I came here that I had many friends who
preceded me. Most of them, including Senator Steuart, who
made a kindly reference to me when he spoke the other day,
Senator Thériault and Senator Rowe, I met when they were
serving in other provincial cabinets. I first became acquainted
with Senator Goldenberg many years ago. In those days he
was an expert in municipal law and an adviser to municipal
governments and, later, to provincial governments. It was my
good fortune to encounter him on many occasions when we
came to Ottawa to discuss constitutional matters.
I have noticed Senator Deschatelets in the house. More than
20 years ago Senator Deschatelets and I were members of a
parliamentary delegation which visited India. Through the
years, I have derived great pleasure from recalling the memories of that Commonwealth meeting, and very pleasant memories they were insofar as my association with Senator Deschatelets was concerned.
There are some senators in the house I know of but have
never met. I sec Senator McIlraith listening to what I am
saying. I do not think I have ever met or been introduced to
Senator Mcllraith, but in a very real sense, honourable senators, he is responsible for my presence here this afternoon. I
think il only just and proper that he should sit here now and
listen to what I have to say, because without his assistance I
would not be here. I know he is wondering what I mean. He
doesn't have the slightest suspicion or idea that he in any way
ever helped me to gain my appointment to the Senate and so
occupy this seat.
* (1610)

I will explain myself by saying that I once sponsored a bill to
be put before the Parliament of Canada to increase the
complement of judges of the Supreme Court of the Province of
Nova Scotia. It provided for the addition of two judges, and il
was understood in quarters where it mattered that if the bill
passed, one of the appointments would fall to me. I do not
know because of what motivation, but Senator Mcllraith saw
to il that the bill in question got talked out in committee. Il
[Senator Donahoe.]

October 25, 1979

never did gel passed. The government of the day fell, and when
a similar bill was ultimately passed into law under another
administration, the appointments went in a direction which
was of no benefit to me.
So, had il not been for that "support" along the way from
Senator Mcllraith, I honestly believe that I would not have
been available to answer a willing "yes" when I received the
welcome telephone call from Prime Minister Clark this fall.
Senator Perrault: That is real cooperation.
Senator Donahoe: Senator Hicks is in this house too. He and
I were friendly enemies for some time before he packed up his
political activities on the provincial stage and transferred his
talents to the realm of Academe and to this chamber, two
concurrent assignments to which he has seemed to be fully
equal. When he congratulated me on my appointment to the
Senate, he hastened to assure me that, "In the Senate"-and
these are his words-"we are all truly objective". I assured
him that if that proves to be the case, I shall be as objective as
the next fellow. So far, I think he has been nearly right; but I
have observed a few performances which re-assure me that I
do not now, as a result of where I now find myself, have to
become a political neuter.
Of course, I was sponsored in this house by my very good
friend, former colleague, and genial whip on this side, Senator
Macdonald, and I thank him for that. He also played a part in
my reaching this place, although il was not quite along the
same lines as that played by Senator Mcllraith.
I was thrilled by the stirring performance earlier this week
of my old friend, college classmate and former leader, Senator
G. I. Smith. He is not here today to listen to me as he is in the
sunny Caribbean representing Canada on the occasion of a
new national state coming into official being.
Honourable senators, since this debate began, I have heard
the new government criticized on several scores. The government's proposai for dealing with Petro-Canada has been a
favourite target. Well, I do not propose to argue about PetroCanada. I know that Petro-Canada is held up by the NDP and
my honourable friends opposite as the St. George who will
save us from the dragon of the multinationals. I am a Nova
Scotian, and I know that every gallon of oil that reaches our
shores, whether through Petro-Canada or any other source, is
useless to us until il is first received and refined by those same
multinationals. I know that the people who bewail the
changes-changes which, to my mind, will make PetroCanada a more effective instrument for the public good-are
the same ones who, in the long, dreary years that they were in
power, failed to establish a national energy policy which put
ail Canadians in an equal position. They left the Atlantic
region totally dependent on offshore oil, and made il the most
vulnerable region of the world when the oil producing countries began their holdup of the western world.
The Clark governmerit has set 1990 as ils target date to
achieve energy self-sufficiency, and the shabby treatment
given to the Atlantic region by the previous administration is
the best of reasons for this government to support the utmost

October 25, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

utilization of our coal resources as one important part of our
drive to utilize all the means at our disposai to achieve energy
self-sufficiency-and not only our coal, but that vast reservoir
of power waiting to be tapped from the Fundy tides. I urge the
government to make these developments possible, and the
sooner the better.
I am encouraged in that regard by an article I read in my
local paper just a few days ago which quoted an address given
in New Brunswick by the Prime Minister, in which he said
that the Atlantic region has the resource potential to be a
strong partner in Canada. He said his government is committed to working with the provinces of the region to build up the
resource strengths of each province, and he concluded in that
regard by saying that strong parts of Canada are the best
guarantee of a strong, united Canada. Those sentiments are
very dear to my heart, and I am sure that they will appeal to
ail those who wish to see the unity that we ail hope for brought
about. That, in my opinion, is the means by which unity can be
achieved in this country.
I have heard suggestions in this house that the Clark
government is in some way responsible for difficulties that are
said to be arising in the provision of health care services. When
the Government of Canada put forward the offer to share the
cost of hospital insurance with the provinces, I was the Minister of Public Health in Nova Scotia, and the Honourable Paul
Martin was the Minister of National Health and Welfare.
How well I remember the terms that were offered, how they
were only available if a majority of the provinces having a
majority of the population of Canada accepted them, and how,
when it reached the point where all that was required was the
consent of one more province, the Minister of Health of New
Brunswick and I journeyed to Montreal to see the Minister of
National Health and Welfare. He was so busy that we could
not catch him in Ottawa, but he did say he would give us an
appointment in Montreal. So we travelled to Montreal to see
him, and we were ushered into his suite. He received us very
graciously, of course. We went there hoping to bargain for
better terms. We were prepared to say to him that our
provinces would enter the plan, thereby making up the
required majority of provinces, but that we would like him to
make it a little easier for us to do so. That was our intention in
seeking the appointment, and that is what we meant to do.
We were barely in the room with the federal minister when
an assistant came in and asked him to take the telephone. He
did so in front of us, and carried on an animated conversation
with someone whom he called Alex. Finally, he put the
telephone down and turned to us and said, "Gentlemen, that
was Alex Campbell"-you will remember that Alex Campbell
was the Premier of Prince Edward Island at that time. He
said, "That was Alex Campbell advising me that Prince
Edward Island has decided to accept the plan." Then he
smiled graciously, leaned over and said, "What was it you
gentlemen wanted to speak to me about?" Well, needless to
say, we had very little to say, but it was only after Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick had both agreed to enter the planindeed, about six months later-that P.E.I. made the decision

that we thought had been made that day we were in Montreal.
Do you wonder that from then on I always dealt with federal
ministers at arm's length?
* (1620)

Later, when Medicare was introduced, Nova Scotia, as it
had done in the case of hospital insurance, sought modifications that would have made the plan more financially bearable,
while providing a high standard of care wherever it was
required, and leaving some personal responsibility to pay on
those who were able to do so. Well, we had no success. The
insistence was on a comprehensive service, on universality of
coverage and on portability of benefits, and the proposai
involved a 50-50 sharing of costs on ail agreed services. I
feared then, and it came to pass, that the day would come
when escalating costs would drive the federal government to
place limits upon its share and to leave the provinces to look
after the escalation on their own. If today there are some
problems arising in the supply of health care, if overbilling is
becoming more common, if in some provinces too many doctors are not willing to practise under the Medicare plan, and if
some are leaving for greener fields, that is a result that might
have been foreseen when there was anything less than a full
sharing of the total cost of agreed services. I would, of course,
be the first to admit that means must be found to control the
costs and to continue to deliver the highest possible level of
service, but the problem is just another Liberal engineered one
which somebody else is going to have to solve.
I would like to cite another subject that has caused some
attack on the new Prime Minister, and that is his position with
respect to the referendum to be held in the province of Quebec.
That has drawn some fire from across the aisîe, and I propose
to say just a few words about it.
I should tell you that I once made a speech in the legislature
of Nova Scotia in French, and that the then Leader of the
Opposition referred to my remarks with the phrase, "whatever
language that was that he was speaking," after I had resumed
my seat. I did the best I could. I retorted that I had always
been aware that the Leader of the Opposition did not understand French, and do you know that, though he has now
happily returned to his position as Leader of the Opposition,
some of his public efforts to use French when he had been
elevated to the other side of the chamber succeeded in convincing me that I was right. Nevertheless and notwithstanding[Translation]
Honourable senators, I must admit I am unable to express
myself in both languages like several of my colleagues.
I do hope that while I sit in the Senate I shall manage to
learn French adequately, which will enable me to take an
active part in discussions and debates. By mastering that
language, which is the mother tongue of millions of Canadians,
not only shall I not bore you with my limited knowledge, but I
shall also learn to understand and appreciate the wisdom and
rhetorical gifts of my colleagues on both sides of the Senate
when they take part in the discussions with the enthusiasm
that is theirs.

SENATE DEBATES

I close my remarks on "la belle langue" fully confident that,
when the time comes for the referendum, the Canadians of
Quebec will decide to remain an important part of our nation,
as it was in fact in the past, through the wish and free consent
of their patriotic ancestors.

[English]
ENERGY
PRICE 0F DOMESTIC OIL

STATEMENT BY PREMIER 0F ALBERTA

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of lndustry, Trade and Commerce. It is now
over 30 hours since Premier Laugheed of Alberta made a
speech in Vancouver with respect ta ail prices and the availability of Alberta oul ta the ather provinces of Canada.
1 wonder if the minister can tell us whether or not he bas
had an opportunity as yet ta study the text of Mr. Lougheed's
speech. Would he tell us whether there have been contacts
with Mr. Lougheed's office, or with Mr. Lougheed personally,
ta discuss the implications of the statements attributed ta him?
1 wauld remind the minister that the statement was ta the
effect that the people of Canada would have ta buy ail at a
price which Alberta would decide was fair, or not get ail from
Alberta.
Perhaps this next question shauld be asked in a supplementary way, but have the minister and his cabinet colleagues
determined ta make sure that ail from Alberta will continue ta
be made available ta aIl Canadians in the foreseeable future?
Furthermore, can an assurance be given that ail, wherever it is
produced in Canada, shaîl continue ta be available ta aIl
members of aur confederatian?
Senator de Cotret: Well, ta answer your first question,
senator, I have not had the appartunity ta read the text af
Premier Lougheed's speech. 1 would therefare prefer ta defer

SENATE DEBATES
any specific comments 1 may have on the text of that speech
until I have had the opportunity to review it in detail.
Senator Lamontagne: A decided lack of communication!
Senator de Cotret: I should also like to say that according to
some press reports that I have had the opportunity to scan,
Premier Lougheed indicated clearly that in no way have the
negotiations currently under way between the federal government and the various provincial governments at all reached an
impasse. It is still our firm belief that we will be successful in
reaching a negotiated agreement on the future course of
petroleum prices in this country, and assure thereby the continued supply of petroleum to the Canadian public and also
meet our goal of self-sufficiency in energy overall by the year
1990.
Senator Perrault: I have a supplementary question-a
request for clarification. Would the minister have the Senate
understand that after a speech of the kind made yesterday at
noon in Vancouver-a speech with possible grave implications
for all Canadians-the Government of Canada has yet to
secure a copy of the text, or to obtain a text of the relevant
sections, of that speech-an address which could have profound and far-reaching effects on Canadians from coast to
coast?
Surely some contact has been made with the Government of
the Province of Alberta, or at least an effort made, to obtain
reassurances or clarifications if there are any misunderstandings. If the minister has not had an opportunity to study the
remarks attributed to Premier Lougheed, surely there has been
contact of some kind between the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister and Mr. Lougheed's office. There are many concerned Canadians from coast to coast who want to be reassured that the government is as concerned about the oil supply
and pricing situation as they are.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I am sure that
there has been some contact. I do not know whether it has
been between the Office of the Prime Minister and the
Premier of Alberta or between the federal Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources and the Minister of Energy for Alberta,
or exactly at what level the contacts have taken place.
I would like to assure honourable senators that there has
been contact between the two levels of government in the
continuing dialogue and discussions that we are having in the
area of oil and petroleum pricing.
I will endeavour to secure the precise information as to who
contacted whom, and who got the first copy of the speech. I
assure honourable senators that 1 shall read the text of that
speech with great interest as soon as I am able to obtain a
copy.
Obviously, il is a speech that does fall within the area of
energy and I should think that the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources would be the first to turn his attention to the
matter. I have not had the opportunity today to do so, but I
shall endeavour to do so within the very near future. I am sure
the matter is being looked after.
(Senalor deCotret.]

October 30, 1979

Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question for the the
minister. It is almost incredible that the government is treating
this matter in such a lax manner. It seems to be on everyone's
mind except the government's. I would ask the minister whether he can tell us what has been offered by the federal government to the Province of Alberta in the course of these negotiations. I do not expect to be given the precise amount, but has
there been a reasonable offer made, because the Premier of
Alberta said in Vancouver yesterday that he was not making a
threat but a statement of policy of the Government of Alberta.
Presumably Premier Lougheed made that statement on the
premise that the offers that had been made by the federal
government were completely unacceptable and, in his view at
least, unreasonable.
Could we be informed of the present state of negotiations,
and whether the federal government is making a reasoned
offer to Alberta, or whether the offer is so ridiculous that il
has infuriated the provincial premier?
Senator de Cotret: I shall not comment on the specifics of
the negotiations, nor will I discuss the negotiating stance of the
federal government in ils dealings with the various provinces
on this issue. I can only tell the honourable senator that the
negotiating position of the Government of Canada is certainly
a most reasonable position, and most certainly il does take at
the very heart the interest of Canadians from coast to coast in
ensuring our energy future.
Senator Oison: I have a further supplementary question for
the minister. Is the offer in keeping with the commitment that
was made by the federal government and all the other provinces that the price be allowed to move up sufficiently rapidly
so that it would narrow the gap between domestic and international prices? Has an offer been made which is sufficient to
maintain that commitment?
Senator de Cotret: The position on that issue is very clear,
honourable senators. We have repeatedly said that we would
favour a course of action in this area that would see the price
of domestic crude gradually rise toward-not to, but towardworld levels, always maintaining a differential between the
domestic price of crude and the price of crude at Chicago, in
order to maintain a competitive advantage with our major
trading partners.
a (2010)

That remains the position of this government, and suggestions along those lines have been made. I can only concur that
there has been no change in our essential position in terms of
the basic strategy to be followed in energy pricing in this
country, and no change has been made in our commitinent to
reach a level of self-sufficiency in energy overall by the year
1990.
Senator Oison: A final supplementary question. honourable
senators: I think there is a problem of semantics here, or
perhaps the minister is stepping around the question. He said
that il was the government's policy to pursue a course of
bringing these domestic prices "toward" international prices,
but he did not answer the real heart of that question.

October 30, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Is the offer enough to narrow the gap, or will it widen it
further.
Senator de Cotret: Well, once again there is no question that
if I felt free to discuss the details of the negotiations, which I
do not, I could give you a more precise answer; but in general,
if you look at the proposals that have been made over time,
they do certainly narrow the gap between the domestic price of
crude and the international price of crude.
Senator Bosa: I have a supplementary question. While I
realize the minister is not in possession of the text of Mr.
Lougheed's speech may I ask what contingency plans this
government has in the event that Mr. Lougheed decides to
accelerate the increase in the price of oil to close to the
international level by slowing down the rate of production of
this vital commodity?
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator will recognize
that this is a totally hypothetical question. The Premier of
Alberta indicated that by no means have these negotiations,
which have been ongoing now for several weeks, reached an
impasse, and I will repeat to this house that we are confident
that we will be able to reach a negotiated agreement on the
future direction of the price of petroleum products in this
country which will be acceptable to the provincial authorities,
be they from producing or consuming provinces. I would
certainly not speculate on what would happen if such and such
a course of action were to be taken by one provincial government or another.
POWER OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REGULATE DOMESTIC
OIL PRICE

Senator Bosa: A further supplementary question. I would
beg to disagree with the minister. This is not a hypothetical
question. It is based on a statement made by Mr. Lougheed
and reported in the press. My specific question related to a
different aspect of the matter. Does this government have the
jurisdiction-the constitutional jurisdiction-to intervene in
the event of a deliberate slowdown in the rate of production of
this vital commodity? Does the government have the jurisdiction to intervene in this area?
Senator de Cotret: You are asking me if we have constitutional authority in this matter. I would have to consult with
my colleagues to find out whether we have such authority.
Senator Oison: The Minister of Justice is right there.
Senator de Cotret: I know we are only a day away from
October 29, but I do not really think that that kind of doom
and gloom scenario is ever going to materialize in this country.
Senator Molgat: I should like to put a supplementary question, if I may, to the minister. It is really for the purpose of
clarification, because I find it very hard to believe that I
understood him properly. Am I correct in my understanding
that the Premier of Alberta, whose province is the main
supplier of domestic oil in this country, made a major policy
statement some 24 hours ago, and that the federal minister
specifically responsible for economic matters has not looked at
80072-14

that statement, has not obtained a copy of that statement, and
is not prepared now to make a clear-cut statement on this
matter? Is that what the minister is telling us?

•

(2015)

Senator de Cotret: Absolutely. That is exactly what I am
saying.
Senator Perrault: That's a shame!
Senator Bosa: As a final supplementary, would the minister
take my question as notice and respond to it tomorrow if he
does not have the answer at this time?
PROFITS OF OIL CORPORATIONS AND CHARTERED BANKS

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
a question with respect to oil company profits in the United
States. As the minister is aware, the President of the United
States, a firm advocate of rugged free enterprise, is proposing
a major windfall profit tax on the multi-national oil companies
whose profits have soared to record heights in the United
States, as they have in Canada. Will the minister tell honourable senators this evening whether the government is anticipating taking extraordinary measures to ascertain that an adequate portion of oil industry profits are invested in oil
exploration and recovery; and that inordinate windfall profits
are going to be recaptured, at least in part, by the government
for the Canadian people.
Senator Flynn: What do you know about that?
Senator de Cotret: When one looks at the profits that the
honourable senator has mentioned, one has also to look at
what happens to the profits because, really, it is a mechanism
by which savings from the corporate sector are transferred
either to individuals or to investment. They are transferred to
individuals through dividends, and they are transferred to
investment through capital spending.
In the last full year for which information is available, 84
per cent, and I stand to be correctedSenator Oison: That is what the Prime Minister said.
Senator de Cotret: That is right; we speak the same words.
Eighty-four per cent of the profits of those corporations was
reinvested in Canada for exploration and further development.
We are following the situation closely. There is no indication
at the moment that there is an excessive dividend outflow from
these sources or that the profits are being used for the accumulation of assets outside of energy.
Any major policy decisions that are to be made in this
matter will be made in the appropriate manner.
Senator Perrault: Can the minister give us assurance that in
respect of oil industry profits a careful monitoring procedure is
being pursued rigorously to make sure the public interest is
being protected?
There is, as the minister is aware, a great and rising concern
in this country, not only with respect to the enormous ninemonth profit figures of the oil companies-something
approaching $1 billion-but with respect to the soaring profits

SENATE DEBATES
of the banks as well at a time when the purchasing power of
the average Canadian is plummeting.
Senator de Cotret: The answer to that is: Yes, we are
inonitoring it very activcly.
Senator Oison: Are you going to do anything about it?
Senator Flynn: It is the samie systemr that you put into place.
GRANTS AND SPECIAL ALLOWANCES TO OIL CORPORATIONS

Senator Crol: Honourable senators, in light of the discussion on profits, 1 should like to ask a question.
Senator Flynn: Discussion or question?
Senator Crol: How do you justify paying to these varjous oul
companies the sum of $450 million by way of grants and
special allowances this year?
Senator de Cotret: The justification, honourable senator,
cornes from the utilization that is made of these funds, as the
justification for the profits accruing to those companies cornes
essentially from how those funds are utilized. Let's face it: a
dollar is a dollar. It can be used for varjous purposes. If t is
used for a purposc that advances the public policy cause of this
country and the economie well-being of the citizens of this
country, we will stand firmly behind that kind of programn.
Senator Croli: It is not one of your better answers.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
LOCATION 0F (ANADIAN EMBASSY IN ISRAEL- RELATIONS

Senator Buckwold: H-onourable senators, 1 have a question
for the minister answering for foreign affairs. 1 have heard and
read the report by Mr. Stanfield and the recommendations he
made on the proposed move of the Canadian embassy in lsrael
from Tel Aviv to Jerusaiem.
0 (2020)

In view of the fact that, during his Middle East tour, Mr.
Stanfield met with PLO leaders, and that the Prime Niniser's
recent staternent regarding Jerusalern has met with positive,
and indeed enthîisiastic, respcinsc by the PLO, dc'es the minister think that wc wili be able to maintain our good and
friendly relations with the State of Israel, or does this indicate
any change in Canadian policy vis-à-vis the State of lsrael?
[Translation]j
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, 1 think every senator
read the Prime Minister's statement following the interim
report, tabled in the House of Commons, on the mission
undertaken by the Honourable Robert Stanfield on behaif of
the government. The Prime Ninister very cleariy stated and
repeated that Mr. Stanfield was to colleet ail the data, ail the
information he would deem useful. And the visit he made with
the Palcstine Liberatiun Organization, as he very cleariy
stated, is in no way an officiai recognition by Canada of that
movement. AIl Mr. Stanfieid recomrnended, and I myseif arn
[Senator Perrault]J

now reading the report because I arn back fromi travel, is that
the Canadian Embassy shouid not be moved. The governrnent
accepted Mr. Stanfield's views, and quite simpiy decided not
to proceed with the move.
[Eng!ish]
Senator Buckwold: I do not think that that is a response to
the question. 1 agree that the response was quite proper, but it
did not get to the major question I asked, which is the
assurance of the govcrnrnent that those good and friendiy
relations, which have been so important to the State of Israel,
will continue to be rnaintained. I hope the answer has not been
evaded because of any negative thinking in this regard.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, 1 can make no predictions to the honourabie senator as to what will happen to
our relations with certain countries visited by Mr. Stanfieid.
One thing is certain, the Canadian government reached a
decision. That decision was announced. My honourable
friend's party attacked us for not reaching a decision. When
we make no decision we are attacked, and when we make
decisions, we are stili attackcd. This tirne we reached a dccision, it was announced by the Prime Minister, and the honourable senators are awarc of its contents. I have nothing to add
at this point.
[En glish]
POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING CONSULATE IN WEST
JERIJSAtEM

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, 1 should like t0 ask
a question of the Minister of State who answers for foreign
affairs in the Senate. In view of the appeasernent, indecd
surrender, of the governrnent to the demands of the Arab
states and the PLO by abandoning the movernent of the
Canadian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusaiern, wouid the
minister inforrn this chamber whether the federai governrnent
wili have at ieast the courtesy, if not the courage, to establish a
consulate in West Jerusalern?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, obviously I arn not
the one who will decide. I wiil take that question as notice. I
will consuit the Secretary of State for External Affairs and try
to give you an answer.
Senator Molgat: If I may, I have a supplementary for the
honourabie minister. He said in his answer that this was a
prelirninary report. Could he tell us what other measures Mr.
Stanfield is going to take? Is he going to make other visits?
What has he left to do now that the governrnent has made a
decision? Why a preliminary report, what can we expeet and
when can we expeet a final report?
Senator Asselin: Mr. Stanfield received a clear and specifie
mandate from the government. 1 think the terms of that
mandate are known to honourable senators. Mr. Stanfieid did
not want this issue to suffer further deiays and neither did the
governrnent.

SENATE DEBATES

October 30, 1979

We asked Mr. Stanfield to make a preliminary report on his
views about this important issue and in light of this important
matter we made a decision you are aware of. Under his
mandate, of course, Mr. Stanfield will have to make a more
complete report. He did not tell me, but I read that his report
would be ready within a few months.
Senator Molgat: Would the honourable minister tell us if
this report will imply other visits, if there are any other
countries to visit and other people to consult? Who has not
been seen yet? Is he satisfied that all measures were taken.
Has the government made a decision? It is difficult to understand that we need something else now. Would the minister
tell us what else Mr. Stanfield is going to do?
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I think that Mr.
Stanfield is a responsible man and according to his mandate he
can make all the decisions that the government would like him
to make. If you require more information you might get them
directly from Mr. Stanfield.
Senator Moigat: I thought that the minister was answering
here on behalf of the government. Did Mr. Stanfield not
receive a mandate from the government?
Senator Asselin: I answer on behalf of the government, but
Mr. Stanfield is not a member of the government.
[English]
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
CANADIAN CONTRACTS WITH ARAB COUNTRIES

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In the
wake of what can only be described as the abortive Jerusalem
embassy debacle, can the minister tell us whether any contacts
have been made with Arab countries in order to rescue
Canadian orders lost or placed in jeopardy during this Conservative policy disaster-a disaster, Mr. Minister, which i
think even the government must admit has alienated our good
friends both in Israel and in other friendly states in the Middle
East?
Senator de Cotret: Well, I have a lot of difficulty in
answering that question. First, I do not recognize that it was a
disaster; second, I do not recognize that we have alienated
everybody around, including our friends in Israel and our
friends in the Arab world.
I am not willing to agree that we have a whole series of
contracts out there that are in jeopardySenator Olson: We will send you a list, if you like.
Senator de Cotret: Please do. Make sure that they are not
contracts that were lost on a purely commercial basis, though.
Make sure that they were contracts that were put in question
directly because of this policy.
We have answered this question. In total, there is less than
$5 million in contracts that can be attributedSenator Oison: Oh, oh.

Senator de Cotret: -that can be directly attributed to
moves made during this period. A disaster? I do not think so. i
can cite contracts that were signed during this period. i do not
think we have to move to reassure. We do not have to move to
rescue. We have set the record clear. We have carried out the
mandate we said we would carry out in this matter. The record
is clear now. Our commercial interests in the Middle East can
pursue their normal course, and i would certainly expect them
to flourish in the months to come.
Senator Perrault: I would appreciate a further clarification
from the honourable minister. The minister states that the
approximate loss is something like $4 million.
Senator de Cotret: i said $5 million. i will not quibble.
Senator Perrault: Is that the exact total estimated amount
of money involved in lost contracts during the period between
May 22 and the present time? When the minister talks about
his version of a "disaster," one almost believes that he would
have described the collision of the Titanic with the iceberg
merely as a stop to take on ice.
* (2030)

Senator Denis: May I ask a supplementary question of the
minister? i was told that a minister stated, when speaking on

Senator Perrault: The estimate given was $5 million, yet i
have in my hand a newspaper article which states:
A British Columbia steel fabricating firm says it has
lost two contracts in Arab countries worth $43 million as
a result of Prime Minister Joe Clark's proposai to move
the Canadian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
The articles continues:
Julius Bekei, President of Zenith Steel Fabricators Ltd.
of Richmond, harshly criticized the government's falsestart policy on the issue, which he directly blamed for the
loss of the two contracts.
Mr. Minister, the question I put to you is: Have you studied
these allegations made by the President of Zenith Steel Fabricators, Mr. Julius Bekei? He has set forth certain serious
charges in substantial and apparently exact detail. Does the
minister accept the validity of Mr. Bekei's statements or does
he deny the validity of those statements?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, i neither accept
nor deny their validity. I am well aware of that report. I had
occasion to read the media comments on it. I can only assure

Senator Perraulk that I have instructcd my officiais to carry
out a îhorough investigation of thc allegations contained in the

Senator Perrault: Is the minister, then, prepared to revise
upward his estimate of the dollar loss to Canada if Mr. Bekei's
allegations can bc proven to be accurate'?
Senator de Cotret: No, not in any way. 1 would certainly say
that this government stands ready to look very seriously at any
such allegations made that concern the policy of the government of this country. i think that is a responsible course of
action, and it is the course of action we are pursuing. As soon
as that review is conducted, i would be happy to informi the
Senate of the exact status of the question.

attach and that the new government attaches to an increased
economic cooperation between Mexico and Canada.
I have met on at least two, perhaps three occasions with the
Mexican ambassador in Canada to organize a ministerial and
business mission which would provide Canada with a serious
opportunity to express in concrete terms its interest in developing closer economic relations with Mexico. Moreover, this
would not mean a two or three-day trip, but an extended trip,
so that Canadian businessmen may truly understand the economic challenges that Mexico will face in the next 10 years.
I still maintain that this is one of our most promising
markets, and one that we should certainly develop.
These negotiations, since this is what you call them, these
discussions were held during the summer and the fall. As
concerns our negotiations and our agreements with Mexico, I
believe that we have very good relations with that country at
this time. I can assure the honourable senators that we fully
intend to follow up in the coming months on the action taken
last summer and carlier this fall.
Senator Lamontagne: Why is it that our ambassador to
Mexico complains that the agreements entered into have not
yet been made fully operative?
Senator Asselin: When did hc complain about this?
Senator Lamontagne: Why is it that the oil import agreements have not yet been made effective and have not yet been
signed at the ministerial level?
Senator de Cotret: I shall reply simply that, under the
agreements entered into by the then Canadian government and
the Mexican government, the treaties were to bc signed during
the visit of the Mexican president to Canada in October of this
year. At the request of the Mexican authorities, this visit has
now been postponed. I do not believe that this should cause
any serious problem.
The agreements have been negotiated. What do you want?
Are the agreements so bad that they should be renegotiated?
If this is the problem, I have certainly not been told about it.
Senator Lamontagne: I have a last supplementary.
Since this agreement on energy negotiated by the former
government with Mexico has awaited the signature of the
ministers since May, can the minister tel! us whether he is
aware of the fact that Mr. Bernard Cloutier, president of
SOQIP, the Société québécoise d'initiatives pétrolières, has
already initiated talks with PEMEX, the Mexican oil corporation, with a view to importing Mexican oil into Quebec and
replacing Petro-Canada?
Senator de Cotret: Now, listen: that type of business, that is
initiating talks of that type means nothing. I can pick up the
telephone tomorrow morning and initiate talks with any country in the world.
So, when SOQIP can tell me they have made a deal with the
Mexicans, of some substance, that the Mexicans are even
willing to discuss it, then I shall be able to answer your
question. Initating talks, that is easy to do: all it takes is a
phone call.
[Senaior de Cotreti.

Senator Lamontagne: Since the minister is not aware of it, I
must inform him that Mr. Cloutier went to Mexico and met
PEMEX officials.
Senator Asselin: If you know, then why ask the question?
Senator Lamontagne: Because I want to hear it from the
mouth of the minister, since we are supposed to have access to
information in this chamber.
Senator de Cotret: You have no information to lead us to
believe that an agreement between SOQIP and PEMEX has
been reached to the detriment of the one that has already been
signed.
I do not know exactly what you want to prove by your line
of questioning. There is nothing in it. Talking to the Mexicans
is no big deal. I can talk to the Mexicans. I can talk to anyone
in the world. But to conclude an agreement which will become
an economic reality in the future, that is something else again.
The government of your party negotiated during 14 months
the agreements that are to be ratified by the Prime Minister of
Canada and the President of Mexico. Now you are telling us
about the visit to Mexico of a representative of SOQIP who
claims to have reached an agreement that can interfere with
the one that was negotiated previously.
Senator Lamontagne: 1 did not say there was an agreement.
I said Mr. Cloutier had initiated talks, which is not to reach an
agreement. In any event, I must conclude there have been no
negotiations since May.
Senator de Cotret: Once again, there have been no negotiations. The agreement was negotiated, and we are waiting for
the President of Mexico to visit Canada and rectify it conclusively. So, I see no problem.

AGRICULTURE
CHICKEN IMPORTQLOTAS

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, on Thursday last I
asked a question as to the undesirability of granting import
quotas on chicken on the basis of importers of record as this
would seem to give the largest part of the quota to two large
importers.
The Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce in reply to
that question, as reported, at page 188 of Hansard, said in
part:
In terms of the question raised by the honourable
senator today, there has been no hard-and-fast decision
made by my department in terms of the allocation of the
import permits.
I have in my hand a publication headed: "Notice to Importers: Export and Import Permits Act," and dated October 19,
1979. This is what it says in part:
Quota Allocation
Individual entitlements have been established on the
basis of import performance during the years 1976

October 30, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

through 1978. A separate notification contains individual
importers' entitlements for the period October 22, 1979 to
December 31, 1979 and for the calendar year 1980.
I would ask the minister how he can explain the answer he
gave-that the matter of allocation of import permits was still
being discussed and that, in fact, he had discussed it at a
breakfast meeting-when this publication, which, I take it, is a
directive under the Export and Import Permits Act, says that
notification containing individual importers' entitlements has
already been sent out?
The chicken producers are, of course, greatly disturbed. This
is a legitimate question and I hope that somehow he is able to
stick by his first answer as opposed to what appears to be, in
black and white, a complete contradiction of what he has told
the Senate.
Senator de Cotret: Well, I am quite disturbed, to be very
honest with you, to learn that. I can assure the honourable
senator that I was in no way attempting to mislead colleagues
in this chamber. It was my understanding that the matter was
still under active discussion. i referred to a breakfast meeting
at that point in which I had with my senior officials discussed
that very matter. The fact that there has apparently been a
publication to the effect that import quotas have been allocated, according to a basis that I had not understood or agreed to,
is certainly something i will look into and I will be happy to
report back on it to this chamber.
In this case on that morning, or the morning before, I had
been specifically discussing that very issue, so this is certainly
something that disturbs me and I will look into it. I would like
to assure honourable senators that I was not in any way
attempting to mislead this chamber.
Senator Argue: I appreciate the minister's answer. 1wonder
if in making his reply he could supply the members of this
chamber with the particular notification, if one exists, that is
referred to in this publication so that we can see for ourselves
in black and white how it is intended that these quotas be
allocated, if in fact that is the case. If it is an error, can we be
informed of that as well?
Senator de Cotret: With respect to your question, senator,
certainly I will provide all of the information to honourable
senators. I believe you mentioned the date of October 19 when
you quoted the publication.
Senator Argue: Yes.
Senator de Cotret: i will have to verify the actual publication. It seems to me to be somewhat strange, because the
cabinet decision on this matter was close to the 19th. I would
not say it was after the 19th, but it was very close to the 19th.
It is surprising the speed with which some of these documents
appear. But I will certainly look into that and provide all of the
information.

between Canada and the United States leading to the import
agreement, was Canada's negotiating team led by the Canadian Minister of Agriculture or was this delicate and important
negotiation left to officials only?

CANADA-UNITED STATES AGREEMENT ON IMPORTATION OF
CHICKEN-CANADIAN NEGOTIATING TEAM

Senator Asselin: Honourable senator, I am ready to answer
your second question. Yes, the Secretary of State for External
Affairs has made a great contribution on behalf of Canada.

Senator Argue: I wonder if I might ask another question in
the field of agriculture. In the negotiations that took place

Senator de Cotret: In terms of that question, senator, it is
my understanding that the negotiations were led by officials,
but I stand to be corrected on that. I will ascertain from my
colleague the Minister of Agriculture whether he was involved
directly or personally in the negotiations. 1 am sure, though,
that the negotiating team was operating under the close supervision of the Minister of Agriculture throughout the
negotiations.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
CANADIAN STAFF AT UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS

Senator Muir: Honourable senators, I should like to pose a
question to the minister who replies in this chamber for foreign
affairs. I apologize, for not giving him notice, but I should like
to know if he is aware that Canada has a restraint program at
the United Nations causing great problems in that area to
dedicated people from External Affairs who have to try to be
in several committees at the same time. Before the honourable
senators across the way laugh with glee, I should point out that
that has been going on for some years.
I should like to ask the honourable gentleman if he would
check with the cabinet to find out why we have a "Mickey
Mouse" operation at the United Nations.
We are proud of Canada. Canada, the nation as it is, is
looked up to by many countries at the United Nations, but, if

we are not able to carry out our duties as we should because
we have not the staff there, we will go down in the eyes of the
other countries of the world.
SPEECH OF SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT
UNITED NATIONS

Senator Muir: May I ask the minister who replies in the
Senate for foreign affairs if he is aware of the quality of the
presentation at the United Nations by the Secretary of State
for External Affairs?
From my discussions with the delegates at the United
Nations, I am advised that our Secretary of State for External
Affairs made a fantastic, an excellent, presentationSenator Perrault: No commercials!
Senator Muir: -at

Senator Perrault: Speech! Question!
Senator Muir: I will make my speech and I will pick you up

SENATE DEBATES
With regard to his first question, I shall provide the answer
later.

October 30, 1979

In our party we do not muzzle our members as the party
opposite used to do. It is most interesting to sec that they are
now unmuzzled.

PRESENCL OF CBC REPORTER AT UNITED NATIONS

Senator Muir: I have a supplementary question for the
honourable the minister. Why in the hell does the CBCSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Muir: -not have a representative in New York, the
financial centre of the world and the site of the United
Nations? The CBC does not have anyone reporting from the

United Nations on what is happening with respect to the
Canadian delegation or other delegations. Would the honourable the minister be good enough to bring that matter before
the cabinet and eventually the President of the CBC?
I recall that ai one time we had Stanley Burke at the United
Nations who sent back reports to Canada. However, Canada is
now forgotten, and J would like to know why the CBC does not
have a representative in New York.
Senator Buckwold: I would like to include the Senate in
that.
Senator Muir: Yes, that is right. I have been there on
several occasions, and have felt dismayed and upset ai what is
happening with regard to the Canadian mission aI the United
Nations. It comprises dedicated, earnest people who are trying
to do a good job; yet they are not being allowed to do so
because they have neither the staff nor the finance.

Senator Asselin: I will call the attention of the Secretary of
State to that important issue and J will report back to the
Senate.

THE ECONOMY
STATEMENT BY THE HONOURABLE AILVIN HAMILTON, P.C.

Senator Perrault: I direct a question to the Leader of the
Government in the Senate. One of Canada's respected Conservative members of the Privy Council is the Honourable
Alvin Hamilton who the other day called the central bank's
high interest and tight money policy dubious. He complained:
There is no concrete proof that it is working.
That seems to be at odds with the fervour that passeth all
understanding by which members of the present government
defend high interest rates. Is there some way that the honourable the Leader of the Government can resolve this confusion
in Conservative thinking?
Senator Flynn: J believe I have already said that Mr.
Hamilton was speaking for himself. The committee in the
other place, which is inquiring into the policy of the Bank of
Canada on interest rates may come up with a solution. Possibly it could adopt some of the points mentioned by Mr.
Hamilton, but in the meantime that gentleman is speaking for
himself, and there is nothing wrong with that.
[Senator Asselin.]

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
GOVERNMENT POLICY IN ADVANCE OF ENACTMENT OF
LEGISLATION

Senator Godfrey: I should like to ask of the Leader of the
Government in the Senate the same question that I asked the
Deputy Leader of the Government last Thursday. The Leader
of the Government, in his capacity as Minister of Justice, is
better equipped to answer the question. The Freedom of
Information Bill that was tabled last Wednesday, even with
the support of all parties, will not become law for ai least six
months.
Last Thursday, Governor Bouey, when appearing before the
Finance Committee of the House of Commons, refused to
answer a question which he would be required to answer had
the Freedom of Information Act become law.
Some Hon. Senators: Order.
Senator Godfrey: I will repeat the question that I asked last
Thursday. What steps is the government going to take between
now and the enactment of the Freedorn of Information Bill to
make sure that government and crown corporation officials
will obey the spirit and general principles of the proposed
legislation and answer questions such as were asked of Governor Bouey last Thursday?
Senator Flynn: Some guidelines have been considered at this
time that would normally follow the adoption of the legislation, but which may be put into effect right away.
I do not know whether the governor himself would like to
table all the information he has. He may have some hesitancv
in doing so. It all depends on whether the information would
be harmful to our relations with the United States. That is one
of the exemptions under the proposed legislation. The guidelines will probably clarify the situation in due course.
Senator Godfrey: Has the government any plans for enforcing those guidelines pending the coming into effect of the
Freedom of Information Act?
Senator Flynn: If the government imposes guidelines, it will
see to it that they are enforced.
THE PUBLIC SERVICE
STATEMENTS BY SENIOR OFFICIALS

Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I wish to refer to a
matter that was raised by Senator McElman a few days ago,
and which was left in a rather inconclusive state after he and J
had discussed the matter.
It concerns a statement that he had heard on the radio,
thought to have been made by Mr. Massé, the Clerk of the
Privy Council, which dealt with the question of ministerial
responsibility.

SENATE DEBATES

October 30, 1979

Since the interchange between myself and the honourable
senator took place, I have had an opportunity to secure a copy
of exactly what was said. In order to settle the point at issue,
perhaps it would be best if I read the relevant portion. It is
part of a program over CJOH called "The House on the Hill"
that was broadcast on October 21 last at 6.30 p.m. Mr. Massé
said as follows:
Deputy ministers are presently in a position and should
be put in a position in the future also, where they are
responsible for the management of their departments.
What they cannot be held responsible for is for the choice
of policies, because these are decided by ministers and
ministers are the only people who can defend these policies in Parliament. However, once the policies have been
decided upon, these policies translate themselves into
programs and activities. The management of these programs and activities is done under the supervision of the
deputy minister and in this sense, I believe the deputy
minister should be able to justify, in front of parliamentary committees, how he is running the programs that he
is accountable for.
I am sure that honourable senators will recognize that it is a
pretty accurate description of what actually takes place at
present before a good many Senate committees. It does not, in
my opinion, represent any modification of the principle of
ministerial responsibility, but is a plain common-sense
straightforward description of what often happens in the committees of this house, and I am sure happens also in committees of the other house.
It is well to ventilate the point, and neither Senator McElman nor I should be disturbed that the traditions respecting
ministerial responsibility are being affected.
YUKON TERRITORY
GOVERNMENT POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have some replies to
questions asked previously.
On Tuesday, October 16, Senator Lucier asked a question
regarding the granting of responsible government to the
Yukon. In reply I have sought a complete legal opinion from
my officials.
On a policy matter, the Prime Minister has said repeatedly
that if the people, subsequent to full consultations, demonstrate in a referendum their wish to gain full provincial status,
and if the provinces agree, then, subject to legislation being
passed by the Parliament of Canada, the Yukon would become
a full province.
If provincial status were to be rejected in a referendum, the
duly elected Legislative Assembly of the Yukon would continue to exist and, so far as the Government of Canada is
concerned, the leader of the governing party in that assembly
could continue to call himself "Premier."
I might point out for the senator's benefit that the legislative
authority for the establishment of new provinces lies exclusive-

ly with the Parliament of Canada by virtue of the B.N.A. Act
of 1871. This authority is referred to in later acts creating the
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, at which time the
concurrence of existing provinces was not required.
TRANSPORT
AIRPORT MAINTENANCE

Senator Flynn: Last Wednesday, Senator Norrie asked a
question which was very similar to a motion under Standing
Order 43 moved earlier in the Commons.
* (2110)

The minister has informed me that every effort is being
made to optimize resource utilization. At the same time, there
is no intention of reducing the level of safety or service of
runway snow removal operations.
Of particular interest to the senator will be the fact that it is
expected that for this year near-equivalent service will be
maintained in the Atlantic region over the winter.
The staff resource allocated to snow removal maintenance is
similar to last year. It is anticipated that the provision of a
satisfactory level of service will not be prejudiced.
INDIAN AFFAIRS
JURISDICTION ON CRIMINAL MATTERS

Senator Flynn: Senator Williams asked a question with
regard to the very sad incident at Caughnawauga.
The Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs is most concerned that the situation described yesterday by Senator Williams be fully investigated. To that end, a very prestigious
coroner, Mr. Cyril Delage, has been appointed. A thorough
investigation is also under way by the regional director general
of the department. It is my understanding that the Quebec
Provincial Police are investigating as well.
The minister committed himself in the Commons last week
to personally visit the reserve. He did so yesterday, and to my
knowledge discussed this and many other substantive issues
with the chief.
EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION
REFUGEES FROM INDOCHINA-TEXT OF REPLY PRINTED AS AN
APPENDIX

Senator Flynn: I also have replies to some of the questions
posed by Senator Barrow on October 17, 1979, but as these

year. 1 can assure the honourable senator that the Canadian
government and the Canadian Wheat Board were aware of the
U.S.S.R. requirement. It was logistical, not pricing, difficulties
which precluded further sales at this time. This government is
determined to overcome the existing handling and transportation problems which are a constraint on exports of Canadian
grain and has already announced a series of measures toward
this end.

OFFSHORE~ RESOURCES

Senator de Cotret: 1 have a response here to a question by
Senator Thériault dealing with the government's position
respecting jurisdiction over fisheries.
1 would like to state that the offshore minerai resource issue
and the fisheries issue are quite separate matters. This government is well aware of the fact that the fisheries resource has
important economic and social implications for' Canada's
coastal provinces and that the resource should be mranaged
with a meaningful input from the province.
Given this, however, the position of the federal government
has not changed in terms of jurisdictional power or constitutional responsibility. It is the government's view that there
mnust be a strong federal presence in order to provide effective
management of the Canadian fisheries due to the interprovincial and international factors involved. We are intending to
introduce changes to the existing legislation which would
provide for the delegation of federal responsibilities to thc
provinces when it is apparent that there are programs which
can be better managed at the provincial level.
The interest by the guvernînent in the fisheries has in no
way diminishcd On the contrary. we consider the economnic
development growth potential a priority. We intend, however,
to place an emphasis on consultation and co-operation radier
than confrontation. We believe this can bc accomplished
within the existing jurisdictional framework.

FIRE PROTECTION-REPORT OF DOMINION FIRE COMMISSIONER
PRINTED AS AN APPENDIX

The Hon. the Speaker: Before I call the Orders of the Day I
would inform honourable senators that I have a report arising
from inquiries made a week ago tonight by Senators Molson,
Bosa and Haidasz, and, later, by Senator Bird, respecting the
status of security in the Senate to persons and property, in the
event of a serious fire hazard. The report is in the form of a
reply received by me from the Dominion Fire Commissioner,
who is an officer of the Department of Public Works. This is a
fairly long report, running to about six pages of single-spaced
typing. I leave it to the judgment of the Senate as to whether it
should be tabled, or appended to the Debate of the Senate. In
the meantime, I will summarize it very briefly because some of
the highlights will be of particular interest to honourable
senators.

House of Commons chambers, the corridors, Confederation
Hall, or in the Hall of Honour.
The report goes on to deal with other areas such as the
Peace Tower, the Library of Parliament, the West Block,
Confederation Building, and the East Block.
What is your wish, honourable senators, as to the disposition
of this report?
Senator Molson: Honourable senators, I would ask that this
report to His Honour the Speaker be appended to our proceedings of today. There is sufficient material contained in it that
it would be worthwhile for us to have an opportunity to look at
it. It may even suggest some further questions on our part.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For texi of report, see Appendix "C").

First, we are dependent for our security in this field on the
Ottawa Fire Department, which the Dominion Fire Commissioner says is recognized as "one of the most efficient and
effective fire departments in Canada."
Secondly, he reports that there was a complete fire protection survey made of the buildings, and particularly the Centre
Block, in 1973, and since then many of the recommendations
made at that time have been carried out. For example, in
answer to Senator Bosa's question, there is a sprinkler system
in operation in the basement, and a proposai is before the
Treasury Board to include the sprinklering of the ground floor
of the Centre Block. Incidentally, the cost of that is estimated
to be $745,000.
In respect to the matter of storage space and overcrowding
which was raised by Senator Haidasz, the Dominion Fire
Commissioner says this is a constant problem which is closely
monitored, but that the problem will not be solved completely
until such time as the renovations of the East Block are
complete.
The Fire Commissioner attaches to his letter some of the
fire protection requirements which were found from time to
time, and a statement indicating what is being done to meet
those requirements.
In answer to Senator Bird's question, the Fire Commissioner
states that the order of priorities are (1) life safety, (2)
protection of property, and (3) the achievement and maintenance of present-day building and fire code standards.
To indicate the tremendous costs that will be involved in the
updating of the building, the cost of updating the Peace Tower
alone is estimated at $2,840,000.
A fully supervised fire alarm system was installed throughout this building in 1977-78, along with heat and smoke
detectors. The sprinkler protection system was installed, as I
indicated, in 1973, and will be extended in due course. A water
standpipe and hose system has also been installed, but it is not
planned to provide sprinkler protection in the Senate and

CANADA NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONS BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Walker moved the second reading of Bill S-7,
respecting Canadian non-profit corporations.
He said: Honourable senators, this reminds me of the nun
novitiate who was proceeding to a circus tent when a puddle of
water prevented her progress. A clown came out of the circus
tent, picked her up, carried her across the water and let her
down gently. Just as he was doing so, be whispered in her ear,
"This is vergin' on the ridiculous." I need hardly suggest to
you what I am to talk about tonight. I hate to interrupt the
comedy act, but I have to do my duty with regard to Bill S-7
which is before the house, namely, the Canada Non-Profit
Corporations Bill.
Honourable senators, as you know, this bill has been before
the Senate twice before. It was passed in ail its stages, and
then sent on to the House of Cmmons. On the first occasion,
through no fault of the Commons, time ran out on the bill and
it died on the order paper when Parliament was prorogued. On
the second occasion, the general election stopped the bill's
being passed. Therefore, I shall be bri<f tonight because you
have heard it ail before. The only changes in the bill consist of
a few phrases and clauses for the purposes of clarification.
Definitively, the bill has not changed, although the language
has been improved slightly.
To those members who are new in this chamber, this is
going to be a very short briefing. Bill S-3 was introduced in the
Senate on November 15, 1977, and, as I said, it was passed by
the Senate. Bill S-4 was introduced on October 17, 1978, and
that also was passed. Both were considered by the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce; passed
by the Senate; and later introduced into the House of Commons where, for various reasons, neither of them were proceeded with further.
Bill S-7 is so similar in aIl respects to Bill S-4 that I am
almost inclined to take my seat, but I am told that I should at

with by the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce under the very distinguished chairmanship of
Senator Hayden. We are very much looking forward to his
serving again as chairman of that committee, over which he
has presided now for 26 years.

QUEBEC AND MONTREAL PORT WARDENS ACTS
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Charbonneau moved the second reading of Bill S-6,
to amend an Act to provide for the appointment of a Port
Warden for the Harbour of Quebec and to amend an Act to
amend and consolidate the Acts relating to the office of Port
Warden for the Harbour of Montreal.
[Translation]
He said: Honourable senators, Bill S-6 is a very short piece
of legislation designed to amend very ancient provisions dealing with the duties of the port wardens in both Montreal and
Quebec City. This bill would make it possible to establish fees
for the services of the port wardens of both these cities that
exceed the maximum fees that the act at present permits.
A port warden carries out various duties, including checking
the condition and stowing of goods on board. He may be called
upon, for instance, to survey the damage caused to the goods,
supervise the loading of grain, concentrates, lumber and dangerous commodities, in order to make sure that international
safety measures are complied with and to serve as an arbitrator whenever disputes arise between the various parties
involved in the loading and unloading operations.
Amendments to these acts would eliminate the present
provisions which set a ceiling on the fees for such services in
both ports. The proposals would authorize the Quebec City
and Montreal board of trade councils, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, to establish fees over the maximum
presently allowable.
With the approval of the Governor in Council rates have
been higher on several occasions in the last 20 years. However,
in 1977, when the last application for such an increase was
received in Montreal, the Department of Justice refused to
ratify the new increase until the act was amended. We therefore find ourselves in the situation where the rates in both
ports appear to be ultra vires.
The Montreal Board of Trade states that the office of port
warden is operated at a loss at present and that that will
remain until the rates are increased. Of course, neither port

expects to make a profit. The services are provided for the
benefit of Canadian exporters and are an additional incentive
for buyers of Canadian goods since they are assured that the
goods are loaded under security and supervision and will
normally arrive at destination in good order. Similar services
are offered in other Canadian ports by port wardens employed
by Transport Canada on a cost recovery basis, and the ports of
Montreal and Quebec City only want to be authorized to
charge rates equivalent to those of federal ports. The International Marine Transport Association as well as Canadian
exporters have agreed to comply with a reasonable rate for a
service which today is internationally recognized as an integral
part of the customer service provided by Canada to its commercial partners.
Should the ports see their request rejected, then both cities
would be forced to subsidize a service which in every other
Canadian port is provided on a cost recovery basis by the
federal government.
Obviously, this puts these two ports at a disadvantage,
especially when one considers that those costs are for the most
part collected from foreign ship owners.
Although Quebec and Montreal operate their port warden
service independently, both acts provide that higher rates must
be approved by the Governor in Council.
So the ultimate aim is to establish for both ports rates quite
similar to the rate structure applied by the port wardens of
Transport Canada, as provided under the Canada Shipping
Act.
Less important is the proposal to change the name of both
corporations which is made necessary by the fact that, first,
the Montreal Act of 1882 inadvertently used the term "Chambre de Commerce" instead of "Bureau de Commerce", the
second expression being the name used when the Montreal
Board of Trade was incorporated in 1842; and secondly, the
Quebec organization changed its name by Letters Patent in
1971.
In concluding, I should like to remind all honourable senators that the services provided by the port wardens to Canadians exporters and to the marine industry in general, throughout Canada, have been for decades and are still excellent. In
order that that level of service be maintained in Quebec and
Montreal and to standardize the cost of those services across
the country, I urge honourable senators to support the proposed amendments contained in Bill S-6 which is now before
the Senate.

On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.

SENATE DEBATES
CANADA-FRANCE TRADE AGREEMENT ACT, 1933
SUJPPLEMENTARY CANADA-FRANCE TRADE
AGREEMENT ACT, 1935
BILL TO REPLAI

-SECOND READING- DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator de Cotret moved the second reading of Bill S-2, to
repeal the Canada-France Trade Agreement Act, 1933 and
the Supplementary Canada-France Trade Agreement Act,
1935.
He said: Honourable senators, in introducing Bill S-2, I will
keep my comments very brief. This is an act to repeal the
Canada-France Trade Agreement Acts of 1933 and 1935.
As honourable senators no doubt know, Canadian companies have been producing a product called "Canadian champagne" and so labelling and selling it in Canada for a number
of years. Under Article XI of the Canada-France Trade
Agreement, the French took Canadian producers to court in
Quebec and were successful in preventing them from continuing to sell their product in that province. At this time a similar
court case is pending in Ontario.
It has not been possible to work out an accommodation with
the French that would allow our producers to continue to sell
"Canadian champagne" on the domestic market even though
other countries can label their product "champagne" and
export it to Canada. I particularly refer to Australia and the
United States. This, in our view, created an inequitable situation that had to be corrected.
This bill is in no way an impediment to the protection of the
Canadian consumer. The question of the protection of consumers is one for the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act. In
addition, the consumer and public interest in protecting appellations of origin in Canada is one that could appropriately be
considered in any future revision of the Trade Marks Act.
Notice of our intention to abrogate bilateral agreements with
France was given some time ago. This bill is procedural in
nature and its effect is to implement in Canadian law the
decision taken in December 1977 to terminate the CanadaFrance Trade Agreements Acts of 1933 and 1935.
Senator Godfrey: May I ask the honourable senator a
question? Was there anything else in this act? Does this
merely cover the question of appellations of origin? Is there
anything of advantage to Canada in the act as a quid pro quo
that we are giving up when this act is repealed?
* (2150)

Senator de Cotret: I do not believe that Canada is losing any
advantage, or that any negative effects would follow as a result
of the repeal of the act.
The French are still somewhat upset over this action, but we
believe, through the consultative process that has been going
on, that they will understand Canada's position in this matter.
We certainly cannot foresee any adverse effects as a result of
the repeal of the agreements in terms of our trade with France.
On motion of Senator Godfrey, debate adjourned.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN

REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 25, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Bielish,
seconded by Senator Charbonneau, for an Address in reply
thereto.
Senator Graham: Honourable senators, I shall attempt to be
not too long, having regard for the hour, but in view of the
number of bills that the government obviously has to consider
tomorrow and the next day, and in view of the fact that we do
not have a schedule of those bills, I would beg ]cave to proceed
this evening.
I wish to commence my remarks by taking special notice of
the presence in the Chair of the new Speaker. Senator Grosart
has distinguished himself in various fields of endeavour, but
most of ail in this chamber where, on many occasions, he was
the articulate conscience of deliberations here and in the
standing committees, of which he was such a valued member.
[Translation]
His predecessor, Senator Lapointe, deserves ail our congratulations and appreciation for the manner in which she
discharged her duties. She enhanced the good name of the
Senate on several occasions whether she led or received delegates involved in aIl major fields of international affairs.
Since the opening of this Thirty-first Parliament, we have
been privileged to have three ministers of the Crown sitting in
this house.
I wish to congratulate Senator Flynn in particular since he
finally managed to get over to the other side of this house. I
am confident that his ability and his great sense of humor will
lighten the burden of his heavy responsibilities.
We also want to welcome his colleagues in the Cabinet,
Senator Asselin and Senator de Cotret who will certainly
enhance the significance and the good repute of this house.
[English]
I am also pleased to sec that Senator Perrault continues to
lead the Liberal Party in the Senate. This chamber, the west
and, indeed, aIl the regions of Canada, have no greater champion than Senator Perrault.
Speaking of regions, I am fully cognizant of the valuable
additions to the chamber that have been made from across the
country, and I welcome ail new honourable senators. I am sure
I will be forgiven if I make special mention of our new
colleagues from Nova Scotia, Senator Muir and Senator
Donahoe. There is a third native from our province, who for
various reasons, now is a representative from Ontario. I refer,
of course, to another personal friend of long standing, Senator
Murray. While Senator Murray constitutionally represents
Ontario, I am sure that he will join with others in protesting
with ail the vigour at his command some of the unfortunate
decisions already inflicted on our native province by an il]advised new federal government.

October 30, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, it is not my intention to dwell heavily
on the Speech from the Throne-there is not much to even
lean on, let alone dwell-but I do want to take this opportunity
to express my views on some important issues affecting my
part of Canada, issues which, in the broad sense, must clearly
be considered of national importance.
As I have said on another occasion, there are few countries
with a more diversified and complex system of economic
decision-making than Canada, where the responsibilities of
government are divided between federal, provincial and municipal jurisdictions, where bigness and the very nature of our
geography, as well as the distribution of our resources and our
population, make things even more difficult to manage.
Another immutable economic truth is the inescapable "time
lag" between developments elsewhere in Canada and their
impact on the Atlantic provinces. As a result, when economic
recovery begins elsewhere, some time will elapse before beneficial effects are felt in the Atlantic provinces.
Happily, a sometimes exception to this rule can be found in
indigenous resource industries such as coal or the fishery.
However, by and large, we cannot expect a rapid step-up in
economic activity if normal economic forces are allowed to
operate alone.
A case can and has been made, therefore, for special
government measures as a form of pump-priming. This is
especially true, since the Atlantic provinces have a real contribution to make in terms of energy, and also because the
200-mile limit has given a new economic relevance to the
fishery and related industries, such as boat building.
Examination of these sectors serves to emphasize that there
is an important difference between non-productive government
expenditures, in the economic sense, and those designed to
speed up good initiatives of lasting economic benefit.
It is a matter of record that we do experience unnecessary
delays because of red tape, interdepartmental, federal-provincial and interprovincial rivalries. The interface between various departments of government at all levels needs careful
analysis. Some central co-ordination is clearly necessary over
all programs and expenditures to avoid duplication and to
maximize effectiveness. In addition, there is the uncertain and
inconsistent state of the relationship between the public and
private sectors. Too often, there is a seeming absence of the
will, the drive, the determination to move ahead quickly and
decisively with some projects of enormous potential.
What may be needed in government at all levels is a number
of action-oriented task forces with the power to bring matters
to a head and to force early decisions on a priority basis, when
and where they are needed most in our country. Obvious
examples can be found in the need for an early and positive
decision in respect of the financing of a new coal mine at
Donkin, Cape Breton. I am given to understand that all of the
relevant studies have been completed, and it remains for those
documents to be examined for final decision-making by the
appropriate authorities here in Ottawa.

* (2200)

A new mine at Donkin would provide several hundred
much-needed immediate jobs in construction and, upon completion, something in the order of 1,150 new permanent jobs,
producing in the first phase at the rate of 2.3 million tons of
coal per annum, and upwards of 1,500 new jobs in the second
phase, producing at the rate of some 3.4 million tons each
year.
I am pleased to report that progress is being made in the
development of the New Prince mine on the north side of
industrial Cape Breton. Within the next month, over 300
people will be employed at that mine and, should the geology
and quality of coal live up to expectations, the employment
figure could reach as high as 700 by 1983-84. Here, too, I am
confident that federal support will prove to be beneficial and
worthwhile. These numbers in terms of jobs, honourable senators, may seem low in comparison to some other areas of
Canada; but they are extremely important to the part of
Canada I come from.
Because of the world energy crisis, nowhere is it more
important to reduce our dependence upon oil than it is in Nova
Scotia, and perhaps Prince Edward Island. Recognizing this
fact, the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia entered
into a joint funding venture to carry out a major offshore
drilling program in the Sydney coal basin. As a result, new
massive reserves of coal were delineated, ensuring a future for
the industry for many years to come.
The scale of the coal challenge is as immense as the
potential benefits. Above all, it is a challenge to our ability as
governments, industry and labour to anticipate and collaborate. Unless early commitments are made by all sectors of the
economy, sufficient quantities of coal will not be produced in
time to meet our energy needs. In the meantime, each delay
brings with it the inevitable escalation in construction costs. It
should be noted that there is probably no greater challenge to
industry and to government-and, indeed, to our colleges and
universities-than to solve the large technical problems related
to the extraction, utilization, air pollution and maximum efficiency of our coal resources.
Honourable senators, closely related to coal in the Cape
Breton economy and, as a matter of fact, in the economy of all
of Nova Scotia, is its industrial twin, steel. It is a matter of
record that all political parties have supported the concept of
providing the necessary support for this vital cornerstone of
economic survival in industrial Cape Breton. The plain fact is
that, in my judgment, without a steel industry in Sydney, the
whole of eastern Nova Scotia will face grave, if not irreparable, economic damage.
Earlier in the year the previous government committed some
$50 million in federal funds to aid the development program at
Sysco. i believe that even greater assistance will be required.
The burden is such that the Province of Nova Scotia cannot
carry this load by itself. To date, the new government bas
made available some $7.2 million of the $50 million committed
to the province. While we recognize that the prime responsibility rests with Nova Scotia, it is important to understand that

SENATE DEBATES
the province cannot carry the burden alone and that substantiai help will be rcquired f'rom the Governrnent of Canada.
Honourable senators, there has been both public and private
speculation over the last year in respect of the possibility of
dcseloping nexw coking-coal operations in Cape Breton which
could cosi in the vicinity of $300 million ta $400 million.
Direct emiployrnent in such a facility has been estimated at
200.
To supply such an operation, tl is ta be presumied that
existing mines will have to be expanded or new mines developed. However, while 1 recogni7e that there is a relationship, 1
would caution those in authority that the first priority wsben tl
cornes ta funding is, and must continue ta be, coal and steel.
The importance of proper developmnent in these two industries
must not be obscured or undermined by the possibility of'
developing large seule coking facilities aimed primarily at the
expart market, no matter how commendable or worthwhile
this venture may be.

another topie, honouruble senators. last August the new
government announced the cancellation of decentralîiation
programs in varlous parts of Canada. While ail of these
cancellations were regrettable in the extreme, 1 want to make
specifie mention of the projeets ,vhich originallv cngendered
such high hopes in two areas of eastern Nova Scot ia- na mely,
Sydney and Antigonish. In the first instance, 350 new jobs
were involved arnd, in the second, close to 100.
While these may sound like snmall numibers ta those of you
svho corne from the heavily industriali7cd areas of Canada, 1
repeat that, in mny part of the country, they arc vcry significant. I believe those cancellations were reprelhensible and
nsensitive. They represented political partisanship and retribution of the worst kind. It is a matier of' record that projeets
were neyer held back by the previous government because of
the political stripe of the constituency member of Parliamient.
whether tl was in Pictou. Halifax, Sydney, or anvwhere else in
this great country.
The aim of the decentralization prograni was not just ta
provide jobs and broaden the economnie and tax base in areas
of need and thereby help elimninate regional econoiei disparity. but also ta bring the national govcrnment dloser ta the
people in the various regions of the country. Surely in a
country the suze of Canada, whcre the hcalth of' the nation is
dependent on the health of ail its regians, every fair-rninded
citizen would recognize that as a commendable and morthwhile objective.
We are fortunate ta live in a country where our politicul
beliefs and differences are settlcd periodically by the ballot. In
the last ledieral general clection, the Progressive Conservative
Party sought and won a mandate ta govern. 7 hat party now
has a responsibility ta serve ail of the people equally and fairly,
no matter haw they voted or wherc thcy may live. One of the
sources of~ aur dif'ficultý in this case may be the faci that we
have a new system of cabinet ranking in Canada and, as a
cansequence. varying degrees of influence.

1 can recaîl the days when sucb autstanding Canadians as J.
L. Ilsley. Angus M4acDonald, Robert Winters, George Nowlan
and, more recently, Allan MacEachen represented Nova
Scotia at the federal cabinet table. They each spoke with as
rnuch authority as any other cabinet minister. But today aur
federal cabinet representutive, the Honourable Elmer
MaclKay, a respected Nova Scotian, is in the so-called outer
cabinet. He is on the second team. He is not there when the
big decisions are made. Otberwise. 1 am sure that. in the
bard-fought and hard-won traditions of people like Nowlan
and NiacEachen, be would not for anc minute allow Sinclair
Stevens ta pull the rug out from under the employ ment hopes
of his neighbouring county of Antigonish, or the hard-pressed
high unemploymient areas of industrial Cape Breton.
Mr. MacKay bears a double responsibility in this respect.
He is not only Nova Scotia's cabinet representative. but alsa
the Minister of' Regionul Ecanomie Expansion. He is the
minister of a departnment created for the very purpose aI
helping ta create jobs and ta broaden and strengthen the
econoiei base of the variaus regians of Canada. Sa, we ail
share in the embarrassrnent that mnust have been Mir. MacKay's when the President of the Treasury Board used bis

which desperately necds the help and understanding of thase
who contraI the ecanamic levers of aur country.

As a Nova Scotian 1 feel aggrievcd that we are being
deliberately shart-cbanged, that we are being treated as
second-class citilens with respect ta the place of influence
given ta aur cabinet representutives. 1 am sure thut the vast
majarity of Ne,, Brunswickers and Manitobans feel likewise,
because their cabinet representatives alsa failed ta make it ta

SENATE DEBATES

We must get it firmly fixed in our minds that all of the
trappings of our social, religious, political and industrial
systems exist for the sole purpose of allowing life to be as
tolerable and civilized as possible for the individual and
the family. Only if we start from here, are we likely to get
our directions right.
I am also reminded of a further quotation which reads as
follows:
The preservation of a democratic society of high ideal, is
entirely dependent upon the willingness of good people to
give of themselves to a cause beyond themselves. And
those who will do so, when all about them lies the pursuit
of self-interest, may know that but for them, democracy
could not survive.
Honourable senators, the concept of equal human worth still
has a long way to go in its realization. And in our attempts to
assist in achieving that realization, we must first understand
that we are here to serve others. That service must be rendered
justly and fairly for every person in every part of Canada.
Senator Cottreau: Honourable senators, I should like to
begin by associating myself with all the good wishes that have
been conveyed to our new Speaker on his appointment, to the
Leader of the Government in the Senate, to the new senators
who have joined us and also to the mover and seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Three Nova Scotia senators have already participated in this
debate, including my learned colleague from the highlands of
Cape Breton who has just spoken, and they have very ably
enlightened this chamber as to the problems which confront
our small but mighty province. So, lest my part in the debate
tends to become redundant, I shall endeavour to confine my
remarks to matters which my predecessors from Nova Scotia
have not touched upon, or if so very slightly.
My home area which constitutes the south-western tip of
Nova Scotia lies within the federal constituency of South West
Nova. This comprises a very large territory including the three
counties of Yarmouth, Digby and Annapolis. My purpose in
giving this brief background summary of my home area is so
that I can relate it in some manner with some of the proposals
which were advanced in the Speech from the Throne.
Honourable senators, the diversities in all aspects of Canadian life is one of its richest assets, and for this reason I maintain
that my home area shares in the richness of Canada. One of
the aspects in which it differs greatly from the majority of the
other regions is that its economy is almost completely dependent on the local fishing industry. Now, there is something in
the Speech from the Throne which, if implemented, will
definitely bring to my area a great measure of satisfaction. I
refer to that part where it is stated that a five-part strategy
will be implemented to build on the economic potential of
Canada. I am particularly interested in the fourth part, from
which 1 quote, as follows:
Fourth, my Government will ask you to support programs
which build upon the strengths of the regions of Canada.

Legislation will be placed before you to strengthen the
mandate of the Department of Regional Economic
Expansion. You will be asked to consider a White Paper
on future development of our fisheries resources, prepared
in consultation with fishermen, the fishing industry and
the provinces.
I hope I am not overly optimistic as to the true meaning of
these words, but I must say that I am encouraged by them as I
am sure are all others who are associated with the fishery
resource. It is not that this proposal will necessarily bring a
new dimension to the fishing industry, but it does give me hope
that the new government will carry on with the programs
initiated by the previous administration, and, more importantly, it will endeavour to develop the fishing industry, which
means that my area can be favourably affected.
Let me explain briefly why this is so significantly important
to the province of Nova Scotia in general, and to my home
area in particular.
Fishing has always played a significant role in the history of
my province. Even in the days of the first explorers, it was
noticed that the cod seerned to be in boundless supply around
our shores, and not very many years after-in fact, we are told
it was in 1577-the coast of Newfoundland, Cape Breton and
Labrador abounded with men in some 315 ships fishing for the
precious cod. This prized fish retained its popularity for the
next two centuries, and gave rise to a lucrative trade between
Canada, Europe and the West Indies.
Coming back to my province, fishing developed substantially, and the 1880s were the peak years of what was then known
as the schooner fleet. We still have in Nova Scotia a replica of
one of the schooners, the Bluenose, which is symbolic of our
history. Later on, with the advance of technology, schooners
gave way to motorized vessels in the 1930s and then, later on
still, the pattern changed in the sixties to stern trawlers, which,
to this day, fish the offshore banks for ground-fish and scallops. You will recall that in order to protect and nurture the
fish stock Canada imposed, as has already been mentioned by
Senator Graham, a 200-mile limit around its shores in 1977.
a

(2220)

Honourable senators, what I am giving you in a brief
manner are statistics taken from the Nova Scotia fisheries
department. These will give you an idea of the importance that
this resource has for my province.
The commercial fishing industry employs 15,000 people. Of
these, 10,460 are associated with primary operations and 4,450
are employed in fish processing. There are 9,000 vessels
engaged in fishery, the value of which amounts to $76 million.
Investment in fishing gear is estimated at $10 million.
The 1977 figures, which are the latest I have for the purpose
of these remarks, indicate that fish landings for Nova Scotia
were valued at almost $110 million in 1977. The five most
valuable species landed were scallops, lobsters, cod, herring
and redfish.
So much for the description of our fishery at the provincial
level. I corne now to my own home area which is situated at

SENATE DEBATES
the southwestern tip and which fits very well in the setting I
have just described. Our climate and our geography arc such
as to favour ideal fishing conditions. Our forestry resource is
more than adequate to supply the necessary material for a
healthy boatbuilding industry as well as for making lobster
traps and other fishing equipment. Our coastal environment, at
least up to now, has been and is properly suited for the growth
and reproduction of lobsters, the species which constitutes the
major portion of our fishery.
Owing to the makeup of our fishing grounds, a pattern has
developed according to which fishermen segregate themselves
into two classes: one being the offshore fishermen whose
interests lie in ground-fish and/or scallops and who generally
fish away from shore in large boats; the other class being
comprised of those fishermen who prefer to fish within a short
distance offshore in small boats measuring between 35 feet
and 50 feet and whose fishery is mainly directed towards the
lobster fishery.
I have given you in summary form the structure of the
fishing industry in my home area. This industry brings in
something like $100 million annually to my province, not to
mention the value of its related industries, and it brings in
something like $40 million in my own area. Because of its
tremendous impact on the local economy, I feel it is imperative
that it be carefully and wisely managed by those who are
closely associated with it, in close co-operation with the government. According to the Nova Seotia Department of Fisheries, a three-fold increase in the Nova Seotia catch is possible in
the next ten years. This is, of course, as a result of the
200-mile limit.
I therefore urge the government to develop its programs
with respect to the fishing industry without delay, particularly
as they affect my region of southwestern Nova Scotia.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I wanted to concentrate on the subject
of fisheries because the other subjects relating to my province
have pretty well been dealt with. But I would not want to lcave
you under the impression that everyone in my part of the
country is fishing. Of course not. Like everywhere else, there
are all sorts of occupations enabling people to earn their living.
I also wanted to say that I have in my area one of the
concentrations of Acadians in Nova Scotia. There are others in
the Cape Breton arca. In my area, the ridings of Digby and
Yarmouth, the Acadian people total 17,500, which is 42 per
cent of the people in the area.
So we have here a situation where a minority group makes
up a rather high proportion of the people in an area although
at the provincial level those same Acadians account for only 10
per cent of the population.
The Acadians of Nova Scotia have been able to adapt to
local conditions and it must be said that they always lived in
harmony with their English-speaking neighbours without for
that matter feeling like strangers. There might be a lesson
there for the country in this period of crisis where the issue of
Canadian unity is at stake.
[Senator Cottreau I

October 30, 1979

It is truc that many people among the Acadians no longer
speak their mother tongue and say they are assimilated to the
English culture. It is true also that many of them seem to
think, for all practical purposes, that French groups in Nova
Scotia are bound to disappear. I for one do not accept such
suppositions.
It is absolutely inevitable that the Acadian culture be affected by its environment and that in certain cases it should
disappear. On the other hand, we must admire the tenacity
that characterizes Acadians who have always worked for the
safeguard of their customs and traditions that are found
everywhere they live today.
In my area, Acadians have always been recognized and
respected for their ambition, their contribution to the welfare
of society and the welfare of the regional economy.
I once belonged to one of their social clubs whose motto was
"Live and Let Live." That motto reflects exactly the attitude
Acadians have towards their neighbours. They only want to
work for the good of their country. However, it must be said
that they must continuously be on their guard against anything
that might be detrimental to them. That is why they have
leaders and spokesmen who often speak on issues that have to
do with their welfare. Although generally speaking local
authorities are sympathetic to them, there are small incidents
that happen here and there where there is room for
improvement.
In the villages, for example,-and here I am only giving a
passing example-in the villages that are basically French you
find today that al road signs, names of lakes and rivers are
always in English, although at first and even today, Francophones usually refer to those things by their French names.
However, it is normal to see French signs in those French
places, as happens everywhere.

Honourable senators, because of the late hour, I shall not
prolong my speech. May I say in closing that these are perhaps
minor details which do not sap the foundation of good relationship. However, in human relations a certain amount of give
and take is always conducive to peaceful understanding between groups of people of different ethnic background. I
believe the possibility exists that those minor differences will
be ironed out to everyone's satisfaction.
Motion agreed to, and the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne adopted.
On motion of Senator Roblin, ordered that the Address be
engrossed and presented to His Excellency the Governor General by the Honourable the Speaker.
NORTHERN PIPELINE
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL SENATE COMMITTEE

Senator Oison, pursuant to notice of Wednesday, October
10, 1979, moved:
That a special committee of the Senate be appointed

October 30, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

(1) to inquire into any matter relating to the planning
and construction of the pipeline for the transmission of
natural gas from Alaska and Northern Canada
described in An Act to establish the Northern Pipeline
Agency, to facilitate the planning and construction of a
pipeline for the transmission of natural gas from
Alaska and Northern Canada and to give effect to an
Agreement between Canada and the United States of
America on principles applicable to such a pipeline
and to amend certain Acts in relation thereto, Chapter
20, Statutes of Canada 1977-78.
(2) to consider, in particular, all reports, orders, agreements, regulations, directions, recommendations and
approvals referred to in the said Act, and
(3) to report to the Senate thereon at least once in each
session of Parliament during the period of the planning
and construction of the pipeline;
That the Committee have power to send for persons,
papers and records, to examine witnesses, to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as may be ordered
by the Committee and to adjourn from place to place in
Canada;and
That the papers and evidence received and taken on the
subject in the Third and Fourth Sessions of the Thirtieth
Parliament be referred to the Committee.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like to make a brief
speech to explain that the wording of the motion relating to
the terms of reference of the proposed committee is the same
as that of the motion that was adopted during the last session.
Indeed, it is very similar to the one that was adopted in an
earlier session.
Honourable senators will note that the motion refers to any
matter relating to the planning and construction of this pipe-

line. It is fair to say that there was an agreement that the
Senate would re-establish the committee in each session until
the construction was completed and the pipeline was
operational.
Some discussions have been held with respect to amending
the terms of reference but they are incomplete. The committee
may consider such matters as other applications that are now
before the National Energy Board. To name one or two, there
is the Polar Gas proposai and also the extension of the gas
pipeline from Montreal east into eastern Quebec and the
maritimes-sometimes called the Q and M. However, I do not
wish to identify that specifically because there is more than
one proposai and, I believe, more than one formal application.
We believe that the committee is sufficiently competent to
look into those matters. As I have said, the discussions have
not been completed and we are prepared to proceed with the
identical wording that was used in the last session.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, Senator Olson did
give me notice that he intended to procced with his motion
tonight, and I acknowledge that fact.
We do not oppose the adoption of the motion now before the
Senate, for the reasons that the honourable senator has stated-it represents a continuation of what we have already been
doing, and we believe that the matter should be completed.
I do confirm that at the present time discussions with
respect to any expansion of the activities of this committee
have not reached a point of maturity-although I dare say
that further discussions will take place in the future.
We are prepared to accept the motion and will be glad to see
it adopted this evening.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION
REFUGEES FROM INDOCHINA-- REPLY TO QUESTION OCTOBER 17,

With respect to the so-called Vietnamese or Indochinese
Boat People:
1. Where, in fact, do these people come from?
The Indochinese refugees come from Vietnam, Laos and
Kampuchea.
2. Under what conditions are they being admitted to Canada?
These people are admitted to Canada under the Indochinese
Designated Class Regulation approved by Governor in Council
on December 7, 1978 effective from January 1, 1979 to
January 1, 1981. This Regulation, which has the effect of
designating them as refugees, provides for the admission of
people who have fled their homes because of hardship or
danger, and are seeking permanent resettlement in Canada.
3. Do they have to pay ail or part of their passage or fare, and
is it by air or boat by which they arrive?
All the refugees from Indochina come by air. They are all
given interest-free Assisted Passage Loans for their transportation to final destinations in Canada. As of January 1, 1979 the
repayable amount has been set at $750 for each adult refugee,
$375 for children between the ages of 2 and 12 years, and $75
for children under 2. Travel costs above these amounts are met
by the Federal Government. These loans are repaid over an
extended period of time, once the refugees are self-sufficient.
4. Do they have to be sponsored by individuals or groups and,
if so, how long does such sponsorship continue?
The refugees may be either assisted by the Federal Government or sponsored by legally incorporated organizations or
groups of at least five people, all of whom are over 18 years of
age and are Canadian citizens or permanent residents. There
are two major types of group sponsorship in the private sector:
a) national organizations who have signed a formai agreement on behalf of their constituent groups, and
b) one for local groups or organizations who enter into
individual sponsorships.
Sponsors must accept the commitment to assist for a period
of up to one year.

979, BY SENATOR BARROW

5. Does it mean the payment of money or is there personal
involvement required?
The commitment made by the sponsor groups requires
material or monetary assistance such as the provision of initial
food, clothing and accommodation. It also requires personal
involvement such as meeting them upon arrivai, and helping
them adjust initially to life in Canada and to find employment.
6. What facilities does the federal government provide for
these people and their families to become assimilated into
the community and to learn one or both of our two official
languages?
Language training is provided through the Canada Employment Centers, for those refugees intending to work, and by the
Department of the Secretary of State in other cases. The
provincial school systems and community organizations provide other language training facilities.
The federal government also provides to non-sponsored
refugees:
1. accommodation,
2. food and clothing, and
3. assistance in finding employment.
7. Is there a commitment from the provincial governments
and, if so, what are the commitments with respect to
finances, facilities and numbers by individual provinces'?
All provincial governments have been consulted with regard
to the federal government's undertaking to accept 50,000
refugees by the end of 1980, and have concurred with this
program.
Quebec is the only province which has made a specific
numerical commitment and will accept 10,000 refugees (of
those sponsored by the government) in that time.
All provinces are actively participating with finances and
facilities in the resettlement of these unfortunate people,
through their ongoing social and educational programs.
8. What provision is made for medical and security checks
with respect to these people?
A full medical examination of each refugee is conducted by
physicians designated by Health and Welfare Canada, before
these people leave for Canada. The refugees are also given a

medical inspection on arrival in Canada by doctors from the
Department of National Defence and arrangements for treatment are if required.
Thorough background security checks are conducted on all
refugees in accordance with normal immigration procedures.
9. Are the Boat People covered by the Citizenship Act and
Immigration Act with respect to becoming Canadian citizens, with full rights and privileges to bring relatives into
this country and, if so, what are those rights and, if not,
whercin do they differ?

The Indochinese refugees are landed as new immigrants on
arrival in Canada and are entitled both to ail rights and
privileges under the Immigration Act and Regulations, and to
apply after three years residence to become citizens under the
Citizenship Act.

Once these individuals are landed, they have the same rights
as other immigrants to sponsor their relatives into Canada
under the Immigration Act and Regulations.

NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION
EXPANSION OF CANADA'S ROLE-REPLY TO QUESTION OF SENATOR HAIDASZ OF OCTOBER 23, 1979

In response to the honourable senator's question of October
23, 1979, I have the honour to refer to the speech made by the
Prime Minister to the North Atlantic Assembly on October
26, 1979, wherein the Prime Minister reiterated Canada's full
commitment to the NATO Alliance. In particular, the Prime
Minister stated that Canada will meet its spending commitments to the Alliance until 1984. I also should point out to the
honourable senator this country's commitment to the NATO
Alliance in a message to NATO Secretary General Luns.
1 would also refer the honourable senator to the speech
made by the Minister of National Defence to the political
committee of the North Atlantic Assembly on October 24,
1979, regarding Canada's commitments to the Alliance. On
that occasion the Minister indicated that in addition to continuing the major re-equipment programmes for the Canadian
Forces already underway, the government also has plans to
make modest increases to the strength of our Armed Forces.

The Minister of National Defence also told the North
Atlantic Assembly that Canada has long recognized that in
facing a nuclear armed opponent, NATO cannot rely on
conventional forces alone for credible deterrence. For this
reason, Canada subscribes to NATO's strategy of flexible
response and forward defence based on the triad of military
forces designed to provide the Alliance with a capacity to
respond in an appropriate manner should aggression occur.
The Minister indicated that Canada also recognizes that there
is a need to modernize the long range element of NATO's
theatre nuclear forces in order to close the gap in the range of
available NATO responses to the Warsaw Pact threat brought
on by the general improvement of Soviet theatre nuclear force
systems and in particular by the deployment of the SS20
missile and the Backfire bomber. The question of an Alliance
consensus on theatre nuclear force modernization will of course
await the results of the meeting of NATO Ministers in
December.

PAR LIAMENT BUILDINGS
FIRE PROTECTION-REPORT OF DOMINION FIRE COMMISSIONER

1979-10-29
The Honourable Allister Grosart
Speaker of the Senate
The Senate
Parliament Buildings
Ottawa, Ontario
Dear Senator Grosart:
Re: Fire Protection Measures
Parliamentary Buildings
Ottawa, Ontario
In response to questions raised in the Senate regarding fire
protection of the buildings on Parliament Hill, the following
information is forwarded for your consideration.
Firefighting services for all federal properties in the City of
Ottawa is provided by the Ottawa Fire Department as part of
the Municipal Grant paid in lieu of taxes. This firefighting
force is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective
fire departments in Canada, and is supported in a major
conflagration by units of surrounding municipalities by way of
a Mutual Aid Agreement.
A complete fire protection survey of the buildings on Parliament Hill was conducted by engineers and technical officers
on staff of the Dominion Fire Commissioner in 1973, and
regular inspections are carried out by a fire inspector from the
National Capital Regional office of the Dominion Fire Commissioner. Sprinkler systems have been installed in the basement areas of the Centre Block, Langevin Block, and Confederation Building. Total sprinkler protection has been approved
and is being installed throughout the East Block. "Designs and
specifications have been prepared for a complete sprinkler
installation in the remainder of the Centre Block, and this
project is programmed along with other improvements to this
building. Phase I of this program which includes sprinklering
of the ground floor, and separation of vertical openings, at an
estimated cost of $745,000 has been prepared and is being
processed for Treasury Board approval."
The lack of storage space and overcrowding is a constant
problem which is closely monitored, but the problem will not
80072-15

be resolved completely until such time as the East Block
renovations are completed, and other suitable space is made
available to both the Senate and the House of Commons.
Attached is a list of fire protection requirements implemented over the past four years, and of projects programmed for
further improverment of fire protection measures in the future.
Within financial constraints all requirements were implemented by priorities in order of life safety, protection of property,
and present day building and fire code standards. For example,
a Treasury Board submission for updating the Peace Tower at
a cost of $2,840,000 bas also been prepared for Treasury
Board approval.
Trusting this information adequately answers the questions
raised. We are, of course, prepared to amplify or clarify our
responses if you so desire.
Yours sincerely,
G.A. Hope
Dominion Fire Commissioner
Attach.

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
THE ECONOMY
GOVERNMENT POLICY

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and the
Minister of Finance. I should like to ask the leader a question
with respect to the government's economic policy.
During the election campaign, the leader will recall, his
leader, now the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, stated
that Mr. Trudeau was wrong when he suggested that, in view
of the world economic situation, Canadians might have to
lower certain economic expectations. Yesterday the Honourable Minister of Finance, a colleague of the Minister of
Justice, stated, and I quote:
Canadians will have to lower economic expectations perhaps for several years to help the government keep the
inflation down.
There is some confusion in the country today, Mr. Leader,
and the questions are: Will the minister inform the Senate
whether the Right Honourable Joe Clark was wrong and
misguided in May and that there has been another agonizing
policy flip-flop by his government, or is the Minister of
Finance misguided and in fundamental disagreement with his
leader? Finally, in the minister's view, is the Minister of
Finance wrong today? I appeal to the Leader of the Government to assist us along the proper path of thinking here and
end the confusion.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, the Leader of the
Opposition has given a rather short speech today. He usually
speaks much longer than that. He has put questions before the
Senate which, I suggest, he should put as a Notice of Inquiry
at the first opportunity. We could then have a full debate on
the subject.
Senator Perrault: It should not require a Notice of Inquiry
or a special Senate debate for the Leader of the Government
to tell us whether in his view the Prime Minister of this
country, supported by his cabinet colleagues, believes that we
should look forward to the future with positive expectations or
whether we should dampen our expectations. Surely these are
some of the simplest and most fundamental questions that
could be directed toward any government.

Senator Flynn: We are able to look to the future with great
optimism, not worrying too much about the comments made
by the Leader of the Opposition. I should not have to tell him
that there is a difference between a debate and a question.
Senator Perrault: Then I take it from the minister's
response that in his view the Minister of Finance is wrong, for
he has suggested that we should look forward confidently to
the future, that we should not reduce our expectations. Is that
the reply?
Senator Flynn: The reply is that the questions of the Leader
of the Opposition would require a full debate in order to have
the two texts placed in their proper context. Possibly that is
one thing that does not appeal to the Leader of the Opposition.
I suggest to him that his questions warrant a good debate,
and I also suggest that the way to deal with problems like that
is to place a Notice of Inquiry on the order paper and then
proceed with it.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I suggest that the
Leader of the Government's circunlocution and obfuscation
hardly advances the total of human knowledge on this particular subject. I do not wish to be unfair, but it seems to me that
the leader is attempting to evade the question.
ENERGY
PRICE OF DOMESTIC OIL-STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF
ALBERTA-- GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may 1 pose another
question to the Leader of the Government? There are many
premiers in Canada who do not feel serene about the future of
their provinces and this country as a result of certain statements attributed to the Premier of Alberta. The Honourable
John Buchanan of Nova Scotia stated last night-and many
senators heard this on national television-that "if, suddenly,
the cost of oil in Nova Scotia went to the world level, or the
Chicago level, which is at present below the world level, it
would be absolutely disastrous in any economic or social
sense.
This is a premier who obviously feels that his province may
well be asked to reduce its expectations. My question is: Has
the minister had an opportunity, even at this late date, to study
the text of the speech made over two days ago in Vancouver by
the Premier of Alberta? Have members of the cabinet discussed the contents of that speech, and is the government of
this country prepared to take the necessary action, such as use
of the declaratory power, in order to assure that Mr. Buchanan's concerns and the conceris of other Canadians can be
allayed?

October 31, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Flynn: The more the Leader of the Opposition
speaks, the more I am convinced that he should seek a full
debate on this matter in the Senate. It is not by questions and
answers that he will find solutions to the problems to which he
refers. In any event, 1 have not seen the text of Premier
Lougheed's speech. I do not even know if there was a text. I
heard part of the speech on television, and it seemed to me that
the premier was speaking without a text.
But perhaps my honourable friend, who seems to have a pile
of newspaper clippings and other information, would yield to
my advice and give notice of an inquiry so that we could
debate the matter of his not expecting an improvement in our
standard of living at this time. The present and the future are
two separate things, of course. In any event, I suggest that if I
were to reply to all the questions that you have put and deal
with the general problems you have underlined, it would take a
very long time. Why don't you give notice of an inquiry and
then make a long, long speech? With your imagination you
could speak for two hours.

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I certainly am not; but
I also know that the Prime Minister said some time ago that in
arriving at a solution to this dispute he would use neither the
declaratory power nor the Petroleum Administration Act.
Therefore, I am curious as to what basis they are going to use
in the absence of a negotiated settlement.

Senator Oison: I wonder if the Honourable the Leader of
the Government in the Senate would answer a very simple
question with a very simple answer.

Senator Perrault: May I observe, however, that if the text of
that Lougheed speech has yet to be received in Ottawa, there
is little hope for any speedy government action in the future.
That important speech must be coming from the west by
smoke signal.

Senator Flynn: I have heard of those simple questions
before.
Senator Oison: Does he, as Minister of Justice know, or do
other ministers in the federal government know, what the
Premier of Alberta said in his speech in Vancouver, in which
he was stating government policy, not issuing threats, with
respect to what he was going to do if a negotiated agreement
was not arrived at? Is the government aware of what is in that
speech?
Senator Flynn: Well, I heard what you heard. I can draw
my own conclusions at this time, but it would not be very
useful to give them to you, since we are in a period of
negotiation. I do not think it would be very wise, either for me
or for the distinguished new Deputy Leader of the Opposition,
to dig into that at this time just for the sake of political
advantage.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, to accuse us of seeking
political advantage by expressing concern for the welfare of
Canada is not acceptable. We want to know whether the
government is aware of the contents of that speech, that
declaration, since it was a statement of provincial government
policy-and there is no question about that. The Honourable
Leader of the Government said he could draw some conclusions about it. Have he and his colleagues drawn any conclusions about what the federal government is going to do, and
which powers it is going to use, in the absence of a negotiated
agreement?
Senator Flynn: I would say that the government remains
very confident that a solution by way of consultation will be
arrived at. That is our position. I hope you would want to
concur in this and that you are not hoping that the negotiations will break down.

*

(1410)

Senator Flynn: We have heard that negotiations will result
in a satisfactory solution. In due course we will consider other
ideas, but I do not think we should proceed with negotiations
on the assumption that they will not result in a satisfactory
settlement. Do you suggest otherwise?
Senator Perrault: As a supplementary, is it anticipated that
an agreement will be achieved between the federal government
and the Province of Alberta before a long cold winter is
ended?
Senator Flynn: I am quite confident that we will reach a
solution.

Senator Flynn: It may be a good thing that it does not reach
us too soon.
PROFITS OF OIL COMPANIES-GOVERNMENT MONITORING

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of State for Economic Development, which perhaps the Leader of the Government would pass on to him. Last
week I asked if he would tell us what criteria were being
applied by the Department of Finance in judging whether any
windfall profits as a result of the interest rate increase were
undue. If I understood his answer yesterday to a question by
Senator Croll, he said that that department was also monitoring the profits of the oil companies. I wonder if the leader
would be good enough to pass on my question so that the
Minister of State for Economic Development might add to his
response the criteria that are being applied to undue oil profits
as well. Perhaps sometime next week he could let us know
when we might expect to receive an answer to that question.
Senator Flynn: I certainly will inquire from the Minister of
State for Economic Development.
Senator Lawson: I should like to ask a supplementary on the
same subject. I am not making a speech as an independent
member of this chamber, and I am not looking for political
advantage. Some months ago there was a report from the
United States that the auditor had determined that there had
been overcharging by 15 of the leading oil companies of
something like $4.8 billion. Last week a report came out
amending that figure and indicating that in fact it was $5.2
billion, which is the equivalent of a difference of five cents on a
gallon of gas. There is evidence to indicate that some of the

SENATE DEBATES
same companies doing business in Canada have also been
guilty of overcharging in this country.
My question to the leader is this: Is it the intention of this
government to take any steps to at least deal with the Canadian sections of those companies that have been found guilty of
price gouging or rip-offs? Does the government intend to
investigate them in Canada to determine if that is happening
and, if so, to prevent it?
My concern is twofold. The United States report indicates
that they do not expect to recover any of this overcharging for
at least 15 years because apparently the oil companies are
going to use the interest from the overcharge, totalling six to
seven hundred million dollars a year, to fight the government
in its attempt to have it returned to the people. In order to
prevent the same experience in Canada, does the government
intend to take similar precautionary measures?
Senator Flynn: I may tell the honourable senator that an
investigation has been under way for some time and it is
continuing.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
SALARIES OF JUDGES

Senator Lawson: Honourable senators, I should like to pose
a question to the Leader of the Government, in his capacity as
Minister of Justice. In the last Parliament, some legislative
steps were contemplated concerning salary increases for federal judges. There was also someone from Winnipeg appointed
to investigate this matter.
Salary increases for federal judges had formerly been tied to
those of members of the other place and members of this
chamber, but somewhere along the line the federal judges were
dropped off. It is my understanding that no salary increases
have accrued to federal judges for a number of years, and that
they have not been the beneficiaries of indexing.
e (1415)
Does the government contemplate dealing at an early stage
with this very unfair situation for federal judges, many of
whom, in my understanding, have made considerable financial
sacrifices by leaving their law practices to go to the bench?
Are any steps contemplated by the Minister of Justice or the
government to correct this very serious inequity?
Senator Flynn: I can assure the honourable senator that this
problem has been one of my main preoccupations since I
became Minister of Justice, and I hope to be able to introduce
legislation to deal with the problem within some weeks.
Senator Lawson: Thank you.

October 31, 1979

General. On October 25 and 26, the provincial attorneys
general met to discuss certain aspects of the Criminal Code.
Was the matter of capital punishment discussed and, if not,
should it not be discussed at a later meeting of the attorneys
general with the Minister of Justice for Canada?
Senator Flynn: I would like to thank Senator Robichaud for
advising me of his question.
The matter of capital punishment or its reinstatement was
not on the agenda of the conference. Other issues were discussed concerning the Criminal Code, such as an in-depth
review of the Code, which the attorneys general agreed to
undertake in cooperation with the Department of Justice.
We discussed the government's short-term intentions to
make some amendments to the Criminal Code. But the issue of
capital punishment was not on the agenda and was not discussed at the assembly.
It may of course have been discussed privately, but there is
no question of having discussions on this matter for the
moment. Nobody requested it and unless a specific request is
put forward, we do not plan to take it up again. The senator is,
of course, well aware of the government's position, which is to
keep the status quo, that is abolition, even though there will be
a free vote should a bill to this effect be introduced for
Commons or even Senate approval.
Senator Robichaud: On a supplementary.
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Robichaud: The government leader has just told us
that it is not the intention of the attorneys general to put this
question on the agenda of future meetings. But does he intend
to consider the matter with the attorneys general?
Senator Flynn: I would say no, unless there is a specific
request to that effect, because the government's position is
quite clear: we are in favour of maintaining the abolition of
capital punishment, while leaving it up to Parliament to
change that by a free vote.
In passing, I do not know if this is of interest to honourable
senators, but I have here the final communiqué of the conference of ministers responsible for the administration of criminal
justice and of their talks on October 25 and 26, 1979. I can
table it or ask that it be appended to today's proceedings, as
you wish.

Senator Robichaud: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the government leader, Minister of Justice and Attorney
[Senator Lawson.]

Senator Haidasz: I have a supplementary question on the
same subject, the recent meeting of the attorneys general of
the provinces of Canada. In view of the lenient attitude of the
law enforcement officers and the judiciary that amounts to a
virtual de facto decriminalization of marijuana use, does the
Leader of the Government, in his capacity as Minister of

SENATE DEBATES

October 31, 1979

Justice, agree with this attitude, and, if so, does he intend to
present in this session of Parliament any kind of legislation to
deal with this important matter?
Senator Flynn: I can tell the Honourable Senator Haidasz
that as far as the administration of criminal justice is concerned, in some cases it is the responsibility of the attorneys
general and in other cases it is the responsibility of officiais in
my department. But, of course, one cannot dictate to the
members of the bench, who deal with these matters, the
attitude they should take. They are operating within the law as
it is.
With respect to doing something about the use of marijuana
or cannabis, I think the position of the government has been
explained on several occasions. First, we are looking at the
problem from the viewpoint of health; and, secondly, to determine whether it would be appropriate, not to legalize but to
decriminalize the offence of simple possession. The Minister of
National Health and Welfare, the Solicitor General and my
department are looking into this problem, and eventually a
position will be taken by the government and communicated to
Parliament.
THE ECONOMY
PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CAMPAIGN PROMISES

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Could the leader
inform this house whether the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce is going to be absent for the balance of the
Question Period today?
Senator Flynn: I am not certain, but I am afraid he will be. I
am very sorry for ail of you.
Senator Bosa: There has already been a great deal of
criticism concerning a minister of the Crown who has the
responsibility of a very important portfolio in this government
and who is not in the other place to answer the important
questions he ought to be answering to the elected members of
Parliament. At present, the Senate sits only three days a week,
and, consequently, the senator gets limited exposure.
Could the Leader of the Government in the Senate tell us if
the minister is going to absent himself even from this very
limited exposure?
Senator Flynn: I find it rather amusing that you speak of
limited exposure. If he were here only one day, it would not be
limited exposure. In any event, I think it is accepted in the
other place that a minister may be absent from the other place
when necessary. I was away last week because I was attending
the Federal-Provincial Conference of Ministers Responsible
for Criminal Justice.
I am very sorry that you may have to delay your question a
day or two. Of course, the weekend is longer here than it is in
the other place-but perhaps we need it.
Senator Bosa: Then, may I put this question to the Leader
of the Government in the Senate? Since the Conservatives

made a number of promises during the election campaignpromises they say they cannot keep now that they have formed
the government, because they say they have found the economy to be in a much worse state than they had anticipatedcan the Leader of the Government point out which areas of the
economy they have found to be different from what they had
anticipated, since the rate of inflation was known, the rate of
unemployment was known, the amount of the deficit was
known, and the devaluation of the dollar was known? All the
major factors that go into determining what the economy is
were public knowledge. What area of the economy then surprised the honourable gentleman and his colleagues in
government?
* (1425)

Senator Flynn: First of ail, I would suggest that Senator
Bosa team up with the Leader of the Opposition for a major
debate on ail these questions, because they are related. I think
we could have a two-day debate on these questions, which
would be a long debate in the Senate.
What do you find today that is worse than when the Liberal
Party formed the government?
Senator Bosa: I am not engaging in a debate with the
minister. I am merely seeking information. He is introducing
an argument into the question.
It has been stated time and again during Question Periodeven by Senator de Cotret, who referred to this matter last
week-that the state of the economy prevented this government from implementing certain of their promises. The reason
given was the state in which the economy was when they
inherited it on June 4. They said it was worse than they
thought it was. Could the minister point out those areas?
Senator Flynn: I feel it is not proper to engage in a debate
on these issues at this particular time. Again, I would suggest
to Senator Bosa that be put a Notice of Inquiry before the
chamber. With all this in mind, he could probably obtain a
reply in a half-hour speech.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
CURTAILMENT OF FOREIGN AID-STATEMENT BY MINISTER

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Minister of State for the Canadian International Development Agency. According to a Canadian Press
report, the minister announced yesterday in Montreal that he
will cut the foreign aid budget by $90 million.
First of ail, could the minister tell us whether it will be his
practice to make such statements outside this chamber, since
he was in it on that very day.
Secondly, after clearing that up, could he provide some
details of what aid will be cut, and so forth? A few days ago he
said that there would be no change in the guidelines until the
committee, which is not even in existence yet, reports some
time next June.

federal minister, has the right to comment on statements made
by those countries, particularly when a non-aligned country
goes as far as calling Canada an imperialist country. It is in
that context that Miss MacDonald made her statement. I
think she was totally justified in doing so.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary for the same Minister of State for CIDA.
If I understand correctly, he is now telling us that the report
we have from the Canadian Press is not correct. He did not
make that statement.
Senator Asselin: No, no, that is not what I said.
Senator Molgat: Well, I understood he had not made the
statement yesterday in Montreal that he was indeed going to
cut the budget by $90 million.
Senator Asselin: I did say that.
Senator Molgat: You said that, well, okay then. So if you
did say that, could you also confirm another section of the
same report indicating you were going to increase the staff of
the agency, is that right?
Senator Asselin: No, not necessarily the agency. Perhaps 1
could explain that to honourable senators.
The management of CIDA, starting with its president, has
undertaken to restructure the financial control of the agency.
To do that, the comptroller of the agency wanted to have
additional help to exercise stricter control. I went to Treasury
Board and told them that to have stricter control at CIDA
over our expenditures, in our bookkeeping and the monitoring
of our projects abroad, the financial comptroller of CIDA
would need 16 resource people to help him set up tight
structures. After consideration, Treasury Board thought the
suggestion made sense and I was trying that way to save
Canadian taxpayers some money by trying to cut down further
on expenses, and Treasury Board decided to give the agency
those 16 people.
Senator Molgat: So, if I understand correctly, honourable
senator, you are going to cut aid abroad to increase internal
spending?
Senator Asselin: You did not understand correctly. What I
said is this: If I have a stricter control over our expenses, I
might very well have more money for foreign countries.
Senator Flynn: Not everyone can understand that.
Senator Rizzuto: Honourable senators, I also have a question for the Minister of State for CIDA. On October 10,
during Question Period, at page 23 of Hansard,you informed
this house that you would be setting up a joint committee of
both houses before changing the policy regarding assistance to
under-developed countries. Based on your statements yesterday before the Chamber of Commerce, are we to understand
that you changed your mind?
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, what I meant was
that there is a difference between the administration of an
agency and the orientation in its policy. Yesterday I talked

80072-16

about the administration of CIDA, about certain cuts that
should be made in its budget.
As for the orientation of our policy concerning assistance to
foreign countries, what will it be in the future? I said and I
repeat that there will be a parliamentary committee which will
consider that matter. Furthermore, since the committee will
give thorough consideration to that new orientation in light of
working papers to be submitted by CIDA and the cabinet,
then after completion of those studies when we will know the
findings of that parliamentary committee we will take the
appropriate decision.
I also want to add what I had said at the time, and I say
again today, that such parliamentary committee should be a
joint committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons.

ENERGY
PROFITS OF OIL COMPANIES-GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION OF
ALLEGED PRICE GOUGING

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Justice. Earlier he was asked whether or not
the Department of Justice is investigating the possibility of
price gouging by Canadian subsidiaries of world oil companies
operating in the United States.
Senator Flynn: I did not speak of Canadian subsidiaries,
senator.
Senator Everett: I believe Senator Lawson did, but I will
amend the question to say "companies operating in Canada."
Could the Minister of Justice give us the definition of "price
gouging" that is being used in the investigation that he said is
under way?
Senator Flynn: I certainly could not. This investigation is
the responsibility of the Director of Investigation under the
Combines Investigation Act. He has the responsibility of
determining, as he proceeds, what is or is not relevant, and
what are the factors they should take into account.
Senator Everett: I have a supplementary question. The
minister indicated to Senator Lawson that an investigation was
under way into the possibility that there was indeed price
gouging. The indication given by Senator Lawson was that
that price gouging was based on the situation that obtained in
the market itself and was not necessarily the result of a
conspiracy or of some form of retail price maintenance.
I took it from the tone of the minister's answer that he was
quite informed on the investigation that was being made, and
it appears to me from his answer that his department is
making an investigation that would be tantamount to interfering with the market mechanism, and is not confined merely to
a question of conspiracy or of retail price maintenance. Is that
the minister's answer?
Senator Flynn: No, no. The investigation would come under
the Combines Investigation Act, and I suppose it would be
controversial, but if there is nothing illegal in what has been

SENATE DEBATES
accomplished by the companies, I do not think the investigation would need to be long.
I should point out that the investigation is not under my
department. I have been asked for advice on it, but that is all.

JOINT COMMITTEES

Senator Asselin: Would the honourable senator want me to
send him a copy or to table the documents in this house?
Senator Lamontagne: I do not mind one way or another. If
others are interested in reading these documents, it might be
better to table them.

REQUEST FOR REFERRAL OF D'AVIGNON REPORT AND REPORT
OF COMMISSIONER OF OFFICIAL LANGUAGES

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, about ten days
ago, I asked the Leader of the Government whether he and his
colleagues would agree to refer the D'Avignon report to a joint
committee of the Senate and the House of Commons. Without
giving a definite answer, he said he would be pleased to discuss
this with his colleagues.
Since then, I have read the report of the Commissioner of
Official Languages, which is a very important report. The
question I want to ask is in two parts.
First, I would like to know whether the honourable senator
has had the opportunity to discuss this matter with his colleagues and, if not, whether he would object to including the
Yalden report with the D'Avignon report when he does discuss
it. A glance at both reports has convinced me that there is a
strong relationship between the two and that it would be
interesting for the committee to have both documents at its
disposal.
Senator Flynn: I appreciate the suggestion. I should tell
Honourable Senator Marchand that Mr. Joyal has asked the
Prime Minister in the House of Commons to refer the Yalden
report to a joint committee of the House of Commons and the
Senate and I know that the Prime Minister is now considering
these possibilities. I will suggest to him that consideration of
the D'Avignon report could be added to the terms of reference
of this joint committee.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
REQUEST FOR TABLING OF SPEECHES

Senator Lamontagne: May I put a question to the Minister
of State responsible for CIDA and ask him simply if he can
table a copy of the speech he made yesterday in Montreal and
a copy of the statement made by the Secretary of State for
External Affairs in Toronto, I believe, at the end of September
or in early October, as well as of the statement made by Mr.
Doug Roche, Parliamentary Secretary to the Secretary of
State for External Affairs, before the United Nations in New
York recently.
Senator Asselin: I shall be very happy to table, first of all,
the speech that I made yesterday before the Chamber of
Commerce. In passing, I might tell honourable senators that it
was an excellent speech. I was very well received by those
present. As for the other documents, I shall first enquire and I
shall certainly table them shortly.
Senator Flynn: Would you want them to be tabled here or
sent directly to you?

METRIC CONVERSION PROGRAM
GOVERNMENT POLICY

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government in the Senate concerning metrication and the position of this government in connection with
it.

The three main areas of trade between Canada and the
United States are the auto industry, forestry, and mining, and
my understanding is that in these three areas metrication has
been achieved in excess of 60 per cent.
Comparing Canada with other countries, I understand that
Australia has already had full conversion to metrication, that
England is well on its way to becoming completely metrified,
and that the United States has indicated a similar disposition.
When will this government clear the air and clear up the
uncertainty that prevails in the minds of Canadians concerning
this policy?
Senator Flynn: I do not know if there is any misunderstanding in the minds of the public. If there is, it is probably due to
the position taken by the former government, because since
then nothing has taken place to add to the confusion, if there
was any.
I hope the honourable senator understands that the United
States is behind us in the process of metrification, if I may
refer to it in that way.
In any event, I know of nothing at this time that would
suggest that there is anything to worry about in the process.
However, I will inquire of the Department of Industry, Trade
and Commerce and I will report.
Senator Bosa: I have a supplementary question. It was the
deputy leader who informed us, while the leader was absent
last week, I believe, that this government was reviewing the
entire policy on metrication. That is what prompted my
question.
Senator Flynn: That is quite possible. I must say I was not
aware of it, but I would doubt that there would be a complete
review. Perhaps there would be a review in some areas.

POSTAL RATES BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Bélisie moved the second reading of Bill C-11,
respecting certain postal rates.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding with Bill
C-11, respecting certain postal rates, I should like to take this
opportunity to express to the Honourable Allister Grosart my
sincere felicitations on his appointment as Speaker of this
august chamber. His experience and ability will undoubtedly
make of him a prudent and able Speaker, and his many years
in the Senate and his knowledge of the rules will assist him
greatly in his present task.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, do allow me to tell you briefly just
how much I appreciated the help of our former Speaker of the
Senate, the Honourable Renaude Lapointe. To my mind, she is
really one of a kind, in that she was at once very dignified and
very competent. The newspapers had every reason to dub her
"The Ambassador of the Senate".
I should also like to congratulate my leader, the Honourable
Jacques Flynn, Leader of the Government in the Senate,
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. When
the media broke the news of his appointment, I am sure I was
not the only one who rejoiced, because he proved his worth
many long years ago.
As for the appointment of the Honourable Martial Asselin,
I am convinced it helped the public understand just how
important a role the Senate can play.

SENATE DEBATES
I was tremendously pleased to have acted as sponsor, along
with the Leader of the Government, when the Honourable
Robert de Cotret took his oath as senator and minister. His
reputation as an economist was acquired in the other place,
and especially as Chairman of the Conference Board in
Canada.
If the newspapers and the media had any doubts about his
being able to sustain the heavy fire of opposition questions,
and to answer them, I am sure they have completely disappeared. His competence and his experience make him a favourite of the press. Might I add that, to my knowledge, no
senator as young as he is bas ever come to us so heavily
burdened with responsibilities as head of two key departments.
Who knows, perhaps the destiny of our country might make of
him a future Prime Minister of Canada.

Honourable senators, it was with deep interest that 1 listened to the mover, the Honourable Senator Martha Bielish,
and the seconder, the Honourable Senator Guy Charbonneau,
of the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. As newcomers, they deserve our congratulations and
respect. To all those who made their maiden speech, congratulations for a job well donc. I hope that all those who were
appointed either from the Liberal side or the government side
will play an active role in this chamber.
Honourable senators, we are asked today to study Bill C-Il,
approved during second reading in the House of Commons,
studied by the Committee of the Whole, and approved on third
reading.
This bill pertains to measures respecting certain postal rates.
First, let me point out that beginning in 1976, and continuing
until 1979, the former Liberal government chose to institute
increases in letter and second class postal rates by way of
authorization by the Governor in Council pursuant to section
13(b) of the Financial Administration Act, rather than by
presenting a bill to Parliament amending sections 10 and l1 of
the Post Office Act.
The use of section 13(b) of the Financial Administration
Act came about, presumably, because of the inability, or the
unwillingness, of previous Postmasters General to obtain time
in the House of Commons for consideration of amendments to
the Post Office Act.
In its third report dated October 4, 1976, the Standing Joint
Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments, considered that
regulations setting new rates were ultra vires section 6 of the
Post Office Act. It added that this use of the regulations
amounted to an unusual and unexpected use of power conferred upon the Governor General in Council by section 13 of
the Financial Administration Act. The fourth and sixth reports
of the same committee reiterate those objections.
The legitimacy of using the Financial Administration Act
was challenged in the courts. The decision was in favour of the
position the former government had taken. That decision is
[Senator Bélisle.]

October 3 1, 1979

now before the Federal Court of Appeal. An adjournment was
asked for by Postmaster General John A. Fraser. That
adjournment was granted on the undertaking of the Honourable John A. Fraser to introduce into the House of Commons
legislation that would, in a retroactive way, legitimize the rate
increases made under the Financial Administration Act.
It is our understanding that should this bill meet with the
approval of Parliament the appeal before the Federal Court
will be withdrawn, but that is not the raison d'être underlying
this bill. The plaintiff in the legal proceedings contended that
what was being done was not according to the Constitution
and was contrary to the proper practices of Parliament. The
government's view is that as long as amendments to the Post
Office Act exist as a means of rate adjustment, the Financial
Administration Act is not the preferred method of increasing
the letter and second class postal rates.
As Postmaster General John A. Fraser pointed out in the
House of Commons:
Although the use of the regulation may be technically
within the law, it is clearly less than acceptable to some
members of this House, the Senate, and the Canadian
public.
Passage of this bill will legally confirm the amendments to
postal rates that were made by regulation, by deeming them to
have been made under the Post Office Act, and will also
protect Parliament against improper practices on the part of
any government in the future. I will come back to this in a few
minutes.
Honourable senators, may I point out that no objections
were made on either side of the House of Commons at the
time of second reading of the bill. While it nevertheless
generated numerous interventions, the government was commended by certain members of the opposition for having
presented Bill C- 11. All of us have had the opportunity to read
the House of Commons debate. Let me remind you of the real
intent of the amendments made to section 13 of the Financial
Administration Act when these were introduced in 1968 and
1969. The Honourable Mr. Drury, then President of the
Treasury Board, stated, when he introduced these amendments, that there was no intention that section 13 would ever
be used for such a purpose as the fixing of postal rates. From
1968 to 1976 no attempt was made to do so. It was in 1976
that this was donc for the first time.
[Translation]
Let me point out, honourable senators, that until recently
Parliament was responsible for fixing postal rates. Need I
remind you that postal rates have a strong influence on people,
on those who are called ordinary citizens.
If there is one principle that must be respected by Parliament it is the one allowing all concerned to make their views
known when time has come to go and find money in the
taxpayers' pockets, for instance through higher postal rates.
This is the main feature of our legislative process.
I do not believe, honourable senators, that we are here to
pass judgment on a political party or one or several of its

October 31, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

members. Our function consists essentially in ensuring that
Bill C-11 submitted to us by the House of Commons is in the
interest of all Canadians. And I am convinced that the interests of Canadians will be protected if Parliament corrects what
I would call the misdemeanours of the previous government
and if it eliminates all ambiguity in the Financial Administration Act by passing this bill.
If we read Bill C-11 we realize that the present government
is anxious to eliminate controversial elements concerning the
implementation of paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act. According to the spirit and the terms of Bill C-11,
as long as it is possible to amend the Post Office Act to
readjust first and second class rates there is no need to use the
Financial Administration Act.
Honourable senators, I think that Senate members should
not hesitate to support Bill C-11 which is aimed at protecting
parliamentary practices and giving parliamentarians a chance
to express their views about any increase in first and second
class rates.
Honourable senators, if this bill gets your support, it might
be referred to the Transport and Communications Committee
but I do not see why. However we are at your disposal.

[English]
Senator Godfrey: Will the honourable senator permit a
question? I was a member of the Joint Committee of the
Senate and House of Commons on Regulations and other
Statutory Instruments which was highly critical of the practice
of the former government. I listened with a great deal of
interest to what the honourable senator had to say. During his
speech, although he said that the government did not think it
was necessary to use section 13(b), I do not think he stated
definitely that the government would not use section 13(b) in
the future. 1 just want to clear that up. Is it the undertaking of
the government that in the future they will not use the
Financial Administration Act, but will go by way of amendment to the Post Office Act, as had been done before 1976?
Senator Bélisle: I would answer my honourable colleague
this way: I have read in the record that in 1968 the Honourable Mr. Drury said that we would not use it. The present
minister has said that he will not use it. Does that answer the
question?
On motion of Senator Deschatelets, debate adjourned.
FUGITIVE OFFENDERS BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Flynn moved the second reading of Bill S-8,
respecting fugitive offenders in Canada.
[Translation]
He said: Honourable senators, for most of us this bill is
nothing new since an almost similar bill-and I will mention
later the relatively small difference that is to be found in itwas once submitted to you. It went through first reading on
January 31, 1978, was read a second time on February 2, 1978

and given third reading on February 22 of that same year. It
was sent to the House of Commons and expired along with the
last Parliament.
[English]
In the 97 years since Canada first passed its Fugitive
Offenders Act, the sophistication and pervasiveness of criminal
activity has increased dramatically. Geographic boundaries
offer little hindrance to fleeing criminals and all countries
must co-operate, and indeed are co-operating, ever more closely to ensure that lawbreakers find no sanctuary.
Bill S-8 replaces our sadly outdated Fugitive Offenders Act
and amends the Extradition Act to enable us to meet our
responsibilities and to play an effective part in the international fight against crime.
Many of the provisions of this bill are based on an agreement reached between Commonwealth law ministers at a
meeting in 1966. The agreement settled upon at that meeting
was called the Scheme Relating to the Rendition of Fugitive
Offenders within the Commonwealth, and legislation based on
this scheme is now law in almost 50 independent Commonwealth countries, dependencies, protectorates and associated
states.
The bill consists of three main sections: The first contains a
major revision of the Fugitive Offenders Act; the second
amends the Extradition Act; and the third lists a "schedule" of
returnable offences.
[Translation]
The Fugitive Offenders Act is the instrument allowing
Canada to return to Commonwealth countries which recognize
the Queen as their head of State some offenders who have
taken refuge in Canada, and vice versa.
The Extradition Act provides similar agreements with all
countries not part of the Commonwealth. It also allows
Canada to negotiate the return of Canadian fugitive offenders.
The Fugitive Offenders Act was first adopted in 1882 and it
has not changed significantly in the last 96 years.
The changes introduced by this bill involve three main
objectives: first, to see that the legislation be more closely
adjusted to modern criminal activities and make its administration easier.
Second, to protect civil liberties of those who have fled
racial, religious or political oppression, and third, to raise to
over 70 the number of countries with which Canada can
negotiate under the Fugitive Offenders Act.
Right now, any fugitive offender found in Canada can be
apprehended and extradited to the country where he has
committed his offence, and from which he has fled, provided
the Fugitive Offenders Act applies in that country and the
offence committed is punishable, under the legislation of the
claimant country, by twelve months' imprisonment or more,
with hard labour. Moreover, whether the offence committed is
recognized as such or not under Canadian legislation is not
considered. One problem which arises under this system is that
nowadays few countries inflict sentences of hard labour.

SENATE DEBATES
So the amendments proposed in Bill S-8 introduce in a
schedule a list of returnable offences. This schedule establishes
a rule of "double offence"; in other words, Canada would
allow a fugitive to be extradited only if the offence perpetrated
in the claimant country is recognized as an offence under
Canadian legislation as well. The same schedule applies to the
Extradition Act and the Fugitive Offenders Act in the proposed bill.
The proposed schedule introduces a well detailed list of
serious offences, such as homicide, kidnapping, aircraft highjacking, rape, counterfeiting, income tax evasion, and wilful
non-support or abandonment of a child where the life or health
of such child is likely to be endangered.
Moreover, this bill offers safeguards for the civil liberties of
individuals. For instance, Canada could refuse to return a
fugitive if the offence for which a country is seeking his return
is an offence of a political character.
It should be emphasized however, in line with modern trends
in the area of extradition, that Canada does not consider as an
offence of political character the murder, kidnapping or other
assault on a head of state, a head of government, a minister of
foreign affairs, or a member of the diplomatic corps carrying
out his or her duties outside his or her country. As you can see,
this does not apply to a minister of justice, but only to a
minister of foreign affairs or a prime minister. As a matter of
fact, these persons are entitled to international protection
under a United Nations convention which Canada signed in
1974.
This bill would amend the Extradition Act and the Fugitive
Offenders Act in such a way that Canada could refuse to
surrender a fugitive if, when surrendered, he is likely to be
prejudiced at his trial by reason of his race, religion, sex,
nationality, political opinion, or subjected to the full force of
the law.
a

(1520)

[English]
The bill provides that a person returned to Canada from a
Commonwealth country may only be tried in Canada for the
offence for which he is returned. Thus, if an individual is
returned to Canada to be tried for income tax evasion, we may
not, unless we first obtain the agreement of the returning
country, try him for counterfeiting. Such a situation might
arise where Canadian officials feel they lack sufficient evidence at the time of extradition to convince the returning
country that the fugitive has committed the counterfeiting
crime, but, on his return, turn up additional evidence. In such
cases, the law applies the "rule of speciality," providing a
45-day grace period on the counterfeiting offence, before the
fugitive could be charged with it.
Honourable senators will recall that, as I have mentioned, a
similar bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders Act and the
Extradition Act was introduced in the last Parliament, and it
went through all stages in the Senate. At that time members of
this house expressed serious concerns about a provision that
would have given the Minister of Justice of Canada the
[Senator Flynn.]

October 31, 1979

discretion to refuse to surrender a fugitive to another country
where the penalty for the returnable offence in question was
death, and the country refused to give assurance that this
penalty would not be imposed. I shared that concern, and so
the bill before you provides that a decision to refuse the
surrender of a fugitive on the grounds that he or she might be
executed will be the responsibility of the full cabinet. A
decision of this kind is a grave one, with serious implications in
terms of both international law enforcement and human rights.
Thus, the government believes that it should be addressed by
the Governor in Council.
Honourable senators, I commend the bill to your approval.
On motion of Senator Neiman, debate adjourned.
SAFE CONTAINERS CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Senator Macdonald moved the second reading of Bill S-5, to
implement the International Convention for Safe Containers.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill S-5 is an act to implement in Canada the International Convention for Safe Containers. It will be remembered that a similar bill, known as Bill
S-4, was given second reading in this chamber in December of
1977. It was considered in committee on February 8, 1978,
and then passed here. However, it was not considered in the
other place prior to the summer adjournment. It was again
introduced here, with I think one amendment or change, as
Bill S-3 in October of 1978 and duly passed. Again it was not
considered by the other place, due to the dissolution of Parliament. The present bill has some technical changes, but no
change of substance from the two prior bills.
I should add, as honourable senators will recall, that both
the prior bills were sponsored here by Senator Petten, and on
the 1977 bill especially he gave a very detailed explanation of
its provisions. Perhaps I should also mention that if my
remarks today should sound familiar, it is because I have
borrowed heavily from the speeches given by Senator Petten
when he was moving second reading on the two occasions I
have mentioned.
Senator Roblin: Give credit where credit is due.
Senator Macdonald: Containers have made possible the
transportation of cargo with a minimum of handling by sea,
rail and road. Consequently, it has resulted in a more efficient
and less expensive way of moving cargo and other kinds of
freight. The use of containers is responsible for the development of new types of ships, railway cars, trucks and specialized
equipment. However, with the movement of containerized
goods from one form of transport to another, and from one
country to another, it became evident that some form of
international safety regulation was necessary. So, the International Convention for Safe Containers was adopted by the
1972 Conference on International Container Traffic, which
was held jointly by the United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe and the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative
Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations. A

October 31, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Canadian delegation participated in the development of this
international convention and signed it, subject to its later
ratification.
There are currently 22 contracting parties to the International Convention for Safe Containers, including the United
States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Federal
Republic of Germany, France and the Soviet Union. The
convention came into force internationally on September 6,
1977, following its ratification by the first ten countries. Full
compliance with the convention will be required by September
6, 1982, on which date contracting parties to the convention
will initiate container safety control measures at their frontiers. The convention has not as yet been ratified by Canada, a
process which requires prior enactment of this legislation.
Implementation of this convention will provide the Canadian
public with a system that involves a minimum level of regulation essential to maintaining the necessary degree of safety
assurance required in the container industry. It will avoid
possible disruption in the flow of Canadian containerized
goods to and from the many countries which are contracting
parties to the convention, and which will be checking containers entering their territories for conformity with the terms of
the convention. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it will
ensure that Canadian interests can benefit from uniformity in
the application of national laws concerning safe usage of
freight containers in international transport.
Honourable senators, it may be helpful at this point to
briefly highlight the main provisions of the bill. First, the bill
and the convention, which is a schedule to the bill, set out
criteria for the safety approval of containers used in international transport, thereby providing for conformity by the
Canadian container industry with internationally accepted
minimum safety standards.
Secondly, container owners will obtain safety approval for
such containers, and this approval is to be evidenced on each
container by a safety approval plate. A valid safety approval
plate will constitute a safety "passport," facilitating the movement of a container internationally. It is intended, under
regulations pursuant to the act, that certification of containers
will be done by utilizing organizations such as those already
providing classification standards in Canada for shipbuilding
and structural steel construction. I am speaking of organizations such as Lloyd's Register of Shipping, Bureau Veritas and
the American Bureau of Shipping.
a

(1530)

Thirdly, container owners will be required, in addition to the
initial safety approval, to carry out periodic inspection of
containers in accordance with approved procedures. If at any
time there is evidence that the condition of a container is such
as to create a risk to safety, the owner will be required to take
such container out of service until it has been restored to a safe
condition. Under the proposed regulations, compliance with
the safety standards will be monitored by selective inspection
of container approval and maintenance functions and by surveillance carried out by such personnel as customs inspectors,
coast guard surveyors, CTC rail inspectors and civil aviation

inspectors at strategic entrance and exit locations across the
country as part of normal duties and within existing resources.
Fourthly, structural safety requirements and tests, in addition to those specified in Annex Il of the schedule to the bill,
can be imposed only for purposes of air transport and for
containers especially designed for the transport of dangerous
goods or bulk liquids.
Fifthly, authority is provided under clause 6 of the bill for
the Minister of Transport to direct an inquiry with respect to
any accident or incident involving a cargo container where
personal safety or property damage is a factor.
I should like to add, honourable senators, that extensive
consultation has taken place with the container industry and,
in addition, the provinces have been consulted and generally
have no problem with the convention.
In closing, I believe it should be stated that the Canadian
container industry has a fine safety record. The regulatory
approach proposed to implement the International Convention
for Safe Containers which has been developed in concert with
the private sector and which has its support, will contribute
significantly to the maintenance of this standard. It will
achieve compliance with the convention with a minimun
amount of industry control, and will deal responsibly with
Canada's international interests and public safety requirements in this important transportation area.
Canadian ratification of the International Convention for
Safe Containers will reinforce the use of world transportation
safety standards and will ensure that Canadian containerized
goods will continue to have an orderly flow to and from the
many countries which have become contracting parties to the
convention.
Honourable senators, since quite a period of time has
elapsed since a similar bill was considered in committee and
since there are some changes in this bill, I believe it would be
useful if it was again referred to committee. So, if this bill
passes second reading, I will move it be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications.
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, as my honourable
colleague Senator Macdonald said, I sponsored this bill on the
two occasions it was before the house previously.
Senator Macdonald made an excellent presentation-far
better than mine. There is nothing I can add to what he has
already said. So, for our part on this side, if no other senator
wishes to take part in the debate, we should be quite content to
have the bill go to committee.
Senator Oison: How is that for being co-operative?
Senator Roblin: Perfect.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Macdonald moved that the bill be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications.
Motion agreed to.
STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
MOTION TO AMEND RULE 49(l)(c)

Senator Bosa, pursuant to notice of Thursday, October
1979, moved:

There is a book entitled How Parliament Works, by E.
Russell Hopkins, which, on page 21, states:
The Senate was never intended to be a competitor of
the House of Commons in the field of legislation. It was
conceived of and in the main has acted as a second
chamber which, in the words of Sir John A. Macdonald,
can take a "sober second look" at legislation initiated in
the House of Commons.

•
l1,

That when the Conmittee on Standing Rules and
Orders is set up, it be instructed Io look into and report
upon the advisability of amending rule 49(1)(c) of the
Rules of the Senate for the purpose of simplifying the
procedure applicable to a senator who abstains from
voting.

He said: Honourable senators, the reason for my moving
this motion is to simplify rule 49(1 )(c), which is to be found at
page 13 of the Rules of the Senate.
I would urge honourable senators to take out their copies of
the Rules of the Senate so that they may follow what I am
attempting to do. It can be seen that this particular paragraph
in question reads as follows:
(c) a senator who declines to vote shall assign his reasons
therefor, following which the Speaker shall submit to the
Senate the question, "Shall the senator, for the reasons
assigned by him, be excused from voting?", which shall be
decided without debate.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that it is very incongruous for a senator to remain in his place and abstain from
voting on a measure which he may find he cannot entirely
support or vote against for reasons which I will explain in a
moment.
I wanted to sec if there was a precedent in the House of
Lords. I did some research, and read chapter 4 of a book by
Janet Morgan entitled The House of Lords and the Labour
Government 1964-1970. The Standing Orders of the House of
Lords have no similar voting procedure. The only way a
member of the Lords may abstain from voting is by absenting
himself from a division.
One of the realities in the Senate during this session is that
there are 71 senators who have given their party affiliation as
Liberal. There are 29 senators who have given their party
affiliation as Conservative, and who are on the government
side but in the minority. There are two senators who are
Independent. Literally, any government measure that comes
before this chamber could be defeated by the opposition, but h
do not think the purpose of the Senate is to frustrate the will of
the elected house.

October 31, 1979

(1540)

Continuing on page 21, it further states:
As mentioned, the Senate was never intended to act as a
competitor of the House of Commons, or, in the words of
Sir Robert Borden, "to exercise its powers to the legal
limit". It has never, for instance, resisted the adoption of
a government measure for which the government has
received a popular mandate in a general election. The
Senate has been traditionally conscious of its special role
in the legislative process, that it should act as a brake,
rather than as a block, in relation to legislation originating in the CommonsIt seems hypocritical to me, honourable senators, that we
should adopt the practice that has been adopted in the other
place or the practice that has been adopted in the House of
Lords-that is, in order to avoid voting in favour of or against
a motion one should absent himself from the chamber. I think
those senators who do not share the philosophy of a government measure which comes before this chamber ought to have
the privilege to remain in their place and have their presence
noted and their abstention also recorded.
For that reason, I move that this matter be referred to the
Standing Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. I hope
that honourable senators present will support this motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: I should point out that there is
already a motion before the house. I thought Senator Bosa
might have been adding a second motion.
The motion already before the house is that the committee
deal with this matter. Therefore, it will not be necessary for
me to put the motion that it be referred to that committee.
Is that agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Bosa, seconded by the Honourable Senator Adams,
that when the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders is set
upSome Hon. Senators: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

APPENDIX
(See p. 222)
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE OF MINISTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE
COMMUNIQUÉ

For Immediate Release:
Friday, October 26, 1979
At a meeting of the federal and provincial ministers responsible for justice held in Ottawa on October 25-26, 1979, the
following were the principal items discussed.
1.Criminal Code Review
Ministers agreed that a thorough review of the Criminal
Code should be undertaken as a matter of priority.
The next step will be an early meeting between deputy ministers and the Law Reform Commission of Canada to develop
a plan of action for the review and propose a time schedule for
consideration by Ministers when they meet early next spring.
The principle of federal-provincial co-operation was firmly
established and it was agreed that the review should encompass both substantive criminal law and criminal procedure.

Ministers agreed to review questions concerning accountability during the contract negotiations.
Ministers agreed to set up a Law Enforcement Forum consisting of all federal and provincial ministers having law
enforcement responsibilities to consider these and other law
enforcement questions on a regular basis.
4. Access to Information under Part IV of the Canadian
Human Rights Act
This provision gives an individual access to personal information held in federal government files and data banks, subject
to certain exceptions.
A problem can arise where the information held by the federal government has been provided by a province or has been
collected by a federal agency on behalf of a province.

2. Prosecution of Offences under Federal Statutes Other Than
the Criminal Code
The respective powers and responsibilities of federal and
provincial crown prosecutors for prosecution of offences under
federal statutes other than the Criminal Code is a continuing
concern of federal and provincial ministers alike. Recent court
decisions have underlined this concern.
The statutes include, for instance, the Narcotics Control Act
and the Food and Drugs Act.
Deputy ministers will meet to identify legal and constitutional solutions to this problem and to propose practical
administrative arrangements that might lead to a general
federal-provincial agreement or a series of bilateral agreements between the federal government and the provinces.

One example of the latter is information collected by the
R.C.M.P. acting as a provincial police force under contract.

3. R.C.M.P. Accountability
Ministers noted that complex and difficult questions have
arisen about the responsibilities and accountability of the
R.C.M.P.

In the same period, a national work group consisting of
experts from Statistics Canada, the Justice Department and
the Ministry of the Solicitor General has been working with
the provinces under the guidance of a federal-provincial steering committee to develop systems that will enable statistics to
be derived in the most economical way possible.

These questions include the handling of citizens' complaints
against the police, internal disciplinary practices and accountability to the responsible provincial ministers.
Some Ministers expressed concern with the federal suggestion to establish a citizen complaint review process for
R.C.M.P. activities, where such a process already exists in the
provinces. This would clearly duplicate provincial police commissions or other bodies that currently deal with these problems.

Ministers noted that any consideration of this question must
include study of the Freedom of Information Bill now before
Parliament, its impact upon Part IV of the Canadian Human
Rights Act and its impact upon the problem.
5. Justice Information and Statistics
To meet the problems encountered as a result of a lack of
accurate and timely information and statistics in criminal justice, provincial Attorneys General in 1976 set up a National
Task Force to identify, describe and quantify justice services at
all levels of government. The Task Force has now issued
reports on policing, courts, legal aid, adult corrections, pretrial services and crown counsel.

The Ministers agreed that the National Task Force and the
National Work Group should together develop a plan of action
for the provision of timely and accurate criminal justice information and statistics.
This work is to be overseen by a small committee of federal
and provincial deputy ministers, which the Chief Statistician
of Canada will be invited tojoin.

6. Family Legal Aid
Provincial Ministers urged that family legal aid shared-cost
agreements should be entered into to complement existing
criminal legal aid agreements. The Minister of Justice agreed
to lay this matter before his Cabinet colleagues.
7. Duplication And Overlap
Ministers reviewed the report of the last meeting of the federal/provincial committee of deputy ministers and a status
report on the various issues under consideration.
A further report is to be made before the forthcoming First
Ministers' meeting.
8. Cannabis
The Minister of National Health and Welfare joined the
meeting for discussion of this subject.
Ministers noted the increasing body of evidence suggesting
that the use of cannabis derivatives is injurious to health.
The Minister of National Health and Welfare announced
that he expects to publish a discussion paper on this subject in
the near future.
The discussion included "decriminalization" of cannabis, the
effects of conviction upon the individual for simple possession,
fingerprinting, photographing, the keeping of criminal records,
and an educational campaign on the harmful effects of
marijuana and hashish use.
9. Corrections
Ministers agreed that the existing split in jurisdiction over
corrections continues to create many problems and that this
question should be considered as a part of the work being done
to eliminate duplication and overlap.
10. Jurisdiction over Family and Various Administrative Matters
Ministers expressed concern with recent court decisions
tending to limit the flexibility of the provinces to establish
family court and various administrative tribunals.
Ministers agreed that this matter receive a high priority in
the Continuing Committee of Ministers on the Constitution,
with a view to amending Section 96 of the British North
America Act.

l1. Young Offenders
Ministers welcomed the announcement that the federal government is proceeding with the proposed Young Offenders Act
and that there will be further opportunities to comment upon
the content of the proposed Act.

the fact is that by the time we have finished with the pre-study
we have really had a more detailed examination of the bills
than they have had in the other place. I make that claim as a
senator. Others may not agree with me, but i think this is true
in many cases. We would encourage the government to support
this practice, for it has been very useful.
Senator Flynn: i would like to add one comment. One of the
great advantages of this formula is to signal to the other place
some of our concerns. As a result, sometimes amendments are
made before the bill cornes to us, which eliminates the necessity of a confrontation with the other place.
Senator Oison: Right.
Senator Flynn: I am not very worried about the concept of
forcing the Senate to adopt a bill in a few hours. i think this
will happen only in extraordinary circumstances. i hope i will
never use the pattern that was used by the former
administration.
Senator Perrault: The Leader of the Government, it is
encouraging to note, has not lost his simple, child-like faith.
Senator Flynn: i think i am more subtle than the Leader of
the Opposition.

Senator Roblin, for Senator Hayden, moved, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45( 1)(e):
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and
consider the subject matter of the Bill C-14, intituled:
"An Act to revise the Bank Act, to amend the Quebec
Savings Banks Act and the Bank of Canada Act, to
establish the Canadian Payments Association and to
amend other Acts in consequence thereof", in advance of
the said bill coming before the Senate, or any matter
relating thereto; and
That the papers and evidence received and taken on the
subject in the third and fourth sessions of the Thirtieth
Parliament be referred to the committee.
He said: i will just make a brief statement, honourable
senators. I have the privilege of standing in for Senator Salter
Hayden on this occasion because everyone recognizes that this
formal procedure is almost the patent right property of Senator Salter Hayden. It certainly is a very advantageous procedure for the Senate to have at its disposal.

Senator Flynn: Do you mean the budget of the Senate?
Senator McDonald: No, the budgets for the committees.
Senator Flynn: Nothing has changed in this respect. There
were certain good things under the former administration.
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear.
Senator Everett: Do I understand Senator McDonald correctly to be saying that the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy, Budgets and Administration has to approve the
budget before hearings could begin?
Senator McDonald: No. I was hoping that the committees
would submit their budgets at as early a date as possible in
order that the Internal Economy Committee may deal with
them as one of its first responsibilities.
Senator Everett: That would be our intention, yes.
Senator Walker: Did you call it the "Eternal" Economy

PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF FEES

Senator van Roggen, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(i), moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid with respect to a
proposed application to Parliament for a private bill to
revive Expressway Truck Line (Canada) Ltd., of the City
of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, be
refunded to the petitioner.
He said: By way of explanation, I would simply say that two
or three years ago a petition was received by the Senate to
reinstate this company, which had been dissolved, because it
was found that two pieces of land in British Columbia were
still registered in its name and could not be dealt with.

(1415)

That application was accompanied by the normal deposit of
$500. The law officer of the Senate, and I think quite correctly, wrote back to the petitioner, pointing out that very probably a more appropriate procedure for him to follow would be
to use the Escheats Act of the Province of British Columbia.
Nothing much happened. No reply was received. So our
staff wrote again a few weeks ago and received a letter back
from the lawyer in Vancouver asking us to please withdraw his
petition and refund the $500. I telephoned him this morning
and ascertained that indeed he was following the very good
advice of our law officer.
I might just say that no expenses were incurred by the
Senate. The bill was never printed, and no disbursements were
made, so it would seem in order to refund the $500.

SENATE DEBATES

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
INDUSTRY, TRADE AND COMMERCE
MINISTER'S ABSENCE FROM CHAMBER

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, i have a few questions for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce is becoming
increasingly "elusive." Perhaps that is one term to describe his
continuing absence.
i should like to ask whether the minister is abroad on some
vital public mission, whether he is researching a way to
reconcile the government's contradictory economic policies,
whether he is speaking to a group of dispirited Tories, or
whether he has gone into hiding. In short, where is he?
Senator Choquette: You are trying to destroy him as much
as you can.
Senator Perrault: We have important questions to address
to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce today. This
is the second consecutive day he has not been in the chamber.
This is a time of great importance to Canadians. There are
several economic concerns which require responses from the
minister, yet no explanation of his whereabouts has been given.
*

(1425)

Senator Flynn: i can inform the house that the Minister of
State for Economic Development is away on public business.
He is in the city of Los Angeles, representing the interests of
Canada.
I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that when he
was the only minister in this house he was often absent. But, of
course, his absence was not as remarkable or as important, and
did not have the same consequences. Overall there has been an
improvement, even with the minister being absent for a few
days on government business.
Senator Lamontagne: Where is he?
Senator Flynn: He is in Los Angeles. If you want to join
him, you can fly down there today.
Senator Perrault: There may be some reason for the minister's visit to the world's movie capital this afternoonSenator Flynn: He is not in Hollywood.
Senator Perrault: -but there are a number of important
reasons why he should be in this chamber today. This is his
first responsibility.
As far as my attendance record is concerned, an examination of the record-and it can be made available to the Leader
of the Government-will show that all of my absences from
this chamber were valid ones-on public business and in the
public interest.
PROPOSED APPOINTMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO
MINISTER OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Senator Perrault: Given the fact that there are so many
important questions to be posed in this chamber dealing with
[Senator Robin.]

November 1, 1979

the economy, surely there is validity to the proposai to have a
parliamentary secretary appointed to the Minister of State for
Economic Development. Surely, a competent parliamentary
secretary could be chosen from among the many frustrated,
talented government backbenchersSenator Oison: Or even frontbenchers.
Senator Perrault: Or even frontbenchers, as my colleague
suggests. The parliamentary secretary to the minister could
then speak for the minister on those rare occasions when the
public interest demands that the minister be elsewhere.
i hope the government wili give consideration to this proposal. There should be someone here with sufficient economic
data and information to answer for the minister in the range of
economic questions which demand and require answers.
Senator Flynn: Really, i had no idea that the Leader of the
Opposition could become so funny or so humorous. Dealing
first with the justification for the minister's absence, he is, as i
said earlier, in Los Angeles on public business-and not the
kind of "public business" on which the Leader of the Opposition was engaged when he was away from this place organizing
the Liberal Party in British Columbia, the results of which we
are ail aware of.
Senator Haidasz: There are no Conservatives in San
Francisco.
Senator Flynn: The minister is in Los Angeles to deal with
matters in the interests of Canada, not of any political party. i
hope you are able to make the distinction.
With regard to the appointment of a parliamentary secretary, i can only say that when we had only one minister in this
place under the previous administration-a minister without
departmental responsibility-we were not provided with parliamentary secretaries, despite the fact that you were three
times our number. What a silly suggestion to make!
Senator Perrault: There is valid reason for the proposai.
However, before i let the other matter pass, may 1 say that,
during my infrequent absences, on not one single occasion did
i absent myseif from this chamber and my responsibilities to
this house to work on behalf of the party of which I find
myself a member. Let that be clearly placed on the record.
Dealing with the matter of parliamentary secretaries, there
are now three ministers entrusted with major portfolios in this
government who are sitting in the Senate. The situation is
completely different from what it was when I occupied the
position of Leader of the Government in the Senate, with my
general overall responsibilities. Given the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce's specific responsibilities, there is now a
valid case for establishing the position of parliamentary secretary. In fact, i would suggest that the supporters of the Leader
of the Government in the Senate agree with the idea.
However, it may be that the minister has gone to Calgary in
an attempt to locate a copy of Mr. Lougheed's speech.
Senator Flynn: The minister, as I said, is in Los Angeles.

SENATE DEBATES

November 1, 1979

Senator Perrault: Mr. Lougheed is often down in the United
States. Perhaps they are meeting in Los Angeles. In any event,
we hope to be able to help the government out this afternoon
with respect to that elusive speech.
Senator Flynn: Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting
that his party colleagues in the other place would accept
legislation appointing parliamentary secretaries in this chamber? Is the Leader of the Opposition prepared to give us that
assurance? If so, that would be interesting.
Senator Perrault: Let's hear from the government as to its
proposal.
Senator Flynn: You are backtracking.
Senator Perrault: I suggest that the proposal should have
the support of the people who work with the Leader of the
Government in this chamber.
Senator Asselin: What about your people? It is your
suggestion.
Senator Perrault: I am speaking of the government party.
Senator Flynn: Come on, say it.

Senator Perrault: Mr. Leader, any well researched and
sincere proposal would be duly considered by the loyal
opposition.

Senator Perrault: Indirect reference was made not only to
the crash in Mexico City.
Senator Flynn: i know you said "throughout the world".
Senator Perrault: Mr. Leader, the reference was made in
view of the general apprehension of air travellers with respect
to air safety because of a recent series of crashes throughout
the world. Of course, we should bear in mind that Canadian
airline operators are some of the safest in the world.
Senator Flynn: I agree.
ENERGY
PRICE OF DOMESTIC OIL-STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF
ALBERTA-GOVERN MENT ATTITUDE

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, might I ask the Leader
of the Government a question, in the absence of the Minister
of State for Economic Development? My question is whether
they have had, as yet, an opportunity to study the very clear
and positive remarks of Premier Lougheed about what he
would have to do in the absence of a negotiated agreement,
and is the government prepared to let the people of Canada in
on what they are going to do with respect to this very, very
serious and important statement of provincial policy?

STRIKE OF AIR AND MARINE RADIO OPERATORS

Senator Flynn: I do not know to what text or comments by
Premier Lougheed the Honourable Senator Olson is referring,
but I would say that as of today we are very confident that
negotiations will result in a satisfactory arrangement.
Senator Oison: We have heard that confidence expressed a
number of times.
Senator Perrault: Is this a "confidence" game?

Senator Perrault: I should like to direct a question to the
Honourable the Leader of the Government with respect to the
radio operator situation in Canada. Reports are that almost
half of Canada's airport and marine radio operators are off the
job again today following a breakdown in government-union
contract talks yesterday.
In view of the continuing rash of air crashes throughout the
world, and the concern that all air travellers currently have,
can an assurance be given this afternoon, first of all, that there
will be initiatives to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible;
and, secondly, despite the absence of certain radio operators,
are reasonable safety precautions being followed at Canadian
airports to make sure that the Canadian air traveller is well
protected?

Senator Oison: And we have also heard every day up until
today, at least, that you have not seen the speech yet. I have a
copy of that speech here and I shall be glad to send it to you if
you have not yet seen it. But what is important is that Premier
Lougheed said in that speech that, in the absence of a negotiated agreement with the federal government, Alberta would
set its own prices, and that all of Canada would be welcome to
buy at those prices.
i am just wondering if the Leader of the Government could
tell us what the federal government is going to express as the
national interest in this respect, in view of the fact also that the
Prime Minister said on October 24 that he would not use the
declaratory power or the other powers-at least the others that
we know of-that are available to the federal government.

Senator Flynn: i hope that the Leader of the Opposition is
not establishing any relationship between the situation of the
radio operators in Canada and the crash in Mexico yesterday.
It seems to me that is what he was implying.
I may say that there are some reports that there may be a
disruption of services. We have not yet received a complete
report, but I can assure honourable senators that the government is doing everything to bring this matter to a satisfactory
conclusion.

Senator Flynn: The Prime Minister said he is confident, and
will remain confident, that an arrangement can be made. I
think the events of the next few weeks will prove that to be
correct.
Senator Oison: A final supplementary question-

Senator Flynn: We are back where we were.
LABOUR RELATIONS

Senator Flynn: Are you sure of that?
Senator Oison: Yes. Can the Leader of the Government
advise us whether or not a reasonable offer has been made to

SENATE DEBATES
the Province of Alberta respecting these prices, or perhaps
even an offer they cannot refuse?
Senator Flynn: You can understand that the government
would make only reasonable offers.
Senator Oison: That is not the way Premier Lougheed
sounded.
Senator Austin: I should like to ask a supplementary. If
Premier Lougheed thought negotiations were going as well as
the government leader thinks they are, why would he have
made a statement of the kind he made? I wonder if the
government leader would guide us in that respect.
An Hon. Senator: Ask him!
Senator Flynn: That statement was made some days ago.
Senator Austin: It was made last Monday. Do you mean
that something has changed in the meantime, Senator Flynn?
Senator Flynn: I am quite confident that things are going
better.
Senator Austin: Has the government made a further proposal to the Premier of Alberta that leads to that confidence?
Senator Flynn: There are continuing negotiations.
Senator Austin: I wonder if the government leader would
assure this house that it is the policy of the government that
Canadian oil and gas prices should rise to the level that
induces conservation and encourages new energy development,
but no further than that.
Senator Flynn: Yes.
HEALTH AND WELFARE
FAMIIY ALLOWANCES

Senator Bird: I should like to ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate if he could set at rest certain repeated
rumours that are causing a great deal of distress among
facilities in this country. I hope he can reassure us and
reassure those families.
Is it truc that the government is planning to pay for the first
stage of the proposed mortgage tax credit by taking away
family allowances from the upper-income bracket peoplehalf the population of Canada?
Senator Flynn: I have heard nothing about that.
Senator Bird: I have a supplementary question. Is the
government planning to do anything about taking awav family
allowances from any group of people in Canada?
Senator Flynn: I have no knowledge of that.
Senator Oison: There are lots of things that happen in
cabinet that you don't scem to know about.
Senator Bird: Would the Leader of the Government be kind
enough to speak to the minister responsible for social security
and let this house know what his plans are?
[Senator O!son.)

November 1, 1979

Senator Flynn: What exactly do you want to know? Do you
want to know what goes through the minds of the Minister of
National Health and Welfare and others as they proceed in
reviewing the whole spectrum of social security and things of
that nature? Is that what you want? If any decision is made, it
will be made known to Parliament in due course.
Senator Bird: I hope the Leader of the Government will not
give us a whole review of social security.
Senator Choquette: You want a bird's eye view!
Senator Bird: What I am asking about is family allowances.
Senator Oison: He hasn't heard about that yet. I think he
must be an outsider in the inner cabinet.

QUEBEC REFERENDUM
PUBLICATION OF PROVINCIAL WHITE PAPER

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of State for CIDA.
First, I would like to point out to this house that the white
paper on sovereignty-association is supposed to be released in
the province of Quebec, which might also mark at the same
time the start of a great debate which may or may not be
resolved during the coming year. I believe this date is worth
pointing out.
I would like to point out at the same time a statement
attributed to the Honourable Senator Asselin, the Minister of
State for CIDA, to the effect that contrary to what his leader,
the Right Honourable Joe Clark, had just stated, he would not
campaign under the umbrella set up under the referendum
legislation. I do not say that is the intention of the honourable
minister, but the reporter says that Senator Asselin was inspired by the position taken by the Honourable Roch La Salle,
who in this context seems to be the one who defines the general
policy of the party. That worries me a bit.
In any case, that is what the honourable minister says, that
he does not want to work under the umbrella as defined in the
legislation. But, on the other hand, at the same time he wants
to be free to defend his opinions on the form of federalism he
thinks we should have. Does that mean he is going to make his
whole campaign without there being a general policy from the
government and the Conservative Party on this important
problem?
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I want to say there
will be a general policy. I also want to say that the conclusions
reporters drew from my statement were not those I had in
mind. He asked me if I would vote yes or no on the question
put by the Government of Quebec. I told him: "Do not take
me for an idiot, I do not know the question. When I know it, I
will be able to make up my mind."
He also asked me if I would participate under the umbrella
legislation of the provincial government. I said: "Not necessarily." However, I said that nobody would stop me from going
into the riding of Charlevoix to defend Canadian federalism.

November 1, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Nor could anybody in this house stop me from expressing my
opinions.
Senator Marchand: Nobody is going to stop you from going
into the riding of Charlevoix, I hope. I do not think anyone
would try to do that. But I expect, nevertheless, on the part of
the government in power at this time-and I am saying this in
the least partisan way possible, if you want-a very specific
statement, because based on the reports we sec there is no
consistency between the statements by the Right Honourable
Prime Minister, Mr. La Salle and yours. I think that if there is
a time when we must have consistency, without having necessarily the same political ideas, but to have consistency in our
positions, it is indeed at this crucial moment when the future
of Canada is probably at stake. So I think the fact that the
minister can make speeches in Charlevoix does not indicate
there will be consistency in the general policy.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, the question raised
by Senator Marchand is important. If, of course, during the
referendum campaign Senator Marchand and I were to meet
on the same platform in the same room to defend federalism, I
think our points of view would be close.
Senator Denis: I would like to put a supplementary question
to the minister. When he says that nobody will prevent him
from speaking in Charlevoix, does he mean that he will take
part in the referendum campaign, either for or against,
depending on the question asked, even if it is confused?
Senator Asselin: I am a Canadian citizen from Quebec and
it is obvious that, when we witness important events for the
future of Quebecers such as those which will occur this year,
as a minister I will surely intervene in the debates.
Senator Denis: Thank you.

HEALTH AND WELFARE
DANGERS OF MARIJUANA SMOKING-EDUCATION OF PUBLIC

Senator Haidasz: I direct a question to the government
leader in his capacity as Minister of Justice. In view of the
alarming fact, which was revealed in Ottawa yesterday by a
certain national organization, that three and a half million
Canadians smoke marijuana, I should like to ask the Minister
of Justice why the government is not conducting an intensive
public education program on the dangers of marijuana smoking, and why it has not allocated more resources to stop
trafficking in marijuana and other illegal narcotics.
Senator Flynn: I may say that this question is under active
consideration. Certainly it has some value. It ail depends, of
course, on the conclusion that the Department of National
Health and Welfare will draw from its present study of the
situation.
As I said yesterday, or perhaps the day before, the matter of'
whether or not we should decriminalize marijuana is also
under active consideration.

It is quite obvious that if marijuana is dangerous to health,
then the honorable senator's suggestion is worthwhile. I can
assure him that the matter is under consideration.
Senator Oison: What is the conclusion of the Minister of
Justice?
Senator Flynn: We must await completion of the study.
CRIMINAL CODE
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE OF MINISTERS
RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE-COMMUNIQUÉ

Senator Haidasz: In the communiqué of the Federal-Provincial Conference of Ministers Responsible for Criminal Justice,
which the minister tabled in the Senate yesterday, there is no
mention of provincial representations and discussions concerning gambling casinos and off-track betting.
Would the Minister of Justice take the Senate into his
confidence and tell us what the government's view is on those
two matters?
Senator Flynn: I do not think that question was discussed,
or, if it was, it was discussed only incidentally. I know there
have been exchanges on that matter between officials, and I
know that the Minister of Agriculture is considering the
problem, since it comes within his jurisdiction. However, no
conclusion has yet been reached.
OFF-TRACK BETTING

Senator Buckwold: I have a supplementary question for the
Minister of Justice concerning off-track betting. Honourable
senators will recall that towards the end of the last Parliament
a special subcommittee of the Senate was appointed, with
myself as chairman and the late respected Senator Wagner as
deputy chairman, to review the question of off-track betting.
Perhaps honourable senators will allow me one or two
sentences as a preamble to my question. I was in touch with
the department to determine whether it wanted to have the
committee reconstituted, and I spoke briefly with the minister.
I have been advised, although not in writing, that there is no
intention of re-establishing the committee. I accept that decision. The committee had just commenced its study, but if it is
the wish of the government to take a different route, then that
is quite satisfactory to me. However, there is a great deal of
interest in the subject, and I have received numerous calls
inquiring as to what has happened. That is the reason for my
question.
The Minister of Justice may wish to take my question as
notice. Since the committee has not been reconstituted, and in
view of the fact that the industry is very much concerned that
there should be a prompt resolution of this subject, is it the
intention of the Minister of Agriculture to recommend the
legalization of off-track betting, or can the minister announce
what further studies, if any, are to be undertaken?
Senator Flynn: In order for me to give a precise reply to the
question, I shall have to take it as notice.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Buckwold: It is not my wish to take sides on this
matter, and certainly the minister may do whatever he wishes,
but for the satisfaction of those who are involved and who are
anxiously awaiting some response, a detailed reply would, in
my view, be in order.
Senator Flynn: Very good.
INDUSTRY
ASSISTANCE TO AUTOMOTIVE PARTS MANUFACTURERS

Senator Bosa: In the absence of the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce, I direct my question to the Leader of
the Government in the Senate. The Minister of State for
International Trade indicated recently that this government is
considering initiatives to assist automotive parts manufacturers in Canada in the area of research and development.
Would the Leader of the Government inform this house
what those initiatives are, particularly in view of the fact that
the deficit in the automotive sector will be shown to have
increased when the figures are released at the end of this
week?
Senator Flynn: I shall have to take that question as notice.
[Translation]
CRIMINAL CODE
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE OF MINISTERS
RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

Senator Robichaud: Honourable senators, I would like to
follow up on a question i asked yesterday of the government
leader and Minister of Justice concerning the conference held
on October 25 and 26 between the attorneys general and the
Minister of Justice. Yesterday, the Minister of Justice said,
and I quote:
The senator is of course well aware of the government's
position, which is to keep the status quo, that is abolition,
even though there will be a free vote should a bill to this
effect be introduced for Commons or even Senate
approval.
My question is simply this: when exactly in the history of
the present government or of the Conservative Party was the
official position favouring abolition of capital punishment
taken, and to what documents can I refer?
Senator Flynn: You can refer to the statements made by the
Prime Minister since the new government was sworn in. He
has said many times that as far as capital punishment is
concerned he is in favour of maintaining the present situation,
that is, of maintaining abolition. He has added, however, that
should a proposal be introduced in Parliament for the reinstatement of capital punishment, the government would allow
a free vote on the matter. i do not think that it is very difficult
to interpret the government's policy. As for the Progressive
Conservative Party taking an official position on the issue, 1 do
not know. I do not remember.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
PETRO-CANADA-GOVERNMENT POLICY

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, in the other place, on
October 29 last, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the
subjet of the borrowing authority, said:
Mr. Speaker, 76 per cent support our mortgage proposal. I did not make that up; that is the result of the
Gallup poîl. It is the mortgage and property tax credit
plan that honourable gentlemen opposite have been scoffing at for the last three or four days, particularly the
honourable member from Manitoba. As I say, 76 per cent
support the mortgage proposal-76 per cent, Mr. Speaker. i hope honourable gentlemen are going to help us get
it through the House, Mr. Speaker, so that we can have it
all in effect by Christmas.
In view of the Minister of Finance's reliance on Gallup polils
for policy making, i wonder if the government leader could
confirm, inasmuch as, according to a Gallup poil that
appeared on October 10, 1979, 75 per cent of Canadians like
Petro-Canada the way it is, and said that the federal oil
company should be kept in being, that the government will not
create a policy difference for 1 per cent.
Senator Flynn: Some arguments are better than others.
Senator Oison: Some polls are better than others.
Senator Flynn: If my memory serves me correctly, with
regard to faith in God, the last argument was universal
consent.
Senator Austin: I think the government leader is more
abstruse and abstract than usual.
Senator Flynn: Well, with you I am afraid that I have to be.
Senator Austin: But then your explanations have always
been difficult for me to follow.
i take it, however, that you are saying, as the Minister of
Finance said, that Gallup polis are the guiding beacon of this
government's policy.
Senator Flynn: No, no. We use them when it serves our
purpose.
Senator Perrault: When it is convenient.
Senator Molgat: That is a good one.
Senator Asselin: This is a very good answer.
Senator Austin: Now that is an answer I can understand.
INDUSTRY, TRADE AND COMMERCE
MINISTER'S ABSENCE FROM CHAMBER

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, i have a question for
the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I wonder, to
satisfy my curiosity, if he could tell us who, in the absence of

November

SENATE DEBATES

the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, is the acting
minister?
Senator Flynn: Do you mean in this house?
Senator Argue: No. Who is the acting minister? My impression is that when a minister is away there is always an acting
minister appointed to take his place. I wonder if he is in this
chamber or the other place?
Senator Flynn: I think Mr. Wilson is the acting minister in
the other place.
As I said before, I do not know why there are all these
complaints about the absence of the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce. It was a desert here before, with only
the present Leader of the Opposition as government leader,
with responsibility for no department. Now that we have three
ministers in the Senate you are complaining, and on top of
three ministers you want parliamentary secretaries and, as
Senator Argue seems to be suggesting, acting ministers as
well.
Senator Argue: I think there always is an acting minister,
and I am just wondering if, in the absence of the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce, the Senate has in fact lost
that minister since there is no acting minister in the Senate. I
think it would be helpful if the government leader were the
acting minister, and then we could go on with these important
questions.
Senator Flynn: You can always direct to me questions
intended for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce,
or the Minister of Finance, or the Minister of Indian Affairs
and Northern Development, or even the Minister of Agriculture, although, with respect to questions about agriculture,
very seldom will I be able to reply because I do not have your
expertise.
Senator Oison: We know that.
Senator Flynn: If Senator Olson were in my place, it would
be even worse.
Senator Marchand: On a point of order: I think the Leader
of the Government mentioned that under the former government we had only a minister without portfolio here in the
Senate. I must remind him that we had the Minister of
National Revenue for a period of time, and there is no
guarantee that those ministers who are here at this moment
will stay any longer than the former Minister of National
Revenue did.
Senator Flynn: We have already been here longer than he
was, so I am not too worried about that. It is, however, true
that that was an interesting period, when we could put questions to somebody who knew some of the answers.
Senator Oison: We are not in that position now.

ENERGY
PRICE OF DOMESTIC OIL-STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF ALBERTA

Senator Lamontagne: I should like to put a question to the
government leader. Now that he has received from the opposi-

tion the text of the speech delivered by Premier Lougheed,
could he assure the house that as soon as possible he will
forward a copy of that speech to Senator de Cotret and to the
Prime Minister of Canada?
Senator Flynn: I think that is unnecessary because they have
surely received it. However, I did not check the text to
determine if it was taken in shorthand or whether it was really
the text given by Premier Lougheed himself. There is nothing
to indicate it.
In any case it does not matter. I can tell you that the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources are
well aware of the situation. I am sure that they already had
the opportunity to speak with Mr. Lougheed. In addition, as I
said earlier, negotiations are going on, and I hope that the
opposition is just as anxious as the government to see them
concluded as soon as possible with a satisfactory agreement for
all parties concerned.
Senator Lamontagne: Of course it is our hope. However, I
wonder if the minister is aware of the statement made by the
Prime Minister yesterday afternoon in the House of Commons
when he said that he did not have the text of the speech made
by Premier Lougheed and that he had not been in touch with
him.
Now the government leader tells us this afternoon that there
have been sensational or quite substantial developments since
yesterday afternoon. I think he should make a progress report
because we are also quite interested in keeping up with that
vital question for Canada.
Senator Flynn: Unfortunately, you are no longer in the
government and when negotiations are carried on only ministers are involved in such a process.
Senator Lamontagne: Since yesterday afternoon?
Senator Flynn: What do you want me to tell you about what
has happened since yesterday? Tell me what I could say to
you.
I am simply saying that negotiations are carried on and that
we are very hopeful that they will lead to a satisfactory
settlement. What else do you want me to say? Do you want me
to repeat everything that was said and done? Do you think it
would help the process whether you are informed or not? Not
at all!
Senator Lamontagne: That is access to information.

Senator Lamontagne was raising the point that ministers do
not have a copy of this speech. Would you sec that they get
one, or would you like us to send them copies?

TRANSPORT
APPOINTMENT OF MANAGER OF SECOND CONTAINER
TERMINAL AT HALIFAX

Senator Barrow: I should like to ask the Leader of the
Government in the Senate if he would inquire of the minister
responsible for the National Harbours Board of Canada, and
inform this house, what the reason is for the delay in selecting
the organization to manage the second container terminal in
Halifax, and how soon we may expect the terminal manager to
be appointed.
The reason for asking this question is because of an article
which appeared in one of Canada's great newspapers, the
Globe and Mail of today's date, in which it is stated, in
reference to the port of Halifax:
Also awaited is the vital choice of an organization to
manage the terminal. The delay is becoming critical since
the appointment of a terminal operator is directly linked
to investments of up to $20-million in cargo handling
systems.

Surely on something as important as this-an agreement
that will set the pattern for oit prices for perhaps the next
three to five years-the government should keep the people of
Canada informed. It is the people of Canada who will be
affected by it.
Senator de Cotret: These are very important negotiations,

the public media. The negotiations have been ongoing. You are

SENATE DEBATES

On Friday last, Dr. James Gillies, the chief policy adviser to
the Right Honourable the Prime Minister-he could have
been at the same conference in Los Angeles-told a group of
economists in California, and I quote:
-Canada has the potential to become an important world
supplier of energy, possibly enough to return the Middle
East to the insignificance it so richly deservesI see some government members applauding that statement.
Obviously, then, this view must represent official government
policy.
First of all, was the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce present when this rather startling statement of apparent
government policy was made?
Senator de Cotret: First, let me thank the honourable
senator for his welcoming me back to the chamber. As he
knows, I was in Los Angeles representing the Government of
Canada at a meeting-the first in a series of such meetings in
key American cities-with a representative group of American
businessmen to acquaint those businessmen with the potential
that exists in Canada for the next decade. Obviously, honourable senators will appreciate that, given the kind of trade
situation and current account situation we face, this is a very
high public policy priority on our part.
I would like to report that the meeting went very well and
that the prospects for the Canadian economy, as described by
government spokesmen and spokesmen we had invited from
the private sector, representing a number of key industries,
were very interesting to our guests in the United States. Over
all, the meeting was a great success.
I recognize that the honourable senator is adept at taking
quotes from here and there. Last week, if I remember, he took
one from the speech by Premier Lougheed, and I would like to
assure the honourable senator that I read it very thoroughly.
Today his quote is from a speech given by Dr. Gillies. I did not
attend the function at which that speech was made; it was not
in the plans for my visit. This was a quotation taken totally out
of context, however, and I can only assure the honourable
senator, once again, that on verification with Dr. Gillies the
accurate description of what he said suggested that Canada, to
the extent that it was exposed to the vagaries of international
pricing, particularly at the hands of cartels, would benefit
greatly from self-sufficiency, from security of supply, from
being masters in our own house, and, relative to what happened in 1973, that we would welcome not having powerful
foreign cartels dictating domestic policy actions. If the comment is looked upon in the whole context of the remarks he
was making it will be seen that it is a comment that is
extremely plausible.
Senator Perrault: May I suggest to the honourable minister
that after the traumatic events of recent months with respect
to the sensibilities of certain nations in the Middle East, this is
hardly the time for the chief policy adviser to the Right
Honourable the Prime Minister to say, "The Middle East
should be returned to the insignificance it so richly deserves,"

80072-17

unless the minister, this evening, denies that those words were
actually employed.
It is significant, honourable senators, that in defence of what
he said, Mr. Gillies stated, in response to a suggestion that he
may have "opened old wounds," "I can see now that I might
have, but that never entered my mind down in Los Angeles."
Now, Mr. Minister, why not state candidly to the Senate
that these were obviously very unfortunate remarks by the
senior policy adviser? I would suggest that the Right Honourable the Prime Minister should call Mr. Gillies into his office
and discuss with him critically his statement made at a time
when our relations with certain nations in this world are in a
very sensitive condition. I want to ask the minister whether at
this time there have been any adverse reactions to this speech
from the embassies of any Middle East countries.
Senator de Cotret: First of all, the most deplorable fact is
the interpretation that is being given to these remarks, and,
unfortunately, being applied by the honourable senator opposite. The remarks in question have to be looked at in the
context in which they were spoken. They were not meant to
downgrade the importance of the relationships that we have,
and hope to develop further, with the Arab states. I will make
no apology for the fact that we do intend to develop strong
relationships and improve our bilateral trade patterns with the
Arab states.
I would also like to say, speaking of adverse reaction, that I
was informed late this afternoon that the Government of Saudi
Arabia had signed an important contract with a Canadian
firm. I do not have the details this evening. I will be happy to
give honourable senators the details of this contract at the next
sitting of this house.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I do not think the
minister should place himself in the position of defending the
indefensible. What, in his view, constitutes, "the degree of
insignificance that the Middle East so richly deserves"? What
does this mean? Does it have any meaning at all, or is this
position totally denied by the government?
9 (2030)
Senator de Cotret: I have a lot of difficulty attempting to
answer a question like that. I would like to think that energy
policy decisions made anywhere outside this country do not
have a direct effect or significance on what we do in this
country. That is why we want to become self-sufficient in
energy. That is the whole name of the game-so we can make
and call the shots.
Senator Perrault: This is my final supplementary: Is it
anticipated that Mr. Stanfield will be sent on a second expedition to the Middle East in order to explain Canada's position?
Senator de Cotret: Of course not.

SENATE DEBATES
East in the past quarter century. I should like to ask the
honourable minister in charge of CIDA, an important and
proven internationalist, a question in relation to a very significant issue which, in my judgment, indicates our concern for
the whole international scene.
The great poet, John Keats, described the civilized man as
one for whom the miseries of the world are a misery. The
Secretary of State for External Affairs made a statement
yesterday in relation to the appalling suffering, proven and
elaborated upon, in Cambodia or Kampuchea-the change of
name is insignificant to me, but the suffering is meaningful to
me. Can the minister in charge of CIDA indicate to this very
important chamber what the Canadian government's attitude
is towards that terrible, appalling and painful area of world
suffering? I would ask him to expatiate upon his policy.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I think this house
already knows the thrust of the speech made by the Secretary
of State for External Affairs yesterday at the United Nations
concerning Cambodia and Kampuchea. I believe the Secretary
of State for External Affairs expressed on behalf of Canadians
all the sympathy our people have for Cambodia and Kampuchea, a country dying of famine and disease. I believe that so
as not to be accused of contradicting the Secretary of State for
External Affairs, i would like to quote two paragraphs from
the speech she delivered yesterday at the United Nations
which will enable you to judge the whole thrust of her
statement.
[English]
Senator Olson: You just happen to have that?
Senator Asselin: I will explain it to you later on.
Senator Flynn: It would take too long.
Senator Asselin: No, it will not take too long.
Senator Flynn: To state it to him?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: The Secretary of State for External Affairs
said the following yesterday at the United Nations, and i
quote:
I am able to announce that Canada's contribution to the
relief of famine and disease in Kampuchea has now been
increased to $15 million.
We know we had already decided on a contribution of $5
million, so the minister has increased the amount by $10
million.
We will determine specifically in the coming weeks the
way in which those funds will be channelled in the
international campaign.
As others have donc, I can only congratulate the Secretary
of State for External Affairs for her attitude in this unfortunate tragedy Cambodians are now going through. I urge her to
continue to bring relief to those people.
[Senator Macquarrie.]

[English]
IRAN-OCCUPATION OF UNITED STATES EMBASSY

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I wonder if i could
ask Senator Asselin whether the Secretary of State for External Affairs has, as yet, associated herself with the remarks of
Prime Minister Thatcher in connection with the very unfortunate event that has taken place in Tehran regarding American
embassy staff and families.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: No, i did not get in touch with the Secretary of State for External Affairs concerning what I just
related to honourable senators. I am sure the Canadian
Department of External Affairs is following very closely the
situation and we sympathize with what is happening to the
Americans in Iran.
[English]
Senator Austin: I thank the minister for the general answer,
but i wonder if any minister of the government is able to
inform this house whether this government has represented, in
the strongest possible terms, its outrage and the outrage of
Canadians at the behaviour of what is left of the Iranian
government towards American citizens, particularly the
American citizens working for the United States of America in
Iran.
Senator Flynn: May i say that the House of Commons
today adopted a motion-I do not remember by whom it was
presented-condemning the actions of the Iranian government.
It was presented under standing order 43 of their rules and it
was adopted unanimously.
Senator Austin: Would the government leader undertake to
make representations to the Secretary of State for External
Affairs urging her to advise the Government of Iran, in at least
the same terms as used by Prime Minister Thatcher, of the
attitude of Canadians towards the events that have occurred in
that country.
Senator Flynn: I shall certainly convey that message, but if
you want to present the same motion that was moved in the
House of Commons, and, if the Senate adopts it, it will
become even more evident to the Secretary of State for
External Affairs what the attitude of the Senate is in this
matter. I am sure, though, that she understood what was said
in the house.
ENERGY
IRAN-SUPPLY OF OIL TO CANADA

Senator Perrault: May I direct a further question on this
subject to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In
view of the resignation of the Government of Iran today and
the partial dependence of Canada on Iranian oil supplies-to
the extent of about 100,000 barrels a day-and the National
Energy Board report last week which suggested that the oil
supply situation in Canada could be tight this winter, have any
representations gone forward at any level, including political

or economic, to the Iranian authorities to ensure that the
supply of oil to Canada will not be interrupted as a resuit of
the disruptions taking place there?

Quebecers. That position was made known. On the other hand,
I have never had, officially or otherwise, any discussions about
the participation of the province in the purchase of Canadair.

Senator de Cotret: We are following the situation very
closely, but, as has been said, the government has resigned.
How can we have contact with the government when the
government has resigned?
Senator Perrault: There is still a head of state. There are
political contacts there, contacts in the revolutionary committee. This is what I ask.
Senator de Cotret: Be assured, honourable senators, that ail
due representations will be made.

Senator Denis: Recently, in reply to some of my questions,
the senator said that the minister-I mean Mr. Landry-did
not say anything about keeping Canadair for Quebecers.

[Translation]

Senator Denis: One last question: does the government
intend to put Canadair up for sale before the Quebec
referendum?

CROWN CORPORATIONS
POSSIBLE SALE OF ASSETS OF CANADAIR

Senator Denis: Honourable senators, may I ask a question
to the Minister of State for Economic Development?
Senator de Cotret: Yes.
Senator Denis: Recently I asked him a question about the
Quebec minister, Mr. Landry, who seems to be quite concerned that Canadair should remain in Quebec. Since you met
that minister yesterday, I would like to know if the purchase of
Canadair was mentioned?
Senator de Cotret: I would like to answer that in our
discussions with our counterparts in the Quebec cabinet we did
mention the development of the aeronautical industry, especially in the Montreal area. No question was raised about the
sale, or the means, process or details of the sale of Canadair.
Senator Denis: Did Mr. Landry not mention that he would
like that company to remain in Quebec and belong to
Quebecers?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, the only comment
made in that regard was that the Quebec Minister of Economic Development mentioned that a group of Quebecers was
interested in purchasing the assets of the government in Canadair. There has been no discussion about the members of that
group nor about special interests involved. I should point out
that it was a passing remark made during the discussion but no
specific reference was made in the Orders of the Day.
Senator Denis: In other words, you do not care whether or
not Quebec buys Canadair.
Senator Flynn: The province!
Senator Denis: The province or Quebecers, it matters little,
because the newspapers publish the statements of the minister
to the effect that it would be a crime if Quebec, the government or Quebecers should lose Canadair. I would like the
minister to tell us whether or not the subject was discussed
seriously at their last meeting. I sec it was not.
Senator de Cotret: I should like to repeat to the honourable
senator that Quebec, in the past, made it known very clearly
that it would prefer to see the shares of Canadair bought by

Senator de Cotret: I remember your questions very well, as I
also do my answers. In my discussions with Mr. Landry no
mention was ever made of the province of Quebec being
interested directly in participating in the purchase, by the
private sector. In that case, it would no longer be a private
purchase of the assets the Government of Canada now holds in
Canadair. Nothing was ever said about that.

Senator de Cotret: The timetable followed with regard to
the decision to hand over some crown corporations to the
private industry is in absolutely no way related to the
referendum.
Senator Denis: But that is not my question. I asked whether
Canadair would be put up for sale before the referendum, that
is, in the spring of 1980. That is easy to answer. If you do not
intend to put it up for sale, just tell us so.
Senator de Cotret: It has been clearly indicated that these
corporations are to be sold to the private sector under certain
conditions, and that a committee would establish the terms of
the transfer. You mentioned the referendum. Nobody knows
exactly when it will be held. So how could I say whether it will
be put up for sale before or after the referendum.
Senator Denis: Well, just tell us then when will it be put up
for sale?
Senator de Cotret: When we are good and ready.
Senator Denis: I do hope you get a good price for it.

TRANSPORT
RUMOURED MERGER OF AIR CANADA AND CP AIR

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, to continue on the
subject of aviation, rumours are going around more and more
that Air Canada and CP Air are currently negotiating a
possible merger. Could the minister advise us whether these
rumours are well founded and whether the government has
formally heard about it?
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge, no. I have
heard nothing about it and I have not had any report about
discussions on that subject.
Now that is my own personal view. However I can ask my
colleagues if they have heard anything. AIl I can say is that
personally, I have not heard anything to that effect.

1 have here the text of the speech deiivered by the Minister of
Transport. Hc spoke of certain actions and he mentioned the
possibiiity of an agreement between CP Air and Air Canada
concerning the rationaliiation of international routes. However
this was nat a suggestion on his part. If Senator Marchand

Oison \vould like ta suggest that there will bc "a certain

minîster is only thinking of some rationalization in the use of
international routes. That is ail it is and I think that the text

This is a miatter which was raised with Quebec last summer,
specificaliy between the Minister of Transport, Mr. Mazankowski. and the then Quebec Minister of Transport, Mr.
Lessard. As you know, there was a cabinet reshuffle in Quebec
and a new Transport Minister was appointed.
There is however, a small study group with representatives
from the Quebcc Department of Transport and the federal
Ministry of Transport studying the matter. According ta
scheduie, this group must repart by December 25 and a
decision wiil then be reached as regards mass transit and

Ohviously, bath parties wish ta resolve that matter as soon

SENATE DEBATES

National Research Centre in Boucherville, to name only those
two.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, really, there are
limits to the extent one is allowed to exaggerate.
As far as Place Guy-Favreau is concerned, the Liberal
administration spent 12 years-that is four electoral campaigns-shouting their mouths off about it. Yesterday, we said
very clearly that a specific decision would be made and
announced within the next few weeks about that project.
On September 14, the Minister of Supply and Services
announced that the government would proceed as quickly as
possible with the Boucherville National Research Centre
project.
I could mention others. The files we are discussing are those
the previous government tried to bury for years after years.
They brought them back to life during each election campaign
to make political hay.
Senator Rizzuto: I addressed my question to the honourable
minister and instead of answering, he described what the
former federal government did when they were in power.
That was not my question. I did not want to know that; I
wanted to know whether this new government bas actually
done anything.
Senator Charbonneau: That is not a question. That is a
speech.
Senator Rizzuto: That was not a speech. I asked a clear and
simple question: What has this government donc for the
Quebecers during the five months since it came to power?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, after listing those
projects, I will say the former government did very little.
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I rise on a point of
order.
I think that the Minister of State for Economic Development might be going a little too far because as far the Guy
Favreau plaza is concerned, the facts, as he has been told, are
that the federal government made the purchase with the
intention of building this plaza simply because this was necessary to build the Desjardins plaza in Montreal.
Senator Flynn: This is possible. After we were attacked so
vigorously by Senator Rizzuto, we may have made a slight
exaggeration, but this does not surprise me as it occurred
much more often in your time.
Senator Marchand: This bas probably happened in the past,
but if you accept this, it is all right.
Senator Flynn: We are quite ready to accept this.
Senator Rizzuto: Honourable senators, the Leader of the
Government does not seem to have liked my intervention.
Senator Flynn: No, I did not like it.
Senator Rizzuto: The honourable Leader of the Government
does not look pleased about my intervention. As a matter of
fact, we may no longer be able to be sure about the answers
given by the three ministers who sit in this assembly if they

continue to tell us that we may have some answers in January
and affirmative replies in the spring.
We want an answer to this for the population of Canada and
the population of Quebec. This is what we do not have.
Senator Flynn: I shall give you answers. But the trouble is
that when we give you answers, you do not understand.
Some Hon. Senators: Order.
Senator Rizzuto: Honourable senators, I would ask the
Leader of the Government to withdraw his comments because
I do not think that we can understand his answer if he does not
answer our questions.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
CIDA-AID TO CAMBODIA

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I am sorry that I
cannot continue with the fire that has been roused so far in the
Question Period. My question is directed to the Minister of
State for the Canadian International Development Agency.
No doubt he will be glad to know that it is relatively simple.
I am delighted to hear that the Government of Canada has
announced a $15 million contribution to those who need it so
badly in Cambodia.
My question to the minister is in relation to his announcement last week that up to $100 million could be deducted from
the budgetary expenditures of CIDA. Their work, in the
opinion of many, is most important as well as being a help to
refugees and others in Cambodia. Will this $15 million that
the Government of Canada has now directed for this worthwhile cause be an additional deduction from the expenditures
of CIDA?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: I will try to get that information from the
Secretary of State for External Affairs whose department has
already provided $5 million for the Canadian International
Development Agency.
I will inquire and answer the honourable senator's question
later.
[English]
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I think it is important that we get the answer to this question.
Senator Asselin: I do not mean that you will not have the
answer. I have told you that I will take notice of your question
and give you the answer tomorrow or perhaps at a later date.
Senator Buckwold: Thank you. I am delighted that $15
million is being given, but I am sure the Senate would be most
anxious to know that we are not giving with one hand and
taking away with the other.
MEETING OF UNALIGNED NATIONS, HAVANA, CUBA-POSTURE
TOWARDS CANADA

Senator Bird: Honourable senators, two weeks ago I asked
the minister responsible for CIDA on behalf of the Depart-

SENATE DEBATES
ment of External Affairs for a transcription of those sections in
which Canada was mentioned in debates at the summit conference of non-aligned nations at Havana. Since then I have
received a memorandum from his office saying that, unfortunately, there is no such transcription.
However, I was sent a copy of the final declaration from the
conference, and in paragraphs 73 and 74 Canada is called an
"imperialist" power, along with the United States, Great
Britain, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan,
Belgium, Italy, Australia and Israel. The reason given in the
declaration is, I think, understandable. It is that those nations
"cannot escape blame for the existence and maintenance of
racist oppression and the criminal policy of apartheid, because
of their political, diplomatie, economic, military, nuclear and
other forms of collaboration with the Pretoria regime to deny
the South African people their legitimate aspirations."
The memorandum also stated that several countries such as
Sri Lanka had publicly disassociated themselves from paragraph 73, but that the Department of External Affairs had no
"definitive list" of the other countries.
I want to thank the honourable minister for providing me
with this information. Today I would like to ask him two
things. First, would he table in this house any further mention
of Canada that the Department of External Affairs has found
in its study of the proceedings, or in its observance of the
proceedings, of the Havana conference? For example, I think
it is important that the Senate know what Pakistan said, and
why, when, as has been stated by the Minister of External
Affairs, it led the attack on Canada.
Second, I would ask the minister to table the definitive list
of those unaligned nations that disassociated themselves from
section 73 of the final communiqué. I assume that by now the
department must have the definitive list, and I cannot help
feeling that it is rather important that we should know it and
that the government should know it in order to form foreign
policy.
*

(2100)

Senator Asselin: I believe this is a question that should be
put on the order paper. It might be easier for the minister to
answer the question in detail if that were the case. However,
having listened to the question, I shall inquire of the minister
and determine the details. I will be happy to answer that later
on.
THE ECONOMY
EXCHANGE VALUE OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question to
put to the Minister of State for Economic Development. On
October 10, 1979, I asked the minister the following question:
The Governor of the Bank of Canada, in his statement,
said that one of the reasons why interest rates in Canada
had to be increased was that we could not allow the
Canadian dollar to fall any further in terms of the curren[Senator Bird.]

November 6,

1979

cies of our major trading partners because of the inflationary effect that would have.
Given that the government agrees with the action of the
Governor of the Bank of Canada, does that indicate that
there is now a floor under the Canadian dollar?
I have been reading Hansard but I have not been able to find
an answer to that question. I wonder if the minister has given
one yet.
Senator de Cotret: No, I have not. I referred the question to
the Minister of Finance. There is no doubt that because of his
heavy schedule he has not given me a specific answer that he
would like to communicate to Senator Everett. I will bring the
matter to his attention again, and as soon as he provides me
with an answer, I would be happy to give the answer to
Senator Everett.
Senator Everett: I have a supplementary question, Mr.
Minister.
Within four days, a month will have elapsed since the
question was asked. The question relates to a statement made
by the Governor of the Bank of Canada. That statement was
clear and unequivocal and given to the press. The question
relates to the very heart of economic policy.
I undersand that you have communicated the question to the
Minister of Finance. I must say that I am surprised that you
cannot answer a simple question like that. It does put into
question how much control you have over economic policy in
this country. It is just too long for Parliament to wait for an
answer to a question which was raised by the Governor of the
Bank of Canada in hisSenator Snith (Colchester): We waited for months.
Senator Everett: Do you want to continue that sort of thing?
Is that your policy?
Senator Steuart: You should be on this side if you do.
Senator Everett: The minister is doing a good job of continuing that policy. I would like an answer to a very straightforward question, and I will repeat it to him: Is there a floor
under the Canadian dollar?
Senator de Cotret: 1shall endeavour to provide an answer to
my honourable friend as soon as I possibly can.
However, I would like to underline the fact that the Minister of Finance has responsibility for the stabilization policy
and has responsibility of the overall fiscal framework. The
Minister of Finance has direct reponsibility over the actions
that are taken under the foreign exchange account. Those are
not responsibilities that fall under the longer term purview of
the Commitee on Economic Development. The Minister of
Finance is the Minister of Finance.
While I would be happy to give you my own views on the
situation, the answer to the question is an answer that should
be provided not by me but by the Minister of Finance in his
capacity.
Senator Everett: I agree that the Minister of Finance should
provide the answer. I just think that it has taken an inordinate-

November 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

ly long time. As i say, it does bring into question how well the
government has the economy and economic policy under control. Since you have offered to give us your views, I would be
satisfied to hear those now as an interim answer until the
Minister of Finance gets an opportunity to answer the
question.
Senator Olson: Give us Gillies' opinion, too.
Senator Flynn: I suggest that the Minister of Finance must
understand exactly what you mean.
Senator Molgat: The minister offered us his views.
[Translation]
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE OIL FROM MEXICO

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of State for Economic Development.
When I asked my question on October 30th-pardon me, I
did not hear what you said?
Senator Flynn: It was addressed to me.
Senator Lamontagne: You said a moment ago that I did not
dare stand in my place, see.
When about a week ago I asked the Minister of State for
Economic Development a question on our trade relations with
Mexico, he stated several times that additional negotiations
were not needed to implement the agreements discussed by the
former government and that they would simply be initialled
during a forthcoming visit of the President of Mexico to
Canada.
On the other hand, our ambassador in Mexico told Le
Devoir on October 30th this story concerning the agreement
on industrial co-operation, and I quote:
We are working on a mechanism needed to implement
this agreement before the visit to Canada of the Mexican
President.
As far as the agreement on oil is concerned, our ambassador, Mr. Claude Charland, has said that the negotiations on
price and delivery could be resumed very shortly.
In view of these contradictory statements, can the minister
tell us who is right, the ambassador to Mexico or himself?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I do not see any
contradiction between the remarks made by our ambassador to
Mexico, Mr. Charland, and the answers I gave the other night.
With reference to agreements on economic co-operation, it
is understood that Canada is seeking a means to make that
agreement effective, not with a view to a final conclusion but
rather to an intervention, an actual Canadian presence on the
Mexican market.
I think I also mentioned in my answer the other eveningpardon me? We do not have to negotiate that. How can we
ensure that this agreement will be profitable as expected by
both sides? In addition, it is understood that every effort is
being made to ensure that the agreement is fruitful.

As far as the agreement on energy pricing is concerned, the
agreement itself deals with the matter of delivery, since the
question of pricing has not been settled.
It is rather an agreement on principle. Furthermore, it is
understood that, in the years to come, we will have to discuss
specific price components and delivery dates.
Therefore, I do not find any inconsistency between the
remarks of the ambassador and the answer I gave the other
night.
Senator Lamontagne: Is it not true that in the agreement
which had been signed with Mexico by the former Minister of
Energy, it said that oil deliveries would reach Canada as of the
end of 1979?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I should like to
take notice of this question in order to give you a detailed
answer. At this time, to the best of my knowledge I would
answer no. But I should like to check the records to give you a
more precise answer.
Senator Lamontagne: A last supplementary question on that
matter. Is it not true, as reported in Le Devoir, that the
agreement on energy has yet to be signed, and I quote:
Has yet to be signed by the two ministers concerned.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, to the best of my knowledge, it has
yet to be signed at the ministerial level.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA-TRIAL OF CHARTER 77 MEMBERS

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I would like to ask
the Minister of State for the Canadian International Development Agency to answer a question on foreign policy. Would
the minister inform us whether the Government of Canada has
sent a formal note to the Government of Czechoslovakia
expressing concern about the way the recent trial of certain
members of Charter 77 was conducted and the harsh sentences
imposed on those persons for demanding their rights according

Senator Haidasz: I have a supplementary question. Can the
minister inform us whether any federal government officials
are monitoring violations of agreements provided in the Helsinki Final Act in preparation for Canada's position at the
forthcoming Madrid review conference?
Senator Asselin: The answer is the same. I shall take the
question as notice and will provide an answer in due course.
Why is the Honourable Senator Hays laughing?

TRANSPORT
SPEECH OF MINISTER TO AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION OF
CANADA TABLED

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, I wish to direct a
question to Senator Flynn. In his reply to Senator Marchand's
question regarding the so-called blueprint for Canadian aviation, laid out in a speech given by the Honourable Donald
Mazankowski in Toronto, he waved what I presume was a
copy of the minister's speech. I wonder if the honourable
senator would be kind enough to table that copy if he has it.
According to the Citizen, the speech was very contradictory.
The minister spoke about a merger of both international and
national flights, which was contradictory to the main thrust of
his speech, which seemed to be directed to more competition
from Canada, and certainly from Saskatchewan. What we
look forward to is more competition. I wonder if the honourable senator would table his copy of that speech.
Senator Flynn: I will be pleased to table that document. I
am not surprised that in these complex areas the press may be
confused. They are often mixed up over more simple matters.
Senator Flynn then tabled:

ENERGY
PERMITS FOR OFFSHORE OIL EXPLORATIONFEDERAL-PROVINCIAL JURISDICTION

Senator Austin: I have a question for the Leader of the
Government in his capacity as Minister of Justice. Will the
federal government stand by licences and permits given for
offshore exploration in cases where those licences and permits
may be different from those awarded by a province'? In other
words, what I am asking the minister, who looks a little
puzzled, is whether grants in the form of licences from the
federal Crown which have been acted upon and on which
money has been spent, will be maintained, and also the
jurisdiction of the federal government maintained, in the event
of conflict with provincial permits which have been awarded?
Senator Flynn: That is a rather technical question. I shall
have to take it as notice. It seems to me that any agreement by
the federal government with a province concerning offshore
resources would include a solution to that problem.
Senator Austin: I wonder how it would be solved. We have
been giving permits to oil companies for drilling on the Grand
Banks and off the coast of Labrador. The Province of Newfoundland has awarded conflicting permits.
Senator Flynn: The province'?
[Senator Asselin.]

November 6, 1979

Senator Austin: Yes. The oil industry is keen to have an
assurance from the government that federal permits that have
been awarded, upon which money has been spent, will be valid
and that the government will not dissent or detract in any way
from that position in its negotiations with the Province of
Newfoundland.
Senator Flynn: The honourable senator mentioned two
things. He referred to conflicting permits by the province. He
mentioned conflicting permits by the federal government and
permits by the province.
If there are conflicting permits issued by the province, that
would be a problem for the province. If it is a conflict resulting
from permits granted by both governments, the issue will be
resolved with agreement on offshore resources.
I do not know very much about the technical aspects of the
problem, but from the aspect of pure logic, it would seem that
if the federal government has granted permits, it would ask the
provincial government to honour them. Perhaps I do not see
problems where my honourable friend sees them.
Senator Austin: That is often the case. As a supplementary
question, I am glad the minister understood my question
correctly on the second try. If the federal permits are not valid
and the provincial permits are maintained by the provincial
government, federal lessees will be looking for compensation
from the federal government. If the reverse is truc, the province of Newfoundland will have to pay compensation for
permits it has awarded.
Senator Flynn: That is part of the negotiations, I suspect.
INDUSTRY, TRADE AND COMMERCE
STATEMENT BY MINISTER AT LOS ANGELES

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and
Minister of State for Economic Development. Given the following statement that he made in Los Angeles, "The government should be a referee, not a central actor in the economy"-thereby, in my view, advocating a return to the old
laissez-faire attitude of the nineteenth century-given also the
statement, "The Clark government is pursuing a close economic partnership with business and labour groups," could the
minister tell us how a referee, responsible for the enforcement
of the rules of the game, can also actively participate in the
game by forming a close partnership with the players?
Senator Perrault: It would not be allowed in the CFL.
Senator de Cotret: Even in the CFL a referee could call in
both sides and have a little talk at the centre line. Certainly
when the outcome of the game is as important as the outcome
for this country of our economic development in the next
decade, I think it is not only incumbent on government but it is
its privilege, and its responsibility to bring together the other
major economic partners, to talk about where we are going as
a society, how we hope to get there, and make sure that
everyone clearly understands some of the problems and issues
that we shall have to overcome in achieving those goals.

November 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Certainly, when we talk about economic consultation, about
economic partnerships with the other major economic participants in our economy, that is the kind of dialogue that we hope
to develop and continue on an ongoing basis throughout the
next decade. When we talk aboutSenator Lamontagne: That is not my question.
Senator de Cotret: Your question, senator, if I understood
you correctly, is how I reconcile the thesis, or the approach, of
economic partnership and economic consultation with the
approach of government playing a less direct interventionist
policySenator Lamontagne: I said "referee."
Senator de Cotret: I will tell the honourable senator that i
firmly believe that the government of this country has all the
coercive powers it possibly needs to ensure the kind of economic and social development for which we strive. We do not have
to become the direct owner or a direct participant in the
process. We have ail the coercive powers that are required to
ensure that we overcome the difficulties that are in our path,
and that our partners proceed with us down that path to the
kind of goals and objectives that we set for ourselves. i do not
see any contradiction between the two themes.
Senator Lamontagne: i cannot see how you can be a partner
and a referee.
Senator Flynn: If you don't see it, so be it.
TRANSPORT
APPOINTMENT OF MANAGER OF SECOND CONTAINER
TERMINAL AT HALIFAX

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, i have a reply to
Senator Barrow's question of Thursday last in connection with
the appointment of a manager for the second container terminal in Halifax. The reason for the delay in selecting an
organization to manage the second container terminal is
accounted for by the need to re-tender after the first bid was
withdrawn.
After the second tender deadline was extended, only one
proposal was received, that from Halterm Ltd., and that
proposal is currently being evaluated to determine whether
negotiations should continue on the basis of that proposal.
The National Harbours Board must receive an appropriate
financial return from the potential operator, who in turn
should be prepared and able to make a commitment that
recognizes the prime importance of the new facility to the port
and its hinterland.
The government will make its decision when it is satisfied
that these conditions are met in the proposal submitted.
CRIMINAL CODE
OFF-TRACK BETTING

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, dealing with Senator
Buckwold's question of last Thursday in relation to the govern-

80072-18

ment's policy on off-track betting, may I say, first, that it is
the opinion of the Minister of Agriculture that this issue has
already been thoroughly studied. In fact, the reality that
studies have been under way without a decision being taken
has itself caused uncertainty within the industry.
The minister has met with both proponents and opponents in
a preliminary manner, and has asked his department to prepare a final discussion paper on off-track betting, which would
include a plan of action. It is his intention to take this proposed
action to both groups, seeking agreement, if possible.
The minister is on record as having said that if no agreement can be reached with both sides on the off-track betting
question, he will put his proposais to caucus and to cabinet and
will ask for a decision so that he might go ahead and implement a plan.
While the minister obviously wants a decision as soon as
possible, the process of consultation with the affected parties
will probably result in a decision by early 1980 at the soonest.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING CONSULATE IN WEST
JERUSALEM

Senator Asselin: Last week, Honourable Senator Haidasz
asked me to inform this house whether the government now
intends to open a consulate in Jerusalem. As I stated on
October 30, this government accepted ail of Mr. Stanfield's
recommendations, as included in his preliminary report. One
of the recommendations dealt with the question of a consulate.
It reads, and i quote:
[English]
Having considered the matter, I do not recommend that a
consular office be established in Jerusalem. Those consulates already in the city have a unique historical status
relating back to the Ottoman or British Mandate periods.
They have no formal links with the Israeli government. i
see no benefit in trying either to duplicate this arrangement or in establishing a consular office under some other
arrangement. There is little practical need for such an
office for consular purposes and it would not materially
assist the ambassador and his staff in discharging their
functions with the Israeli government.

Our mission to the United Nations in New York is affected

Those measures require a good deal of energy from our
officers in the UN so, their spending power is curtailed.
However, I would emphasize that our mission in New York

QUEBEC AND MONTREAL PORT WARDENS ACTS

Honourable senators, I also have a comment on the question
put by Senator Lamontagne. I explained to Senator Lamontagne that the documents he requested concerning the Secretary of State have in fact been tabled. I do not have the exact
note here, but maybe I could supply the honourable senator
with the details that were tabled here in this house.

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Charbonneau, seconded by the Honourable Senator Walker, P.C., for the second reading of the Bill S-6,
intituled: "An Act to amend an Act to provide for the
appointment of a Port Warden for the Harbour of Quebec
and to amend an Act to amend and consolidate the Acts
relating to the office of Port Warden for the Harbour of
Montreal".-(HonourableSenator Petten).
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, I yield to the honourable Senator Marchand.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators,
that Senator Marchand proceed now instead of Senator
Petten?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
[Translation]
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I read and reread
Bill S-6, not necessarily with the intention of destroying it as
you will see, but in the hope of finding in it at least a pretext
for some oratory, but I must admit that I did not succeed. I
can sec that my friend, the Leader of the Government is very
happySenator Flynn: No, I am not.
Senator Marchand: I shall merely make a few comments on
that bill which, h think, is perfectly justified and should not be
seriously amended except to correct the French in some
instances as it is very difficult to understand if you do not read
the English version of the bill. Anyhow, this bill is only
intended to allow the port wardens of Montreal and Quebec
City to request fee increases for their services to the ships
using Quebec and Montreal harbours. The maximum rates set
in the law date back to 1871 in one instance and 1872 in the
other. It does not mean that the fees have not increased since.
They have, on several occasions but in 1976 and 1977, the
Department of Justice had suddenly the insight to realize those
increments were not legal. So, they refused the requests which
were presented at that time. Now, I think that these requests
are justified as the fees are really lower than administration
costs and rates charged for equivalent services by other government agencies or by the United States. Then, this bill is
only intended to abolish the maximum rate which is even older
than the well-known Crowsnest rates in Canada. So, its aim is
to abolish the maximum so that the rates can be increased to
meet administration costs.
Harbour officials, more specifically port wardens of Montreal and Quebec are of course not authorized to decide
themselves the increase, which means that they must present a
request to the government or to the Department of Transport
and those increases will take effect only when they are
approved.
Are those increases going to have any effect on the inflationary trend in Canada? Sincerely, I do not sec how they could

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
VISIT TO CANADA-ARRANGEMENTS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it has been
brought to my attention that honourable senators may be
interested in the arrangements that are now being made for
the visit to the Parliament of Canada by the President of the
United States and some of his senior officials. There will be a
meeting tomorrow morning at which plans will be finalized. It
is my intention to make a statement to honourable senators
respecting the arrangements for the visit as they involve this
chamber, the Senate, and honourable senators. I cannot make
a full statement at this time as arrangements are not yet final.

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, may I accept the
invitation of the government leader with respect to the resolution moved in the House of Commons earlier today on the
subject of the events in Iran?
I have been able to obtain a copy of a resolution passed
earlier today by the other place in connection with the hostage
situation in Iran. I intend to move the same resolution at this
point in the hope that it will be adopted also by this house.

The resolution passed by the other place was moved by the
member for Fundy-Royal, and seconded by the member for
Nepean-Carleton.
In view of the contemptible attitude of the Ayatallah
Khomeini of Iran towards the civil liberties and rights of, not
only his countrymen, but those of legitimate aliens domiciled
within Iran's borders and his support of actions of blackmail
and terrorism against these defenceless people, I move, seconded by Senator Thompson:
That the Government of Canada extend its protest to
the Government of Iran against the latest act of criminal
aggression, the siege of the U.S. Embassy and the kidnapping of its staff and their families.

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

have any effect since they are very marginal indeed. In the
first case, that of Montreal harbour, it has a global budget of
$100,000 and in the case of Quebec it is about $32,000. So
when you know that the cost of moving a ship may range
between $5,000 and $30,000 a day, even if the fees were
doubled the increase would not have any impact on the use of
Montreal and Quebec harbours.
So, I have no objections. I do not see any either as concerns
competitivity.
As concerns the increase or the elimination of that limit I
think that the bill provides for its complete elimination. That is
entirely justified, I think, particularly as those fees are paid
mostly by foreign ships rather than Canadian vessels.
The second purpose of the bill is to provide consistency as
the name of the Board of Trade of Quebec was changed a few
years ago and became the Board of Trade and Industry of
Metropolitan Quebec. I do not have any objections as it is
consistent with the letters patent issued to the new Board of
Trade.
As concerns Montreal, the name has also been changed and
the expression "Bureau économique de la Société de Montréal" is substituted to the "Chambre de Commerce" to avoid
confusion with the Montreal Board of Trade.
I might make lengthy comments but I would not be pertinent. I do not find anything wrong with the first or the second
point. Furthermore, I believe that they are both justified and
the best thing I can do for you is to sit down.

Senator Connolly: I wonder if I could ask the sponsor of the
bill, Senator Flynn-perhaps Senator Roblin would take this
under advisement-whether or not the bill will be going to a
committee. I assume that it will be. If it does, could a special
effort be made to have the shippers represented at the committee hearing? I notice that the new tariffs proposed under the
bill would have to be approved by the Governor in Council, but
the shipping people who, I suppose, must bear the cost of these
additions should not feel that the new rates are going to be
exorbitant. Will there be some opportunity for input from the
shipping community with regard to the proposals in the bill?
Senator Charbonneau: Honourable senator, to give you an
indication of what we are talking about, on the basis of the
latest figures we have for 1977, the income of the Montreal
office was $103,000 net, and of Quebec $34,000. So we are not
talking about very big figures. If you spread it all out among
vessels that come into both ports, I would not think that the
foreign owners would mind very much.
Senator Connolly: Well, I suppose that the domestic shippers, the people in the inland shopping business, are also
subject to these rates, and I just wondered whether the lake
shippers, operating in the inland waters, would have an opportunity to discuss the proposals in committee.
Senator Roblin: If I might attempt to reply to the question
raised by the Honourable Senator Connolly, it is the intention

that the bill should go to the Standing Senate Committee on
Transport and Communications. The chairman is in the house
and has heard your observations. I know it is his policy to hear
anybody who wishes to make an appearance before him, so if
you know of anyone who might like to appear, it would be
quite open to you to advise them that we would be pleased to
make the facilities of the committee available.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?
Senator Roblin moved that the bill be referred to the

POSTAL RATES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, October 31, the
debate on the motion of Senator Bélisle for the second reading
of Bill C-11, respecting certain postal rates.
[Translation]
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, I want first of
all to congratulate, on your and my behalf, Senator Bélisle on
the excellent presentation of this legislation he made last
Wednesday. His presentation was precise and generally nonpartisan, and it is my intention to do the same.
However, after having considered all the facts and the
related documents, my remarks will be made in quite a
different context from the one in which Senator Bélisle spoke,
and I want most of all to stress the legal aspect of what
happened.
What are the facts which gave rise to this Bill C-11? Here
are the facts: on three occasions, i.e. on August 19, 1976,
March 23, 1978, and January 18, 1979, the former Liberal
government decided to increase the postal rates for letters and
second class mail under the authority given to the Governor in
Council under section 13(b) of the Financial Administration
Act. When the former government decided to increase rates,
they could do so in two ways.
First, by way of an order in council, as I just mentioned, or
second, by introducing ordinary legislation in Parliament to
amend sections 10 and 1l of the Post Office Act.
Honourable senators, when one proceeds by order in council,
obviously there is no need for legislation, but a statement by
the Postmaster General informing Parliament that from a
certain date, and normally for a period of several months, new
rates will take effect. There are two questions to be considered
at this point. The first-and in my opinion the most important-was the former Liberal government entitled to do so?
Could they legally, under the statutes, proceed with the rate
increase by order in council? I want first of all to answer that

SENATE DEBATES
question. Then there is the second question about the use of an
order in council which has been critized by several parliamentarians and also by the committee dealing with those questions, the Joint Committee on Regulations and other Statutory
Instruments. Is the use of an order in council an extraordinary
procedure which should be followed only in particular circumstances when there is no other practical procedure? I will
address this question briefly at the end of my remarks.
Let us try to answer the first question. It is the legal aspect
of the matter. Before the former government decided to proceed by order in council, it had obtained from the Department
of Justice officials legal advice to the effect that the government had the authority to order such a rate increase by order
in council. As I already mentioned, the then Postmaster General gave notice of it to the house and I have before me a
transcript of a long statement he made then and in which he
gave the reasons why the government had decided to proceed
by order in council.
It is obvious that at the time, members of the house,
particularly opposition members but also members sitting on
the right of the Chair, objected to such a rate increase by
order in council, suggesting that such a practice prevented
them not only from discussing those rate increases on second
and third reading, but also from questioning the minister on
the necessity of those rate increases and on all other aspects of
the Post Office.
*

(2140)

Subsequently, the Standing Joint Committee on Regulations
and other Statutory Instruments, which was presided, if my
memory serves me well, by Senator Forsey, after having
discussed that order in council, not only protested against that
procedure but also questioned its validity and legality.
I must say, honourable senators, and this is very important,
that this whole matter of rate increases by order in council was
referred to the courts. The case was heard and the first ruling
of the Federal Court, dated August 2, 1978, was favourable to
the former government and declared legal those rate increases
by order in council.
If honourable senators are interested, they just have to refer
to the case of the Canadian Periodical Publishers Association
and the Survival Foundation vs the Solicitor General of
Canada, 1978, Federal Court 391.
I now want to dwell for a moment on this legal aspect to
impress upon you the fact-I think that all senators with a
legal background will agree with me-that when a judgment
of a lower court rules as legal a given interpretation of the law,
this judgement is a law in itself. This judgement then becomes
jurisprudence so long as it has not been overruled by a superior
court. That is so true that if I go through Bill C-l which is
intended to clarify a situation already ruled as legal by the
court, and if we pass this bill-I will recommend that it be
passed without difficulty-well, tomorrow morning if it so
desires the present government could increase the rates by
resorting again to section 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act.
[Senator Deschatelets.]

November 6, 1979

However 1must say in all fairness that in his speech Senator
Bélisle and the present Postmaster General did say very clearly
that the new government does not intend in any way to use the
provisions of the Financial Administration Act to implement
postal rates increases.
Consequently, honourable senators, I must say that from a
legal point of view Bill C-11 has little impact, strictly speaking, since we are just asked to sanction it "for greater certainty". These are the very words used in clause 1 of this bill, a
situation which the courts have already recognized as legal.
i must also say-and the present Postmaster General so
stated when presenting this bill to the other place-that it was
the minister himself who requested, when the Federal Court
ruled in favour of the former government, it was the Postmaster General himself, as I said, who requested the parties
involved to suspend their procedures for the reason that an
appeal to the Supreme Court would take too much time. The
minister thought that because of that long delay it would be
better for him to proceed with Bill C-11 that we now have
before us.
Speaking about Bill C-1l, I made an interesting finding. On
December l1, 1978, the then Liberal government introduced
in the Commons, for first reading, Bill C-27 which could be-i
think it was in December 1978-which might be the most
important bill, the most substantial bill to be introduced by the
Postmaster General in Parliament. It was one of those bills of
the omnibus kind which dealt with just about every aspect and
every problem of the Post Office Department. Of course the
main object of Bill C-27 was to provide for the conversion of
the Post Office Department into a Canadian postal service
corporation, a crown corporation.
Furthermore, in clauses 52 and 53, page 23 of Bill C-27, I
just happen to read two clauses entitled "authority to prescribe
fees order" and the first words are "for greater certainty".
You will find there, word for word, the terms of Bill C-1 1. In
other words, the point i want to make to honourable senators
is that Bill C-11 which we are asked to adopt is word for word,
and can be found "in-extenso", in the bill introduced in the
House of Commons in December 1978 by the preceding
Liberal government.
So this means that we are asked to adopt Bill C-11 which is
a Liberal bill. I have no objection to that. That is one of the
reasons why I will ask you in a moment to adopt it. Besides, I
will add that I am not only in favour of this bill, but that this
Bill C-1 I has in my opinion no legal scope. Therefore it will
not be necessary to refer it to a permanent committee of the
house.
Now, honourable senators, I told you
words about the second part.

i would say only a few

What are the effects and the impacts of using an order to
increase the postal rates on the parliamentary practices. I
think that might interest honourable senators and also the
members of the other place. i completely agree theoretically, it
goes without saying, with all parliamentarians urging that all

November 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

government legislation must in general be debated in both
houses. i believe that on this point we all agree in principle.
However, I want to emphasize here the fantastic work done
by the Joint Committee on Regulations and other Statutory
Instruments. That committee I think is the real vigilant guardian of the rules and privileges of Parliament. I believe the
committee was perfectly right in questioning in two of its
reports the use of orders in council. I think that in one of the
reports I read in that respect, Senator Forsey who represented
the Senate on that joint committee questioned the validity or
legality of the use of orders in council. Well, we now have the
answer to that question.
e (2150)
I think I will have done what I had to do tonight in saying
that it is perfectly valid and legal for a government to proceed
by order in council. But the joint committee went a little
further and asked that governments stop proceeding in this
way. I want to say something here. The use of orders in council
is perfectly legal and was recognized as such in court, but it
may be raising apprehensions among parliamentarians. Parliamentarians can rightly say: if you proceed by order in
council, you are preventing us from proceeding with second
and third readings. You are preventing us from questioning
ministers. In that respect, they are generally right. So I say it
is an exceptional measure. But there are other exceptional
measures in the traditions and rules of Parliament. Let me give
you an example: the use of closure to put an end to a debate is
the most unpopular measure that I know of and it is perfectly
legal. And so is the use of orders in council which is a special
and extraordinary measure by our standard rules. In my view,
when a government uses orders in council or closure, which is
perfectly legal, it then has the responsibility to establish that it
is using extraordinary measures because of circumstances
where the public interest demands that it proceed that way.
But then I say that the government has the burden of the proof
and has to establish when using orders in council or closure,
that there are reasons to justify its doing so.
You might ask whether the former government had particular reasons to proceed by order in council. Did the business of
the Commons at that time not allow to have those tariff
increases passed by Parliament within a reasonable time? I do
not believe I have to answer that question. I believe the facts
are there. The statements are there. It is up to you to judge
them.
Honourable senators, to put everyone at ease, and so as to
be very clear, I conclude by saying that, personally, as a
parliamentarian who has acquired over the years a quarter of a
century of experience, I think that in general a government
should proceed the usual way by introducing a bill unless there
are very exceptional circumstances. It is then up to the government to prove it. The burden of the proof rests with it.
So, for all those reasons, honourable senators, I conclude
that Bill C-11 is a legislation of Liberal inspiration as it was
copied word for word from Bill C-27 which was introduced by
the former government in December 1978. You can compare it
to what appears at clause 52 of Bill C-27. It is the same thing,

word for word. This government chose to proceed that way to
clear any uncertainty. I have no objection to that. But I am
personally convinced it is more or less important from a legal
point of view. It is not essential. We could not pass it and the
situation would be the same because there is a judgment in the
Federal Court which is a precedent and recognizes that the
increase by order in council is legal.
For all these reasons, I think we should accept this bill
without any trouble. In addition, as a consequence of what I
said, I do not really deem it advisable to have this bill referred
to a standing committee of the bouse, but I leave the decision
up to Senator Bélisle and to the Leader of the Opposition.

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I do not want to
intervene in the substance of the debate on Bill C-11. However, I was impressed with the learned study of the matter
made by Senator Deschatelets, and I would hope we could
suggest to the mover, Senator Bélisle, or indeed the government house leader, to take Senator Deschatelets' advice and
ask that the bill be given second reading, and then ask leave
for third reading to be given at the next sitting of the Senate,
rather than send the bill to committee. I say that for all the
reasons that have already been stated.
Senator Bélisle: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I have to inform honourable senators
that if Senator Bélisle speaks now, other than to answer a
question, his speech will have the effect of closing the debate.
Senator Bélisie: Honourable senators, I listened with great
interest to the comments made by Senator Deschatelets on Bill
C-11, and I thank him for his kind contribution. He had such
an excellent career in the other place and in this house as
Speaker that I must tell him I am always enriched and
enlightened by his remarks.
It is my intention to bring to the attention of the Postmaster
General, the Honourable John Fraser, the contribution that
Senator Deschatelets has made tonight. I am sure that due
consideration will be given to the content of his remarks. As
the Deputy Leader of the Government has already saidSenator Oison: Of the opposition.
Senator Bélisle: The Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
Senator Perrault: It will not be long.
Senator Oison: It is clairvoyance.
Senator Bélisle: If honourable senators agreed, this bill
could be read a second time tonight and probably a third time
tomorrow.
[Translation]
Senator Lamontagne: May I ask a question of Senator
Bélisle? Am I to understand that we are going to pass on
second reading a piece of legislation that is completely useless?
Senator Bélisle: Honourable senators, if you had listened to
the speech I made the other day and to the one our distin-

SENATE DEBATES
guished colleague made tonight, you would know that this
legislation is certainly not useless. A bill serves a purpose. It is
passed to enact what has been done by order in council, has
been done, as Senator Deschatelets said, pursuant to Section
13(b) but should not have been donc, while being legal. We
must also consider that the Court of Appeal has upheld what
had been done by the previous government, but the matter is
now before the courts. This bill may therefore indirectly do
away with the reason for the legislation now before the court.
Is that clear?
Senator Lamontagne: Very clear.
Senator Bélisle: So, if Parliament passes this legislation, it
will from now on be legal to increase first and second-class
rates by order in council.
[English]
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I do not want
to be overly emphatic about the keeping of our rules, but I
think there are times that the rules require the Chair to
intervene. One such occasion is when an honourable senator
rises who has sponsored a bill, and I am then required to
inform senators that his speech will close the debate.
In this particular case, what appeared to be a question was
actually carrying on the debate. The honourable senator who
carried on the debate in that fashion was not rising in his place
to do so.
This is just a minor caution in that I think we can go too far
in paying no attention whatsoever to our rules.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?
Senator Bélisle moved that the bill be placed on the Orders
of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

CANADA NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONS BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October 30, the debate
on the motion of Senator Walker for the second reading of Bill
S-7, respecting Canadian non-profit corporations.
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, my first words must
be words of appreciation for Senator Walker's fair and concise
explanation of the scope and purposes of this bill. Of course,
that was to be expected of him, his being a member of the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce which had this bill before it on two occasions, hearing
witnesses and making reports which the Senate concurred in.
There was a vast amount of material which I knew he could
quite easily absorb, since he had already done that part of the
job. So when I read his speech I asked myself, "What further
[Senator Bélisle.]

November 6, 1979

is there to say?" It occurred to me at first, "Well, nothing,
really." But then, in reference to the fact that certain amendments had been incorporated in the bill for the first time which
were not in the bill on any previous occasion on which it was
dealt with in this house or in the committee, I thought I might
take the occasion to make some remarks.
First, I would indicate that the amendments are not really
important at all. I suppose I might use the colloquial expression and say they are cosmetic in nature.
To illustrate just one of them, in order to change the
practice of making use of decimals in labelling or enumerating
particular subsections, the amendment eliminates that and
gives another and more positive number in place of the decimal number.
Surely that is not important, but perhaps if you are in a
sense literary or appreciate good prose you will say, "Yes;
don't promote something you don't believe in, even though
changing it at this time only contributes to delay in passing the
bill." But then I thought, "If I say that, then it may be said
that this bill cannot be very important."
While these amendments sort of wind down to the bottom of
the barrel, I think I should indicate to you that there are
important and substantial features to this bill. May I just take
a moment of your time to do that?
For instance, there is a provision in relation to dissent. Bear
in mind that this bill has to do with a non-profit corporation
which includes a variety of organizations such as the Red
Cross Society, the Metropolitan Board of Trade of Toronto, as
well as other boards of trade, and the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce and others. In connection with the Metropolitan
Board of Trade of Toronto, there were submissions with
respect to the benefits or rights which the bill gives-or did
give before we changed it-to a member of a membership
corporation when he dissents. In dissenting he enjoys a right
under the articles of association to share in any distribution of
assets at the time of liquidation or winding up. Then, if he
dissents on certain limited and specified subjects, if he does not
succeed in his dissent, he has a right to have his share interest
or his membership interest evaluated and to be paid out the
amount of that share.
The boards of trade, particularly some of the boards of trade
that have acquired substantial assets, were concerned about
what actions might be taken from time to time by members.
When they appeared before the committee, the limitation that
was provided-and I think that is important-was that with
respect to boards of trade and the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce, the right to dissent did not carry with it, if the
dissent was not acknowledged, the right to have the holding
evaluated and paid out.
That is an important provision. The bill, as it came to us in
the first place, contained that provision.
When the Red Cross Society appeared before us there was
another provision on the question of voting that was of concern. There is a general provision in the bill under which a

November 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

member of a membership corporation, if he is of a class of
members that is entitled to a vote, may vote.
The difficulty with the Red Cross Society is that they have
only one corporation, namely, the Red Cross Society, but the
makeup of their association is not that simple. They have what
are called local branches. The local branches are really the
workers who do all the spade work in the various branches of
the organization, and when health demands and care demands,
et cetera, have to be attended to by the Red Cross Society,
which in essence is a charitable organization, they are the ones
who go into the forefront. But the next group is what is called
the divisions, and the divisions have a provincial character.
Local branches make appointments to the divisions, and the
divisions make appointments to the Central Council, and all
these organizations are unincorporated. The Central Council is
the body that, when it meets, really constitutes the meeting of
the Society.
0

(2220)

The way in which they handle this as they move along the
line of branches, divisions and Central Council, is that the
representatives are selected by these different groups, and they
finally end up at the top of the Central Council. The Central
Council is the group recognized as constituting the membership of the Red Cross Society operated for a substantial
number of years. They were concerned about this because the
cost of meeting the requirement of giving notice to every
member would have amounted to, in their estimate, approximately $300,000. They said that they could use that money
better in dealing with causes and emergencies than in spending
it to send out notices to all these different groupings, if we are
going to classify them or attempt to classify them as members.
A provision has been put in the bill which satisfies the
society under which there is indirect voting, but either the
articles of the Red Cross or the bylaws will have to provide for
the indirect voting. The indirect voting, then, would be by the
representatives who have the right under the bylaws to vote at
the annual meeting. To the committee this was a very important issue.
There were several other issues that are important to charitable organizations that I would say are substantially controlled through income tax provisions. There is no provision in
those cases under which a member of a charitable organization
could qualify and exercise a dissent because a dissent, and
what follows from a dissent under the bill, does not extend to
include a charitable organization because there is no provision
under which a charitable organization can distribute its assets,
or any part of them, to its members. They collect money from
the public, and they distribute money and spend money on
charitable causes. They have to account in a very substantial
way for how they deal with that money. Under the Income
Tax Act, of course, they must give a strict accounting. Each
year they must distribute up to 90 per cent of their income in
order to maintain their status as charitable organizations.
The problem of dissent is not a large problem but it can be a
serious problem in certain areas. For instance, in the matter of
a golf club it could be a serious problem. If a member of a golf

club who had substantial property thought the course was not
doing him justice in that he was not able to reduce his
handicap, he could dissent. If his dissent was not honoured,
then he could say, as I expressed it, that he wanted his marbles
and would go home. That is an English expression. It means,
in other words, that he wants his money.
These are important features in the bill and yet they were
not in the bill in that form when it came before us. There are
many other amendments which relate the Non-Profit Corporations Act to the Canada Business Corporations Act. They have
to be fitted in because one is not just an impression of the
other. I only mentioned these-and there are others-simply
to highlight that the bill is an important bill.
The remaining item I wish to discuss is the fact that five
years after this bill becomes law, any membership corporation
that has not sought to continue its operation under this new
bill is dissolved. There are many such organizations that were
incorporated under the Companies Act of years ago, or were
incorporated under the Business Corporations Act, or were
incorporated under the Boards of Trade Act or other special
federal statutes. What the bill is attempting to do is to get
them all into one pot so that there will be one record of the
operations of non-profit organizations.
I was asked a question when I dealt with this before as to
what happens if an organization does not meet the five-year
limitation. Under the bill, the corporation is dissolved, but
there are two outs to that, one being that an organization can
apply to continue under this bill when it becomes an act, or it
can go to the Governor in Council and ask for an order to
permit the organization to remain under the law under which
it was originally incorporated. In those circumstances, of
course, there is no dissolution and no distribution of assets.
This is very important, and the catch is, of course, as the
departmental officers told us, that if the Governor in Council
makes an order permitting any of these corporations not to
continue under this bill when it becomes law, then they can
continue in the form, the exact form, in which they were
incorporated. If they want to make any changes thereafter,
they have to go through the procedure of incorporating all over
again if the five-year period has run out, because the department will use this as a pressure on these corporations to get
them to conform to the plan of this bill. That plan is to focus
all the activities of non-profit corporations in the department
that deals with that subject matter, and in one file, instead of
having some under the various Boards of Trade Acts over the
years, the Companies Act, the Business Corporations Act, and
so on.
*

(2230)

It is a sensible and intelligent move, and where companies or
corporations were incorporated under the Business Corporations Act, or even the Canada Business Corporations Act, it is
confusing, to say the least, to try to understand what is
supposed to deal with non-profit corporations and what is the
general corporate law in relation to corporations, even those
other than non-profit.

SENATE DEBATES
That is as far as I should go, except to emphasize that this is
an important bill.
There are six amendments that have actually been incorporated in the bill, which were not there at an earlier time. The
proper way to deal with it, in order to avoid any criticism in

the future, would be to send the bill to committee. It is not that
the chairman of the committee is looking for work, because the
committee's platter is pretty full.
If anyone does any research into the bill, as it becomes law
with these amendments incorporated, and then goes back to
the bill immediately before that, and to the bill immediately
before that one, he will not find these changes, and he may ask
why. At least in committee we will be able to clarify the
situation. It should not take long, and I think it is both a
regular and sensible course. Legally too it is a sensible course
of action.
Needless to say, I am in favour of the bill, and I thank
Senator Walker for illustrating, by his clear and concise
explanation, how the committee, of which he is a member,
works and does its homework.

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
VISIT TO CANADA-ARRANGEMENTS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, yesterday I
informed the chamber that I would be in a position today to
give the Senate some general information about the arrangements for the visit of President Carter and his family and
members of his cabinet to the Parliament of Canada next
Friday and Saturday.
The arrangements have just been completed, and, with your
permission, honourable senators, i will give you a very brief
outline, as the arrangements for the visit concern and involve
the senators and the Senate.
President Carter and his family will arrive in Ottawa at 9
o'clock on Friday morning. They will proceed, after the usual
ceremonial greetings, to the Centre Block, where the President
and his party will arrive at the main door of the Centre Block
at 10.50, to be greeted by a parliamentary greeting party.
There will be a luncheon, a working luncheon as it is
described, with the Prime Minister and members of the cabinet and others. Then the Presidential party will leave the
Parliament Buildings for Government House, returning in the
afternoon when the officiai ceremonies in connection with the
joint session of the two houses will commence.
The President and his party are expected to arrive at the
main door at 1520 hours, that is 3.20 in the afternoon. They
will proceed then to the House of Commons chamber where a
joint session of the Senate and the House of Commons will
take place.
The seating arrangements are as usual based on a scarcity of
accommodation. Honourable senators will be seated in seats in
the aisle of the Commons. Seats are being placed there and I
am asked to urge honourable senators who intend to be in the
House of Commons for that ceremony to let their wishes be
known as soon as possible, as accommodation is somewhat
limited. However, it is expected that all senators who wish to
be in the House of Commons on that occasion will be
accommodated.
With respect to the seating for guests, the suggestion is that
there be a limitation of one guest per senator. The seating for
guests will be at large in the galleries of the House of
Commons. There will be no reserved accommodation for anybody other than distinguished visitors from abroad. Honourable senators are therefore urged to make their representations
for tickets through Black Rod as soon as possible. I emphasize

that, from the information I have, all accommodation in the
galleries of the Commons is to be on a first come first served
basis.
If there are any questions in respect of this matter, they will
be answered, I think, in a memorandum which is to go forward
to all honourable senators this afternoon.
I might say, the President will be accompanied by Mrs.
Lillian Carter and Miss Amy Carter, as well as distinguished
members of the cabinet, including Mr. Cyrus Vance, Mr.
Charles Duncan Jr., Mr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Mr. Cecil
Andrus.

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]

Senator Oison: Pardon me, the government leader. I should
like to ask the government leader whether the Prime Minister
intends to raise with the President of the United States, when
he is here later this week, the matter of delays in the construction of the Alaska Highway Pipeline as they relate to U.S.
regulatory approval, and whether he will be raising the matter
of the Foothills oil pipeline so that the Canadian government's
position, with its stated preference for the Foothills project,
will be made known to the President?
*

(1410)

Senator Flynn: Since this matter has fallen upon my colleague, Senator de Cotret, he will provide the answer.
Senator de Cotret: I am the minister responsible for the
Northern Pipeline Agency. I can assure the honourable senator that the matter of the gas pipeline definitely will be
discussed in terms of the regulatory and other matters that
have held up the beginning of construction.
In terms of the potential for the pre-built part of the
pipeline, given that adequate assurances are provided on the
overall finances for the line, and our general intentions, without prejudging the decision of the NEB in terms of gas exports
from Alberta before the completion of the line in total, that is
definitely going to be raised.
In terms of the oil pipeline, which does not fall under the
responsibility of the Northern Pipeline Agency, I can also
assure the honourable senator that it is a subject that is on the
agenda. I can also assure the honourable senator that we shall
reiterate the position of the Government of Canada in this
matter.
Senator Perrault: I have a question for the Leader of the
Government. All Canadians welcome the visit to Canada by
the distinguished President of the United States, and it is
heartening to note that there is going to be a good working
luncheon during the course of that visit. It is certain that there
will be important discussions of a number of subjects.
Has an agenda been prepared which can be made available
for consideration by those who serve in Parliament? I am not
asking the minister for confidential details, but rather a list of
the general topics to be discussed during the course of that
meeting?
Senator Flynn: There is certainly an agenda, but I do not
think I can make it public at this time.

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION DURING VISIT TO CANADA-GAS AND
OIL PIPELINES

INTEREST RATES

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to ask the
government house leader in the Senate-

Senator Perrault: In view of the policy of this government to
have Canadian interest rates generally follow the interest rates

SENATE DEBATES
established by the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States,
with the result that a great deal of damage is being done to the
Canadian econorny, is there a possibility that the Prime Minister will discuss with President Carter the actions of the
Federal Reserve Bank in the United States? Will discussions
be held to persuade American authorities to modify the recent
policy of escalating interest rates, in the hope that there will be
consequent benefits for Canada?
Senator de Cotret: During the course of the several business
meetings that will be held between the President of the United
States and the Prime Minister of Canada, and associates on
both sides, there definitely will be a discussion of current
economic conditions in both countries and current economic
policy settings both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy in
both countries, particularly as they may affect the other
country.
UNITED STATES NATIONAL OIL ENTITY

Senator Perrault: I have another supplementary, this time
directed either to the Leader of the Government or to the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In view of the fact
that it is the professed intention of the President of the United
States to bring into being a national oil entity in the United
States somewhat similar to Petro-Canada, will the Prime
Minister and ministers take the opportunity to discuss this
important question with the President and his officials in the
hope that he will derive from President Carter and some of his
cabinet members some of their insights into this subject,
insights which up to the present time seem to have escaped the
Canadian government?
Senator de Cotret: Perhaps the President would be happy if
we provided him with insights about our experience in this
country in ternis of the decisions he has to take.
Senator Flynn: We will let you know what his opinion is.
ENERGY
PRICE OF DOMESTIC OIL-POSSIBLE FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL
AGREEMENT

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I direct a question to
the government leader and to the Minister of Industry, Trade
and Commerce. In the past few days they have seemed to be
getting on the borderline of misleading this house.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Oison: They have both assured us in the past few
days that they are very close to an agreement with Alberta on
oil prices, but last night the Premier of Alberta said that they
are not close to an agreement. It seems to me that he went a
little bit further and said that he does not intend to negotiate
the price of Alberta's resources with any other province, that
he would negotiate it with the federal government. That is
where the deal is.
* (1420)

I wonder if the Leader of the Government would tell us
what basis he has for giving these assurances, when hours after
[Senator Perrault j

November 7, 1979

he has said it and the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce has said it, the other party to this hoped for agreement
says that they are not even close.
Senator Flynn: It is very simple in fact. The problem of
establishing a price is an issue of concern to the producing
provinces and the federal government, while the entire energy
package is something that is of interest to all the provinces. As
the honourable senator knows, there is to be a meeting of first
ministers on Monday to discuss that energy package.
Senator Oison: Then it is acknowledged that it will be the
other parts of the package and not the price of Alberta and
Saskatchewan oil that will be discussed with all the other
provinces.
Senator Flynn: It may be discussed, but I cannot say that it
will be determined.
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION DURING VISIT TO CANADA-CHICKEN
IMPORT QUOTAS

Senator Argue: I should like to direct a question to the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, which is supplementary to one raised some time ago. Can the minister assure
the Senate that when President Carter is here the question of
the unsatisfactory arrangements respecting chicken import
quotas-senators can laugh, but this is an urgent and important matter to chicken producers in Canada, especially in
eastern Canada. I ask if that matter is going to be raised. It is
an important question, and the producers would like it raised.
Senator de Cotret: i cannot give you that assurance, honourable senator.
Senator Perrault: Chickening out.
Senator de Cotret: There are a number of issues of bilateral
importance in industry and trade that will be raised, and this is
one that might be raised. However, I cannot give the honourable senator the formal assurance that it will be. If I may add
in respect of this matter, because the honourable senator has
raised a number ofSenator Smith (Colchester): Chickens.
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator has raised a
number of questions with respect to chickens, and I should like
to tell him that I was wrong in the dates I gave him on
October 25. The substance of my answer was quite correct. I
had discussed the problem that the honourable senator had
raised; I had discussed it at breakfast that morning; i had
discussed it with cabinet colleagues while this decision was
under way; I had discussed it before the negotiations began
with the United States last summer when we gave an ad
referendum reference to the negotiating team. It was certainly
a problem that we were aware of, and i had discussed it that
very morning, without knowing that the day after the cabinet
decision a specific direction on the allocation of quotas had
been issued, indicating how the individual quotas would be
handled.

November 7, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

However, I should like to emphasize that when I answered
the question I could honestly say that the decision announced
in that memo that had gone out the week before, without my
express knowledge, did in fact reflect the concerns I had
expressed that morning-indeed, that I had expressed over the
several months during which this issue was before cabinet and
before my colleagues. I feel that the result, while a difficult
one, and perhaps not one that could be seen as satisfactory to
all, was the best that could be achieved under the
circumstances.
Senator Argue: I certainly would not infer that the minister
misled the chamber in any way. My question is: Will the
minister produce for honourable senators a list of the companies, with their entitlements for the importation of chicken into
Canada, so that we can see how in fact those quotas are being
allocated?
Senator de Cotret: Yes, I shall be very happy to provide that
list. I could provide some preliminary information on that,
because I was aware that there may have been some misconception about two particular firms in the industry accounting
for 75 per cent of the total imports. In fact, the two firms that
were mentioned at that point, Loblaw's and Maple Lodge, did
not account for 75 per cent. In fact, in 1978 they accounted for
29 per cent. Eleven importers-I shall be happy to provide the
details-account for 75 per cent of the total. The new allocation, which was done on an historical basis, was on the basis of
the years 1976, 1977 and 1978, to eliminate the aberration of
the earlier part of this year in terms of the imports of chicken,
and respects the terms of the agreement that had been negotiated, which spelled out clearly that they had to be allocated
on an historical basis. However, we did not want to have in
that historical base a period in which there was a clear
aberration.
In terms of the overall quota, we also reserved 7 per cent for
new importers should the applications be forthcoming. We are
allocating 93 per cent of the negotiated quota of 45 million
pounds, which is a reduction from the 65 million pounds, and
keeping aside the 7 per cent. I should be happy to give the
honourable senator a detailed list of the companies.
Senator Argue: I think the whole three-year period is an
aberration. It should have gone back for a longer historical
period, in all fairness.
As a further supplementary question, I should like to ask the
minister if he can say whether or not breaded cut chicken, the
type that comes in for Kentucky Fried Chicken, is in the quota
or outside it. That is an important question that has been
raised, and I do not know the answer.
Senator de Cotret: I have to admit, honourable senator, that
I do not know the answer either. I shall have to check that.
Senator Argue: I should like to ask a further question about
President Carter's visit. I am very disappointed that this
question will not be raised. There may be snickers around the
Senate, but that doesn't bother me, because I think this is an
important question and it could be raised at least briefly. My
question is this: Will the Minister of Agriculture be given or

have an opportunity to raise this question with President
Carter? I see that at the state dinner the Minister of Agriculture is among those who have been excluded, and I am
wondering if the Minister of Agriculture is excluded from the
other meetings with President Carter. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce will be there, and I am pleased
about that, but the Minister of Agriculture conducted the
negotiations, and I should like to see him at some of these
important meetings.
Senator de Cotret: I can assure the honourable senator that
I am going to the dinner. I should also like to underline that I
have not said the matter would not be raised. I have only
indicated that I cannot give my assurance that it will be. I am
trying to be very above-board here. With reference to the
presence of the Minister of Agriculture, I do not think there is
any slight intended on the part of the government. My understanding is that the Minister of Agriculture is flying to Rome
for an international conference today. I may be wrong, but I
talked to him last night and that was the indication that he
gave me. I do not think he will be here during that period.
Senator Argue: That will need to be a pretty important
conference. I wonder what is more important in Rome than
chicken in Canada.
GARRISON DAM PROJECT

Senator Molgat: I have a supplementary question regarding
the agenda for the meeting with President Carter. I do not
know whether I should address it to the government leader or
to the minister who seems more prepared to answer questions,
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Senator Flynn: Thank you.
Senator Molgat: My question relates to a particular problem in the province of Manitoba, but it is one that has some
very broad effects across Canada. I am referring to the
Garrison Dam in the United States. This has been under
construction for some time, and the Manitoba government has
made representations in this regard, as have a number of
volunteer associations. The International Joint Commission
has been seized of it and has made a report. More recently, the
Manitoba Indian Brotherhood has produced a study indicating
that some 28 Indian communities will be affected if it proceeds, that there is a potential loss of hundreds of millions of
dollars to the commercial fishery, and yet the process seems to
continue in spite of the fact that President Carter appeared to
have put a stop to it at some stage. Every indication we have is
that construction continues and the potential pollution of
Canadian waters continues.

•

(1430)

This particular project is of direct concern to Manitoba,
admittedly, but obviously there is the overall national concern
that, if they can do that in one location, then none of our
trans-boundary waters are safe.

SENATE DEBATES
Could we have the assurance that this item will be on the
agenda and will receive ail of the serious consideration it
deserves?
Senator Flynn: Yes, and other similar problems.
WEST COAST OIL PIPELINES

Senator van Roggen: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It is really
supplementary to the first question asked by the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition relative to the oil pipelines. It does
not have to do with the gas pipeline but the question of west
coast oil pipelines in Canada and/or the Foothills line to
Alaska.
I wonder if the minister can assure us in this house that the
government has now formulated a policy to lay before President Carter-I might say no policy appears to have existed at
least as recently as August-that would assist the President in
making a decision more favourable to Canada than the recommendation he has received from Mr. Andrus, Secretary of the
Interior, that he should adopt the northern tier proposal.
I asked the minister a question similar to this two or three
weeks ago. He has not responded to it yet. Time is getting
short. 1 should like assurance that not only will the question of
the pipeline be raised but that the Canadian government
indeed has a policy formulated which it will present to the
President on that particular issue.
Senator de Cotret: I am a little surprised by the senator's
question. We have a clear policy with respect to the oil
pipeline. I gave this chamber details on the policy and we have
often reiterated it. I gave the opposition leader in this house
the exact dates and the names of the representatives that had
presented our case before the various American agencies. I
tabled the documentation in terms of the aide-mémoire that
was presented by the deadline.
I think our position on this matter is quite clear. Certainly,
in our discussions with President Carter we will put forward
again the position and the policy that this government has
followed throughout its five months in office.
Senator van Roggen: I should like to ask a supplementary. I
do not want to pry into the private provisions or proposais you
may put to the President. That is not my objective today.
However, I am concerned that not just a simple statement will
be put to him that we would like to go over land across Canada
to bring down Alaska oil, because as the minister well knows
that will not produce a satisfactory result owing to the fact
that there is very little oil to bring down at the moment.
I am seeking assurance that the government has formulated
some specific suggestions to the President, such as, and I only
use this as an example, a forthcoming position from Canada on
a temporary supply to northern tier refineries with sweet oil
from Canada to enable the United States to postpone a
decision on northern tier until a closer look can be taken of the
overall situation. I mean that type of specific policy. Have
policies such as that been formulated so that the discussion
with the President will indeed be in more depth than the type
[Senator Molgat.]

Novemnber 7, 1979

of "motherhood" that we have so far received as a statement
of the government's policy in this connection?
Senator de Cotret: I can only assure the honourable senator
that the discussion will be in depth.
THE ECONOMY
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY-PROGRAM EVALUATION

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of State for Economic Development. Mr. Minister, there was a press release from the office of the Prime
Minister dated August 30, 1979, Jasper, which stated therein
on page 3, item 3, that:
Ministers must be provided with an increasing capacity
to hold departments and agencies fully accountable for
the efficient and effective discharge of their responsibilitics.
It says that this will be accomplished by:
Reviewing Expenditures on an Ongoing Basis. Procedures will be established to review programs on an ongoing basis to determine whether the original objectives are
still valid and to determine whether programs have been
effective in meeting their stated objectives.
The minister made a speech to the Montreal Chamber of
Commerce on October 16, 1979, in which he stated:
We're ensuring the proper involvement of Parliament
through the work of the Joint Standing Committee on
Program Evaluation;
It would seem clear that the minister's statement is an
outgrowth of the release from the Prime Minister's Office and
that one refers to the other. I wonder if the minister could tell
us what the Joint Standing Committee on Program Evaluation
is and could he describe the work that it will do?
Senator de Cotret: Yes, I would be happy to talk about
program evaluation. I would just like to ask you one question
for clarification. Were you pointing to a speech that I gave
about parliament committees?
Senator Everett: It was entitled, "The Private Sector:
Engine of Economic Growth." The speech was made to the
Montreal Chamber of Commerce on October 16. I will send a
copy over to you but I would like it back right away, Mr.
Minister, because I would not want to lose one of your
speeches. I keep them aIl.
Senator de Cotret: In terms of program evaluation, we have
done quite a bit in the short time we have been in office. I can
first of aIl talk about the inventory in the economic development field that was donc of the various programs that we
administered with a view to ensuring that the programs were
still meeting the needs for which they were initially created.
For example, we identified 63 programs that are now
administered by ten departments, I believe, as potential candidates to be crunched, if you like, into eight programs rather
than the 63, to be administered by three departments, thereby
gaining more efficiency in program delivery, providing the

November 7, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

community that those programs intend to serve a more clearly
defined focus where they can address themselves, and improve
the efficiency of the programs overall in terms of what they
are trying to do.
Given that we have approximately 430-I do not want to be
held to the exact number, but it is over 400-programs in the
economic development field, you will recognize that we have to
go at it step by step. But we are reviewing programs with a
view to making them as efficient as possible and with a view to
satisfying the clientele for which those programs were put into
place.
So there is both the efficiency in terms of the administrative
costs of the programs and efficiency in terms of the delivery of
the programs for those to whom the programs are addressed.
That work is ongoing.
In terms of closer control over expenditures, we are, on an
ongoing basis in the work program of the economic development committee, reviewing a number of programs. That goes
on a weekly basis as programs come up for review and come
up particularly in the context of expansions in programs or
reductions in programs. There have been a number of them. It
is a long list so far. I would be happy to tell you the number of
programs that we have looked at in this manner, but, as you
will recognize, given the extent of the economic development
envelope, or the expenditure envelope, it is not a process that
can be accomplished overnight. But we are well into it.
e (1440)

Senator Everett: I appreciate that this is something that
cannot be accomplished overnight. You have said, however,
that you are carrying out evaluations of continuing programs,
and I think you said you would be happy to provide me with a
list of the programs that have been evaluated. If I am correct
in that, I would ask the minister to table in the Senate a list of
the programs that have been evaluated to date.
Senator de Cotret: I shall be happy to indicate the number
of programs that have been reviewed under the economic

special funding programs. I do not have those numbers at my
fingertips, but I shall be happy to get them for you.
Senator Everett: I am not only asking for the number. I
should like to have a list of the actual programs that have been
evaluated to date.
Senator de Cotret: I shall provide such a list.
Senator Everett: Can you tell me-and this really goes back
to my original question-what the Joint Committee on Program Evaluation is going to do?
Senator de Cotret: I am sorry; would you repeat your
question?
Senator Everett: In your speech, you referred to the Joint
Committee on Program Evaluation. I do not know of any such
committee in Parliament. You spoke of it using the definite
article rather than the indefinite article, and I therefore
assume that you have a fairly clear idea of what that joint
committee is going to do. I think it would be of interest to the

members of the Senate if you were to describe what you had in
mind when you spoke of the Joint Committee on Program
Evaluation.
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to take the question as
notice. It may be a matter of translation. I was speaking to the
Montreal Chamber of Commerce and the text of the speech
was in the French language. Frankly, I cannot remember
referring to a Joint Standing Committee on Program Evaluation. I shall take the question as notice and provide a specific
answer at a later date.

FISHERIES
RESTRICTION ON TRAWLER FISHING IN GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the government leader which will certainly please him since
it concerns his native region, the Gaspé peninsula.
Until August 27 last, trawlers of 100 feet or more were
forbidden to fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This interdiction
was lifted by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and trawlers of 100 feet or more can now catch in excess of 6,000 metric
tons of cod. Of course, this has extremely serious economic
implications for Gaspé fishermen.
Is the minister aware of this situation? Also, how long will
trawlers of 100 feet or more be allowed to fish in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence?
Senator Flynn: I am not aware of this situation, but I shall
enquire and obtain at the same time an answer to the question
of the honourable senator.
TRANSPORT
RUMOURED MERGER OF AIR CANADA AND CP AIR

Senator Marchand: I have another question on which you
are probably better informed since it concerns another question that I asked yesterday about the negotiations between CP
Air and Air Canada.
As concerns the re-arrangement or redistribution of air
routes in Canada, does the government intend to follow closely
these negotiations which would normally come before the
Canadian Transport Commission in view of the importance of
this redistribution? Also, our experience with railroads, for
instance, has shown how very easy it can be to give to a
company certain routes which are not profitable and others
which are profitable to another company.
In view of the very serious implications of this project, does
the government plan to monitor and supervise the negotiations
between these two major companies?
Senator Flynn: As I underscored yesterday, the Minister of
Transport was talking hypothetically about an agreement and
not a merger between the two major national carriers. Of
course, it seems that this is the way things are going. The
government will therefore certainly monitor the situation and

SENATE DEBATES
intervene Io ensure that there is in fact a rationalization of
services.
Senator Marchand: 1 have a supplementary question. 1
would flot want it to be simply a rationalization because in the
exebange-and as you know, 1 have a very intimate knowledge
of this type of problem-it is very easy to impose on a crown
corporation specifie obligations that a private company would
not accept for obvious reasons, as was the case for the Canadian National Railways. If the same is donc in the case of Air
Canada, this will mean that sooner or later this company will
become non-profitable and this will bc used as an excuse to
hand it over to the private sector.
Senator Flynn: 1 arn certain that the government does not
wish to replace the presenit situation, where we have two
competitors, by a monopoly. wbetber of the private or the
public sector. 1 shahl certainly transmit the concernis and the
comments of the honourable senator to the Minister of
Transport.
Senator Marchand: 1 have another supplementary. The
minister is probably aware that, except for the United States,
nearly ail major countries have only one international carrier
wbich has no coînpetition. This is not the case in Canada.
Therefore, even though you say that we sbould not establish
a monopoly, it is not certain that this would not be desirable,
especially for international flights. This is cxactly what 1 ami
afraid of, that competition may increase to the extent that ail
our airlines will become inefficient.
Senator Flynn: 1 must cmphasize that this is the main
concern of the Nlinister of Transport. Our two major national
carriers should not compete 100 much for international flights,
but there should perhaps bc a more logical distribution than aI
the presenit time.

Senator Asselin: Any representation which will be made to

What we want as Canadians is to provide for their most
pressing needs and try to relieve their distress as soon as

order to achieve that level, that is a vastly different thing from
saying, "We are trying to control the aggregates by setting the
federal funds rate at a certain amount."
There is a difference, surely, between making the beacon the
interest rates, and the beacon the aggregates. It is an aproach,
I agree. The policy is the same, but the approach is all
important.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, I agree with that, senator. All you
are really saying is that when they were setting the federal
funds rate, in order to achieve an aggregate growth, they were
not setting it at the right place to get to their goal. They are
now going the other way around.
Senator Everett: That is the significant difference. When
they were trying to set the interest rates, they were not able to
control the aggregates. That is what Senator Lamontagne is
saying. They were not able to control the aggregates, and now
Mr. Volcker is saying, "We are going to control the aggregates, and the interest rates can go anywhere they have to go."
That is a significant change in policy.

going to control the aggregates. The record will have to speak
for itself. We will see what happens to the aggregates over the

Then we will be able to pass judgment on the policy. All I
am saying is that Senator Lamontagne was suggesting that
they had moved from a traditional Keynesian approach to
monetary policy to a monetarist Friedmonite approach. I am
merely saying that there is no move there. They have been on a
monetarist approach in the U.S. for the last decade.
Senator Lamontagne: I did not say that.
Senator Bosa: Has the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce studied the report of the Canadian Institute for
Economic Policy, which clearly demonstrates that the present

respected economists, namely, Messrs. Arthur Donner and
Douglas Peters?
Senator de Cotret: I disagree with both of them.
Senator Bosa: But will the minister respond to the specific
points they have raised?
Senator de Cotret: No, not at all.

Senator Haidasz: When the minister is investigating this
matter, will he tell us whether any officers of his department
have caused an investigation to be made in all government
departments and agencies of the federal government to find
out whether their practices are in accordance with the Human
Rights Act and its regulations?
Senator Flynn: I don't know if it is done on a systematic
basis, but I know the Commission on Canadian Human Rights
is monitoring the administration in this respect. If the commission found anything it would certainly advise both the department concerned and the Department of Justice, which is
responsible for enforcement of the principles of the act.
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION DURING VISIT TO CANADA-WEST
COAST SALMON FISHERY

Senator Williams: I should like to direct a question to either
the Leader of the Government or the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce. On the occasion of the visit of the
President of the United States, will the government discuss
matters of concern to the Pacific coast fishermen? For years
there has been an overtake by American fishermen of salmon
bound for Canadian rivers and their reproduction areas. On
the Gulf of Alaska, Canadian boats will no longer operate in
the halibut fisheries in 1980. The American government has
stated that our fishermen will no longer be able to operate on
the Gulf of Alaska, which has been an historic fishing ground
for Canadian fishermen for mar.y years, beginning possibly in
the late 1890s. Notwithstanding that fact, the Americans have
always had an overtake of Canadian salmon off the Fraser
River system, because Canadian fishermen have limited fishing time due to conservation requirements.
Senator Flynn: What is the question?
Senator Williams: Will the government discuss with the
President and his ministers why the Americans take that much
more salmon than the Canadians, although the salmon is
bound for Canadian waters? In Portland Canal, for instance,
while the Americans fish for five or six days, the Canadian
fishermen operate for maybe 12 hours in a week, and during
the past year there has been no commercial operation there.
Will the government raise this problem of the Canadian
fishermen having to conserve fish while the Americans are
allowed to continue fishing?
Senator Flynn: There are many details contained in the
small speech of the honourable senator. I can tell him that the
problem of fishing boundaries on the east and west coasts will
be discussed. I do not know about the details of the Alaska
problem.

275

SENATE DEBATES

November 7, 1979

I am aware of some problems; for instance, with respect to
the east coast there is an agreement that needs ratification by
the United States Senate. On the west coast there has been
some arrangement with regard to fishing rights, and so on.
I know that there are problems, and I know that some of
them are on the agenda. Whether all the specific matters the
honourable senator has raised are on the agenda I am not able
to tell him. The general concern will certainly be part of the
discussion.
Senator Williams: The question of the overtake does not
involve the boundaries that are now being negotiated.
Senator Flynn: No, there are other arrangements.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
CZECHOSLOVAKIA-TRIAL OF CHARTER 77 MEMBERS

Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I would like to
answer a question put yesterday by Senator Haidasz concerning the trial in Prague of certain Czech activists for human
rights belonging to the "Charter 77" group.
I would like to remind the senator that a motion was passed
by the House of Commons last October 22 which reads as
follows:
That this House register with the Parliament of the
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the concern and the
hope of the Canadian people that these trials be conducted publicly, be open to observers and that the human and
civil rights of those being tried be upheld and respected
according to the spirit of the Helsinki Act.
I also want to point out, honourable senators, that last July
the Honourable Flora MacDonald asked our ambassador in
Prague to pay a visit to the Czechoslovakian foreign affairs
ministry to convey the concern of the government over these
arrests. After the trial in Prague was over, Miss MacDonald
sent a personal message to her Czechoslovakian counterpart, a
copy of which I will forward to the senator later in the day.
That was the essence of the question which was put to me
yesterday.
IRAN-OCCUPATION OF UNITED STATES EMBASSY

Senator Asselin: I also wish, honourable senators, to answer
a question asked by Senator Austin concerning the situation in
Iran.
Obviously, the Government of Canada is very much concerned by the situation in Iran.
Our embassy is following it very closely. It has tragically
deteriorated but the motions passed in the Senate and the
House of Commons have been transmitted to the Government
of Iran. I also wish to point out that after the air rescue
mission of last February, fewer than 150 Canadians are still
living in Iran and most of them are staff members of our
embassy in Teheran and all steps have been taken to guarantee
their safety.

THE ENVIRONMENT
POLLUTION BY ACID RAIN

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Leader of the Government. About 10 days or
two weeks ago I asked him a question concerning the control,
or lack of control, of pollution at the Saskatchewan Power
Corporation plant being built at Coronach in southern Saskatchewan, and he promised to get me the information from
the Minister of the Environment.
I raise the matter today because I think there is some
urgency about it. I have a press release of last Friday that
indicates that, while the International Joint Commission ponders the future of expansion of the Saskatchewan Power
Corporation at Coronach, the corporation is forging ahead
with the first co-operated burning generator, to be opened
some time next spring.
* (1510)

The Government of Canada has the right, as I understand
it, to stop that development, but that would be perhaps too
drastic. The problem is that they are now planning the second
phase in spite of and in the face of complaints from not just
the Americans but the International Joint Commission on
which, as you know, Canadians sit.
I think there is some urgency that we get the answer so that
we can find out exactly where the government sits with respect
to this development.
Senator Flynn: The honourable senator will remember that
last week I told him the minister had asked his officials for a
complete report on the matter. It has not reached me, but I
will endeavour to find out if the minister has received it or
when he expects to receive it, if he has not already.
INCOME TAX ACT
CANADA PENSION PLAN
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Roblin moved the second reading of Bill C-17, to
amend the statute law relating to income tax and to amend the
Canada Pension Plan.
He said: Honourable senatorsHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I am touched by your
demonstration because I cannot imagine why anyone would
applaud a person who wants to make a speech on taxation,
particularly when it is imposing taxation in many respects. I
salute your patriotism.
Senator Everett: We applauded before so that we would not
have to applaud afterwards.
Senator Roblin: Then I had better take it while I can. So I
am grateful for that.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Croll: It is because il is a Liberal bill that you are
introducing. You know that.
Senator Roblin: It is a Liberal bill and that makes it all the
more surprising that there is that much enthusiasm for it. I
can assure vou that it has been amended in some important
particulars which will make it a little more palatable to the
world ai large, regardless of how it may appear to the Liberal
benches.
However, I can say that, by and large, members of the
chamber will be familiar with the contents of this bill, because
last year around this time, perhaps a little later, the then
Minister of Finance brought down in the other place his
budget, and it was as a result of that budget that Bill C-37 was
prepared last year. Bill C-37 is the direct antecedent of Bill
C-17 which we are discussing today.
That bill came to the Senate by way of the pre-study route
and was consigned to the attention of the Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce where it received a lengthy
examination.
As a result, there was a report, which is rather good,
prepared under the direction of the Honourable Senator Salter
Hayden, the Chairman of the Banking, Trade and Commerce
Committee, and which was presented to this house. I draw
attention of the members to the fact that at that time Senator
Hayden gave what I believe was a splendid resumé of what
was in that committee's report, and those who may be interested in looking it up will find it instructive.
Today I want to do three things as briefly as possible. One is
to tell you what is in the present bill. The second is to deal with
some of the differences between the present bill and its predecessor, Bill C-37 of the last session of Parliament. The third is
to make a comment or two on the fate of the Senate Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee's recommendations which
were presented to this chamber and to the government of the
day, and to the present government before Bill C-17 was
prepared.
Starting with what is in the bill today, 1 repeat that we are
familiar with most of its contents, but perhaps it would be well
to put them on the record once again. The major measures are
as follows: First, the 3 per cent employment expense deduction
is to be increased from $250 to $500 commencing with the
1979 taxation year. Secondly, the investment tax credit and
research development tax credit have been enriched and
extended. The details indicate that the credits are extended
indefinitely beyond the present termination date, which is July
1 of next year. The rates are increased with an escalation in
favour of the less developed sections of the country. The
increase is from 51½2, 71½ and 10 per cent respectively to 7, 10

and 20 per cent respectively, with the highest rates applying in
the Atlantic provinces and the Gaspé region of Quebec,
excluding the Montreal-Hull corridor, northern Ontario,
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, northern Alberta, northern British Columbia and the Yukon and Northwsest Territories. This
repeats what was in the former bill.
[Senator Roblin.]

November 7,

1979

The 7 per cent investment tax credit is extended to include
transportation equipment, defined as including commercial
aircraft, railway and shipping assets, intercity buses and longhaul trucks.
The next important feature of the bill is the basic tax credit
of 5 per cent of current and capital expenditures on research
and development. That will be raised to 10 per cent in most
regions and to 20 per cent in the Atlantic provinces and in the
Gaspé region. This tax credit would be increased to 25 per cent
for research and development expenditures by a Canadiancontrolled private corporation that qualifies for the small
business tax rate.
This is another one of the special measures which 1 think all
parties are interested in for improving the economic climate
for small businesses in the country.
The bill then proceeds to the question of oil well or gas well
drilling fund incentives. This allows a 100 per cent write-off
for Canadian exploration expenses incurred by individuals and
non-resource corporations to be extended to December 31,
1981. This is part of the package of incentives to go drilling for
oil and gas that we have discussed in this chamber on a
number of occasions, and the application of the concession is
extended for a further period, as I have said.
The bill then provides that financial institutions-including,
among others, banks, life insurance companies, and trust
companies-are taxable on earnings from term preferred
shares and income debentures issued after November 16, 1978.
I think this is another familiar topic to those who have been
following the development of taxation with respect to this kind
of financial instrument, and the government is, in effect,
carrying out the previous indication that these tax concessions
would be no longer available on these particular financial
instruments.
There is another set of important matters in the bill that
have to deal with matters like the registered retirement savings
plan funds, the tax deductibility of interest and property taxes
on land awaiting development, the deductibility of underwriting expenses, the evaluation of industries and of the inventories, the taxation of income for deferred annuities and matters
of that kind which, I think honourable senators will agree, are
rather complicated and would probably not benefit from any
attempt on my part to explain them in detail. I would rather
suggest that those who might be interested in the details
should take advantage of the meetings of the Banking, Trade
and Commerce Committee to get exact explanations from the
officials of the tax collecting departments.
So far these measures are, by and large, the same as we
found in the previous bill, but I now come to one change which
is quite important. This has to do with the small business tax
situation.
* (1520)

Before getting into that matter, I should point out that, by
my count, there are some 32 changes in Bill C-17 over Bill
C-37, most of which are of a relatively minor character. The

November 7, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

change would be subject to the 331/3 per cent small business tax
rate, such corporations will be given time to re-arrange their
affairs so that they can receive the benefit of the lowest small
business tax rate on eligible active business income. Because
some companies may be unable to re-arrange their affairs
before the end of the year, the Minister of National Revenue is
prepared to allow corporations that wish to re-organize in the
light of these amendments to change their fiscal year-ends in
1980.
Honourable senators, i am the first to admit that the
introduction of a third level of income tax for corporations can
do nothing but complicate the situation. I think we have to
face that. The justification for it must be that it represents a
more equitable arrangement, all things being considered, than
the arrangement contained in the previous measure. As we all
find, as life proceeds, the tax laws become more and more
difficult, more and more complicated. 1, for one, certainly
must join those who express their unhappiness that that should
be the course of events. It will take, i suppose, another serious
and deep-rooted reform of our tax structure-hopefully, not
along the same lines as the one which took place 10 years
ago-if we are ever to simplify our tax structure.
Incidentally, the Economic Council of Canada, in its recent
report-was it the thirteenth? I wonder if it was. If so, it is an
unlucky number, and it may be unlucky for that organization.
In any event, that report contained a positive proposal as to
how we might simplify the whole of our corporation tax
Instead of paying taxes at a rate of 331/3 per cent in the
structure-a proposal which, I hope, will receive some concircumstances indicated, the tax rate under the previous meassideration in the time to come on the part of those interested in
ure would have been 46 to 51 per cent, depending on the

The proposals introduced in the last measure that was
before us made certain changes that would have denied the
special corporate tax rate on small businesses to three categories of business income-professional income, income from
certain personal services, and income from the provision of
certain management and other administrative services.
The new bill, while re-affirming the principle that there has
to be a different treatment for those particular classes of
activity, has somewhat softened the impact over that which
would have prevailed had the previous bill been passed. The
major proposal is that a new small business tax rate of 33½ per
cent be introduced for any Canadian-controlled private company engaged in any of the three categories of business I have
outlined. For this purpose, the professional group, which originally included doctors, dentists, lawyers and accountants, will
bc expanded to include veterinarians and chiropractors.
The new approach will generally ensure that when the
corporation pays a dividend, the amount of the tax for which a
shareholder will receive credit will approximate the amount of
tax actually paid by the corporation. As a result, the overall
tax result will be neutral, whether the corporation pays salaries
or dividends. That, indeed, is the distinction between this
proposal and the one contained in the previous measure. In the
previous measure, the tax position would not be neutral.

have filled out their income tax returns on the basis of the
budgetary statements accompanying the last budget, with the
result that there is a good deal of uncertainty. The Department
of National Revenue has flot been able to assess certain tax

this bill is considered as quickly as possible.

CO) ST[AL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Macdonald, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Roblin, P.C., for the second reading of the Bill S-3,
intituled: "An Act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act".-(HonourableSenator Peien).
Senator Petten: Honourable senators, 1 yield to the 1-onourable Senator Thériault.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators,
that Senator Thériault proceed now instead of Senator Petten?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Thériault: Having perused Bill S-3, 1 am sure that
ail honourable senators will agree it is necessary legislation.
The few points that 1 wish to make, honourable senators,
concern not s0 much what is contained in the bill, but with the
fisheries as a wbole as they affect the Atlantic provinces and
the province of Quebec.
* (1530)

1 well undcrstand that the department must increase penaltics for the reasons set out in the bill. However, what has
bothered me for a number of years, and which still bothers
mie-and bothers aIl those conccrned with fisheries-is the
fact that we do not feel that the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans is physically equipped to oversee the movement of
foreign vessels in the fishing industry.
It is truc that quotas are allocated and there is a restriction
on the number of vessels permitted to fish at certain times, and
also on the quantity and species of fish. But there is a feeling
Senator
Roblin.1

around the Atlantic coast that the department is not equipped
really to control the catches. That is one concern that 1 have.
The bill does flot refer to my next point, but 1 want to take
the opportunity afforded me to express my real concern about
wbat is happening in the fisbing industry around the Atlantic
coast. 1 have asked questions of Senator de Cotret and his
answer was that this is a constitutional matter. It seems to me
that over the years, fishermen, like many other Canadians,
have become a little fed up with constitutional talk and are
more concerned with bread and butter issues. That concern
was perhaps reflected in the way that people in certain parts of
the country voted during the last federal election.
Senator Marchand raised a serious point earlier today when
hie indicated that a decision had been taken three years ago by
-the former Minister of Fisheries restricting trawlers over 100
feet in length from fishing in the Gulf.
The subject of fisheries is probably flot ail that important to
many of my honourable colleagues in the Senate, but it is to
people in the Atlantic region. It is a growing industry, one for
which there is a future, which assists our export trade and
helps our balance of payments and trade deficits.
Since the imposition of the 200-mile limit along the Atlantic
coast-and, 1 presumne, on the western coast-there has been a
tremendous improvement in the catches and export of that
resource.
1-uman nature being what it is, when tl comes to dollars we
are ail looking for more. Fishermen are no different, and some
of the large fish processors are no different. The decision that
was reached three years ago, to prevent trawlers over 100 feet
in length from fishing in the Gulf, resultcd in an improvement
of the industry for inshore fishermen. In dollar terms, when
people talk about fisheries, anyone who is flot familiar with the
situation might think of the millions of dollars for investment.
But what really matters is the number of people who are
providcd with jobs. For each job provided for offshore fishermen, there are 10 or more jobs for inshore fishermen to enable
them to make a living. For over 50 years fishing bas been a
rough way to make a living, but lately, during the past four or
five years, there has been an improvement. Anyone who travels
along the Atlantic coast can easily sec the improvement that
has taken place in the economic situation of the inshore
fis hermen.
The larger fish processors in Nova Scotia have benefited
greatly by the imposition of the 200-mile fishing zone and are
making money. The trawlers are making money, as are tbe
companies. But starting November 1, fishzrmen say they want
to be able to fish in the Gulf. They say that trawlers under 100
feet in lcngth cannot get out. l is true that they cannot get
out, but the fish will still be there, one cannot catch them
twice.
This matter concerns me very much and 1 hope that those
honourable senators who are interested in the fishing industry
on the Atlantic coast. and the fishing industry in general. will
take careful note of the various committees which at this time
are making representations to the Minister of Fisheries for the

November 7, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

reversal of the decision that was made. I hope that honourable
senators on both sides of the house will assist fishermen by
persuading the federal government to reverse its decision.
1 wish to make one further point. I am pleased that the bill
is now before us, because it proves to me that for the time
being the federal government intends to retain its jurisdiction
over fisheries. The other evening I had the pleasure of hearing
Senator Smith (Colchester) speak about offshore mineral
rights. While I did not agree with him on that score, 1 respect
his research and knowledge on the subject. During the course
of his remarks he mentioned fisheries and certain treaties. I
am concerned that decisions are now being made which, in my
opinion, will play right into the hands of René Lévesque and
his separatists in Quebec.
I have had some experience, as a provincial minister, in
attending conferences at the federal-provincial level. I used to
converse with my counterparts from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Manitoba and Saskatchewan-provinces, including New
Brunswick, that were not as powerful as Quebec and Ontario.
What always bothered me at those federal-provincial conferences was the fact that whenever the federal government,
irrespective of the party in power, got a consensus from
Quebec and Ontario, that was it. I am perhaps diverting from
the subject of the bill, but this is the first opportunity I have
had of addressing this chamber and I hope that honourable
senators will be patient with me and will allow me to make
known my feelings.
Returning to the subject of fisheries, when I hear the
Premier of Newfoundland say that he is going to meet with the
Prime Minister of Canada, and that he believes that the
control of fisheries should go to the provinces, and that a
certain stock of cod should be retained for the fishermen of
Newfoundland; and when I hear the Premier of Nova Scotia,
and some provincial ministers, say that provinces should have
more control over fisheries, I am concerned. The Premier of
British Columbia would want control over everything. In
British Columbia it would not be much of a problem because
there is no provincial dispute on the Pacific coast.
Perhaps honourable senators can tell me how they foresee
the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island getting together and saying, "We
are going to fish there, you are going to fish here; we are going
to fish here in May and you will fish there in June."? It does
not make sense. I hope, honourable senators, that by introducing this bill, which to some may not seem important in content,
the federal government does not intend to give away to the
provinces its jurisdiction over fisheries. It should not do so.
Each summer now we have almost a state of war between
Quebec and New Brunswick over the matter of trout fishing
and other types of fishing, because fishermen say, "These are
our waters; you cannot fish here."
(1540)
(

That has happened, and I do not want this happening
between Quebec and New Brunswick, or between New Brunswick and P.E.I., or between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia

and Newfoundland. I hope that very soon indeed someone on
behalf of the Canadian government will be able to take a firm
stand on policy, and that the Government of Canada does not
intend at any time to relinquish any of its jurisdiction over
fisheries to provincial governments.

CANADA-FRANCE TRADE AGREEMENT ACT, 1933
SUPPLEMENTARY CANADA-FRANCE TRADE
AGREEMENT ACT, 1935
BILL TO REPEAL-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October 30, the debate
on the motion of Senator de Cotret for the second reading of
Bill S-2, to repeal the Canada-France Trade Agreement Act,
1933 and the Supplementary Canada-France Trade Agreement Act, 1935.
Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, it would appear that
the only real effect of the trade agreement this bill cancels was
to prohibit the makers of Canadian sparkling wines from
calling them champagne. The word "champagne" is an appellation of origin which designates in France wines produced
entirely in the region of the wine growing province of Champagne, and which have been sparkled by a second fermentation
in botles. All sorts of other sparkling wines, which are not
named champagne, are manufactured in other areas of France
by other methods, and also in many other countries.
Since 1920 the appellation "champagne" had been used in
Canada for a type of sparkling wine by numerous wine producers. The 1933 trade agreement did not have any effect on
the conduct of Canadian wine producers. Not only did they
continue to use the word "champagne," but they did everything they could to mislead the public into thinking that the
wine was either actually produced in France or was made in
Canada by the same methods used in France, and was of the
same or superior quality.
On the labels of the bottles the name "Canadian" did not
appear until 1947. The largest producer of these so-called
champagnes, namely, Canadian Wineries Limited, changed its

SENATE DEBATES
corporate name in 1942 to Château-Gai Wines Limited, which
had a nice French ring to it, and no doubt deceived some of the
more gullible into thinking that they were buying French
wines, or wines of the same nature and quality.
In 1947, the Department of National Health and Welfare
ordered the producers of Canadian wines to add the word
"Canadian" to the word "champagne" on all the labels of
bottles containing sparkling wines sold under the name of
"champagne." Following this edict, the word "Canadian" was
evidently not given much prominence, because in 1956 the
department issued a further directive that the word "Canadian" had to become an integral part of the name of these wines
and was to be written in identical type. These wines are now
known as "Canadian Champagne," so I think it would be
unlikely that anyone is deceived into thinking that these wines
are produced in the Champagne district of France.
Having been thwarted in their efforts to conceal the fact
that this so-called champagne was made in Canada, ChâteauGai then worked out a scheme to convince the Canadian
public, first that their champagne was made the same way as
the French champagne, and, secondly, that it was of equal or
superior quality to the French product.
In furtherance of their first aim-and I might say to
deliberately deceive the Canadian public-they printed on
their bottle labels:
This bottle of champagne comes from a special vatfull
which has been exposed to a second fermentation and
made of wine selected and mixed in our cellars in virtue of
a licence for using the "Méthode Charmat de France"which is a special technique which was perfected by the
wine growers and for which Château-Gai Wines Limited
was granted exclusivity for the whole of Canada.
The méthode charmat de France is a method for fermentation in closed vats. In France, it is illegal to use this method in
the manufacture of champagne wines, so Canadian champagne is not made in the same way as the French champagne.
In furtherance of their second aim to convince the Canadian
public that their wine was of equal or superior quality to the
French product, Château-Gai extensively advertised the fact
that in the year 1954 it was awarded the Medal of Leadership
for its premium quality champagne at the International Wine
Competition held in Paris, France, by an international organization known as l'Institut International d'Alimentation. This
was an organization from Brussels, whose main, and in the end
only, organizer was a gentleman by the name of Gustave
Dhont Il, who was later convicted of fraud for his activities
with respect to it. Under the rules of the so-called competition,
the wines of France were excluded from the competition.
Château-Gai never explained how you judge superiority in the
category of champagnes if from the start the wines from
Champagne were eliminated. Despite the publicity surrounding the conviction of Gustave Dhont, Château-Gai continue to
reproduce the medals in its publicity, and in 1961 extensively
advertised the fact that it had bought an early 18th century
Buhl cabinet to display the medals.
[Senator Godfrey.]

November 7, 1979

Not content with this, they reproduced in their report a
picture of a shop window taken in Paris showing Château-Gai
products, in order to have the Canadian public believe that its
products were generally sold in France in competition with
French wines. An article appeared, with a photograph of the
president of Château-Gai, entitled, "He sells Ontario wine in
the very heart of France." What actually happened was that
they made an arrangement with a wine shop in the rue de
Gareté to place Château-Gai bottles in the window at night
after closing hours. They then took the picture and immediately emptied the window of the Château-Gai bottles.
I obtained the facts I have recited from a judgment of the
Quebec Superior Court, delivered in December 1968, in a case
brought against Château-Gai by the French champagne producers, who were awarded an injunction prohibiting the use of
the word "champagne" by Château-Gai. This judgment was
affirmed by the Quebec Court of Appeal in November 1972,
and by the Supreme Court of Canada in April 1974, on a split
decision.
From the time of the original decision in 1968, all kinds of
pressure was brought on the federal government to rescind the
1933 trade agreement with France so that Château-Gai and
other Canadian wine producers could continue to sell Canadian champagne. While the original judgment applied only to
Quebec, the French wine producers started another action in
Ontario, after they had won the Quebec suit in the Supreme
Court of Canada.
The government was in a dilemma. While the wine producers had apparently cleaned up their act, they had undoubtedly in the past indulged in practices to deceive the Canadian
public which were inexcusable, and it was only because of
intervention by the federal government that they clearly
labelled their product as "Canadian champagne."
Our relations with France were somewhat delicate after
General de Gaulle's visit in 1967. While the trade agreement
was in practice very one-sided, as it really only benefited
France, it was evidently decided that the wine producers of
Canada making Canadian champagne had to suffer in order
that our relations with France would not deteriorate further.
e

(1550)

Then, of course, came the famous visit of René Lévesque to
Paris in November 1967, when the French government paid
him honour in such a way as to give the impression of
encouraging Mr. Lévesque in his efforts to break up the
country.
Personally, I thought it entirely appropriate for the Canadian government in December 1977 to respond to that provocation by giving notice of cancelling the trade agreement,
although the government has not admitted that that influenced
them in any way. While 1 did not have much sympathy for the
way Chateau-Gai had behaved, there were other wine producers involved who had apparently not gone to quite the same
lengths to deceive the Canadian public.
On February 13, 1979, I moved the second reading of Bill
S-1 1 relating to trademarks and unfair competition. At page

November 7, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

531 of the Senate Hansard I discussed at length how the new
Trademark Act would afford protection to certain appellations
of origin in Canada and particularly champagne. I will not
repeat what I said at that time. That bill died on the order
paper when Parliament was dissolved. I presume it will be
reintroduced with these particular provisions. As I pointed out
in my speech at that time, if the makers of Canadian champagne drop the word "Canadian" from their labels they will
lose the right to use the word "champagne", so that the French
makers of champagne will be protected in a manner that is
consistent with international practice and the Paris Convention
on Trademarks.
In my opinion the Canadian government has done the right
thing by introducing this bill confirming the decision of the
previous government to cancel the Canada-France trade agreements of 1933 and 1935, and I support it.

senators, that I put the question?
Some Hon. Senators: Question.

INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Nurgitz moved the second reading of Bill S-4, to
implement conventions between Canada and Spain, Canada
and the Republic of Liberia, Canada and the Republic of
Austria, Canada and Italy, Canada and the Republic of
Korea, Canada and the Socialist Republic of Romania and
Canada and the Republic of Indonesia and agreements between Canada and Malaysia and Canada and Jamaica.
He said: A bill in this form has been in this chamber on
several occasions in various numbers, and has brought on some
24 tax agreements with various foreign countries. The purpose
of the bill is to implement conventions between, in this case,
Canada and Spain, Canada and Liberia, Canada and Austria,
Canada and Italy, Canada and the Republic of Korea, Canada
and the Socialist Republic of Romania and Canada and the
Republic of Indonesia, and agreements between Canada and
Malaysia and Canada and Jamaica, for the avoidance of
double taxation with respect to income tax. In addition, the bill
provides that the Governor in Council may, subject to a

80072-19

resolution of Parliament, give effect by order in council to any
supplementary conventions or agreements.
At the time of tax reform, Canada had 16 tax treaties in
force. That number is now 24, and it is expected that some 40
other countries will be added to the list, subject of course to
the conclusion of negotiations with them.
As in the case of similar legislation approved by Parliament
over the last three years or so, this bill contains a part which
deals with supplementary conventions or agreements; and that
is Part X of the bill. That part is designed to ensure that the
tax treaties can be kept up to date as a result of changes in the
tax system of Canada and of the other countries. The mechanism provided in this bill is similar to that agreed to previously, and contained in the various other bills approved in this
chamber.
The nine tax treaties under review follow the general pattern
of the treaties previously concluded with other countries after
tax reform. They also follow to a large extent the format and
language of the Model Double Taxation Convention prepared
by the Committee of Fiscal Affairs of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. The
agreement with Jamaica, when in force, will replace the
existing agreement signed in 1971.
Honourable senators, I would point out that although the
bill is quite voluminous, we should concern ourselves mostly
with the treaties with Romania and Indonesia. Some of you
will remember that this house has already approved twice the
treaties with Malaysia, Spain, Liberia, Austria and Italy-it
was Bill S-2 in the last session-and approved once the treaties
with South Korea and Jamaica, and that was Bill S-7 in the
last session. 1 understand the treaty with the United Kingdom,
which was also part of former Bill S-7, will be reintroduced at
a later date once some current renegotiations are completed.
The treaties generally provide that dividends can be taxed in
the country of source at a maximum rate of 15 per cent. In the
case of Malaysia, the rate is nil for dividends received by
Canadians because Malaysia does not impose a tax of general
application on dividends, and in the case of Jamaica the rate is
set, as in the existing agreement, at 222 per cent when the
Canadian enterprise controls the Jamaican enterprise.
A general rate of 15 per cent-20 per cent in some cases
with Liberia-is provided for in the case of interest originating
in one country and paid to a resident of the other country.
Certain types of interest-for example, interest paid to the
Export Development Corporation-are exempted in the source
country. The 1971 agreement with Jamaica did not put any
ceiling on the Canadian rate.
With respect to royalties, the treaties provide for a general
rate of 10 per cent except that the ones with Korea, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Romania provide for a rate of 15 per cent. The
1971 agreement with Jamaica provided for a 12½ per cent rate
in the case of Jamaica, and no ceiling in the case of Canada.
The treaties with Spain, Austria, Italy and Jamaica also
provide for an exemption in case of copyright royalties, while
the one with Romania sets the rate at 10 per cent.

SENATE DEBATES
Some of the other matters also deait with in these tax
treaties include, for example, a provision dealing with capital
gains.
The provisions of the nine treaties relating to capital gains
are in line with the Canadian policy of preserving the right of
the source country to tax gains arising on the sale of real
property, business assets and shares in real estate companies.
There is a non-discrimination section. Discrimination, based
on the concept of nationality, is prohibited under all the
treaties. This will ensure a fair and equal treatment in the nine
countries concerned. On the other hand, fiscal incentives based
on the concept of residence, such as the small business deduction and the dividend tax credit in Canada, will not be
affected-that is, they will not have to be extended to
non-residents.
There is a provision with respect to teachers. In line with the
White Paper on Tax Reform, no special concession for teachers from abroad is included in the tax treaties. The unilateral
exemption granted Canadian teachers in Jamaica has been
removed in the new treaty with Jamaica.
Dealing with pensions, Canada has preserved its right to tax
pensions paid to residents of the nine countries included in this
bill. In the case of Italy, however, there is a special provision
whereby Canada or Italy will exercise that right only if the
pension paid in a year exceeds $10,000. The country in which
the recipient of the pension resides retains its full taxing rights.

•

(1600)

Dealing next with double taxation relief, the provision dealing with methods for eliminating double taxation is a very
important one, perhaps the most essential of these agreements.
Double taxation of foreign-source income of Canadian residents is alleviated by way of a foreign tax credit. In addition,
an exemption is granted for certain dividends received from a
foreign affiliate of a Canadian company. In order to promote
the flow of capital and investment, the tax treaties also ensure
that proper relief will be granted in the other countries in
respect of taxes paid in Canada.

November 7, 1979

The tax treaties with Malaysia, Spain, Liberia, Korea,
Jamaica, Romania and Indonesia contain an additional feature, commonly referred to as a "tax-sparing provision."
Under such a provision, the tax incentives granted by those
countries under pioneer-industry legislation will directly benefit Canadian residents. This is achieved by Canada's agreeing
to take into account, for the purposes of computing the foreign
tax credit, the amount of tax which would have been payable
in the absence of the special incentive legislation.
On balance, honourable senators, the terms of the tax
treaties provide an equitable solution to the various problems
of double taxation existing between Canada and the various
countries mentioned. Therefore, I commend this bill to the
most favourable consideration of this house. If the bill receives
second reading, I intend to move that it be referred to
committee.

The Canadian and U.S. economic and monetary situations
Discussion in Committee I began with a general review of
the state of the two economies. It was noted that both countries have high rates of inflation, with the United States
recently rising to double digit levels. Unemployment had been
serious in Canada for a number of years and was expected to
rise in the United States from 5.7 per cent to 6.9 per cent
officially and, according to leaked internal documents, to as
high as 8.2 per cent by the end of 1980. Both countries had
large budget deficits, with the level being disturbingly high in
Canada. The United States and the Canadian dollars were
weak internationally, and both governments had raised interest
rates to unprecedented levels to defend the dollar. The United
States had a large visible trade deficit while Canada continued
to run a serious current account deficit. Productivity in both
countries was a problem and neither economy was in a strong
state.
An American speaker stated that the U.S. economy was in a
stronger position than when the downturn began in 1974.
Between 1974 and May 1975 unemployment had risen from
5.4 per cent to 9.1 per cent. Banks were not as extended as at
that time; interest rates, though high, were below the rate of
inflation and the money supply was not growing rapidly as had
been the case in 1974. There was also a major new investment
objective in the President's synthetic fuel proposal which could
create demand for employment.
Discussion of possible remedies was inconclusive. Tax cuts
were considered, but it was pointed out that previous cuts had
not generated productive investment. In Canada's case it was
noted that the budget deficit was so large that the government
could not consider such a move. Some U.S. speakers showed a
preference for selective tax cuts or even support of food and
energy prices if such an approach were adopted at all.

persuading the Japanese and the European Community companies to assume a reserve currency role.

GA TT, bilateral trade and protective trade practices
Discussion on the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN)
was more encouraging for both delegations. All speakers
expressed satisfaction with the result. Canadian speakers
expressed a hope that exports of fish and papers would
strengthen and that the tariff on petrochemicals might be
lowered in subsequent bilateral negotiations.
The main point discussed was the successful passage
through Congress of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ai a
time when most other bills of the Administration were in deep
trouble. The final result was a surprise to almost everyoneonly 7 opposed in the House and 4 in the Senate. All American
speakers considered the successful passage of such a complex
and potentially divisive bill remarkable, particularly given the
size of the merchandise trade deficit and the weakness of the
U.S. economy. Particular surprise was expressed regarding
acceptance of limitations on federal procurement-Buy
America. All gave credit to Mr. Robert Strauss the former
Special Trade Representative. They suggest the technique he
had employed should be a model for any difficult negotiations
in future.
Mr. Strauss had in fact conducted parallel negotiations,
with the GATT countries on the one side, and with Congress
on the other. The U.S. negotiators had met with the relevant
House and Senate committee members "literally hundreds of
times". Portions of the draft bill were reviewed in sub-committee and later in full committee of the House Ways and Means
and Senate Finance committees. Consultations with affected
interest groups such as steel and agriculture were conducted
through or in the presence of the Congressmen representing
districts directly involved. Mr. Strauss ranaged either to
satisfy or neutralize all the major affected interest groups.
While the final bill submitted by the Administration differed
slightly from the agreed draft, it was still accepted
overwhelmingly.
A Congressman from New York state warned of continuing
protectionist pressures, especially when business and labour
collaborated. To illustrate, he suggested that the New York
State legislature might be convened in special session and that
there might be sufficient votes to over-ride Governor Carey's
recent veto of a bill favouring domestically produced steel,
The suggestion was made that allowing the two dollars to which would seriously affect Canadian exports. Another
American speaker noted that, in spite of the pressing need for
decline might increase relative competitiveness. Others pointed
out that past experience indicated that, especially in the short boxcars to carry wheat for export, the strong support of the
term, the cost of higher imports may be greater than the gains farm vote and the limited capacity of U.S. industry to meet the
from lower priced exports. It was noted that Canada had not need (they are 2 years behind on orders), a provision to remove

American speakers agreed, but pointed to the difficulty of problems. A general difficulty concerned efforts to support

development in slow growth regions of Canada, especially the
Atlantic provinces. This was a problem which had no parallel
in the United States. The efforts had attracted countervail
against Michelin tire imports from Nova Scotia and countervail had also been threatened against fish because of some
support programs. The U.S. Treasury had ruled in January
1979 that a grant provided to Honeywell Ltd. to support the
development of optic liquid level sensors in Canada constituted
a grant justifying countervail under U.S. law. An American
replied that in this instance the Treasury had made an important distinction; the decision was based on the support used by
Honeywell for market research and development, as distinct
from scientific research and development.
A letter from SPAR Aerospace Limited to the Canadian
co-chairman pointing to the difficulties and delays they had
experienced-as a result of Congressional questioning after an
agreement between the NRC and NASA had been negotiated-was discussed and the letter subsequently circulated. The
technique used by Mr. Strauss to secure Congressional approval of the Trade Agreements Act was advanced as a model in
such a case. Given the way Congress operates, it was essential
that any U.S. agency negotiating an agreement with a foreign
partner should consult regularly with the responsible committee Chairmen in both Houses and with Senators and Representatives who might be affected. It was also agreed that the
Canada-U.S. Interparliamentary Group could serve as an
early-warning network, but that its influence was limited.
The question of bilateral free trade was only briefly mentioned in Committee. A Congressman expressed personal preference for free trade. He recognized the need to move slowly
and at a speed acceptable to Canada. He wondered if it might
be possible to move toward the goal sector by sector. The only
Canadian to respond, an NDP Member, expressed concern
that movement toward free trade would intensify the problems
Canada faced from its branch plant economy. This led to a
brief discussion of the nature of this problem, with an American saying how impressed he was by the development of the
Canadian economy, given the size and shape of the economy
and the size of the domestic market.
Border Broadcasting and the Convention Tax Issues
The issue of Canadian rules on the tax treatment of advertising on U.S. television, of particular concern to some stations
near the border with large Canadian audiences, was raised by
an American Congressman representing an affected community. He wondered whether the election of a Conservative
government might lead to a change in policy since the party
had opposed Bill C-58. He also drew attention to the meeting
of officials planned for the following week and inquired whether Canadian attendance was a sign of willingness to negotiate.
He suggested that the U.S. stations would be prepared to
establish a development fund to be used to produce programmes in Canada if the Act were amended to make this
possible. Providing there was no further deletion of advertising
on cable television, he thought such a step would end the
resistance of the border broadcasting lobby. Just after a new

election, he stated, was the best time to make a policy change.
Without it, he feared the possibility of U.S. retaliation if the
Special Trade Representative-in response to the complaint
filed by 14 U.S. stations-recognizes injury under section 301
of the Trade Act.
Canadian Members from all parties were agreed that a
change of policy in the face of U.S. pressure was unlikely.
They pointed to the fact-already known to the affected U.S.
Congressman-that the two responsible Ministers had broken
with their party and voted in favour of Bill C-58. Canadian
TV had benefitted from the Act, and Canadians voluntarily
contributed about $4 million a year to Public Broadcasting
Service stations in the United States, an amount approximately equal to the decline in revenue of U.S. border broadcasting
stations. Finally, Canadian delegates stated that the government's aim had been cultural; only in the United States was it
seen as a tax measure.
This exchange led an American on the House Ways &
Means Committee, which had authored the Tax Reform Act
of 1976 and tightened up the rules on convention tax expenses,
to explain that his committee's sole objective had been to close
a tax loophole. He admitted that "without malice of forethought or any forethought at all", the Congress had blundered into this problem. While there was "no legitimate
linkage" of the convention tax and border broadcasting, the
link was now a political fact of life. A Senator added that, with
Senators Jackson and Magnusson, Javits and Moynihan, ready
to "take the floor" against any special treatment of Canada
until the broadcasting lobby was satisfied, he was doubtful
that Canada could hope for exemption. He added that Senator
Magnusson was chairman of the Appropriations Committee
and all four men were well connected and influential in the
Senate.
The same Senator went on to question whether, even if the
border broadcasting issue were resolved, Canada could then
count on exemption. The United States was receiving representations from Mexico and the Caribbean countries regarding
convention tax treatment and could more justly claim that
tourism was more important to their economy than could
Canada. It would, therefore, be difficult to exempt Canada
without doing the same for these countries, yet there were
several linked issues involving Mexico which would first have
to be resolved. Another problem was that some Congressmen
felt that the tax treatment of conventions held in the United
States was still too generous. He noted that no one came to
lobby him on the importance of an exemption for Canada.
Finally, he personally was impressed that Canadian treatment
would not be reciprocal if an exemption were granted; under
Canadian law associations had to demonstrate a U.S. connection to qualify for tax deductibility if the convention were held
in the United States. To this last point, a Canadian observed
that most Canadian organizations had such an association.
The important point which emerged was that U.S. delegates
were doubtful that satisfaction of the complaints of border
broadcasting stations could lead to an assured exemption for

Canada on convention tax treatment. Thus, while the link had
been used in Congress to contest an exemption for Canada, the
reverse of the proposition did not necessarily prevail. Indeed,
the only positive approach to emerge to this difficult combination of problems was the suggestion that Canada and the
United States should try to negotiate reciprocal tax treatment
rules for conventions and then seek exemption on this ground.
This would at least offer a legitimate link and provide an
effective argument for de-coupling border broadcasting.
The Automotive Industry
This issue was introduced by a Canadian delegate who
rehearsed the main facts: that both countries and the companies involved have benefitted and that the average annual
increase in trade in automobiles and parts has been 22 per
cent; that in only 3 of 14 years has Canada had a net surplus;
and that of particular concern to Canadians is the fact that the
deficit is growing and expected to do so until 1985. In assessing this situation it appeared that it was unrealistic to re-open
the agreement itself. This left open only the possibility of
leaning on the companies to place a reasonable share of new
investment in Canada, especially that involving high technology manufacture. This was what the government was doing.
Unfortunately, this opened up competitive bidding, a situation
from which only the companies benefitted.
There was little that American delegates had to say about
this argument. One questioned whether auto trade had to be
balanced, but the Canadian response that it represented threequarters of bilateral trade in manufactures robbed this argument of most of its force. It was noted that the auto industry
within the United States was moving to the sun belt. As
appears in the next section on investment issues, this was a
trend the American delegates seemed prepared to see resolved
by the market. It was also pointed out that plants in the south
were being unionized quite rapidly, which should lead to
higher wages and reduction of the differential in the south
which now represents part of the incentive. Finally, a U.S.
delegate pointed to the internationalization of automobile production as yet another problem. A Canadian agreed, noting
that General Motors was negotiating with some 9 countries
over the construction of a new engine plant.
A U.S. delegate warned that Congressman Charles Vanik
chairman of the responsible sub-committee of the Ways and
Means Committee, has been talking of holding hearings on the
auto pact. In particular, he was concerned about Canada's
more liberal treatment of parts made in third countries, which,
having entered Canada duty-free, then flowed duty-free into
the United States.
Another United States Congressman on the Ways and
Means Committee, on being told that after-market parts were
excluded from the auto pact and were dutiable, reacted by
suggesting that with tariffs as low as they now were, he did not
see why after-market parts should not also move free of duty
between the two countries and in effect be included in the auto
pact.

Investnent Issues and Locational Grants
The opening American speaker expressed satisfaction with
the present state of relations in this area. On being reminded
of the possible expropriation of a U.S.-owned asbestos company by the Province of Quebec, he continued to show little
concern, explaining that asbestos caused so many environmental problems that the main interest was in finding a substitute.
He acknowledged that the expropriation a few years earlier of
a U.S. potash company by the government of Saskatchewan
had aroused concern at the time, but that that situation had
worked out so well that there was no residue of anxiety. He
repeated that, if the United States could find a substitute for
asbestos, asbestos would be harmed, but that this would not be
an action directed against Canada.
Canadian comments on the actions of the government of
Quebec related to the history of the asbestos industry in
Quebec and would probably mean that even a successor government would continue the policy. Also involved was a desire
to seek ways of upgrading asbestos before it was exported.
Discussion on locational grants reflected the same attitude
evident in discussion of the auto pact, namely that U.S. states
could not be prevented from competing among themselves.
Particularly in times of unemployment, there was fierce rivalry
among states. The main trend was a move from the Snow Belt
to the Sun Belt. To the natural benefits of climate and a less
unionized workforce, were added devices such as tax-free
industrial development bonds (up to $10 million per undertaking) and about 20 states offered land virtually free of tax.
While U.S. delegates agreed that competitive subsidization
among OECD countries should be avoided, they had no
suggestions for how to achieve this end and reiterated the
principle that competition among states could not be
prevented.
Progress in negotiating an agreement on national anti-trust
action in the two countries was noted and welcomed, but not
discussed.
Defence Questions
A Canadian delegate reported on the near completion of the
U.S.-Canada air defence study leading up to consideration of
the renewal of the NORAD agreement. He mentioned that the
new government was reviewing the requirements for a ground
support and air defence fighter and that the main interest
continued to be focussed on the F-16 and the F-18. He also
noted that Canada supported the SALT agreement and has so
informed the U.S. Administration.
A U.S. delegate said he expected a modest increase in U.S.
defence expenditure, which might lead to some pressure on
Canada to increase its defence expenditure in the north.
Another American delegate complimented Canada on its
important peacekeeping role, especially in Cyprus. He thought
that Canada was wise to specialize in the peacekeeping role,
for which its political posture made it especially well qualified,
and he thought this emphasis beneficial not only to Canada
but to the Western Alliance as well.

Agricultural Issues
Several American participants from farming states promoted the idea of an international wheat agreement, under which
exports would be controlled by agreement among producers
and the export price raised correspondingly. If such an agreement were reached with the world's principal suppliersCanada, Australia and Argentina-the assured price in the
United States could be raised and the return to the farmer
increased. But without an agreement, competitors would
simply undersell the United States and increase their share of
the market, so there would be no point raising the assured
price. The American advocates said that Senator McGovern,
who had met members of the Canadian Parliament, reported
an interest among the parliamentarians but opposition on the
part of the government. What was the situation?
A Canadian delegate explained that Canadian farmers have
looked sceptically on an international wheat agreement,
because the agreement implies holding backing stock and this
would involve them in carrying inventory on the farm. The
Canadian tradition is to grow as much as can be sold or
transported. In recent years, the bottleneck has been transport
and the new government has given high priority to rectifying
the problems. The aim was to increase capacity for handling
grains by 10 million tonnes to 30 million, a statement which
alarmed the Americans. A new facility was to be built at
Prince Rupert, rail cars were being ordered and eventually
work was to be done on the rail bed. The biggest dilemma was
the Crow's Nest Pass rate, which represented approximately a
$300 million loss to the railways. The speaker thought that
with improved facilities, Canadian farmers might be prepared
to accept higher transportation rates. He added that this
subsidy was small compared to the $2 billion subsidy of
transportation on the Mississippi River through facilities operated by the U.S. Corps of Engineers. In answer to a question
about the possibility of keeping the St. Lawrence Seaway open
all winter, it was stated that Canada opposed such a move,
which would not be cost effective, and was resisted by power
interests and environmentalists in both countries. However,

there were modifications contemplated which could lead to
increased capacity.
American speakers responded to each point. Not only did
U.S. farmers likewise have to hold inventory on their farm,
they were also required to keep land out of production through
the set aside program. There was a feeling that Canada has
exploited the U.S. program to hold back production. In fact,
American farmers preferred to hold surplus production themselves; they felt this reduced the risk of manipulation of the
market by the government. The United States did not have a
Wheat Board and was not ready to go to one. As for the
subsidy on transportation on the Mississippi, it was pointed out
that wheat was only one of many commodities moved on the
river. The Americans were concerned as Canadian transport
capacity grew that farmers would switch back to wheat from
oil seeds and try to increase Canada's share of the export
market.
The Canadian spokesman agreed this was a possibility and
justified because, with physical transportation limitations and
work stoppages on the docks, Canada's share of the market
had fallen in the 1970's. By 1978 it had only regained the
share it had in 1972. He noted that Senator McGovern had
met members of the Senate Agricultural Committee but had
not had contact with MP's. The only element which could lead
Canadian farmers to change their mind about a wheat agreement would be higher prices. He urged the Americans to move
with speed because, with increased transport capacity, Canadians would want to increase production to take advantage of
the opportunity.
At this stage, an American speaker raised the question
whether, in the face of opposition from consumer groups, it
would be possible to secure Congressional approval of a higher
price, even if there were a new wheat agreement. The question
was left hanging. However, a couple of U.S. Senators said they
intended to maintain contact and pursue the issue.
The question of beef and cattle trade was not raised.

The Alaska Highway Gas Pipeline (held in plenary session)
Prior to the plenary discussion of the Alaska Highway Gas
Pipeline project, a presentation was made by Foothills Pipelines (Yukon) Ltd. Company officials reviewed the route, the
costs, the timing, the financing and the benefits to both
Canada and the United States of the pipeline project in the
transportation of U.S. gas to U.S. markets. Among the points
made were that the original completion date had been pushed
back from January 1983 to the fall of 1984 or January 1985,
that the entire pipeline in Canada would be buried, that the
most difficult Canadian terrain would be some areas of permafrost near the Yukon-Alaska border, that there is an impressive array of experienced gas transmission companies involved
in the project, that Canadian companies believe the project can
be privately financed, that the company had put $125 million
risk moncy into the project, and that the gas pipeline would
bring 20 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas from Alaska to U.S.
markets.
The company's president, Mr. Pierce, emphasized the
importance of prebuilding southern sections of the line to carry
Alberta gas to U.S. markets before Alaska gas is available. He
listed some of the following benefits which could be derived:
the financing of the whole project would benefit since capital
costs would be reduced; the Canadian economy would be
stimulated by some $2.3 billion; Canada would get increased
cash flow through export of gas which could lead to more
exploration and more discoveries of gas; jobs and production in
the construction industry would be spread out over a longer
period of time; there would be an obvious advantage to U.S.
consumers of earlier gas availability; the prebuild facility
would be partially depreciated by the time the Alaska and
northern portions were in use.
In reply to a question by an American delegate as to what
impediments were delaying the prebuild, the Foothills official
replied that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) had still to decide the rate of return. Contracts could
not be finalized until this was known. The FERC must also
decide finally who will pay the cost of conditioning the gas
before it enters the pipeline and whether the costs of conditioning could be "tracked through" to the U.S. consumer. This
question was under appeal from an earlier Senate decision to

have the costs rolled into the price. Questions have been raised
in the United States as to whether the project could be
privately financed or whether it would need a government
guarantee. Mr. Pierce stated that there were U.S. concerns
about overruns on this line because of the massive Alyeska line
overruns, but he maintained he was not apprehensive about
substantial overruns in Canada due to the proven capability
and experience of Canadian companies in pipeline construction. The company hoped for a decision on financing the whole
line before the end of the year so the prebuild decision could
go ahead; if so, the prebuild could be completed by the end of
1981.
The basis for financing the Alaska line would be 25 per cent
equity and 75 per cent debt with a policy of reducing debt and
equity on an equal basis, Mr. Pierce stated. It was explained
that this was an unusual requirement imposed by the National
Energy Board (NEB) and likely to be imposed by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission. The total capital cost of the
Canadian portion of the line is $5.7 billion, an increase from
the original $4.3 billion due mainly to regulatory delays and
environmental requirements. It was stated that the return on
equity on the whole project would necessarily be higher in
Canada-around 16 per cent-than in the United States,
mainly because of the more advantageous tax system in the
U.S. than in Canada. Amortization of the line was projected
over 28 years. He projected the 1985 price of Alaskan gas at
about $5 to $6 per mcf. Nor did he envisage undue delay or
capital costs due to environmental difficulties, but he admitted
that the Yukon was a new area. He referred to the role of the
Northern Pipeline Agency in helping the company deal with
environmental problems.
The administrator of the Northern Pipeline Agency
reviewed for the Group the Agency's regulatory aspects and its
activities in procurement, in engineering, in manpower and in
environmental plans in preparation for the pipeline. The Agency's target for Canadian procurement for the Canadian portion of the line was 90 per cent. He estimated the Canadian
Agency was perhaps 15 months ahead of its U.S. counterpart.
The appointment of a U.S. administrator in July 1979 was
expected to speed up the American procedures.
Discussion on the pipeline, the prebuild and financing question continued in plenary after departure of the Foothills
executives and some additional points on these subjects were
covered separately in the energy committee discussions. In
general, these discussions were marked by an impatience on
the American side that Canada get the prebuild under construction and by an insistence on the Canadian side that there
must be adequate assurance the rest of the Alaska line would
be built.
A Canadian spokesman pointed out that bilateral relations
between the two countries would be affected if the massive
joint Alaska gas pipeline project were not implemented. However, it was heartening to sec that the American Congressional
and regulatory processes had recently speeded up. There were
advantages to Canada in seeing that the United States had

access to its Alaskan gas so as to alleviate future demands on
Canadian gas and Canada gained considerable through-put
revenues and employment benefits as well. Environmentalists
failed to recognize that Canada was merely "piggy-backing"
the gas to the United States, he said. Canada considered that
the prebuild should be a first step in the completion of the line.
While the amortizing period for the full pipeline is 28 years,
prebuild exports are projected for 12 years and the financial
markets will not become involved unless it is certain the whole
line will be built. He urged that the outstanding decisions be
made so the companies can go to the private financial markets
and the whole project can get underway.
It was reiterated by a number of Canadian delegates that if
the prebuild section were constructed and the relatively less
expensive Alberta gas exported to U.S. markets, Canada was
concerned that the rest of the northern portion line from
Alaska might be abandoned or greatly delayed. "If we prebuild and you get our gas, you may never get your gas out of
Alaska" one Canadian delegate said. Another Canadian made
the point that the former U.S. Energy Secretary, Mr. Schlesinger, had stated that the United States wanted to have
additional Alberta gas only if it facilitated the construction of
the Alaska Highway project. But a U.S. Senator stated that
this statement by the Administration had not been approved
by Congress. An Alaskan Senator admitted that the price of
Alaskan gas would be high and wondered if liquified natural
gas, (LNG) would not have been a better method. But he said
he still did not understand why Canada did not go ahead with
the prebuild even without the whole financing in place. The
prebuild would generate more funds for exploration and discovery of additional gas in Canada, and in any case, Alaskan
gas would eventually be delivered regardless of cost because of
the U.S. policy toward energy self-sufficiency. The Alaskan
Senator suggested that Canada might ask the U.S. government to guarantee the $1 billion cost of the prebuild but others
on the U.S. side said they did not agree with this suggestion.
The question of loans or bonds from the companies or from
the State of Alaska as a guarantee against overruns was
raised. The Alaskan Senator wondered whether the Administration was right in looking to the producing companies to
finance the conditioning plants and to grant loans for overruns
when at the same time it had just recently proposed to tax the
companies' windfall profits severely.
A Canadian participant from B.C. warned that because of
B.C. Hydro's financial structures, there was a growing feeling
in the province against external hydro demands. Hydro export
licences were up for review and there was the possibility of
electricity export cut-backs, making the nearby United States
markets more dependent on gas. Another Canadian participant made the point that the prebuild could serve as an
incentive to get Canadian gas out of the Beaufort Sea.
Additional Exports of Canadian Gas
Prior to the plenary discussion on the pipeline, the energy
committee discussed what additional Canadian gas exports to

80072-20

the United States were available and at what price. A Canadian delegate stated that while the National Energy Board had
reported in February 1979 that 2 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas
were available for export, this figure was disputed as being far
too low by producing companies who considered that 9 tcf
would be a more realistic figure and were making such a
proposal to the National Energy Board. The Alberta regulatory agency had concluded that over 5 tcf were available
although this was for domestic as well as export use. It was
considered likely that the NEB would revise its estimates of
available gas reserves upwards in the fall. However, the point
was made clearly that before any consideration is given to
additional gas exports, long-term Canadian needs had to be
protected; balance of payments concerns were secondary.
The Canadian spokesman referred to the current NEB
hearings on new applications for gas export and also applications for the extension of existing licenses due to expire. He
noted that if the NEB authorized a substantial level of additional exports, then, depending on the size of these exports,
extra new facilities may be needed even if the prebuild facility
is constructed.
United States delegates pointed out that the U.S. regulatory
authority had given its approval for increased Canadian
imports but current Canadian gas exports are below previously
authorized levels and below those of previous years. The
present price of Canadian gas was cited as one reason for this
decrease. Also, there is a temporary gas surplus in the United
States today. Two American Senators mentioned that U.S.
policy had been to discourage the use of gas by massive
industrial users, although there had been more recent modification of this policy to encourage home use. Moreover, coal
conversion into gas runs into air quality problems, but they
thought that the American air quality standards were too high
and the energy shortage would force changes.
The export price of Canadian gas, which has risen sharply
since 1974, become a controversial topic in the discussion.
Dissatisfaction over the Canadian pricing policy for gas
exports was expressed by a number of U.S. delegates and one
objected that the higher export price amounted to a discriminatory tax on the United States. The United States, he
said, did not utilize such a tax in its coal exports to Canada.
He questioned the appropriateness of the United States, in
effect, subsidizing the Canadian Treasury. Would Canada put
an export tax on us when the price of Canadian oil reached the
world price in order to maintain the domestic and export price
differential, he asked? While he thought the higher export
price for gas might assist the financing of the pipeline, it would
at the same time, exacerbate inflation in both countries.
Another United States Senator pointed out that some American midwest states, for example, Idaho, were extremely
dependent on Canadian gas where it was used mainly for home
heating. Reference was also made by an American to the
existing long-term export contracts with the lower prices which
had been raised by Canada during the term of the contract. A
Canadian delegate explained that the Canadian domestic price

of gas is based on 85 per cent of the Btu equivalent of the price
of domestic crude oil. On the other hand, the export price for
Canadian gas, which rose to $2.80 per million Btu during the
week of the meetings, is determined on the basis of the
replacement cost of imported crude oil at world prices, adjusted for the gas transmission costs. The royalty structure was
also explained whereby the producing province got 35 to 40
per cent of the gross selling price and the federal government
gets 30 per cent. One Canadian noted that as gas discoveries
increase, there will be increased incentive to use more gas
domestically. The policy of a lower domestic gas price
encouraged this conversion. Doubt was expressed that the
higher gas prices would necessarily assist the financing of gas
pipelines. As for the existing contracts, a Canadian Senator
explained that they had always included provisions that the
export price charged by Canada should be competitive with
other forms of energy. Canada, he said, was faced with a
geographic problem. It could not subsidize mid-west American
citizens by charging them less for exported gas than the
Canadians in the Maritimes had to pay for imported oil. The
same principle applied to oil pricing. The oil export tax helped
to subsidize eastern Canada, which was dependent on imported oil, from the full brunt of OPEC prices. There was an
obvious misunderstanding, the United States thinks Canada is
gouging them but all sorts of countries have certain areas
where some form of subsidization is going on.
When an American delegate asked whether additional gas
would bc in the form of direct sales or swaps, Canadian
delegates replied it would be more likely in direct sales since
both sides had found it very difficult to work out a feasible
swap arrangement.
An Alberta participant pointed out that Alberta producers
are anxious to export as they are sitting on large inventories of
gas which they can ill afford to carry and this leads to serious
cash flow problems for many small producers. The producers
were confident that there were much larger reserves available
than the NEB had calculated. But there were no facilities in
place to take additional exports although it was evident the
Trans-Canada system could be expanded. Resulting contracts
could be for as much as 10 years. On this point, an American
Senator asked why the contracts for Alberta gas exports being
discussed were for so short a term as 5 years. He stated that
the United States would need a longer term assurance of
supply. A Canadian delegate said that the short term contracts
could be construed as incentives to get the Alaska gas line
built. "Just what I thought" replied the Senator.
The idea of taking Alberta gas through a proposed Quebec
and Maritime line to the U.S. northeast was also raised by a
Canadian participant who asked the United States delegates if
they thought it would be a feasible route. The U.S. reaction
was that such a delivery system made little economic sense
when Alberta gas could more easily tic into transmission lines
across the Ontario border at Niagara Falls and thence east to
Boston rather than going all the way around through the
Maritimes.

Oil Supply
Underlying the Committee's discussions on oil supply was
the stated awareness on both sides of the prospect of a real
crisis by the 1990's as world consumption figures continued to
grow at a faster rate than production. At the same time there
was a parallel recognition of the need for restraint and for
measures to lessen the dependence on OPEC. A Canadian
participant spoke of the variety of Canadian conservation
efforts, the tar sands extraction plants in operation and the
recent Canadian commitment to two new tar sands plants. He
urged the United States to step up conservation and to take
other measures to reach energy self-sufficiency. A U.S. participant stated that the American conservation program was at
last starting to show results, that large strides in R & D have
been taken in the oil shale industry, in the treatment of coal
and that a synthetic fuel program had already been adopted.
However, he said the U.S. 1985 self-sufficiency goal would
realistically need to be extended a little.
It was against this background that several Congressmen
broached the idea of a continental energy policy or a common
energy market involving Canada, United States and Mexico
which touched off a lively exchange of views. A Congressman
who had a resolution before Congress on this subject elaborated on the idea suggesting that there should be a summit
meeting of the Presidents of the United States and Mexico and
the Prime Minister of Canada to discuss energy issues principally, although he recognized that other issues could be discussed as well. As an example of the sort of cooperation he
foresaw, he cited Mexico which is seeking to develop industrially with the money it earns from resources. In such a cooperative energy arrangement, the United States would ask Mexico
what it could do to help Mexico attain its objectives-in
technology, etc. As for Canada, what did it need? distribution
facilities? more refinery capacity? In international discussions
this delegate said, the three countries would be considered as a
North American unit.
An American Senator pursued the idea of the sharing of
technology in a continental energy cooperation arrangement
and emphasized the need for increased recovery rates on
existing wells. He forecast that tertiary recovery methods of oil
in the ground would yield tremendous new oil reserves. Even if
only 10 per cent of the 300 billion barrels still in the ground
were recoverable this would be equal to three Prudhoe Bay
yields. The increased price of gas would help speed this
process. In his opinion, the United States was not looking at
Canadian reserves. To him, he said, a continental energy
policy meant a melding of the energy transportation mechanisms. It was wasteful to ship Alaska oil all around the south
of South America or through the Panama Canal when distribution could more economically go to the nearest consumer
through a substitution of supply system. This participant also
considered it was necessary to stimulate a reconsideration of
the Clean Air Act to make it less stringent.
The Canadian response to the continental energy proposal
was decidedly negative. One Canadian participant stated that

Canada had no energy to share although it was more than
ready to share technologies. A Canadian Senator sought to
explain why the Canadian reaction to the phrases "continental
energy policy" or "North American common energy market"
was strongly negative. Canadians were not prepared to pool
their limited energy resources with the American giant who
would be perceived as a threat to drain them all. The word
"continentalism" had come to have unpleasant connotations in
Canada and although it might seem to be a question of
semantics, any American proposal should use and emphasize
the word "co-operation". This approach was supported by
other Canadian delegates who reiterated to the American side
that a proposal for a continental or common energy policy
would be impossible in those terms.
An Alberta MP considered that each country should look
after its own energy problem. The control wielded by OPEC
must be replaced by a "cap" price. He said Canada must save
700,000 barrels of oil a day by 1985 to be achieved through
price mechanisms which allow oil sands development to
become economic. He was not overly optimistic about how
much oil could be recovered by the tertiary techniques spoken
of earlier. Oil, gas, nuclear power and coal would likely be, in
the next 10 years, the main sources. Likely new developments
in Alberta and Saskatchewan will be costly to upgrade.
Although there were huge quantities of coal, this participant
doubted that there would be enough water to process it,
considering that it takes 1 ton of coal and 1 ton of water to
equal 1 barrel of oil. An American Senator also emphasized
the need to reduce dependence on OPEC but he suggested that
nuclear power plants were going to be a very important factor.
In addition to the acknowledged need for restraint, a U.S.
Congressman was optimistic that the billions of dollars committed by the United States to new developments including
synthetics would eventually pay off. He voiced his scepticism
of a pre-eminent position for nuclear power in view of the
additional costs involved in waste disposal plants and in new
plants. In view of the Canadian concerns regarding continentalism, this Congressman thought the wording of the U.S.
resolution would have to be changed.
Emphasizing Canadian efforts to attain self-sufficiency, a
Canadian participant stated that Canada had spent or was
committing $15 billion to the tar sands developments of which
$3 billion had gone into the two plants already in operation
and $12 billion would go to the two newly-announced Allsands
and Cold Lake developments. He pointed out that in parallel
terms, in the United States, this would mean a commitment of
$150 billion. An American Senator replied that he accepted
the Canadian criticism as justified. There were suspicions on
both sides he said. For their part the Americans were suspicious that Canada wanted the United States to develop and
pay for Canadian energy.
Transportationof Alaskan Oil
The alternative Canadian routes to bring Alaskan oil to U.S.
markets-Kitimat, Trans-Mountain and Foothills-were
reviewed by a Canadian Senator. He noted that the relative

merits of Canadian proposals were to be considered shortly by
the NEB and that President Carter was currently looking at
the options, including the Northern Tier line and was due to
indicate his preference before the end of the year.
While Kitimat was currently being revived despite its earlier
rejection by the Canadian government, he said, the recent
negative reaction to this route by Mr. Fraser, the new environment minister indicated it would continue to be opposed by the
government. Nor was the reversal of the Trans-Mountain
route without problems, mainly the difficulty of bringing
increased supply of oil into Puget Sound, although a recent
suggestion had been made to supply all crude requirements to
these Puget Sound refineries by oil piped from a new oil port
at Port Angeles on the outside coast. The spokesman said that
the original Foothills proposal, by tanker from Valdez to
Skagway and from there by pipeline paralleling the Alaskan
Highway from Whitehorse to Edmonton, was to be replaced
by a modified all-land route which would take oil directly from
the Alyeska line at Delta Junction near Fairbanks and bring it
over land to Whitehorse, down to Edmonton and on to U.S.
markets. (In fact, this new Foothills' application was made
public the day of the meeting.) This delegate pointed out that
it would be important to determine if there were sufficient
Alaskan oil production since Foothills needed 450,000 barrels
per day (bpd) to justify this route and, unlike the earlier
Skagway proposal, the new overland line would be entirely
dependent on North Slope crude. He suggested that the new
Foothills application merited serious consideration by the
United States.
Commenting on the future supply of Alaskan oil, an Alaskan Senator was very optimistic. At present the flow on the
Alaskan line is 1.2 million bpd but this would rise to 2 million
bpd. Several other good oil discoveries on the North Slope or
in the sedimentary basin of the Beaufort Sea were probable
although he recognized it was unlikely any single discovery
would equal the 9-billion-barrel Prudhoe Bay find. This delegate considered the Northern Tier proposal a good one while
recognizing there would be some environmental roadblocks
concerning an oil port at Port Angeles. Foothills also appeared
to have a pretty good new proposal although it could result in
considerable environmental delays and it would have only a
limited pipe capacity from Edmonton, which would leave
Alaska with a surplus production. Furthermore, it would mean
the lower portion of the Alyeska line to Valdez would be
underutilized. Nevertheless the Senator considered that a new
transportation line could encourage exploration and discoveries. He concluded that perhaps Foothills and Northern Tier
were both needed, with Foothills substituting for the defunct
Sohio proposal.
An American Congressman from the State of Washington
expressed his impatience at the current confused situation of
oil pipelines. Both the Sohio line and the Trans-Mountain line
were currently underutilized, so why build new lines he asked?
The Northern Tier proposal would need 80,000 bpd to justify
its construction whereas there would be about 400,000 bpd

available at present of which only a portion was Alaskan
crude, the remainder coming from off-shore. Since the Carter
policy was to reduce oil imports, this route would seem to have
no future. Moreover, considerable opposition existed both in
Washington State and British Columbia in regard to oil spilis
in the delicate inland water area and any oil port decision in
the United States, including Port Angeles, was bound to
encounter serious delays. He himself favoured proposals which
would hook up Edmonton, the Trans-Mountain and Anacortes
lines. If Alaskan oil capacity increased substantially, then
Foothill's new proposal might prove to be the most feasible
route and worth the extra cost. He thought it also made sense
for the two countries to try to work out an exchange system in
view of Canada's oil requirements in the east furnished
through Portland, Maine and the American needs along the
mid-west border area.
There was a brief discussion of the various reasons why the
Sohio project had failed and several U.S. participants were of
the opinion that a real possibility existed for the Sohio line to
be revived.
It was pointed out by two American Senators from affected
border areas that refineries in border states preferred Canadian crude to the heavier Alaskan crude scheduled to be provided by the Northern Tier line. Moreover, one Senator asserted, the Northern Tier proposal would inevitably arouse
environmental concerns in his state. Two western Canadian
delegates voiced their support for the Foothills proposal, one of
them expressing optimism that future Beaufort Sea discoveries
would produce sufficient oil to support the Foothills plan. A
Congressman cautioned that Foothills would do well to obtain
assurances that the north western U.S. refineries would accept
the heavier North Slope crude.
Finally, a number of American participants made the point
that unless the Canadian government pronounced favourably
for a particular Canadian line, the President was almost
certain to designate the Northern Tier route. He could scarcely designate a Canadian route. In response, Canadian delegates asked what Canada could do, in effect, except make a
tentative statement that when the United States had proved
new Alaskan oil, Canada could offer a transportation link to
the lower 48 states. If there are no indications from the United
States that it is interested in a particular route, assurances by
the Canadian government regarding environmental procedures
could hardly be given. On this point a Canadian participant
told the U.S. delegates that the Canadian regulatory process
was likely to prove less of a stumbling block than the American system and he forecast that the major difficulty in the
Foothills project could well be from Delta to the Yukon
border.
Strategie Petroleum Storage
A Canadian Senator raised the question of the storage of
U.S. strategic petroleum reserves in Canadian territory. He
reviewed the factual details. Two Canadian companies had
responded to the U.S. Department of Energy's invitation to bid

on the establishment of storage facilities. These proposed
facilities were an abandoned iron mine at Bell Island, Newfoundland and a salt dome on Cape Breton Island. The
installations would be owned by the companies and rented to
the United States. A bilateral agreement would be necessary
to ensure the United States security of access, avoidance of
any tariff, etc. The Canadian spokesman emphasized that
Canada would welcome the opportunity to provide this storage, that a transportation facility at least at Bell Island would
be no problem and that technology involving storage in salt
domes already exists in western Canada. The facilities would
both be very accessible for the needs of the highly populated
U.S. north-east. However, in view of the fact that a government procurement contract would be involved, the Canadian
spokesman asked his U.S. Senatorial and Congressional counterparts what congressional reactions and congressional obstacles the Canadian companies could expect to meet. Would
Congress have any objection in principle to having U.S. oil
stored in Canada if the Canadian companies bids proved to be
competitive? He mentioned the fact that Canadian exporters
were frequently frustrated in their competitively priced sales to
the United States by U.S. procurement practices originating in
congressional attitudes and by the provisions of the Buy
America Act. How effective would the American lobbyists be
in this situation?
A Congressman's initial reaction was that he doubted a
Canadian storage project would get through the Senate Armed
Services Committee due to "plain domestic political reasons."
But a Senator on the energy committee considered it might be
a "politically saleable" proposition, and he would like to take a
closer look at it. He agreed that approval by the U.S. Defense
Department would assist the project but he doubted that the
geographic proximity of the storage sites to New England
would be very useful since there were no refineries there to
refine the stored crude. However a Congressman stated there
would be a large group of voters in the area who would be
favourable to the thought of having access to nearby secure
supplies and a Canadian member from the Maritimes reminded the group that eastern Canada has considerable refining
over-capacity. But would Canada have any difficulty in committing Canadian refining capacity to the U.S. market in
times of emergency the Senator enquired. Another Congressman mentioned that the United States had had an uncontrollable fire of oil in a salt dome reserve and obviously some
arrangements would need to be devised to protect the reserve.
U.S. delegates from both the House and the Senate agreed
there should be a closer examination of this project in the right
committees in both the House and the Senate. A Congressman
pointed out that Canada might have to do some lobbying itself.
Future Technologies in the Energy Field
In the discussion on future energy technologies, the two
delegations compared notes as to the various programs and
progress in their countries. A Canadian delegate made the
following points: Canada considers itself relatively advanced in
the tar sands/heavy oil technology where it is spending $20

million a year; there is great potential for enormous savings by
increasing oil conservation technology-an example was a
pilot building in Calgary which has no power plant and has
reduced costs by 66 per cent by collecting heat from bodies,
electric lights and through windows and storing it in a 2
million gallon storage tank and by burning trash at night. A
new house, properly constructed, can save up to 90 per cent of
heating costs; in the renewable energy field, there is some
small progress in Canada with the use of biomass, the use of
gasohol and the use of solar energy. The Canadian gas industry considers the estimates of the large reserves of tight gas in
western Canada to be exaggerated. In addition, it is difficult to
release and involves enormously expensive technology. Canada
has no significant fusion energy program as yet.
Various members of the American delegation told the
Canadian side that the new U.S. emphasis on the production
of synthetic fuel production from shale was long overdue but
immensely costly; solar energy has recently become a high
profile potential source in the United States, the technology
for it is available, enormous funds are being spent on solar R
& D but it will probably only be a back-up system and very
costly; the United States is spending a lot on fusion technology. Several members expressed the opinion that the American
press's exaggerated coverage of the Three Mile Island incident
had unduly alarmed the public over radioactive dangers, slowing the development of both fission and fusion technologies.
A Canadian participant expressed the viewpoint that more
emphasis should be placed on solar energy technology and he
hoped the United States would make a commitment to this
form of energy similar to its earlier man-on-the-moon commitment. As for fusion, he mentioned the possibility that the
United States might examine a move by Canada and U.S.
scientists to have the International Fusion Research Centre
located in Canada since the U.S.S.R. would never support its
location in the United States because of fears of military
application. A note of caution was sounded by a Canadian
member who thought that advanced technologies should also
be applied to getting at the reserves of conventional fuels while
moving ahead at a reasonable pace in the various future
energy field. Further, he thought that the technology for coal
liquefaction was one which could be profitably developed.
Electricity
In discussing bilateral electricity questions, a Canadian
Senator said it was important to keep in mind that production
and sale of electricity was in the hands of local/provincial
authorities in Canada in contrast to the United States where it
was frequently in the private sector. Canadian-American twoway trade in electrical energy in 1978 resulted in a surplus for
Canada of $479 million, he continued. There are good possibilities for increasing this exchange of electricity along the
border, a development which led to lower unit costs. The
Mandan project involving Manitoba, the Dakotas and Nebraska was a case in point. Manitoba, with 99 per cent of its
electrical power generated by water, had peak demands in
winter whereas Nebraska had heavy summer demands. Cur-

rently the plan to wheel electricity to Nebraska had run into
some problems with the intervening regulatory agencies particularly in North Dakota. A U.S. Nebraskan Senator was
pleased to hear there was no hesitation or reluctance on the
Canadian side for this project and said he would look into the
question further. In his opinion, it made excellent sense to
facilitate and encourage such exchanges.
Another bilateral electrical plan, the Taiya or Dyea Project
between the Yukon and Alaska was also discussed. As a
Canadian Senator explained, the idea was to divert the headwaters of the Yukon River, raising by only a few feet the level
of water in a large natural storage basin and then creating an
outlet down to the Panhandle which would mean a vertical
drop of 2000' near Skagway. An investigation into the market
possibilities for the enormous quantity of power which would
be generated concluded that at present there was no market
for such a development. The project appears to have been
temporarily shelved.
Nuclear Issues
A U.S. Senator, who characterized himself as being "strongly pro-nuclear and therefore probably not typical", said he did
not agree with President Carter's opposition to reprocessing on
a commercial basis and his emphasis on R & D breeder
projects only. Congress had in fact voted to go ahead with a
breeder reactor demonstration project. France, he noted wryly,
is delighted by Carter's policy since it leaves them as the only
suppliers in the field and the Chinese have already bought the
process from France. He ascribed the current objections to
reprocessing to the exaggerated dangers seen in the ThreeMile-Island accident. Another overstated hazard was the problem of long-term storage of spent fuel rods from conventional
nuclear operations. They are now stored in pools of water but
canisters in salt domes in Mexico or in granite near Las Vegas
were being examined. This spokesman thought the rods should
be reprocessed rather than stored. Congress has asked for a
debate on this whole question when the INFCE study is
completed.
Pointing to differences in the Canadian nuclear scene, a
Canadian delegate noted that no nuclear plant construction
had been delayed in Canada by public pressure. Since the
CANDU system "runs cool" in contrast to the U.S. enriched
uranium system, Canadian technicians were confident a
Three-Mile-Island accident could not happen in Canadian
plants. Also, since government agencies controlled nuclear
plants, the potential for adversary relations with the public was
muted. The Canadian government considers nuclear plants are
a safe source of electricity. At present, there were Il units
operating in Canada and by 1988 there would be 25 units
producing 15,000 megawatts. CANDU reactors are provided
with a spent fuel storage capacity of 8 to 10 years and Canada
is also examining methods of future waste disposal.
The U.S. Senator emphasized that with a good reprocessing
system, the balance of the fuel is used in the breeder reactor,
reducing to a very small package the long-life elements which

need disposai. He admitted that a real challenge remained to
find an absolutely safe method for storage and to set standards
for sites chosen.
The dangers of nuclear proliferation were mentioned with
the Canadian spokesman noting the stringent safeguards
which Canada attaches to its sale of uranium. The U.S.
Senator pointed to Pakistan and Libya as two areas of proliferation concern. Why was Libya buying 100 tons of uranium, he
asked.
Another Canadian M.P., while agreeing that nuclear reactors would constitute a major source of energy, warned that
there was a real problem connected with the "Jane Fonda

syndrome." In all western industrialized countries, individuals
perceived a reai threat and were frightened. How should the
western democracies cope with this reaction? Was it effective
to hold public inquiries and attempt to educate the public to
the detailed facts? He foresaw major difficulties ahead in this
respect.
Energy Conservation
There was no formal discussion of this agenda item as it had
been dealt with under various agenda items as they came up
including oil supply questions and future technologies
programs.

salmon negotiations.
East Coast Fisheriesand BoundariesAgreements
The Chairman of the Canadian group in Committee Ill
opened the discussion by stating the Canadian concern that the
U.S. Senate may refuse to ratify the Fisheries and Boundaries
Agreements because of a tendency to acquiesce in the view of
Senators from the immediately affected East Coast states
where opposition from fisheries groups is on the rise. He
stressed two points to the American delegation: first that there
was opposition to the treaty from some Canadian fishermen as
well who see the agreement as giving away a great deal; but,
secondly, that the Canadian government continues to support
it as the best agreement possible in the larger national interest.
He expressed the hope that the United States Senate would
also place the issue in the larger context of Canada-U.S.
relations. He then asked a Canadian delegate from the Maritimes to describe his concerns.
The Canadian delegate noted the long fishing tradition in
the Maritimes and the very heavy dependence of the region on
that industry. He described Canadian east coast fishermen as
having accepted in the Agreement a smaller take-especially
of scallops-in favour of better long term development of the
stock. In deciding on fair quotas, he argued that it was
necessary to consider actual not anticipated catch and, by that
measure over the past decade, Canada had gone more than
half way in the Agreement.
The Chairman of the U.S. group observed that no agreement satisfies everyone. He added that while it was the
Senate's responsibility to ratify the Agreement, the House of
Representatives and in particular its Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee would examine them as well for their
conformity to other U.S. legislation such as the Fisheries
Management and Conservation Act. He acknowledged the
danger of "parochial interests" determining the outcome on
the issue.
An American Senator from a New England state observed
that while the Agreements had been submitted to the Senate
on May 3, he foresaw no action on them before the end of the
year because of the Foreign Relations Committee's preoccupation with the SALT Il Agreement. He then went on to

describe the mounting opposition from east coast fishermen.
The main criticism, he noted, was directed at the quotas set for
scallops. U.S. fishermen argue that prior to 1960 they had
done very well in this industry but then heavily subsidized
Canadian scallop fishermen had substantially increased their
take. He reported the view-without necessarily agreeing with
it-that 27¢ out of every dollar of Canadian production came
from public subsidies and that the Agreement would base
quotas on the period when the Canadian take was high and
before the period when Americans began to do better as the
result of substantial private investment. Turning to the politics
of the Agreement he reported that Senator Muskie was in
favour and Senator Kennedy "not opposed but in favour of
amendments". He noted that Maine fishermen were less
involved than others in the scallop trade and that the feeling
among scallop fishermen was that their interests were being
traded away for an agreement on boundaries which most
concerned Maine. He concluded that while the U.S. Administration strongly supported the Agreements and would fight for
ratification, there was "some heavy weather ahead".
A Canadian delegate questioned the argument that the
Canadian fishing industry is more heavily subsidized than the
American by observing that while Canadian subsidies are
explicitly provided by various federal government programs,
many U.S. subsidies are provided at the state and local level
where they are not identified as subsidies to that industry. The
leading American discussant replied that this was certainly not
the case in his State and was unaware of such subsidies in
other States "most of which are broke".
He then inquired what the Canadian position was on
amendment to the Agreement. A Canadian participant replied
that Canada saw itself as having already made significant
concessions to arrive at the Agreements and that the Fisheries
and Boundaries Agreements were closely linked together. The
main Canadian participant repeated the point that Canadian
fishermen had to swallow hard to accept the Agreements. He
acknowledged that boat costs were higher in Canada than in
the U.S. but that serious efforts were being made to bring
these down and not simply hide them with subsidies. He then
made the point that whereas Canadian fishermen were being
"rationed" by federal quotas, no such quotas were being set or
applied in the United States. An American delegate replied
that that was no longer the case, that U.S. quotas had been
applied and enforced for the past two years. Another American delegate reinforced the point that the Management Councils set up by the Fisheries Management and Conservation Act
were federal bodies, albeit with local participation, and that
they had the power to establish a conservation and management régime.
Fisheries Trade
There was a short exchange on the matter of fisheries trade
in general. The Canadian delegate from the Maritimes led off
by noting that Canada now exports roughly a million tons of
fish a year and hopes to increase that figure by 50 per cent. He
observed that while the United States was the major market

for Canadian fish exports, he had been warned of American
plans to substantially reduce this. The American delegate from
an east coast state replied that in his view this was "only a
grumbling point" in the United States and that under the
latest GATT agreement he did not foresee any changes to
worry Canadians. He said that the United States was "pretty
well strapped in" under the GATT. As regards countervail
duties he said that it was now clear that the United States had
the common obligation to issue warnings to exporting countries and to abide by bilaterally acceptable injuries tests before
taking any action.
Air Quality
Acid Rain
The Canadian spokesman on this subject described acid rain
as a rapidly emerging major issue and one which is receiving
serious and commendable attention from the new Canadian
government. He noted also that provincial cooperation was
being sought and obtained. He described the problem as
originating mainly from sulphur dioxide pollution by coal
burning power plants in the United States and smelters in
Canada. The transborder aspect of the problem was that the
United States was sending about 4 million tons per year into
Canada-roughly equal to Canadian domestic emissions-and
Canada was sending roughly one-quarter that amount into the
United States. He cited evidence that some 148 lakes in
Ontario have already been "killed" by acid rain and an
additional 48,000 were considered threatened. He suggested
that there was good reason to believe-though not as yet
proof-that the damage caused by acid rain extends beyond
water degradation and the killing of fish to include the retardation of forest growth. Given the importance of the Canadian
forestry industry, that was a serious problem indeed.
A Canadian delegate pointed to his own resort area of
Muskoka in Ontario as an example of the problem. While the
waters in area lakes were still suitable for swimming and
boating the fish populations were dying off with serious consequences for tourism. He noted that it had been assumed earlier
that the problem in the region originated with the "monster in
Sudbury" (the nickel smelters) but that research revealed that
most of those emissions drifted eastward into Quebec and that
in fact much of Muskoka's problem came from the United
States.
An American delegate from the northwest observed that the
United States now has higher emission control standards than
Canada and that Canadian sources were polluting badly across
the border. He added that new technologies for the use of coal
would greatly reduce the problem over the next ten years. A
Canadian delegate acknowledged that Canada certainly had to
clean up its act and suggested that recent government statements indicated that it intended to do so. He went on to say
that while Canadian emission standards on new plants werc
not as high as those in the United States, Canada produced
only a fraction of the pollution. The American co-chairman of
Committee III summed up the discussion to that point by
observing that both countries recognize the problem and that

the reference to a Bilateral Research Consultative Group
would help in establishing mutually acceptable measurement
techniques "so vital in an issue like this".
An American delegate expressed puzzlement at one aspect
of the problem, namely the phenomenon of "dead lakes" which
he said he had never heard of in the United States. Moreover
he could not imagine a lake that would not restore itself over a
period of years after the source of pollution had been eliminated. A Canadian delegate explained that the geology of the
Canadian Shield made its lakes highly susceptible to acidification and that it was the entire drainage system of lakes which
was affected. Research had shown that acid rain causes a
leaching of heavy metals, including mercury, out of the soil
and into the lakes from which they are virtually irremovable.
The American delegate acknowledged that was indeed a serious problem.
The Canadian co-chairman wound up this portion of the
discussion by inquiring about the prospect for an Air Quality
Agreement comparable to the Water Quality Agreement. The
American co-chairman replied that if the report of the Bilateral Research Consultative Group was "reasonable" the United
States would implement the recommendations.
The discussion then turned briefly to the current political
atmosphere in the United States regarding environmental
issues in general. Several American participants acknowledged
that there was a growing shift away from environmental
concerns in favour of such things as energy and economic
growth and that, in the words of one of them, there "could be
a drastic cutback in environmental gains". He went on to
suggest that if Canada wanted the U.S. to "hold the line" il
would itself come up to current U.S. standards. A frequently
heard argument, particularly in the border states, was that the
U.S. puts itself at a disadvantage by having higher environmental standards than ils neighbour-and competitor-to the
north.
Cornwall Island
A Canadian delegate whose constituency borders on Cornwall Island described the very great concern among the Indian
people of the island about flouride pollution from the Reynolds
Aluminum Plant at Massena, New York. He said that he
personally shared their feeling that the problem was not
receiving the attention il deserved especially from the American authorities. He argued that the unique position of the St.
Regis reserve, located as il was in Canadian and American
territory, established clear responsibility for this problem with
both the Canadian and U.S. governments. An American delegate from New York State suggested that the State government was responsible for health issues and the Canadians
should press the issue at that level. The Canadian participant
replied that when an issue had transborder implications-as
this one did-national governments were obliged to play a
role. The American delegate acknowledged this point and said
that he would follow up the issue with appropriate federal
agencies.

Atikokan
The issue of anticipated pollution in the Boundary Waters
Canoe Area in Minnesota from a proposed coal-fired electric
generating plant in Atikokan, Ontario received brief attention.
The Canadian spokesman suggested that the problem was
being solved by the scaling down of the plant and by the
likelihood that it would be built to higher emission control
standards. The American co-chairman commented that the
issue was apparently being resolved.
Poplar River
The Canadian co-chairman inquired whether the issue of
the power project on the Canadian side of the border near
Coronach, Saskatchewan was of concern to the American
delegation. The American co-chairman replied that he was
satisfied with the reference of the issue to the International
Joint Commission and that it was not a major problem.
Role of the InternationalJoint Commission
A short discussion of the IJC was prompted by an American
delegate's request for information, saying that he knew virtually nothing about the Commission. A Canadian participant
outlined briefly its history and described its mandate as being
restricted in three respects: first to deal only with transboundary water issues, second to examine only issues referred to it
jointly by the Governments of Canada and the U.S., and finally
to make recommendations which were left to be implemented--or not-by the two governments. He noted that with the
exception of two early decisions the lIC had issued only
unanimous reports and that in the opinion of most observersand the Canadian government-it was a highly competent and
credible organization. An American delegate remarked that
unanimous decisions were not necessarily a good thing since
they might indicate the ducking of tough issues or the seeking
of lowest common denominators in disputes. Two Canadian
delegates replied that this was certainly not true of the IJC but
another added that unfortunately there had been some decline
in recent years in the willingness of governments to heed the
recommendations of the Commission.
The Disposal of Toxic Wastes
A Canadian spokesman began the brief exchange on this
subject by observing that transborder movement of PCBs and
other toxic wastes was not a major problem; however, he did
note the U.S. concern about disposing of Canadian wastesparticularly PCBs-in American facilities. In response to a
question from an American participant he acknowledged that
the problem, except in its transborder respect, was a provincial
responsibility in Canada.
The American co-chairman noted that Canada had sought
and obtained an exemption until June 1980 from the Environmental Protection Agency's new regulations on waste disposal
in the U.S. but observed that both countries seemed seized of
the problem and were cooperating in its solution. An American
participant from upstate New York added a note of inquiry to
the discussions by observing that his area received a good deal

of toxic waste from Canada. He added that while 1976 U.S.
legislation covered the handling of future wastes, it had not
dealt with the enormous problem of abandoned sites. However,
he remarked that several bills had recently been introduced in
Congress to meet this problem. In light of the one year
exemption of Canada from the EPA regulations he inquired
what progress was being made in Canada.
A Canadian discussant replied that a waste disposal site had
been established in Montreal and that interesting experiments
were underway on the possible disposal of PCBs by their use as
a fuel in cement plants. Given these developments he suggested
that it was unlikely Canada would request any exemption from
EPA regulations beyond mid-1980.
The Great Lakes
Water Quality
The Canadian co-chairman remarked that Canada was reasonably satisfied with the progress in implementing the Great
Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Another Canadian observed
that there was still pronounced concern about Lake Erie but
that, in general, the agreement was working well. He inquired
about the problem of the Love Canal, a chemical land-fill area
in Niagara Falls, New York from which some 250 families
had been forced to evacuate their homes in August 1978.
The American participant, whose Congressional District
includes the Love Canal, briefly described the history of the
problem. He said that there were suspicions but as yet no proof
that the chemical wastes are contaminating the Great Lakes
through seepage into the nearby Niagara River. He went on to
say that there were an estimated one to two thousand similar
sites scattered throughout the United States and that governments were only beginning to grapple with the problem.
The American co-chairman concludes this discussion by
observing that both countries seem satisfied with the Great
Lakes Water Quality Agreement and that its targets were
being met.
Water Levels
The Canadian co-chairman opened the very brief discussion
of this item by remarking that the IJC had developed a general
system of management for Great Lakes levels and inquired
whether there were any special American concerns. The
American delegate from the Great Lakes region commented
that considering the many conflicting interests the IJC was
doing an admirable job. Another American participant noted
the "perennial problem" of the Chicago diversion and agreed
with a Canadian remark that common sense and cooperation
were the essential elements in handling the matter.
Extension of the Navigation Season on the St. Lawrence
Seaway
A Canadian delegate described various proposals for extending the navigation season and reported that the main technical
obstacle was ice formations interfering with stream flow. An
American commented that Canada, with its huge grain
exports, was probably more interested than the United States

in these proposals but it was pointed out by a Canadian that
cost benefit analysis showed that only the proposal for full 24
hour day traffic during the present 81/2 month season made
economic sense to Canada. The American delegate from
upstate New York described himself as "ambivalent" on the
issue of extending the season but expressed interest in the "full
day" proposal.
The Garrison Diversion
There was an intense half-hour exchange on the Garrison
Diversion Project involving principally Canadian and American delegates from the areas directly concerned.
The Canadian spokesman opened the discussion by asking
whether it was still the intention to proceed with the entire
project of 250,000 acres despite a critical report by the International Joint Commission. The American Congressman from
North Dakota replied that the major benefits of the project
would be realized only if the full 250,000 acres were developed. He observed that the IJC had recommended only that
the project be delayed until a number of questions were
answered. He went on to say that the "rumours and suspicions" of environmental damage put out by "environmental
zealots" had failed to convince the supporters of the project.
On the contrary, they were convinced that on balance the
project would benefit the rivers in the area, including those in
Canada, through the enhancement of stream flow.
The Canadian spokesman asked why if water quality was to
be enhanced, the United States did not keep it all on its side of
the border? The American spokesman replied that North
Dakota would do just that if it were possible because seasonal
irregularity in stream flow had long posed major problems for
the State. He repeated the point that much of the trouble with
the Garrison Project was traceable to environmentalists who,
having lost the battle in the Dakotas, had moved north to
Canada where they had inflamed the issue. He suggested that
if reasonable people on both sides could calmly discuss the
issue, a solution would be found and that the best proof of the
safety of the project was that the diverted waters passed first
through North Dakota. "We would never foul our own nests".
The Canadian participant from Winnipeg, Manitoba rejected strongly the argument that it was only environmentalists
who were behind the Canadian objections. He pointed out that
many studies, including American studies prepared by engineers and other scientists, indicated grave dangers posed by
the project. He noted the IJC's warning about biota transfer
which raised serious doubts about the ability of any screen
device to prevent such transfer. He went on to stress the
serious economic damage that could be caused to the $10
million a year fishing industry on Lake Winnipeg.

Souris, thus benefitting adjacent Canadian as well as American areas. On the subject of biota transfer he commented on
the "strange irony" that environmentalists who had originally
insisted on fish screens as part of the project were now
blocking in court the testing of such devices.
To the Canadian delegate's remark that the supporters of
the project had failed to convince many of the expert critics,
the American participant replied that much of the criticism
was now dated because, for example, North Dakota was
improving rapidly its handling of effluents and its standards
were now higher than in the adjoining areas of Canada. He
predicted that while the project was now "on the shelf"', the
first time a serious drought occurred the quality of water
flowing into Canada would be very poor and this would have a
terrible impact on Canada.
A Canadian delegate inquired about the current status of
the project. The American spokesman replied that the IJC had
recommended a full testing of preventive measures. In order to
do that with no threat to Canada, North Dakota was now
pressing for completion of only 60,000 acres with all return
flow into the James River and none into Canada. He suggested
that this proposal proved North Dakota's full confidence in the
project and its respect for Canadian concerns and the lIC
report. He stated emphatically that North Dakota did not
recommend ignoring the IJC's recommendations.
A Canadian participant pointed out that a similar project on
the Peace River had been stopped because of the fear of biota
transfer by an identified organism. The American delegate
replied that no such organism had in fact been identified in the
Garrison Project, that it was only fear of possible biota
transfer which had been raised.
As the discussion began to wind down, the Canadian spokesman commented that not only was Canada opposed to the
project but so also had the adjoining states of South Dakota
and Minnesota been opposed when an early version of the
project would have diverted waters into these states. The
American spokesman denied that there had ever been such
plans or such opposition. He noted that the Secretary of
Agriculture, Robert Bergland, a former Congressman from
Minnesota, was a strong and long-time supporter of the
project.
In concluding his remarks, the American spokesman said
that he wished to make it clear that the United States would
honour the recommendations of the lIC and that he called for
pressing ahead now with only those parts of the project having
no effect on Canada. Given the strong feelings on the issue he
concluded that the "best thing right now is for a cooling-off
period".

The American delegate replied that he was very sceptical
about the dangers of biota transfer since there was a long
history of transfer, such as by ducks moving from one water
system to the other. He noted the excellent fishing in the
Garrison area of North Dakota. He repeated the point that the
project was the only means to solve the irregular flow of the

Seabed Mining
The Canadian lead speaker on this issue concisely outlined
its history and Canada's particular concerns. He explained
that recent developments in seabed mining technology raised
the prospect of large scale exploitation of nodules and that
Canada was especially concerned about the possible effects on

her land-based nickel industry. He stressed that it was not
Canada's objective to block seabed mining-indeed Canadian
companies were participants in seabed mining consortia-but
rather wanted to assure an "orderly development of the market". To that end, Canada had proposed fair quotas for seabed
and land based production and had achieved-or believed it
had achieved-agreement with the United States. He added,
however, that information just received from the Canadian
delegation at the Law of the Sea negotiations in New York
suggested that the United States was under intense pressure
from the European Economic Community and Japan to abandon the agreement on quotas in favour of a far more aggressive
expansion of seabed mining, amounting to about twice the
agreed-upon quota. The Chairman of the Canadian Group
substantiated this point and expressed the hope that the U.S.
government would maintain its support for the Canadian
proposal. He suggested that disagreement on this point could
seriously threaten the progress which had been made toward a
general Law of the Sea agreement.
A Congressman replied that he understood the Canadian
concern and that the negotiations were at a very delicate stage.
He believed that the Committees of the House of Representatives concerned with these issues would make reports consistent with the American interest in a Law of the Sea treaty
though he added that the subject did not stir widespread
interest in the House. A Canadian participant repeated the
point that the EEC-Japan proposal for doubling the seabed
quota could destroy the Canadian nickel industry by oversupplying the market and depressing prices. He suggested that
this represented a serious threat to the concept of an International Authority and to the entire Law of the Sea negotiations.
The discussion took a significant turn at this point with an
American delegate making the point very strongly that the
broader implications of this issue were being missed by the
Canadians. He repeated as his view and that of the chief U.S.
negotiator at the Law of the Sea talks that under the cloak of
an international treaty an attempt was being made to establish
a whole new régime of metal marketing, in effect a new
OPEC. The International Authority, as he saw it, was to be
given control over the marketing of resources "it had not
developed" and the current draft provisions on this subject
were completely unacceptable to the United States. He went
on to say that this was a direct threat to the United States as a
major and vulnerable consumer of metals and as a result the
Congress was likely to take action on seabed mining in this
session. He expressed disappointment that Canada now
seemed to be moving in the direction of support for producercartel proposals.
A Canadian delegate assured the American group that
Canada fully supported the United States on a weighted-voting Council for the International Authority which would
reflect the interests of major industrialized countries and metal
consumers as well as the interests of current producers and
developing countries. He stressed that Canada was as opposed
as the United States to the International Authority becoming

another cartel. The Canadian co-chairman suggested that the
Canadian concern was not the structure of the International
Authority-on which it supported the U.S. position-but
rather the current proposals to alter land based and seabed
mining quotas.
An American delegate concluded the discussion by observing that there seemed to be two distinct issues of concern to
Canada and the United States and said that he would check
into developments on the House side upon his return to
Washington.
West Coast Issues
Beaufort Sea
There was a short exchange on the subject of off-shore oil
drilling on the Beaufort Sea. The American delegate from
Alaska reported that there were only two U.S. rigs at present
and that he himself was extremely sceptical of the need for any
drilling off-shore where the costs and environmental risks were
far higher than for exploration in Alaska. He described as
"ironical" that the objections of environmentalists to drilling
in Alaska were forcing the far riskier exploration off-shore. He
expressed interest in the Canadian activity by Dome
Petroleum and specifically what sorts of corrective measures
had been put in place to prevent environmental damage in
moving the oil to shore.
Bowhead Whale
The same American delegate went on to express strong
disapproval of a recent International Whaling Authority decision to cut back the Alaskan Eskimos take of the Bowhead
Whale. He said that it was generally recognized that depletion
of this species was the result of large scale commercial exploitation by the Russians and Japanese and not due to the small
take by Eskimos which was an important source of food for
them. Another American participant said that the U.S. had
been faced with the dilemma of how to push for a general
moratorium on the whale hunt while seeking an exemption for
the Eskimos. The Canadian co-chairman concluded the discussion on this item by suggesting that Canada and the United
States should share data on the Bowhead.
Tanker Routes
The discussion on this subject revealed significant differences between members of the American delegation. The
delegate from Washington State began by remarking on this
fact and expressed the view that the current volumes of
Alaskan oil production could easily be handled by better
utilization of existing pipelines. If much more oil were to be
discovered, he personally favoured the Foothills proposal for
an overland oil pipeline route since any tanker port would pose
major environmental dangers. He expressed the fear that the
issue was "not being examined rationally" and that the President was being presented with no option other than the
Northern Tier proposal consisting of tanker shipment from
Valdez Alaska to a tanker port near Port Angeles,
Washington.

The delegate from Alaska disagreed with these remarks. He
argued that the considerable potential for greater Alaskan oil
production-as much as 2 million barrels a day-would bc
realized only if delivery to market was guaranteed in advance.
He expressed impatience with the objections Io west coast
tanker traffic by observing that the U.S. was dependent on a
huge volume of imported oil being brought to east coast ports
by foreign tankers. How then, he asked, could there be valid
objection to American tankers with stricter environmental
standards carrying domestic oil along the west coast? He
suggested that the environmental and other problems associated with tankers could be solved.
The Canadian co-chairman commented that there were
serious doubts about increased amounts of Alaskan oil and
therefore the whole issue might be a bit premature. He and
another Canadian delegate emphasized Canada's opposition to
substantially increased west coast tanker traffic and said that
an overland oil pipeline, should one be necessary, was much
preferred.
Halibut Fisheries
The Canadian co-chairman opened the discussion by
remarking that Canada could not understand how U.S. fishermen had so grossly exceeded their quota of halibut during a 7
day fishery in July. The American delegate from Alaska
replied that the responsibility for this situation lay with
Canada itself for having broken off talks on a new Pacific
Coast Halibut Convention in 1978. He reported that the
Alaskan Fisheries Council--responsible for enforcing U.S.
quotas-had increased the quota in retaliation for the breakdown in the talks and added that with the termination of the
Convention-which "shocked" the United States-there was
no further mechanism for enforcement on the American side.
He noted as well that the death of the chief U.S. negotiator
had complicated the problem.
A Canadian delegate objected to this interpretation, arguing
that there continued to be an agreement in force as the resuit
of a Protocol to the Halibut Convention signed in Washington
in March 1979. An American participant from Washington
State said that he had been unaware of the recent overfishing
but asked whether compensation had not been awarded by the
Halibut Commission. A Canadian replied that there had been
compensation but that it was inadequate and Canadian fishermen wanted further compensation in 1980 and 1981. He then
raised the larger question of the future cooperative management of the halibut stock and whether U.S. authorities were
really interested in or equipped to enforce cooperation and
fishing quotas. An American delegate replied that the Councils were federal bodies, albeit with some local and industry
membership, and that they were fully equipped to enforce a
management régime. He acknowledged that there was a problem of declining halibut stock and that Canada-U.S. cooperative in this area was essential.

Albacore Tuna
There was only the briefest of discussions on this item with a
Canadian delegate describing the problem as the United
States' refusal to recognize the applicability of Canada's 200
mile economic zone to this species of fish. The point was noted
by the American delegation.
Pacific Salmon Questions
The bilateral problems related to west coast salmon were
introduced by a Canadian spokesman who drew attention to
the ongoing negotiations for agreement to protect the west
coast salmon through a cooperative management program. In
respect to the Fraser River stocks, the problem revolves around
the heavy interception by U.S. fishermen whose catch, according to Canadian data, is considerably larger than that caught
by Canadian fishermen. Canada has put large sums into
salmon enhancement programs but, due to the terms of the
Fraser River Conservation Agreement, Canada is restricted
from developing the Fraser in the way it might choose without
risking the loss to the U.S. of the product of that enhancement.
Canada would like to have overall management and control of
the Fraser run and to sec enforcement of the agreed catch
regulations by both countries. Concern was also expressed
about what seemed to Canadians as a lack of U.S. federal
control over the fishermen entering the U.S. fishery. Canada
has attempted to impose limits on licences issued, ail in the
interest of conservation, whereas the U.S. scems to exercise no
such control because the State or Regional Fishing Councils
seem to have the power to end-run U.S. federal conservation
plans.
An Alaskan Senator spoke of the recent problem related to
salmon originating in the Yukon or B.C. and flowing through
Alaska or the Panhandle to the sea where American fishermen
were secking to develop salmon fishing. There had been incidents in the waters off the Panhandle he said. Canadians are
also concerned about U.S. fishermen catching salmon bred in
the Canadian head waters of these streams flowing through
the Panhandle.
A Congressman from the State of Washington stated that
dams on the Columbia had caused a high mortality rate of
salmon on this river. It was estimated that 60 per cent of
Columbia River salmon were caught by Americans. Last year,
under a short-term agreement, Canadian trollers had been
permitted to fish to 5 miles off the U.S. coast and this had
caused such difficulties that the American fishermen had had
to eut back. He described it as a "volatile" situation with the
danger of shootings and rammings in an industry which had an
increased number of fishermen pursuing a declining resource.
Plenar y
In place of the review of Committee reports held in previous
years, this year's main plenary was devoted to discussions of
subjects of general interest to the two delegations. (An earlier
plenary session on the Alaska Highway Gas Pipeline, the first
day of the meeting, had been arranged so ail delegates could
participate in this main agenda item.)

tween state and federal energy programs and environmental
constraints.
At the request of an American delegate, a Canadian Senator explained the very generous Canadian tax depletion allowance system designed to promote frontier drilling. He
described it as having stimulated oil and gas exploration in the
Beaufort Sea, and offshore Labrador. While the U.S. delegate
found this scheme attractive, it was severely criticized by a
Canadian delegate who claimed that the Canadian public was
generally unaware of it, that it was hidden in the national
accounts, and that there should be a better return for the

Bilateral free trade was raised by a Canadian participant
who mentioned a study donc by a Committee of the Canadian
Senate last year as well as a recent statement by the Canadian
finance minister who wished "to look seriously" at this area
and by a U.S. subcommittee which was undertaking a study
for a North American free trade arrangement. He cautioned
the American delegation in its use of the term 'continentalism'
which would, he said, arouse negative reactions in Canada.
Furthermore it was important for Americans to recognize that
a pooling of energy was "not in the works". What could be
involved would be a sector-by-sector or area-by-area look at
reductions in tariffs and elimination of NTB's such as in the
petrochemical industry. In the manufacturing sector, he said,
it seemed logical to many to look at some form of North
American rationalization. This participant pointed out that a
free trade area was neither a customs union nor a common
market. In a free trade area, Canada and the United States
would trade freely with one another but be free to set their
own tariffs against third countries. He cited the difference
between the common market which exists among the nine
countries of the European Community (EC) and the free trade
arrangement which Sweden or Norway have with the EC.
ANNEX
In keeping with this year's emphasis on energy issues, a
number of additional briefings and tours were included after
the conclusion of the Calgary meetings. In Calgary the delegations were briefed and shown slides of the Arctic Pilot Project
by Mr. W. H. Hopper, President and Chief Executive Officer
of Petro-Canada. In Fort McMurray, the delegates visited a
synthetic fuel producer (Syncrude Canada Ltd.) where they
were briefed by officers of the company including Mr. Brent
Scott, President. The Group then visited Whitehorse, capital
of the Yukon Territory situated on the proposed route for the
gas pipeline. A side visit to Skagway on the Alaska Panhandle
allowed delegates to examine a potential oil port.
From Whitehorse the group flew to Anchorage where the
President of the Northwest Pipeline Company, Mr. John
McMillian met the group for a discussion on the Alaska
Highway Gas Pipeline. In his presentation, Mr. McMillian
stated that there was in Alaska 26 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of
gas, or 13 per cent of the U.S. gas supply, which could be
moved down by pipeline; that an established communication

route would be used for the pipeline which would follow the
Alyeska Line as far as Delta and from there would go along
the Haines pipeline and the Alaska highway; that delays were
due to the regulatory decision-making in the United States;
that 9000 to 10,000 workers would be employed in the project;
that every company in the consortia was experienced in pipeline building; that it had been helpful to have Trans-Canada
Pipelines join the consortia for the prebuild; that Canadian gas
could go east to eastern Canadian markets through this
system; that the cost of the United States portion would be $9
billion and the Canadian portion $6 billion; that the project
could be privately financed; that his company asked Alaska for
$1 billion in tax free bonds; that he considered the incentive
rate of return important to avoid the huge Alyeska-type overruns; that the 80-foot distance required by law for the gas
pipeline from the oil pipeline was much more than the 20 feet
the company thinks is necessary or the 60 feet it had asked for;
and that there are good technical reasons for the frequent
crossing of the gas line over the oil line even though it is
expensive.
In response to questioning as to the comparative costs per
mile of pipeline in the two countries, Mr. McMillian admitted
it worked out at 2½ times more expensive in the United States
than in Canada. This startling difference, he explained, was
due to a number of factors. Canada had a labour output which
was more than twice the American output due to incentive
schemes and a very efficient pipeline industry. There were far
more environmental constraints in the United States as well as
more stringent requirements. Finally, the Canadian regulatory
process was far more efficient than the American. He compared the FERC before which his company had had 15
months of expensive hearings with the "good quick decisions"
of the NEB and urged that the American process be
streamlined.
From Anchorage, the group flew to Prudhoe Bay, the source
of Alaskan oil and gas where it was shown some of the ARCO
and Sohio installations including the ARCO gas compressor
unit where 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas per day was being
reinjected. Although officials maintained there was no limit to
the amount of time they could continue to reinject gas, it was
expensive at $2 million a month and it was in everyone's
interest to have the gas pipeline built. At Prudhoe Bay the
delegates were able to examine for themselves many of the
environmental concerns involving the compatibility of the
operations with indigenous wildlife such as the caribou, as well
as the care of the perma-frost and the tundra vegetation
through the use of 5-foot gravel pads. It was noted that
perhaps the best potential for new oil and gas discoveries in the
United States was in the adjoining lands along the Arctic
Wildlife Range and off-shore in the Beaufort Sea.

November 4, I had the distinct privilege of representing
Canada at the Vimy Memorial Ceremonies in Arras, France.
Accompanied by two distinguished Canadian veteran comrades of the First and Second World Wars, Brigadier-General
J. A. Delalanne, representing the Royal Canadian Legion, and
H. Cliff Chadderton, representing the National Council of
Veterans Associations, I stood, proud, on a piece of Canadian
land in France, a free gift in perpetuity of the French nation to
the people of Canada. And we stood together, side by side with
a Canadian and French honour guard comprised of soldiers of
a new decade, the youth of both our countries, as we honoured
our 60,000 First World War dead, including some 11,000 who
have no known graves, and we recognized their names
inscribed forever on the Vimy Memorial's ramparts, the names
of those Canadians who sacrificed their lives in defending
peace and freedom in the world.
As we stood with our French confrères before that majestic
and inspiring tribute in silent remembrance, we were reinspired with a mutual respect and comradeship, and with a
spirit of unity which I am sure will bind our two nations
everlastingly, even if as a result of the suffering and sacrifice
of our youth in time of conflict.
This Sunday, November 11, at services right across our
great country, Canadians will stand before Canada's memorials, with veterans who are left from the First and Second
World Wars and Korea, to honour the tens of thousands of
Canadian men and women who, in the prime of their lives,
served and died in far-off lands and seas so that Canada might
be free and united.
It is significant that as we honour our war dead on Remembrance Day after three wars we experience conflict from
within our great nation and are threatened with the break-up
of our country-a circumstance which would surely "break
faith" with those many thousands who fought and died for a
united Canada; for if they who lie in their graves could wake,
they would feel that they had died in vain.
I can only hope and pray that the inspriation, mutual
respect, and spirit of unity which I and my comrades
experienced at Vimy will reach across the seas to all Canadians to ensure continued national unity in our country. We will
remember them-those veterans who made the supreme
sacrifice.

Senator Perrault: Together with all honourable senators, I
should like to be identified with the moving and very appropriate remarks just uttered by the Honourable Senator Marshall.
I too have visited the Vimy Memorial at Arras and other
memorials constructed to honour those who died that Canadians and people in other countries might live. Together with
such visitors I was impressed and moved deeply by the fact
that the names inscribed on those memorials and on the
headstones represent Canadians of many racial backgrounds.

Many religions are represented there. United in common
cause, these men and women fought as unhyphenated Canadians, striving together to defend freedom and, in almost all
cases, dying at too young an age.
Some of the survivors, some of the remnant of those who
fought for Canada, are in real need today in various parts of
this country. They must not be forgotten. They deserve to be
honoured, especially on Remembrance Day, but they should be
honoured throughout the year and very much kept in mind as
we consider programs designed to help the people of Canada.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, perhaps I may
be permitted to add that on Sunday last, as your Speaker, I
had the honour, in the company of Mr. Donald Munro, the
Chairman of the House of Commons Committee on External
Affairs and National Defence, and also with our Ambassador
to South Korea, Mr. D. H. Burney, to lay a wreath at the
memorial to the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry
Regiment at a point just below the demilitarized zone in the
north part of South Korea in a spot where that distinguished
Canadian regiment fought one of the most famous battles in
the history of the Canadian Army.
It was an honour for me to be there in the presence of senior
officers, including a divisional general of the South Korean
army, who are defending one of our Canadian lines of defence
between 750,000 North Koreans, South Asia and ultimately
Canada.

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
IRAN-PROTECTION OF CANADIAN CITIZENS

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, in the first instance,
may I address a question to the Minister of State for CIDA.
From recent news reports, the situation in Iran would appear
to be verging on a state of anarchy. Can the minister provide
honourable senators with information with respect to the
position of Canadian nationals in Iran? Is there an estimate of
the number of Canadians there, and are they in any danger?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, the most recent news
indicates that the Canadians now in Iran are in perfect health.
I said recently that there are some 150 Canadians in Iran,
but only 60 of them are registered with our embassy.
Of course, the government is keeping a very close watch on
the explosive situation in Iran. I hope honourable senators will
allow me not to make any aggressive statement concerning this
situation, in order not to jeopardize the safety of the Canadians who are over there.
[English]
Senator Perrault: Is the minister able to state what kind of
security arrangements exist at our embassy in Iran? Is it a
token force? What type of physical protection exists for those
Canadians in Iran?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I cannot give you any
details of the security measures which have been taken to
protect our people. All I can say is that we do receive every
day a communication from our embassy to the effect that the
situation is such as I have indicated.
[English]
ENERGY

further information on this matter I will be very happy to
communicate it to honourable senators.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, it would be of interest to all of us, and certainly of interest to the country to have
a report as soon as possible with respect to the effects here of a
partial reduction of Iranian oil supplies to the United States,
or a total cut-off of Iranian exports, especially the effect such
a partial or total cut-off would have on our oil situation in
Canada, particularly this winter. I appreciate the minister's
offer to bring this information to the Senate.
TRANSPORT
RUMOURED MERGER OF AIR CANADA AND CP AIR

Senator Perrault: I have a further question that I should
like to direct to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. There seems to be a disagreement between Air Canada
and CP Air with respect to a general statement made by the
Honourable Minister of Transport to the effect that the two
airlines become partners on international routes. Has the
government received any communication from either Air
Canada or CP Air in response to Mr. Mazankowski's alleged
remarks?
Senator Flynn: I think we discussed this yesterday afternoon, and at the request of Senator Marchand I have asked
the Minister of Transport to respond to the questions posed. I
have not as yet received his reply.
Senator Perrault: But there have been communications to
the government from the companies in recent hours? The
minister may wish to provide this further information as part
of his report.
Senator Flynn: What I said yesterday afternoon was that
the Minister of Transport was speaking about only a hypothesis to rationalize international routes. In any event, I have sent
a request to the minister to have that point clarified, and I
think the reply will satisfy the Honourable Leader of the
Opposition.

OIL SUPPLIES FROM IRAN

Senator Perrault: I have a supplementary question that I
should like to direct to the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce. In view of the fact that it is estimated that a
cut-off of deliveries of oil to the United States by Iran would
mean that Canada could lose 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of
imported oil a day because of the multinational oil companies'
pooling arrangement under which all major customers share
the misfortune when one customer is cut off, has the government received any updated reports with respect to the status of
oil deliveries from Iran to the United States?
Senator de Cotret: Not to my knowledge, honourable senator. I am not aware of any recent clarification of that situation. I am well aware of the article you are quoting from, and
it is obviously a supply interruption that we would like to see
not materialize. As soon as we have any communication or any

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
IRAN-STATUS OF CANADIAN AID

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I should like to put
a supplementary question concerning Iran-Canada relations to
the Minister of State responsible for CIDA. Can the minister
inform this chamber about the status of Canadian aid through
CIDA, EDC and other federal agencies to the state of Iran?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: I do not have with me either the figures or
the projects you are referring to.
I shall enquire, however, and reply to you as soon as
possible.

INDUSTRY
BRIEF OF AUTOMOTIVE PARTS MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION
OF CANADA

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. Earlier in the
month of October the minister received a brief from the
Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association of Canada in
which they pointed out a projected deficit in their sector of
$2.9 billion, a figure which has now been revised upwards.
Could the minister indicate to the house when he is likely to
respond to that brief?
Senator de Cotret: In the very near future. I had an
informative meeting with the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association earlier this month, and they presented a very
interesting brief. There were a number of recommendations in
that brief, and I undertook at that point to give them a
detailed reply to the brief. That reply is being prepared and
discussed by my officiais at the moment, and I expect to be
able to communicate it to the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association in the very near future.

THE ECONOMY
NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE

Senator Bosa: I have a question of a different nature. In
view of the very great problems that Canada is facing today in
the economy, such as high interest rates, the high rate of
unemployment, and the lack of new capital for investment in
plant and equipment, does the minister not consider it more
appropriate to tackle these problems now rather than wait for
the results of the proposed National Economic Development
Conference, the date of which has not been set yet?
Senator de Cotret: First of ail, I totally disagree with the
premise of your question. Secondly, I totally disagree with the
conclusion that you draw from this false premise. I even
disagree with the facts. Our investment performance, at the
moment, is the best we have had in a number of years. Every
survey that has been conducted in the last year indicates that
investment performance in this country for new plant and
equipment will by far surpass the performance of the economy
for a great number of quarters in the past.
Senator Perrault: As a result of Liberal incentives.
Senator de Cotret: As a result of greater certainty caused by
the government's bringing down policies for stability in this
economy.
In terms of inflation and unemployment, I think it is grossly
unfair to indicate that the government is waiting for the
National Economic Development Conference to deal with
those issues. We are dealing with those issues at the moment.
They will be further addressed in the budget. Certainly they
will be discussed at the National Economic Development
Conference, but I would like honourable senators to know that
[Senator Asselin.]

November 8,

1979

the purpose of the National Economic Development Conference is not to focus on some of the cyclical problems that we
are undergoing right now and solutions to them, but rather
look at the next decade in this country.
Senator Lamontagne: Ten years from now.
Senator de Cotret: No, that was the Liberal approach. We
will look at the next ten years and find proper policies to deal
with the problems.
Senator Bosa: As a supplementary, is it true that the
business community has advised the minister not to proceed
with the conference in view of the lack of substantive results
from previous conferences?
Senator de Cotret: That is absolutely false. I met with my
advisory council as Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce
yesterday morning, and they applauded the initiative being
taken by the government. I have met with the chairmen of the
Tier I task force that was set up by the previous government.
They applauded our new initiative, pointing particularly to the
improvements over the past initiatives. I have also met with
the chairmen of the Tier II task force, both on the business
and the labour side. They are proceeding right now with work
in terms of input into the agenda of this process.
There is widespread support from labour, provincial governments, and business for this conference, and all are contributing very actively at the moment in setting up the agenda and
finalizing the details for its taking place.
Senator Bosa: As a further supplementary, has the minister
received representations to the contrary? Has he received any
representations from the business community which indicate
that they are not in agreement with this proposal?
Senator de Cotret: After meeting with business representatives in each of the provinces of this country, the chairmen of
the Tier I and Tier Il task forces, my own advisory council, the
Prime Minister, and with businessmen in Vancouver and
Montreal, I have not heard one voice suggesting that this
conference should not be held.
Senator Flynn: Except the voice of Senator Bosa.
CROWN CORPORATIONS
PETRO-CANADA-CHAIRMAN OF TASK FORCE

Senator Goldenberg: I have a question which I should like to
address to either the Leader of the Government in the Senate
or the Minister of State for Economic Development, whoever
chooscs to answer. The Montreal Gazette of yesterday,
November 7, reports, from Calgary, a news conference by
Doug McDougall who was head of the government task force
on Petro-Canada, in which he discusses the recommendations
of the task force on the distribution of Petro-Canada shares.
The report goes on to say:
McDougall, who is being paid by the federal government to explain his tasks force's report to interested
groups, said earlier yesterday that Petro-Canada has not
been an effective instrument of public policy:

November 8, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

I find it rather unusual for the head of a task force to be
paid to sell the task force's report. I can speak with some
authority because I think I have headed more inquiry commissions in Canada than anyone else in the last 35 years.
My question is this: Has the Government of Canada
retained the services of Mr. McDougall since the task force
made its report? If so, on what basis is he being paid?
I will understand if the minister takes this question as
notice.

I would therefore ask the minister to read the press release
again. I think he will share my mystification with it, and
perhaps he can give us some expansion from the Solicitor
General as to why this weapon was selected from among so
many as to be no longer a restricted weapon.
Senator Flynn: Agreed.
[Translation]
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
LOSS OF SALE OF CANDU REACTOR TO ARGENTINA

Senator Flynn: I will certainly take that as notice.

Senator Flynn: But sometimes you try.

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce concerning our commercial failure in Argentina.
As the document that he recently tabled in this house
concerning the Candu sale to Argentina was only a statement
made by Argentina Atomic Energy Commission President
Castro Maderos to the press of his country, could the minister
tell us-and I am coming back to my initial question-if the
Government of Argentina has contacted the Canadian government, directly or through exchanges between its nuclear
energy agency and Atomic Energy of Canada, to explain its
refusal to buy Candu; and, if so, could he table these documents as he had promised at the beginning of October?
Senator de Cotret: I wish to take this question as notice. I do
not know exactly which communications means have been
used. I think that the reason given by the Government of
Argentina through the official channels or otherwise are well
expressed in the document already tabled in this house. However, I am going to inquire about the communication process
that was used and I shall give you an answer.

Senator Frith: Really? When?

•

Senator Flynn: Sometimes when you shoot from the hip.

[En glish]
Senator McDonald: I should like to ask the minister a
supplementary question. There seem to be two views expressed
as to why Canada lost this sale of a nuclear reactor to
Argentina. One is that the German technology and work force
were superior to Canada's, which is rather a severe charge to
make against Canada. The other is that it was the application
of Canadian safeguards that lost the sale to Argentina. If we
lost this sale because of inferior technology and work force,
what is the present government attempting to do to solve this
problem? If we lost the sale because of the application of
Canadian safeguards, what are we doing to get our competitors, such as the Germans and the Swiss, to meet the high
standard of safeguards that Canada has proposed?
Senator de Cotret: Once again I am forced to disagree
totally with the basic premise of the question. It is very
difficult to surmise what one would do if what the honourable
senator believes happened actually happened, which did not
happen. I only reiterate what I said before, and what is borne
out in the statement on the table of this chamber, that there
were essentially two major reasons for the Argentine decision.
Certainly there was an express desire by the Government of
Argentina to move to second sourcing in their nuclear pro-

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
GUN CONTROL-RESTRICTED WEAPONS LIST

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Justice. Can he tell us why the Colt model
AR- 15 semi-automatic action rifle, which was on the restricted
weapons list, is no longer on that list? Can he tell us why, on
the recommendation of the Solicitor General, it apparently is
no longer a threat to the public?
Senator Flynn: I think that question should be directed to
the Solicitor General. I will ask him to reply to it, as I am not
much good at that kind of technical problem. To me, a gun is a
gun.
Senator Frith: I have a supplementary, honourable senators.
I just want to be sure that the Minister of Justice realizes that
I do not consider myself any expert on guns either.

Senator Frith: I must say, honourable senators, that some
day I hope to be able to enjoy the humour the Minister of
Justice brings forward with the same zest that he enjoys it
himself.
Senator Flynn: You will not be able to do that. It is
impossible.
Senator Frith: I think it is impossible, yes. I agree.
Honourable senators, I direct this question to the Minister
of Justice because his own press release did not clearly explain
why this weapon has suddenly become unrestricted. I appreciate that in the press release the Minister of Justice did say he
was acting on the recommendation of the Solicitor General. So
I understand that he will want to inquire.
And so he can understand exactly what the question is, may
I say that what I found mystifying in the statement was that it
did not separate this weapon from other like weapons as
suddenly, for some reason, becoming no longer a danger to the
public. It said that it had been restricted, and that it was now
not restricted. The reason the statement seemed to give was
that we now had gun control and therefore this gun did not
need to be restricted.

gram. We, being the first source, were obviously at a cornpetitive disadvantage if it was an avowed atmi of their policy Io
second source some of their nuclear projeets. That was further
illustrated by the fact that they indicated quite clearly that
this decision applied only to the reaclor under consideration.
and not to future contracîs being let out.
The other reason, and one that cannol escape our attention,
is the very poor performance on the first projeet we had in
Argenlina, in terns of the timning of the projeel, which wenl
well beyond what we hiad promised, in ternis of the cost
overruns on the projeet, which wenî well beyond what we had
projected, and finally in ternis of twice having t0 re-open the
question of safeguards during the life of the planning proje et.
That may be hisîory, but nonetheless the experience was not
a happy one for the Governm-ent of Argentina, and il was
cerîainly not a happy one for the Governmient of Canada in
those days. 1 do not propose 10 speak for the government of the
lime, but 1 am sure they cannot have enjoyed that unfortunate
incident. 1I fel îoday, as 1 feit when 1 answered this question
several weeks ago, that those were the two major issues. From
the point of view of technology, 1 think the Candu is stili the
best projeet of ils type in the world.
Senator Perrault: I do want to state, by way of a supplementary observation. that during an officiai mission 10 Argentina a
few months ago, the Argentine authorities were high in their
praise of Canadian technology and v orkmanship on the existing nuclear facîlities installed there. 1 îhink the minister is
aware of the severe fluctuations in the purchasing power of the
Argentine currency during the termi of the conmret, a situation
that precipitated much of that contract crisis. Aimost imiplîcit
n the mninister's repiy is îhe suggestion that somehow there
\vas total mismanagement on the Canadian side. That was not
the case. The contract period saw devaluation of the Argentine
currency two or three limes. Il was a very unstabie situation,
with annual inflation rates aI limes approaching 300 per cent.
Senator de Cotret: 1 should like il 10 be ver), clear that i am

Senator Lamontagne: To my previous question. Since the
government firmly intends to sell Candu reactors to foreign
countries-Romania, perhaps Japan, perhaps Mexico, and
perhaps elsewhere, when the minister finally decides to go
there-I am wondering, in view of the position that he confirmed this afternoon, what credibility can be attached to the
comments of Mr. Ross Campbell, who must, I suppose, continue to negotiate sales in other countries on behalf of Atomic
Energy of Canada. Because of his very important duties, he is
responsible for these sales in other countries.
Senator de Cotret: You have asked me to impute motives to
Mr. Campbell because of his statement. I refused to do so. I do
not see how this can affect his credibility.
As I said earlier, there may have been many reasons for the
comments made by Mr. Campbell. Perhaps he was not in
possession of all the facts that we have ourselves. He may have
spoken too soon. I cannot say. I refuse to examine the pros and
cons or make a judgment about his comments. I have already

industry, will the government take a strong stand at the
meeting with President Carter to set forth the Canadian view
that we should have our fair share of jobs as a result of that
agreement, as well as production, investment, research and
development? Is it planned to have a strong position taken by
Canada with respect to the Auto Pact during the course of
those conversations with President Carter?
Senator de Cotret: I can only assure the honourable senator
that the matter will be raised in the course of the discussions,
and that all positions of this government are strong positions.
We do not have wishy-washy positions.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
TIME ALLOCATED FOR MEETINGS

Senator Perrault: In view of the fact that the minister has
stated that a great many subjects are going to be covered in
the conversations with President Carter, are reports accurate

that the total time allocated for the private meeting with
President Carter is 15 minutes? How does the government
propose to cover those subjects in that period of time? Surely
the reports must be incorrect.
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator was more adept
at reading the previous press statement that he quoted earlier
today than any statement alleging a 15-minute meeting. Considerably more time than that has been set aside for substantive discussion.
Senator Thériault: Two 15-minute periods.
Senator de Cotret: No. I read four morning newspapers
earlier today and they all contained the same story. I am not
sure which paper the honourable senator has been reading, but
certainly the Globe and Mail, the Montreal Gazette, La Presse
and Le Devoir had the same story that reflected exactly the
time table for the meeting. There is a working lunch of one
hour tomorrow noon; there is a meeting on Saturday to last an
hour; and there are two 15-minute private meetings between
the President and the Prime Minister. It adds up to a total
amount of time of approximately three hours in which we are
going to be having substantive discussions. I agree that three
hours is not a very long period of time.
Senator Bosa: It's a ceremonial visit.
Senator Asselin: There will be ten minutes with your leader.
Senator de Cotret: That would be eight minutes too many.
Three hours is a fairly short period, given the complexity of
the agenda, but we still expect to be able to cover the vast
majority of it and have a useful exchange of views. It is
certainly more than 15 minutes.
Senator Perrault: The information is heartening, but surely
the government can understand the position of those on this
side when yesterday, when we asked for details with respect to
the agenda, we were given absolutely no information at all.
Senator Flynn: Nonsense.

Senator Perrault: Some agenda information may have
appeared in today's newspapers, but only after today's questioning have we been able to elicit further information in the
Senate with respect to the times allocated for meetings. Why
was it not possible for the government to provide for honourable senators an official schedule at the outset of today's
activities?
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator did not ask me.
Senator Perrault: For heaven's sake, information asked
yesterday.
Senator Flynn: No.
Senator Perrault: It is in the Debates of the Senate.
Senator de Cotret: Had the Leader of the Government or I
been asked yesterday how much time had been set aside for
substantive meetings, we would have been happy to provide
that information. We were asked whether a number of issues
were on the agenda, and we gave definitive answers on each of
those questions.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Perrault: Definitive answers were not provided.
Indeed, the Leader of the Government stated that he was not
able to divulge that information. Why was it possible to make
that information available to the Gazette, the Globe and Mail
and other publications, and not to the Senate?
Senator Flynn: Where did you see that?
Senator Perrault: We will find it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Orders of the Day-Senator Perrault: Mr. Speaker, as reported at page 267 of
Debates of the Senate for yesterday, when asked about the
agenda, Senator Flynn said:
There is certainly an agenda, but I do not think I can
make it public at this time.
That was the reply.
Senator Flynn: I am sorry, but I will not accept that kind of
insinuation. You asked me if there was an agenda. You did not
ask me how much time would be available for the Prime
Minister and the President to meet. That is quite a different
story. If you cannot iake that distinction, then I do not know
that you belong here.
Senator Perrault: Questions relating to the agenda, of
course, include the length of the meetings. That is implicit in
the question.
Senator Flynn: Oh no.
Senator de Cotret: I would like to reply to the honourable
senator, because the question he asked yesterday was:
Has an agenda been prepared which can be made
available for consideration by those who serve in Parliament? I am not asking the minister for confidential
details, but rather a list of the general topics to be
discussedThat is not asking for the time allotted for private discussions
between the Prime Minister and the President, or, for that
matter, a list of the times, and the amount of time set aside for
substantive discussion between cabinet ministers on the two
sides. Those are two different questions entirely.
Senator Perrault: There are other matters that may more
usefully be pursued this afternoon, but I suggest that a forthcoming government and a forthcoming minister would cheerfully have divulged the length of the agenda and some of the
pertinent highlights.
Senator Flynn: I disagree entirely. Had that question been
asked yesterday, I would have replied; but it was not asked.
[Translation]
ENERGY
IMPORTATION OF OIL FROM MEXICO-REQUEST
OF AGREEMENTS

Senator de Cotret: No, I shall be happy to give you this
information as soon as possible, but I cannot do so today.
Senator Lamontagne: When the minister gives me this
information will he also undertake to table at the same time
the text of the agreements negotiated by the former government with the Government of Mexico?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I am quite willing
to do so. However, I shall have to check in case there are
difficulties of a formal nature which would prevent the tabling
of these agreements before they are signed officially. If there
are no such problems, I shall be happy to table the agreements.
CROWN CORPORATIONS
OWNERSHIP OF AIR CANADA

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I have another
question for the government leader in the Senate. t have just
finished reading the speech made by the minister in its entirety
as opposed to a newspaper summary.
I am sorry, but the reply I received yesterday to the effect
that there was no question of the government adding Air
Canada to the list of crown corporations which will eventually
go back to the private sector was quite clear, since the minister
said that the government had no intention of proceeding in
this manner.
In the last paragraph of his speech-there is no forma]
statement, but the situation is somewhat different from what
the minister suggested-the Minister of Transport said the
following:
* (1500)

[English]
In my view the government should not allow ownership
of the airline to pass to any single corporation or corporate group. Indeed, I feel strongly that the government
should retain a large portion of ownership in Air Canada
for some time to come.
[Translation]
So it is surely not excluded that part of Air Canada could be
owned either by citizens or private corporations, and only for a
limited time. So it is not excluded either that Air Canada
might one day be placed on the same list as those crown
corporations that are to be turned over to the private sector.
Senator Flynn: I agree but I think there is nothing new in
that. That has been our position for a long time. In any event,
in the foreseeable future, there is no question of Air Canada
being privatized.
[En glish]

FOR TABLING

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In
view of the situation in Iran, could he give me today a reply
about our Mexican oil imports?

November 8, 1979

Commission, and in view of the fact that he, as the Minister of
Justice, has just recently ruled out any hope of establishing the
office of a federal ombudsman, would he give kind consideration to improving the working conditions of senators so that
we may continue the traditional role of acting as ombudsman
for our people?
Senator Flynn: I do not know what the question is, exactly.
Are you asking me about the Canadian Human Rights Commission and whether its work is being hampered? If so, I do
not believe it is. If I understand the end of the question, are
you relating the question to our working more efficiently?
Senator Haidasz: That is right.
Senator Flynn: I have had no complaints about that. If
Senator Haidasz is hampered in his work and his duties, we
may have the Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and
Administration look into that matter. That would be
interesting.
I know, however, that not all senators are in the same
situation, because we have addressed that on many occasions
before that committee. If Senator Haidasz is unable to do all
he wishes to do, I think it is worth consideration by that
committee on a priority basis, especially for him.
Senator Haidasz: Not especially for me, but for everybody.
Senator Flynn: I think your case is rather special.
Before the Orders of the Day are called, I have what may be
called delayed answers. Of course, I have to address my friend
Senator Steuart first.
ENVIRONMENT
POLLUTION BY ACID RAIN

Senator Flynn: Senator Steuart asked a question yesterday
which was, in effect, a supplementary to his question of
October 18. I had promised to report back to Senator Steuart
after the Minister of the Environment had indicated to me his
department's position on this matter.
There have been local expressions of concern, echoed by the
IJC, the sulphur dioxide emissions from the plant could have
adverse effects on Montana. However, health and property
federal agencies in both countries have concluded that emissions from a 600-megawatt plant would not violate Canadian,
Montana or United States federal air quality standards.
No timed decision has yet been announced regarding the
second unit. The Saskatchewan government has indicated that
it expects to announce shortly its decision on the second unit.
Canada stated at the recent hearings that it now believes the
second unit can be built and operated in a manner consistent
with Canada's obligations under the Boundary Water Treaty.

FISHERIES
RESTRICTION ON TRAWLER FISHING IN GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE

Senator Flynn: I also have an answer for Senator Marchand
about trawlers over 100 feet-I do not know how to convert

that into metres, Senator Lamontagne-fishing in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence.
An Hon. Senator: You divide by 12.
Senator Flynn: No, you multiply by something. I am sorry,
but I do not know.
Senator Langlois: You have no alternative.
Senator Flynn: I have no alternative, no, because I prefer to
say so right away than being shown otherwise, as can happen
to others.
So I would like to say that the decision in question to allow
those trawlers to fish is valid only for the year 1979. It applies
only to the last two months of this year. So no decision has
been made for the 1980 season.
I have other explanations I could give Senator Marchand,
but I believe this answers strictly the questions he asked me.

AGRICULTURE
CHICKEN IMPORT QUOTAS

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I have a few points
of clarification to questions that were asked recently. In
answer to a question put by Senator Argue yesterday I indicated that the Minister of Agriculture was going to be in Rome
today. I was asked whether this was an important meeting, and
the nature of the trip to Rome.
The Minister of Agriculture will be attending a meeting of
the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
Nations, which regroups 145 nations. It is meeting this week in
Rome for its twentieth session. The meeting will deal with
major trends and policies in food and agriculture worldwide,
and focus specifically on a plan of action to strengthen world
food security. 1 am sure Senator Argue would agree that this
is, indeed, a very important meeting for us to participate in.
Senator Argue: As long as you look after the chickens at
home.
Senator de Cotret: Even while the feathers are flying, I will
look after the chickens at home.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
CANADIAN CONTRACTS WITH ARAB COUNTRIES

Senator de Cotret: In answer to a question that was asked
on October 30 dealing with our trade with Arab countries, I
mentioned that we signed recently an agreement with Saudi
Arabia. I should now like to provide the details I did not have
at hand then. It is the firm of Arthur Erickson Associates Ltd.
They were awarded a $7 million contract to construct a
building for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Saudi Arabia.
That was signed in the recent past.

relating to a speech i had given to the Montreal Chamber of
Commerce on October 16, 1979. The question referred more
speeifically to a comment in thc prepared texi dealing with the
Standing Joint Committee on Program Evaluation.

their presenit form, if at ail." That is really the statement
which led to the specifie words that were contained in the
speech. Thuse referred to one of the potential mechanisms that
would bc used. 1 do not think I used those words, because ait
that time it was very tentative, and it still is. It is one of the

Senator Lang: Honourable senators, before I speak to Order

the attention of the Senate to the fact that one of our
colleagues here is a litter-bug. I do not know whether such
disreputable habits are acquired in the [buse of Commons,
and then brought in here, but my friend Senator Mlarshall,
who has now discreetly departed from the chamber, litters my
area with discarded material from his desk, not by laying it on
the floor but by tearing it up into smnall pieces. M4r. Speaker. I
xwould hope that you might drasw to his attention that this
disgusting habit is not completely in conformity with the sense

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read a third time?

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Nurgitz for the second reading of Bill S-4,
to implement conventions between Canada and Spain, Canada
and the Republic of Liberia, Canada and the Republic of
Austria, Canada and Italy, Canada and the Republic of
Korea, Canada and the Socialist Republic of Romania and
Canada and the Republic of Indonesia and agreements between Canada and Malaysia and Canada and Jamaica.

Senator Nurgitz moved that the bill be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
Motion agreed to.
* (1520)

FUGITIVE OFFENDERS BILL
Senator Hicks: Honourable senators, I wish to say only a
very few words in relation to this bill, which, of course, is an
extension of the policy of treaty making concerning tax conventions with other countries that has been going on for some
time.

I think the explanation that Senator Nurgitz gave, when he
spoke to the bill yesterday, is quite adequate, and I can find
nothing in what he said with which I would want to disagree. h
think we are ail glad that we have succeeded in negotiating
treaties with nine other countries in addition to the 24 with
whom we already have tax arrangements that will avoid
double taxation and ease the tax burden on Canadian taxpayers, and on the taxpayers of the contracting or treaty-making
countries concerned.
I wish that the treaties could be somewhat more uniform,
but I realize the difficulties of these negotiations, and I
suppose we have to make the best arrangements that we can,
even if they cannot ail be the same as they relate to income
that arises in the United States as compared to income that
arises in Romania, Jamaica, or wherever it may be.
Again, Senator Nurgitz pointed out adequately, in my view,
the general differences in the treaties with the several countries. He referred particularly to Part X of the bill, which it
was appropriate for him to do, because certainly it is an
advantage to have a provision in these treaty arrangements
that they can be brought up to date without individual pieces
of legislation every time there is a tax change, either in the tax
laws of Canada or those of the country with which we are
entering into a treaty.
h note that Senator Nurgitz proposes that the bill be
referred to committee. If there are more detailed questions
about any of these arrangements I am sure they can be taken
up in the committee concerned.
Thus, though the arrangements are not uniform, I think the
treaties generally provide an equitable arrangement on behalf
of Canadian taxpayers and on behalf of taxpayers in the other
treaty-making countries. We, on our side, support the motion
for the second reading of this bill.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Nurgitz, seconded by the Honourable Senator Smith
(Colchester), that this bill be now read a second time. Is it
your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
80072-21

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, October 31, the
debate on the motion of Senator Flynn for the second reading
of Bill S-8, respecting fugitive offenders in Canada.
Senator Neiman: Honourable senators, before getting to my
remarks on Bill S-8, I should like to pay my respects to His
Honour the Speaker. I have had the pleasure of serving on
many committees with Senator Grosart, and I am glad to see
that he is presiding here with the same sure grasp of the
subject and the same air of sweet reasonableness that he
always displayed in committees.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Neiman: Of course, he is aided by excellent leaders
on both sides of the house.
I should also like to add my congratulations and welcome to
ail of our new colleagues. It is obvious from the speeches that
they have already made that they are bringing to the Senate
an excellent range of political, professional and personal
experience and wisdom. I might also add that the more
balanced political perspective might have a somewhat salutary
effect on our deliberations.
The Minister of Justice, in speaking to his motion for the
second reading of this bill last week, must have had other
important matters on his mind, because he gave us only a
partial history of the origin of the bill. I do not mention that by
way of criticism. h simply take this opportunity to bring to the
attention of the house that considerable work has already been
done, both in the Senate and in the Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee, on the substance of this bill.
In his opening remarks last week, the Minister of Justice
referred to the first predecessor of this bill, which was introduced a year ago last spring during the third session of the last
Parliament. As Senator Flynn mentioned, it received first
reading in January, and second and third readings during the
month of February. On February 22, after having been
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs, it received third reading.
The committee was unusually kind insofar as the bill was
concerned, and it passed without amendment. h do not know
whether it was because the then Minister of Justice, the
Honourable Ron Basford, was appearing before the committee
for the last time in that capacity, but the bill did pass without
amendment. That bill did not pass aIl stages in the other place

SENATE DEBATES
in that session and was re-introduced, together with some
substantive changes, as Bill S-9 in the fourth session, specifically in November 1978. At that time it received much more
comprehensive consideration by honourable senators, again
both in the house and in committee.
Senator McIlraith, in introducing Bill S-9, brought to our
attention the fact that there were some changes over the bill
which was considered in the third session. These changes were
mostly of a minor character and editorial in nature. However,
he did refer to certain clauses, one of which he found troublesome and it is one which 1 shall refer to a little later, that
being the clause which defines a political offence. During the
ensuing debate, it became clear that a number of us found the
definition that was in the bill at that time rather obscure and
not very helpful.
Another clause that received considerable attention at all
stages was clause 18, dealing with ministerial discretion to
refuse to return an alleged fugitive offender. It is still clause 18
in the present bill. Most of us expressed concern on the matter
of ministerial discretion as set out in the first predecessor bill,
and when the measure was re-introduced as Bill S-9 there was
quite a change. The substantive change that was made in that
particular clause related to the grounds on which the minister
could decide not to return an offender. Those grounds were
changed substantially, and the interesting thing-and perhaps
the minister can explain this later on-is that in the measure
now before us the government has reverted to the grounds set
out in the original predecessor bill.
Clause 18(1) now commences:
The Governor in Council may, by order, direct the
MinisterAnd I agree with the sponsor of the bill that having the
Governor in Council exercise this discretion is an excellent
change, and one that is fresh to this bill. However, the grounds
on which this is donc are now set out to be:
-where the fugitive offender would be likely to suffer the
death penalty for the returnable offence in respect of
which his return is requestedIn Bill S-9, that clause had been changed to read that the
minister could exercise his discretion and refuse to order the
surrender of a fugitive offender where it appeared to him that
that fugitive offender would be likely to "suffer an excessively
severe or inhumane punishment." That represents a substantial difference.
Honourable senators may recall that this bill was twice
before the committee, and we finally did pass it in that form.
It is for that reason that I am curious now as to why the
draftsmen have reverted to the grounds as set out in the
original predecessor bill.
We heard testimony to the effect that the agreement
reached with the Commonwealth countries upon which many
of these clauses are based contained the wording that was
incorporated in Bill S-9, the immediately preceding bill, so I
would appreciate an explanation of why we have gone back to
this particular wording.
[Senator Neimar.]

a

November 8, 1979

(1530)

One other thing that was donc during the course of the
discussion on the previous bill, Bill S-9, was to change the
definition of "offence of a political character" which is contained in clause 2, the interpretation clause of the bill. That
remains the same in this bill, but there again the minister
might like to enlighten us, because it is my recollection that he
himself was a little unhappy with the amended version,
although that definition was much improved over the first
version in the old Bill S-8. You were unhappy with this version
as well, Mr. Minister, and yet it has been allowed to stand.
The other major point I would like to refer to briefly is that
connected with the bail provisions. It was pointed out by
Senator McIlraith, when he sponsored this measure previously
as Bill S-9, that the clause here, which is again clause 8,
dealing with bail provisions, places the onus on the alleged
defendant to prove why he should be granted bail. I recollect
also that Senator Asselin took exception to this, and it is a
clause to which I also take exception. I am referring to clause
8, subclause (3), "Detention of fugitive offender." 1 cannot
understand why the onus has been shifted to the accused. I can
sec no more reason for doing it in this particular act than I can
sec for doing it in any other act, and 1 find this trend in the
criminal law to be very unfortunate and one we should not
encourage.
Honourable senators, I think there are probably a few other
points in this bill that should be considered, but those to me
are the main ones. 1 feel that they require some clarification. I
know the minister has been a distinguished member of the
Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for many years,
and 1 hope he will avail himself of the opportunity to appear
before it in his more elevated and important capacity by
referring this bill to that committee. 1 think the questions I
have raised are ones that could be explored a little further, and
I should also like to have some further explanation of the
possible impingement of the Immigration Act on certain sections of the two acts here-the Fugitive Offenders Act and the
Extradition Act-because I think that in the case of people
who have been granted landed immigrant status there could
possibly be some procedural problems involved.
I would make just one further technical suggestion to whoever deals with such things. I think it would be very helpful if
this bill were to include in its title a reference to the Extradition Act. The title of this bill should indicate that it covers not
only the Fugitive Offenders Act but also the Extradition Act.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is my duty
under rule 30 to inform the Senate that if the Honourable
Senator Flynn speaks now, other than to merely answer a
question, his speech will have the effect of closing the debate
on second reading of this bill.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I thank Senator
Neiman very sincerely indeed for her observations. I am very
interested in many of the points she raised, particularly in the
suggestion that the bill's tithe is wrong or not sufficiently

November 8, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

descriptive. It is truc that every time I look at the title and the
words "fugitive offenders in Canada" I feel that it really
covers provisions for extradition arrangements with other
Commonwealth countries. 1 think something should be donc
about that, and I shall certainly ask my officials to look into
the question of a change in title. At first sight, I would
certainly say that Senator Neiman is entirely right.
With respect to clause 18, the honourable senator mentioned
that the main change was that the discretion is not given to the
minister, but to the Governor in Council, and I think that is an
improvement, as she said. But as far as the rest of the clause is
concerned, the changes meet with the provisions of the extradition treaties we have with other countries. In any case, that
can be examined more thoroughly when the bill is before
committee.
With regard to the problem of political offences, I remember very well that my objection was that the reference was
only to the murder of the head of state, including any member
of a collegial body performing the function of head of state,
the head of a government and a minister of foreign affairs. I
think I mentioned that the murder of the minister of justice,
for instance, could be interpreted as an offence of a political
character. I was in somewhat of a dilemma as to whether I
should bring myself under this umbrella. Anyway, as far as
this is concerned, it too can be discussed in committee because
I think the idea is to try to meet the general standards we find
in extradition treaties. But if there is any way in which we
could cover more than that, then I would have no objection.
I am very pleased also to tell honourable senators, and the
Honourable Senator Neiman in particular, that I want this bill
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs so that it might be examined. I am
certainly open to any suggestions for improvement that might
be made in committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS
MOTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT COMMITTEE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED
Senator Haidasz, pursuant to notice of Tuesday, October
16, 1979, moved:
That a standing joint committee of the Senate and
House of Commons, to be known as the Joint Committee
on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, be
appointed to inquire into any matter relating to the
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms;

That eight Members of the Senate, to be designated at
a later date, act on behalf of the Senate as members of
the said Joint Committee; and
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
requesting that House to unite with the Senate for the
above purpose, and to select, if the House deems it
advisable, some of its Members to act on the proposed
Joint Committee.
He said: Honourable senators, I welcome this opportunity of
moving and speaking to the motion I gave notice of on October
16 last, that a standing joint committee of the Senate and
House of Commons, to be known as the Joint Committee on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, be appointed to
inquire into any matter relating to the protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms. In the previous parliament I
proposed a similar motion, but was unable to proceed as
dissolution came upon us swiftly, if not unexpectedly.
The origins of human rights can be traced back to the
historic movements for freedom and equality, as well as to the
inspiration provided by the great religions and philosophies of
the world that affirm the dignity and worth of the individual.
Human rights have recently emerged on the centre stage of
international affairs, and most recently were given great support and importance by Pope John Paul Il on October 2 last in
his memorable address to the United Nations, which I had the
privilege of attending.
As interest and activity in respect of human rights are
gathering more momentum and importance throughout the
world, we can truly and proudly say that Canada has indeed
played a prominent role in this field. Along with some other
western democracies, Canada has achieved quite a good reputation, even though one must admit that no country has an
unblemished human rights record.
In my introductory remarks, I should like to mention that
most of the efforts of Canadian parliamentarians thus far in
the field of human rights, and especially over the past five
years, were concentrated on the provisions of basket number
three of the Final Act of Helsinki. Of much concern to the
Canadian government, as well as to many parliamentarians
and people across this country, is the fate of the provisions of
the Final Act of Helsinki to which Canada, the United States,
and all the countries of Europe except Albania are signatories,
since August 1, 1975. The Final Act of Helsinki was the
product of long and tedious discussions and negotiations at the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. During
the conference, Canada made a significant contribution to the
human rights provisions of the so-called basket number three.
The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
and the Belgrade Review Meeting have been the forum not
only for discussion of human rights questions, but also for
international political confrontation. The participant states
have rivalled one another in producing allegations and counter-allegations of violations of human rights in particular.
Although solemn declarations were made by the heads of state
to act upon the provisions of the Final Act of Helsinki, human

SENATE DEBATES
rights arc still being violated. In many countries human rights
abuses still occur, but most people cannot flee or seek to have
their rights respected. Individuals and organized groups of
citizens monitoring the implementation of the provisions of the
Helsinki Accords are often harassed or even punished.
Nonetheless, the participating states that signed the Final
Act of Helsinki resolved to continue the multilateral process
initiated by the conference by proceeding to a thorough
exchange of views on the implementation of the provisions of
the Final Act, and by organizing follow-up meetings.
As a result, many interested and concerned members of
Parliament and senators gathered in Ottawa on July 14, 1977,
to forn a Canadian Parliamentary Helsinki Group. This group
is a voluntary, informal, ad hoc body composed of several
senators and members of Parliament of all parties for the
purpose of providing a focus for public and parliamentary
interest in the work of the follow-up meetings of the Final Act
of Helsinki.
Twenty members of this group attended, as parliamentary
observers, the Belgrade Review Meeting which was held from
October 1977 to March 1978. The last meeting of this group
was held in Ottawa on March 15, 1979, when they heard
briefs from a number of Canadian non-governmental groups,
the Canadian Committee of Captive European Nations, and
other national organizations concerned with the implementalion of the provisions of the Final Act of Helsinki and the
concluding document of the Belgrade meeting. A frank and
productive exchange of views took place on that day. In the
course of the discussions, the point was made that the current
parliamentary structure for dealing with the monitoring process of the Helsinki Accords and the preparations for the
Madrid meeting in November 1980 is logistically inadequate,
both in Parliament and in the Department of External Affairs.
To try to improve the group's effectiveness, three recommendations were made, one of which urged the formation of a
permanent joint Senate and House of Commons committee to
monitor the Helsinki Accords and other international conventions concerning the protection of human rights. We are now
faced with the raised expectation of interested groups who
desire to have a formal channel for participation in the Helsinki monitoring process.
On the international scene, an appeal was made recently by
Matthew Nimetz, legal adviser to Cyrus Vance at the U.S.
State Department, during a speech at the recent meeting in
New York City of the National Inter-religious Task Force on
Soviet Jewry, calling for greater progress in all provisions of
the Helsinki Accords and especially in the field of human
rights and international security. He condemned, in particular,
the U.S.S.R. for making its commitment to the Helsinki Act a
farce by refusing to implement its provisions, and by continuing its repression of citizens' monitoring groups. Mr. Nimetz
also criticized the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist
Republic for its harassment of the Charter 77 members and
the recent trials and imprisonment of six of its prominent
activists.
[Senator Haidasz.j

November 8, 1979

The specially organized commission of the U.S. Congress
dealing with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe is very active and effective in monitoring the implementation of the Helsinki Accords. I am hopeful that Canadian parliamentarians will reactivate their efforts in this regard
in the very near future.
The United Nations, which rose from the ashes of the
Second World War, established high standards of human
rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted
by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948
established basic parameters which gave birth to many international covenants and protocols defining more specifically
standards of behaviour to which Canada has become a party,
and which had a catalytic effect on the evolution of human
rights legislation in our country. Today all Canadian provinces
have statutes respecting human rights and have established
human rights commissions. Some provinces have the office of
ombudsman in operation.
In the federal field, Parliament enacted in 1960 the Canadian Bill of Rights entitled "An Act for the Recognition and
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms." In
1968, Mr. Trudeau, as Minister of Justice, proposed a constitutionally entrenched Canadian charter of human rights, but
unfortunately this proposal and subsequent ones were not
realized.
* (1550)

However, the culmination of these efforts was the Canadian
Human Rights Act sponsored by the previous federal government under the leadership of the Right Honourable Pierre
Elliott Trudeau, and given royal assent in this chamber on July
14, 1977. That act assured equal opportunities and privacy for
individuals, and established a Human Rights Commission to
enforce the legislation.
Increasingly, human rights have become an important cornerstone of Canadian foreign policy. Canada has a representative today on the United Nations Human Rights Commission
and our country has made great efforts to relieve the plight of
refugees from many countries.
More recently, on September 25 of this year, the Secretary
of State for External Affairs for Canada devoted most of her
first UN address to human rights issues, and called for better
ways to deal with gross violations. She supported the formation of an office of a high commissioner for human rights and
even proposed that the General Assembly establish a position
of undersecretary general for human rights. But too often at
this time the efforts and talents of delegations are devoted to
the goal of political advantage, and so positive action in this
matter has been postponed.
While the United Nations Assembly is trying to sort out its
problems, the Canadian Parliament can and should take strong
and fresh initiatives to stand up for human rights at home and
abroad. The debates and actions of parliamentarians in
Ottawa should be relevant to the needs and hopes of our
people, or else our credibility will be jeopardized.

November 8, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Fhe talents and work of senators and members of Parliament should be better mobilized and steered to deal with the
outstanding problems that are still debasing our society. There
is still work to be done to eradicate prejudice, discrimination
and racism in our own midst.
Several studies and task forces over the last five years,
conducted on behalf of all levels of government by highly
regarded and credible individuals, have pointed out with hard
data that racial prejudice in individuals and in institutions
exists and has been in varying degrees, if not openly accepted
and condoned, at least quietly tolerated. Only two weeks ago
the thoughtful and alarming report prepared by His Eminence
Emmett Gerald Cardinal Carter of Toronto, called upon the
Metropolitan Toronto municipal government to act urgently
on race relations between the Toronto police force and the
city's ethnic minorities.
On the national scene the Senate and House of Commons
can and should, indeed will have to, play a more important role
in these human rights issues, owing to the fact that the
government has recently cut resources for the Canadian
Human Rights Commission, and bearing in mind that the
Secretary of State expressed only a few days ago that there
would not be a proposal to establish a federal ombudsman.
Therefore, to deal adequately and swiftly with the many and
varied human rights problems existing today, I propose for
urgent consideration by honourable senators the establishment
of a joint Senate and House of Commons committee on human
rights and fundamental freedoms. Uniting the efforts of both

houses of Parliament would add to the completeness and
prestige of our work, and would eliminate delays, duplication
costs and manpower problems. Such a formal committee, with
adequate powers and broad terms, would raise the human
rights issue to its rightful importance. It would mean giving it
our urgent and profound attention on a regular basis and,
more important, it would serve as an additional vehicle, indeed
a more effective machine, for championing the rights of our
citizens and our fellow men elsewhere.
Our affirmative action on the motion would help meet the
challenge and the needs of those people and organizations who
expect parliamentary action. A good starting point would be
the study of a special report incorporating recommendations
from the National Conference on Human Rights in Canada,
which took place in Ottawa on December 8 to 10, 1978,
presented to Parliament by the Canadian Human Rights
Commission in January 1979.
Honourable senators, if there is wisdom among us, and I
believe there is, and if there is the will, as I believe there
should be, and if there is experience, as I am sure there is, then
these qualities should be welded and employed in the best way
to defend and preserve human rights and fundamental freedoms. I therefore urge honourable senators to take up this
challenge with a sense of urgency and determination. This will
be, then, another great opportunity for our Parliament to serve
our people.
On motion of Senator Bosa, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, November 13, at 8
p.m.

THE ESTIMATES
SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (A)
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE

November 8, 1979
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to
which the Supplementary Estimates (A) laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1980, were referred,
has in obedience to the order of reference of Thursday,
November 1, 1979, examined the said Supplementary Estimates (A) and reports as follows:
(1) The Committee was authorized by the Senate as
recorded in the Minutes and Proceedings of the Senate of
November 1, 1979 to examine and report upon the expenditures proposed by the Supplementary Estimates (A) laid
before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1980.
(2) In obedience to the foregoing, your Committee examined the Supplementary Estimates (A) and heard evidence
from the following officials of the Treasury Board: the
Honourable S. M. Stevens, President; Mr. J. Manion, Secretary; Mr. L. J. O'Toole, Assistant Secretary; Mr. E. A.
Radburn, Director, Estimates Division, Prograi_ Branch;
Mr. E. R. Stimpson, Director, Expenditure Analysis Division, Program Branch.
(3) These Supplementary Estimates (A) total $1,001
million which represent funds for which Parliament is being
asked to provide new authority. The budgetary expenditures
total $947 million and the non-budgetary expenses, that is to
say, loans, investments, and advances amount to $54 million.
The total estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1980 are now increased to $53,915 million.
(4) In these Supplementary Estimates some of the major
items are:
-$835
million for Energy, Mines and Resources to
increase oil compensation payments
-$67 million for the Department of Transport to cover
payments to VIA Rail Canada Inc.
$36 million for Supply and Services to increase the
amount that may be outstanding at any time under the
Supply Revolving Fund.
-$10 million for the Department of Communications for
contributions to Telestat Canada in connection with the
Anik D spacecraft.
(5) Treasury Board supplied the Committee with a list
explaining the $1 items for Supplementary Estimates (A)
which is attached as an Appendix to this Report.
(6) The Committee discovered that the government had
intended to use the Main Estimates to provide the legislative

basis for a national home insulation program which will
eventually cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. O'Toole,
Assistant Secretary, Treasury Board Program Branch, mentioned that hundreds of government programs have in fact
been introduced by using estimates, main or supplementary.
The Committee is extremely concerned with a practice
which allows introduction of major government programs
without ensuring satisfactory Parliamentary scrutiny. While
the Committee has objected for many years to the use of
'dollar votes' to amend existing legislation, the general practice
of providing programs with their original legislative authority
in an appropriations act is far more deleterious to effective
Parliamentary consideration of the government's activities.
The Committee recognizes that insisting that no program
have its legislative base solely in an appropriations act would
have major implications for the legislative calendar. Thus
additional information is required to determine the extent of
the practice and the Committee will report further on this
matter in its report on the Main Estimates for the fiscal year
1979-80.
Respectfully submitted,
D. D. EVERETT,
Chairman.

ADDITIONAL EXPLANATIONS
Category C

Agriculture
Vote 1Sa-To authorize the guarantee of a loan to Canfarm
Co-operative Services Limited in the amount of $4
million.
Explanation-Tbe Canfarm Services Program of the Department of Agriculture was privatized effective April 1,
1979. To effect an orderly transfer of Canfarm to the
private sector, the goverfiment agreed to provide a loan
guarantee of up to $4 million to cover the necessary line
of credit to be extended to the newly formed Canfarm
Co-opreative Services Limited by its principle lending
agencies (Canadian Co-operative Credit Society, Cooperative Insurance and Co-operative Trust Company of
Canada). Provision for the goverfiment loan guarantee
was included in 1978-79 final Supplementary Estimates
but was flot approved prior to dissolution of Parliament.
In order to carry on with the privatization, an interim
goverfiment loan was authorized on conditions no more
favourable than could have been achieved under the loan
guarantee. With the Parliamentary authority for the $4
million loan guarantee, the interim boan will be paid back
to the goverfiment when the boans outstanding are transferred to the private sector.
Solicitor General
Vote ISa-To authorize the payment of pensions to the survivors of two former penitentiary officers at the samne rate
as members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Explanation-The families of two deceased penitentiary officers, who were killed in the faîl of 1978 wbile on duty,
would normably receive pensions at the rates payable
under the Government Employees Compensation Act.
Authority is requested by this Supplementary Estimate to
provide pensions to the survivors at the saine rates which
they would have been paid had the officers been members
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the time of
their deaths. This item is proposed because pensions
payable under the Government Employees Compensation
Act are inadequate to support the famibies of the deceased
officers. Provision bas been made to ensure that double
payment of pensions does flot occur.
Similar provisions were made in 1964-65 (Supplementary
Estimates (A) and (B)), 1975-76 (Supplementary Estimates (A)), and 1978-79 (Supplementary Estimates (A))
for other officers killed while on duty. This item was
incbuded but not approved in 1978-79 (Supplementary
Estimates (B)).

(2010)

The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Motion agreed to.

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
ENERGY
DOMESTIC OIL PRICE-FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL NEGOTIATIONS

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to either the Leader of the Government in the
Senate or the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Now that everyone in Canada knows what the energy package
is going to be, will they now report the facts to this house so
that we too might know?
Senator Flynn: Surely the honourable senator is not suggesting that, unlike the rest of Canadians, he does not read the
newspapers?
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, if the Leader of the
Government and other ministers want this house to be
informed secondhand from newspaper reports, then that is one
way it can be done. But I believe they have a responsibility to
carry messages about government policy directly to this
chamber.
Of course I have read the newspapers, but with the massive
leaks, either inadvertent or deliberate, it seems to me that my
prophecy of a few days ago that they have been almost on the
fringe of misleading this house is increasingly becoming true.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Oison: Because they kept telling us that while the
answers to the questions were designed to lead members of this
house to believe that an agreement was imminent in the next
few days, they then hung their hats on the energy conference
that was held yesterday, suggesting that there would be an
agreement then. But we still do not know anything from what
has been brought into this house. We know what has been
published in the newspapers.
The least they could do is confirm which of those press
reports are accurate. Are we going to have a 30 cents per
gallon excise tax on gasoline, for example? Are we going to
move the equivalent of gas prices, which was 85 per cent of oil
prices, down or up, and so on? There are a number of
questions that have not been answered. The ministers responsible have an obligation to inform this house what the government's policy is, because we certainly do not know it yet-at
least, not from them directly.
Senator Flynn: The honourable senator said that all Canadians knew except the members of this house. I was surprised at
his comment, and that is why I made my earlier reply. If the

80072-22

rest of Canadians know, then I do not see why the honourable
senator should make an exception for those of us in this
chamber.
Following the conference yesterday, the Prime Minister said
that consensus was reached only on the need for oil self-sufficiency and that the other elements of the conference mentioned
by the honourable senator were still the object of negotiation.
It seems to me that the Prime Minister is continuing negotiations, and if an agreement was not reached yesterday it does
not mean one will not be reached in the near future. I suggest
it should be the hope of everyone, as it is the hope of the
government, that there be a negotiated settlement. I do not
think I need to say more than that at this time. The honourable senator has been misinformed by the press report as to the
comments made by the Prime Minister yesterday.
Senator Oison: A supplementary question: Is it government
policy that the price of crude oil ought to rise by $4 per barrel
in 1980, and that the national gas equivalent ought to be
changed to 65 per cent, but move up at the same rate in 1980?
These seem to be well-planned leaks. I want to know what the
government's position is.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, you will recognize
that the price of natural resources is a matter for agreement to
be reached between the Government of Canada and the governments of the producing provinces. If I recall correctly, last
week the honourable senator asked a number of questions in
an effort to elicit from me information as to whether or not
there had been made a preconceived, secret deal of any kind.
At that time I tried to explain the constitutional requirements
of arrangements with regard to the pricing of natural
resources. The conference on Monday was not designed to
reach an agreement on energy prices, because, again, constitutionally, any agreement on energy prices must be arrived at
between the federal government and the producing provinces.
Negotiations to that end are continuing, and we still expect to
reach a negotiated settlement that will be agreeable to the
producing provinces and to the federal government, and that
will be acceptable to all Canadians with regard to the goal of
achieving self-sufficiency by 1990.
In the pricing area a number of formulas have been put on
the table by one party or another, and by the consuming
provinces, for that matter. These are still under active consideration. What we have stated, as a government, and which
is a matter of public policy, is that we want to ensure that this
country is self-sufficient in energy by 1990, so that our citizens, by that time, will no longer be open to the vagaries of
decisions on pricing taken offshore, and so that we will have
our energy destiny in our own hands. That is the policy we are
pursuing.
We have also stated that to achieve that goal of self-sufficiency by 1990, we would have to accommodate an increase in
the price of crude oil in this country, not to world levels but
approaching world levels, and always to remain below the gate
price at Chicago. That is the policy we are pursuing.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, that is a very interesting and perhaps laudable objective. I should not say "perhaps"; it is a very laudable objective. However, we always get
the statement: "This is the policy we are pursuing." Could we,
instead, have some of the details of the policy so that we can
sec how it is going to work out, and so that the members of this
house and the people involved in the industry may make their
assessment of whether or not the methods and procedures
within that policy are going to be capable of reaching the very
laudable objective of self-sufficiency by 1990?
Senator de Cotret: Yes, certainly. We are in the midst of an
important discussion with the producing provinces, as we are
with the consuming provinces, and as soon as we reach a
negotiated agreement, which we feel is imminent, we will put
the full details of the energy policy of this government before
this chamber, as we will before the other place. We will be
happy at that point to answer any questions or give any further
explanations as to how this country is going to reach self-sufficiency by 1990. It is not a question, of course, of whether or
not we will get there; we must get there. We cannot any longer
afford the luxury in this country of being exposed to decisions
taken outside this country-decisions that have an important
impact on the lives of Canadians from coast to coast.

here. I would like the Leader of the Government to take into
consideration that that statement was probably madealthough I was not there-when the Prime Minister asked to
revert to motions, following which members from the opposition parties were given an opportunity to reply. If the Leader
of the Government is going to pursue that course, I would
applaud him for doing so. Perhaps he will also follow the
practice of the other place and make statements of government
policy on motions or through some other device so that we
could make some reply to them.
Senator Flynn: That is a technical problem.
TRANSPORT
DERAILMENT AT MISSISSAUGA-ACTION TO AVOID SIMILAR
OCCURRENCE

[Translation]
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, my question is
directed to the Leader of the Government following the rather
terrible accident that happened in Mississauga. I understand,
of course, that the only thing the government can now do is to
order an investigation to determine the causes of the accident.
However, in the meantime and until the results of that inquiry
are known, what contingency measures does the government
intend to take? Will it use other means of transportation to
ship hazardous products or take precautions that were not
taken up to now?
In any event, I do not want to know the outcome of the
investigation, because you could hardly enlighten me, and I
will have to wait like everyone else. However, in the meantime
I think that the government should take contingency measures,
and I want to know whether this has been done.

Senator Oison: I have a final supplementary. The Leader of
the Government always smiles when I say "final," but I do
mean it. When the details of the negotiations that are now
going on come to fruition-and I hope the minister is right
when he says that it will be later this week or early next
week-is he then going to outline to this chamber and to the
rest of Canada what the program is to be through the eighties
to reach the objective in the nineties, or will we be hearing
only what is going to happen over the first year?
Senator de Cotret: No. I think that is a very pertinent
question. It is our purpose to be able to put, in the energy
sector as in ail sectors that are important to Canadians in the
field of economic development, a long-term plan in focus. We
will be happy at that point to indicate not only what is likely to
happen in 1980 but what is likely to happen down the road, so
that Canadians can make their own plans accordingly. We will
certainly present a comprehensive package of policies that will
not be short-term but long-term and will achieve the goal that
we are pursuing.

Senator Flynn: The question of rerouting such freight trains
so that they by-pass urban centres is now under consideration.
Moreover, as my honourable friend knows, a bill introduced
last year and soon to be tabled, is designed to deal with part of
that problem. I do not think that the condition can be corrected by that piece of legislation alone, but it can surely be partly
solved.
I think that the Department of Transport is now considering
some measures of precaution to prevent the recurrence of such
an unfortunate accident.

Senator Flynn: May I just intervene at this point? The
Prime Minister made a statement yesterday in the House of
Commons, after the conclusion of the First Ministers' Conference, which I thought was available to ail honourable senators.
It consists of a full page of Hansard. I could read it, or, if you
think it is going to be helpful to those senators who do not read
Hansard of the other place, it could be appended to our
Hansard.
Senator Oison: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker and
honourable senators, I think that is a good idea. I do not
assume, though, that because something is said in the other
place that we automatically and instantly know about it

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I have another
question for the government leader about one of the problems
with which I am quite familiar. In many places in Canada, the
railway tracks leave much to be desired. This is not the
government's fault; it is due to the size of our cars. It probably
means that maybe some other means of transportation should
be considered. However, we shall then have to face the problem of trucking which the provinces want to keep under their
jurisdiction and which, under Part III of the Transportation
Act-that has never been enacted anyway-we wanted to put
under federal jurisdiction. Are aIl those means being considered right now?

oil over the next few weeks. What bearing would that have on

ENERGY
PRICE OF DOMESTIC OIL-STATEMENTS BY PREMIER OF
ONTARIO

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I should like to ask a
question of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
What is the minister's response to the serious concerns that
have been expressed by Premier Davis over the weekend
concerning the effects on the economy of moving the price of
domestie oil towards international prices, and the possibility of
thus creating a recession?
Senator de Cotret: I think my response has to be a straightforward oneSenator Lamontagne: Fine.
Senator de Cotret: -as is always the case.
We are conscious of the fact that the types of studies that
were conducted by the Government of Ontario, the impact
studies, require a great number of assumptions, such as, given
that there is going to be an increase in the cost of crude oil,
who will get the benefits of that increase; what will the
recipients of the increase do with the funds available as a
result of this increase that would not have been there otherwise; and how will the offsetting-package, to the extent that
there will be an offsetting-package, work? Those are a great
many assumptions.
I can only tell you that the assumptions that I would make
and my government would make are probably quite different
from those being made by the Government of Ontario, because
the results I look at do not coincide with those of the Government of Ontario.
Senator Bosa: I have a supplementary question. What is the
relationship between the stated government policy of achieving
self-sufficiency--doing that by moving the cost of domestic oil
to world levels-and the cost of production and research?
Senator de Cotret: If I may answer the last part of the
question first, I do not think there is any direct relationship
between the price of petroleum products and the cost of
research. In terms of the cost of production, there is no
question that, to the extent that energy materials are an input
to the process of production, an increase in the price of these
energy products would lead to an increase in the cost of
production. That follows quite directly.
The question that I think has to be then asked is: What
happens with the offsetting revenues that accrue to the economy as a result of the increase in the cost of energy products?
Depending on the answer you can give to that, the overall
results to the economy in terms of inflationary impact, the
impact on the gross national product and the impact on
employment and unemployment, will vary.
Senator Rosa: I have one final supplementary question. Let
us suppose the OPEC countries decide to double the price of

(2030)

Senator de Cotret: I am pleased that the honourable senator
asked that question, because that is the very reason for our
wanting to move to self-sufficiency in energy. We do not want
Canadians to be subjected to price variations that occur as a
result of decisions taken offshore.
In terms of the policy, there would be no impact. What we
are really talking about in terms of the domestic price of crude
is that price that is required to get us to a position of
self-sufficiency by 1990. We want to eliminate for Canadians
that terrible uncertainty that is generated by the fact that we
are at the moment importing a significant amount of offshore
energy resources and are, as a result, subject to pricing decisions that are taken outside the borders of this country.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS

HAITI-DISTURBANCE AT HUMAN RIGHTS MEETING

[Translation]
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of State for CIDA of which I gave him
previous notice.
Last weekend, press reports informed us that during a
conference on human rights held in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, a
brawl occurred between participants and Haitian policemen
and that one or more secretaries of the Canadian embassy in
Port-au-Prince were allegedly molested. Could the minister tell
us what happened and whether the facts have been truthfully
reported. Furthermore, I would like to know whether an
explanation of the incident has been asked of the Government
of Haiti.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, first I would like to
thank Senator Deschatelets for giving me notice of his
question.
On inquiry, I was informed of the following facts: representatives of several countries, namely the United States, West
Germany, Canada and France, as well as representatives of
the Organization of American States had been invited to a
meeting in Port-au-Prince, under the auspices of a Haitian
association, in order to discuss human rights. The meeting had
been under way for only five minutes when people in civilian
clothes, but who could not be identified as civilians or soldiers,
burst into the room, smashed chairs and molested some
embassy personnel, including Canadian staff members. The
Canadians who were molested were the first and second
secretaries.
The Canadian ambassador in Port-au-Prince immediately
sent a note to the Haitian government stating that it was

SENATE DEBATES
deeply moved by this incident that seemed to be a step
backward for human rights which are an important commitment for Canada.
The Canadian ambassador has asked to meet the Haitian
Foreign Affairs Minister to stress the importance that human
rights have for this country and to strongly disapprove of such
incidents. The embassies whose members were involved have
extended vigorous protests through their ambassadors to the
Haitian government which is expected to sec to the protection
of foreign diplomats.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, a supplementary question. If I understand properly, the Canadian government has asked the Haitian government for clarifications
through our embassy in Haiti. Could Senator Asselin inform
us on the answer and on the explanations given by the Haitian
government?
Senator Asselin: Certainly, honourable senators.
[English]
THE ECONOMY
INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of State for Economic Development. Does
the minister interpret the significant increase in unemployment
announced today-the first increase registered since lasi February-as the implementation of a promise made by Prime
Minister Clark in May when he said, and I quote:
But I think that what we can do is to take a significant
cut into the jobless total now and recreate the expectation
that people can find jobs here.
[Translation]
Senator de Cotret: I am glad indeed to answer this question,
especially because in October of this year, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, 49,000 new jobs were created in the Canadian
economy. Considered on an annual basis, this would mean
some 600,000 new jobs per year, something which has rarely
been seen, if ever, in this country.
I should like also to emphasize the fact that in October of
this year, there were 45,000 fewer unemployed than in October 1978. Therefore, I see no discrepancy between the Prime
Minister's statement which you have quoted and the performance of the Canadian economy in October.
Senator Lamontagne: I should like to indicate to the minister that in spite of what he has just said, the seasonally
adjusted rate of unemployment increased in September from
7.1 to 7.4 per cent, which is the first increase since last
February.
[English]
On the same occasion, the former Leader of the Opposition
in the other place-and you have to read what he said before
he became Prime Minister-said, and I quote:
-1 intend to have my economic ministries put together
some recommendations quite early, as to a potential national development policy[Senator Asselin.]

November 13, 1979

Given that statement, I am wondering whether the minister is
now in a position, after more than five months in office, to
announce the promised recommendations designed to prevent
mounting unemployment.
[Translation]
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I think that with a
monthly employment growth rate of 49,000 jobs the Canadian
economy is doing very well.
Then, as you know, Senator Lamontagne-since you know
the statistical data and their spread on a monthly basis-in
October of this year there was a very swift increase in the
participation rate. So if this phenomenon is reversing a trend
which has been established for several months and if this
continues, I maintain, as I always have, unlike the former
government, that if those people wanted to work it is not a
problem but rather an asset which we must develop. It is a
strength we will avail ourselves of, as the Prime Minister has
already announced by setting up a job creation program for
young people, a group which makes up over 50 per cent of the
jobless in Canada. But when we have an economic performance creating 49,000 new jobs within one month it would be
completely unfair to say that the job creation rate is lower
than expected. If that can be achieved every month, I shall
indeed be very pleased.
Senator Lamontagne: As my last question-I must say that
the minister is not really answering my question: when I refer
to an increase in the unemployment rate, he talks about the
increase in the number of jobs-I should still like to know,
since we are heading towards an increasingly higher rate of
unemployment in this country, what he as minister is recommending instead of making speeches on the concensus in the
private sector, between business and labour, what will he be
recommending as concrete steps to get those unemployed back
to work?
Senator de Cotret: As far as concrete steps are concerned, in
the short run, well, the honourable senator will have to wait for
the budget to be brought down by the Minister of Finance.
Considering the longer term, we are now trying to solve the
budgetary problem, the balance of payment problem, the
cyclical problem, and over the still longer term, the problem of
economic structures, to ensure the development of the economic potential of Canada during the 1980s.
I am well aware that the concept of consultation and
consensus with the various economic agents is one which might
seem strange to some people.
Senator Lamontagne: You did not invent it.
Senator de Cotret: No, but as far as you are concerned, you
certainly did not improve on it cither, because obviously it is
now at a rather clementary level, honourable senators. It is a
process that you seem to want to put aside without even
considering it. However, as far as we are concerned, we feel
that it is a very valuable process, an essential process, especially when we look at the opportunities we have over the next 10
years. There will still be certain problems which we will have
to face together instead of having each and every economic

November 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

agent trying to face them separately. So the main goal of the
economic conference scheduled for later this year, or in early
1980, will be precisely to put forward a long term policy, and
to address issues that we will have to consider, as an economic
agent, in the next ten years.

Senator de Cotret: I repeat once again, honourable senators,
that when the number of jobs increases by 49,000 in one
month, I cannot see how such an argument can hold.

Senator Lamontagne: While the minister will be engaged in
arbitration between private business and labour unions in
December, in order to achieve between the two a consensus
that could be implemented and developed in the 1980s, I for
one want to ask him now what he intends to do for the
unemployed.

[English]

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I can only repeat
my answer. The Prime Minister has already announced a job
creation program-I shall tell you about it in a moment-a
job creation program for young Canadians because it is among
them that the majority of the unemployed of our country are
found. More than 50% of ail the jobless in this country belong
to the 15 to 24 years old bracket.
A more thorough and exhaustive study of this problem
would include a consideration of other aspects, such as female
and native people unemployment, as well as the one of middleaged workers who find themselves displaced by technological
changes or by industrial adjustment of one kind or another.
Therefore, instead of trying to deal with the unemployment
issue by resorting short term job creation measures such as
Canada Works, a program which is to be discontinued, an
attempt will be made to deal with unemployment on a structural basis by addressing ourselves to the basic causes of the
problem.
A young man is not unemployed simply because he is young
or only because of economic cycles. He is unemployed also
because he needs a certain knowledge, a certain experience
which he does not have. Programs will be introduced which
will be specifically directed to the roots of that problem. The
Prime Minister spoke about it today in the other place. Other
programs will also be announced in the budget which the
Minister of Finance will table before the end of the year.
Senator Lamontagne: I am repeating myself, honourable
senators, but I rise for the last time. I think the minister
overlooks the tendencies existing in Canada and the workers
laid off in British Columbia and everywhere in the lumber
industry. They are neither young people nor women. They are
senior workers dedicated to their work, to their profession and
they lose their jobs because of the monetary and fiscal policy
of this government.

NATIONAL UNITY

FEDERAL RELATIONS WITH QUEBEC

[Translation]
Senator Rizzuto: Honourable senators, I should like, if I
may, to put a question to the Leader of the Government in the
Senate. According to an article published last weekend in a
weekly, Senator Tremblay is reported to be secretly directing
the flexible strategy of the federal government towards the
Lévesque government in constitutional matters. Also, everything connected with the role of the federal government in the
management of economic matters related to Quebec is reported to have been entrusted to Senator Charbonneau. I would
like to know whether this is true.
If so,
Second,

subjects

I want, first, to congratulate both senators concerned.
I want you to inform us and the house whether from
we may direct our questions on the above-mentioned
to these two senators.

Senator Flynn: There is no question that the present government intends to use the expertise of senators on this side of the
house. There is no doubt about that. But as for putting
questions to them, they are not ministers. You could always
ask their opinion on certain topics during the course of a
debate. But the question in that regard seems to me very naive.
That may be intended, however.
Senator Rizzuto: Honourable senators, I think there is a
press report which says-I do not know whether it is accurate-but it states nevertheless that they have specific responsibilities. I want to know whether this is true or not. I do not
think I am being naive in asking this.
Senator Flynn: I suppose that when you were on the government side you had no responsibilities!
Senator Rizzuto: Well, maybe not everybody can have
responsibilities. But that is not the question, honourable senators. I think the government leader does not understand me at
ail. The question is whether the two senators mentioned in the
press really have the responsibilities mentioned. That is ail.
Senator Flynn: AIl I can say is that they will be consulted
just like other senators on this side of the house. What is
wrong with that?

CROWN CORPORATIONS
VIA RAIL-DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

Senator Riley: Honourable senators, my question is not
long, but I should like to address it to the Minister of State for
Economic Development. In view of the fact that 100 per cent
of the shares of VIA Rail Incorporated are owned by the
Minister of Transport of Canada, is there any substance to the
suggestion that the present government is now prepared to
dispose of those shares to the private sector, as it is prepared to
do in the case of PetroCan, Canadair, de Havilland, Air
Canada and other crown corporations?
At the same time I would like to ask the minister if he is
familiar with the 1978 annual report of VIA Rail Canada
Incorporated?
Senator de Cotret: Well, honourable senators, to answer the
honourable senator's second question first, no, I am not familiar with the 1978 annual report of VIA Rail.
To answer the honourable senator's first question, no, to my
knowledge there is no active discussion at the moment of the
subject of turning over to the private sector the shares or any
part of the shares held by the Minister of State in the name of
Her Majesty the Queen in that corporation.
* (2050)

I would suggest that in our examination of crown corpora-

November 13, 1979

will be happy to inquire into that specific question and inform
the honourable senator whether or not VIA Rail was ever
considered, and, if it was, why the idea did not go any further.
I will inquire as to the current status. To my knowledge there
is no intent at this point of returning any of the shares of VIA
Rail to the private sector.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
SEARCH OF JOURNALIST'S HOME

Senator Buckwold: I have a question for the Leader of the
Government in his capacity as Minister of Justice. Canadians
were astounded, and indeed shocked, to learn that last Thursday morning the home of national defence writer Jo-Ann
Gosselin was visited by a number of RCMP officers in order to
carry out a search for a document, which that journalist
apparently had in her possession, involving the procurement of
fighter planes.
In another but separate incident that day, Dr. Boris
Celovsky was questioned by security staff of Statistics Canada
regarding a letter he had sent to the chief statistician, which
found its way to a prominent Ottawa journalist.
My questions are: Who authorized the raid on Jo-Ann
Gosselin's home'? Did the RCMP agents find what they were
looking for'? Do these incidents represent the policy of the
present government in spite of the stated objective of the
government for openness in the affairs of government? If not,
what steps are being taken to ensure that there will be no more

tions that could be returned to the private sector, there may, at

such incidents in the future?

one point or another, have been an examination of the desirability of taking that kind of action with respect to VIA Rail,
and, for that matter, with respect to a number of other crown
corporations. But to this date the only decisions that have been
made are those that were announced by the President of the
Treasury Board with respect to the crown corporations that
were clearly identified at that time.

Senator Flynn: The honourable senator does not appear to
appreciate the work of the police. I know that there is an
ongoing investigation. Surely, in the midst of an investigation,
the honourable senator is not suggesting that the police should
tell everyone what they are going to do the next day, why they
are doing it, and so on, before a conclusion is reached. If a
decision has to be made with regard to laying charges, it will
be made with the authorization of the Attorney General. At
this time, it is under the responsibility of the RCMP. I suggest
that nothing should be said or discussed publicly until a
decision is made one way or the other.
Senator Buckwold: As a supplementary, does that mean that
the RCMP carries out a raid of this type on ils own volition,
with no instructions from any government department, either
yours or others?
Senator Flynn: It is not my department.
Senator Buckwold: Or others.

Senator Riley: I have a supplementary question for the
Minister of State for Economic Development. Why was VIA
Rail not considered as being one of those crown corporations
that should be "privatized"-the new word that is used-and
the shares sold to the private sector?
Senator de Cotret: I was careful in my reply to point out
that VIA Rail may well have been considered. I shall be happy
to inquire as to the current status and give the honourable
senator a detailed report on the views of the governrment
vis-à-vis VIA Rail. I can only reiterate that the only corporations that are being actively considered as possibilities for
privatizationSenator Lamontagne: Give us the list.
Senator de Cotret: The list was made public about two
months ago. It includes de Havilland and Canadair.
Senator Lamontagne: Is it a new list?
Senator de Cotret: No, it is the same list. To my knowledge,
there have been no additions to or deletions from that list. I
[Senator Flynn.]

Senator Flynn: The RCMP is under the direction of the

Solicitor General. I suggest to the honourable senator that,
contrary to the impression he would leave, there are people in
the RCMP who know what they should or should not doSenator Lamontagne: Not always.
Senator Flynn: Well, well, I would have suspected that my
friend, Senator Lamontagne, would make a comment, because
once again he does not understand.

November 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

The police are not trying to persecute anyone. They have a
duty to perform. It may happen that there is excessive zeal or
error, but generally speaking the honourable senator should at
least take for granted that the police are acting responsibly
and within their responsibilities.
Senator Buckwold: As a supplementary, is the minister
saying that the police may have used excessive zealSenator Flynn: I do not mean in this particular case.
Senator Buckwold: Not in this particular case?
Senator Flynn: I am not speaking of this particular case.
Senator Buckwold: Does the minister feel that it was quite
proper, in the case of a relatively minor document, for the
police to knock on the door of a woman journalist, while her
children were at home, and embarrass her for the sake of what
obviously was a fairly insignificant incident? I still have not
heard the minister's reply to my question as it relates to
openness in government as propounded by his party.
Senator Flynn: I am at a loss to ascertain what the honourable senator is really trying to say. He is assessing the case as
if he knows everything about it. I suggest that he should go to
the RCMP and provide them with the information. That
might be sufficient to settle the matter right there and then.
Senator Frith: I have a supplementary to Senator Buckwold's question.
The Hon. the Speaker: I have already given the floor.
Senator Walker: Sit down.
Senator Frith: I have no need to sit down. The Speaker is
not on his feet. I do not have to sit down, and Senator Walker
cannot make me sit down.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
CIDA-RELATIONS WITH NON-GOVERN MENTAL
ORGAN IZATIONS

[Translation]
Senator Leblanc: Honourable senators, I would like to put a
question to the Minister of State for CIDA, as he seems bored
because nobody is asking him questions tonight.
My question has to do with NGOS non-governmental
organizations. Quoting from a report published in the Citizen
on November 12, on page 7, by André McNichol, which says:
[English]
Since the federal elections of May 22, uncertainty and
confusion have marked Canada's foreign aid policy. Matters are getting worse.
Example: there may or may not be a meeting in Ottawa
December 4 and 5 of major Canadian organizations concerned with our foreign aid. No one seems to know.
[Translation]
So could the minister enlighten us on this problem and say
whether there will be a meeting with NGOS. Also, the policy
which is perhaps not established yet but nevertheless seems

confused according to the article I just read, will be discussed
with those organizations which are indeed very important for
Canada.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, first I must say that I
have not read the article in question. If I had read the article,
perhaps I could give you a more detailed answer but, by and
large, I can say that since I have been Minister of State for
CIDA I have met with non-governmental organizations on two
occasions, and I must add, honourable senators, that they are
very satisfied with the way we treat them.
Senator Leblanc: So, honourable senators, that would mean
the Citizen is wrong about the confusion that seems to exist
within the government since you stated you had met with them
and found them in high spirits and pleased with your policy.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I am not going to
judge the article by that reporter. If those are the conclusions
you draw, that is fine with me.
Senator Leblanc: I did not draw any conclusions. It is the
reporter, the Citizen's reporter, André McNichol, who is drawing conclusions, and I am asking you whether the confusion
really exists or not.
Senator Asselin: I did answer. I said, no, it does not exist.

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
SEARCH OF JOURNALIST'S HOME

Senator Frith: Mr. Speaker, am I given the floor now?
The Hon. the Speaker: I should point out to honourable
senators, as the question seems to have arisen, that rule 26
reads as follows:
When two or more senators rise to speak, the Speaker
shall call upon the senator who in his opinion first rose in
his place; but a motion may be made that any senator who
has risen "be now heard" or "do now speak".
I think a misunderstanding may have arisen over the general
proposition that a senator rising to ask a supplementary will
normally be recognized. It is very difficult for the Chair to
know at any one time whether a senator is rising on a
supplementary question or not. I should point out that there is,
of course, no obligation on the Chair to recognize an unlimited
number of supplementaries. An appeal may be made at any
time by the senator to the Senate, and the Senate will decide
an issue such as this if it arises.
Senator Frith: I have no intention, Mr. Speaker, of suggesting an appeal. I did, however, say that my question was a
supplementary, while my colleague did not say that his was.
We can deal with that at another time, if it arises, of course.
My question is for the Minister of Justice, and is supplementary to the question posed by Senator Buckwold. It is quite
clear that the minister did not answer Senator Buckwold's
questions. He made some references to what would be proper,
and what subjects could or could not be raised with the

SENATE DEBATES

November 13, 1979

RCMP, and what assumptions we should make about the
propriety of the actions of the RC MP, but he did not deal with
the questions put by Senator Buckwold.
Was the minister taking these questions as notice, and will
he answer the questions that were posed by Senator Buckwold,
or should I read them again for him? What he said was not an
answer to Senator Buckwold's questions.

not so much by the government as by the experts who deal
with these matters?
Thirdly, what is the expected cost of development to be
realized to the extent that the country will becone completely
self-sufficient? What percentage of that cost is it expected
might be borne by the private sector, and what percentage by
the public sector?

Senator Flynn: I wouldn't say that. Senator Buckwold
seemed to be satisfied with my answers.

Senator de Cotret:
as notice.

Senator Frith: I am insisting. The questions were as follows:
First, who authorized the raid on the Gosselin home?
Two, did the RCMP agents find what they were looking
for?
Three, do these incidents represent a policy of the present
government in spite of what they have stated?
The only question dealt with at all, and not adequately, was
the third. Is it the case that the Minister of Justice is saying
that it is none of our business-which was the impression I
got-or that he is not going to answer the questions, or that he
is taking them as notice, or that he will try to find out the
information?

Senator Guay: Mr. Speaker, I was going to ask a new
question. It was not supplementary. I will, however, dispense
with it.

Senator Flynn: I know that an investigation was made by
the RCMP. I do not know if they have come to a definite
conclusion.
I will take the questions as notice and will reply to you, but,
as far as I am concerned, it is an on-going investigation. If it is
terminated-and I do not know if it is; I will check on it-I
will ]et you know what the conclusion is, but if it is not
terminated, I do not think it would be proper to comment at
this time.
Senator Frith: If the Minister of Justice is saying that he
will inquire and give his answer after he determines more
about the question, then I accept that.
Senator Flynn: I will do that.
ENERGY
SELF-SUFFICIENCY -RESOURCLS

AND COST OF DEVELOPMENT

Senator Connolly: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of State for Economic Affairs. I may say that
it is not for an immediate answer.
I revert to the question of oil and gas self-sufficiency in this
country. I wonder if, at some appropriate time, the minister
would be able to supply the Senate with projections for the
immediate requirements, if this should be practical and possible, for making the country self-sufficient in oil and gas at this
time, and what the projections are for some reasonable length
of time in the future.
Secondly, I would like to know where it is sought to provide
the resources with which to realize self-sufficiency. For example, will it be from the tar sands, from conventional resources
on land, or from offshore development? Just what is expected,
[Senator Frith.]

I shall be happy to take those questions

Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I thank
my honourable friend for his generosity. I do have a supplementary. It relates to the question asked by Senator Connolly.
I would ask the minister if, in replying to Senator Connolly,
he will be sure to keep in mind the subject of tidal power in
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, honourable senator.
Senator Connolly: As a supplementary to Senator Smith's
question, I should say that I might have enlarged the question
to include energy sources other than petroleum and natural
gas. I think what Senator Smith has put forward is quite an
appropriate matter for consideration, as, indeed, are other
energy sources.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, in answering the
three questions that you have put I will attempt to give you as
early as possible a fairly clear indication of the energy demand
and energy supply situation in this country, but I would like to
indicate at this point that gaining self-sufficiency involves
more than increasing supply. There is also the question of
containing demand. The conservation aspects are, in many
cases, as important as the supply enhancement part of the
program. Every barrel of oil that we conserve is a kind of
on-going renewable resource, if you like, if we do not consume
it this year and we do not consume it next year. Given the fact
that Canada is the second highest consumer of energy in the
world, conservation becomes a key factor in attaining self-sufficiency. I will, however, try to give honourable senators a
breakdown of how we propose to achieve self-sufficiency in the
1980s.

THE BUDGET

DATE OF PRESENTATION

[Translation]
Senator Leblanc: I have a question for the Minister of State
for Economie Development.

SENATE DEBATES

November 13, 1979

He said earlier that the next budget will be very important
to solve the problems of inflation and especially of unemployment. In view of the concerns felt by every Canadian, can the

down? I believe that this is very important for all Canadians.
Senator de Cotret: The budget will be tabled in the near
future.

chairman of the Task Force Review of Petro-Canada, I would
like to say that Mr. McDougall was retained by the government for a period extending 15 working days beyond the date
at which the task force reported.
There is no question of Mr. McDougall being retained to
"sell the report". At the time of his initial commission, it was
felt that it would be in the public interest if he were to be
available for a short period after completion of the report to
respond to requests from groups that he explain its conclusions
to them.

TRANSPORT
HIGHWAY CARRIAGE OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL-SAFETY
REQUIREMENTS

Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I should like to
ask a question of the Leader of the Government. Assuming
that the security for the transportation of nuclear material
comes under federal jurisdiction, and appreciating that it is
carried by trucks travelling along highways which come under
provincial jurisdiction, and that the provincial jurisdictions
have varying safety requirements, and in view of the fact that
there was a highly dangerous radioactive nuclear device which
was lost about a week ago, could the Leader of the Government inform us of the federal government's procedures which
ensure the safe transportation of nuclear material? Could he
also inform the Senate why this material was lost, and what
steps will be taken to ensure that this will not happen again?
Senator Flynn: This is a rather technical question which I
shall have to take as notice.
CROWN CORPORATIONS
DIRECTORS OF VIA RAIL

Senator Muir: My question is directed to the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce who acquits himself so capably in this chamber and outside. My question is supplementary to that of my friend, Senator Riley, and it is with
reference to VIA Rail.
I do not expect the honourable gentleman to have this
information with him tonight, but I was wondering if at some
time in the not-too-distant future he would be able to provide
this chamber with the names of the directors of VIA Rail;
their qualifications; for what period they have been on the
board of VIA Rail; and how they got there.
Senator Buckwold: And how long they are going to stay.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, I will have to take
that question as notice. I try to keep abreast of the directors in
our crown corporations but, unfortunately, I do not have the
list at my disposal. I will get the information forthwith and
table it, hopefully at the next sitting.
PETRO-CANADA-CHAIRMAN OF TASK FORCE

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, in reply to Senator
Goldenberg's question of last week regarding the status of the

NATIONAL DEFENCE
PURCHASE OF NEW FIGHTER AIRCRAFT-DISPUTE BETWEEN
NORTHROP CORPORATION AND McDONNELL DOUGLAS
CORPORATION

Senator Asselin: On November 7, Senator McDonald asked
a question concerning the lawsuit between Northrop and
McDonnell Douglas. In response to the honourable senator's
question, let me first say that the court action in question
involving Northrop Corporation and McDonnell Douglas Corporation is a legal dispute between those two companies, and
to comment on the case itself at this stage would not be proper.
However, I can advise the honourable senator that no
injunction as yet bas been granted and, at this stage, there is
merely an application being filed by Northrop for such an
injunction.
In regard to the second part of the honourable senator's
question, the Minister of National Defence has indicated to
honourable members in the other place that this dispute
between these two corporations should not have a lasting effect
on the government's position in regard to the new fighter
aircraft. Of course, any decision by the government in regard
to the new fighter aircraft will be made only after all aspects
have been carefully considered.
BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Flynn moved the second reading of Bill S-9,
respecting bankruptcy and insolvency.
[Translation]
He said: Honourable senators, I have the honour to move
the second reading of a bill which has been introduced in the
Senate several times. Bill S-9 concerns bankruptcy and insolvency. This is the latest-and I hope it will be the last-of a
series of bills introduced these last few years before the House
of Commons and the Senate.
The original bill, Bill C-60, was introduced in the House of
Commons in May 1975 and died on the order paper because of
the prorogation of Parliament. However, when the bill was
introduced in the house, the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce made a comprehensive review
of its subject matter and published a report in December 1975.

SENATE DEBATES

Bill C-60 was followed by Bill S-11 in 1978 and Bill S-14 in
March 1979. Both bills were considered by the committee, but
each time they died on the order paper before the committee
could complete its work.
The bill aims at repealing the Bankruptcy Act, the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, the Companies' Creditors
Arrangement Act, the sections on insolvency in the Windingup Act and certain sections of various acts concerning insolvency, and to replace them by a completely or relatively new
and comprehensive insolvency system which, while concerning
especially the situation of debtor consumers, also interests
creditors in bankruptcy administration.
This bill is quite thick: it contains 420 clauses and, by its
very nature, is very complex. It is divided into 12 parts, and
even though I do not intend to describe each of them in detail,
I shall take time to mention some of the main policy amendments in the present legislation which can be found in the first
six parts.
* (2120)

[English]
Part I-clauses 2 to 10: This part contains rules for Interpretation and Application and it sets out roughly twice as
many defined terms as the present act with a view to reconciling a number of related civil law and common law concepts,
clarifying a number of ambiguities that exist under present
law, and condensing considerably the text of the bill. The bill
also attempts to simplify and clarify the complicated rules
defining related persons that are contained in the present act.
The bill includes a definition of the concept of "security
interest," which in effect abrogates the title or lien theories
that still exist in a number of Canadian jurisdictions, and
substitutes instead a functional test, similar to that of the
Ontario Personal Property Security Act.
Part Il-clauses Il to 62: This part deals with the Administration and it introduces a number of policies that are reflected
repeatedly throughout the bill. It sets out an administrative
structure that better reflects the real exercise of functions and
permits greater administrative efficiency, particularly by dealing with specific issues, on an exceptions basis wherever possible; for example, by requiring the bankrupt to apply formally
for discharge only where a caveat is filed.
One of the important changes is the possibility of delegating
to a province the administration of consumer-debtor arrangements and bankruptcics?
Part Il sets out rules concerning conflicts of interest and the
bonding of trustees. The conflict rules in effect constitute a
conflict of interest code to govern the qualification and conduct of trustees, inspectors, solicitors and others involved in the
administration of an estate.
With respect to Part III, clauses 63 to 97, the main objective
is to provide overburdened consumer debtors with a reasonable
solution to their financial difficulties.
Only individuals, whether in business or not, whose liabilities do not exceed $20,000 or such greater amount as may be
prescribed, may avail themselves of the arrangement provi[Senator Flynn.]

November 13, 1979

sions of Part III. In the computation of this amount, no
account is taken of debts secured by real property where such
property is the principal residence of the debtor.
Senator Connolly: Is that new?
Senator Flynn: I think so. It does not ring a bell. As far as
the residence is concerned, of course, there is the problem of
secured debts being something else. Reference to the exemption of the principal residence, I think, is a new concept.
Perhaps I may be mistaken, but I do not think so.
The proposed arrangement is sent to the creditors to be
affected by the arrangement, and unless creditors having more
than 50 per cent in value of the claims request a meeting, no
meeting will be held and the arrangement, as formulated, is
deemed to be approved. If a meeting of creditors is requested,
the administrator will call a meeting where the creditors may
accept, reject or amend-with the concurrence of the debtor
and administrator-the proposed arrangement. Unless rejected or amended by a majority of the creditors entitled to vote,
whether or not they are present or represented at the meeting,
the proposed arrangement is deemed to be approved as
formulated.
This streamlined and simplified procedure should facilitate
the administration of consumer debtor arrangements by the
administrator.
[Translation]
Part IV, sections 98 to 133: This part deals with commercial
arrangements. One of the main purposes of Part IV of the bill
is to consolidate in only one piece of legislation the various
mechanisms now scattered in a good number of legal texts. It
should be noted, however, that banks and other financial
institutions such as trust companies and credit unions are not
allowed to propose any arrangement to their creditors. This
prohibition is based on the fact that if the financial situation of
these financial intermediaries is such that they must propose
an arrangement to their creditors, public interest will require
that these institutions cease all financial operations.
Another innovation in this legislation is allowing the court to
submit arrangements to creditors in cases where the liabilities
of the business involved exceed $1 million and when the
survival of this business is deemed to be of public interest, due
allowances being made for the legitimate interests of the
creditors. The Farmer's Creditors Arrangement Act already

provides for this intervention by the court.
In order to have enough time for a more careful study of the
problems and aspects of a proposed arrangement and also
because, in most cases, it is in the general interest to let the
debtor have enough time to prepare a proposed arrangement
with a clear head, he is authorized under the act to file a
notice of intention to file a proposed arrangement. For a period
of 10 days from the date of filing this notice, or for a longer
period as decided by the court, all procedures against the
debtor are suspended.
In sections 134 to 234, which form Part 5 of the Act there
are provisions concerning bankruptcy. This part recommends
entirely new legislation respecting bankruptcy and insolvency

November 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

and consolidates all the dispositions which are now scattered in
quite a number of federal acts and systems.
Furthermore, the proposed changes are numerous and far
reaching and they imply the establishment of a coherent and
comprehensive system adapted to the needs of our time.
Last, the legislation provides that any federal or provincial
agency with regulatory or surveillance powers over the financial situation of a debtor can initiate bankruptcy proceedings
any time if it is deemed necessary for the sake of public
interest.
We should also note that this legislation eliminates the
statutory privileges that gave the government some privilege
on the assets of a debtor without submitting to the registration
rules provided for other creditors. However, nothing prevents
the government, federal or provincial, from availing itself of a
guarantee obtained under the general regulations that are
applicable.
These, under the present legislation, are not included in the
assets of the bankrupt, the disability benefits, property excluded from execution or seizure under the laws of the province in
which they are located and where the bankrupt resides, the
property held by him in trust and the sums payable under a
registered retirement savings plan in accordance with the
Income Tax Act.
The bill also provides certain simplified procedures in the
case of a consumer bankruptcy. Among these simplified procedures, we can note the following: reimbursements of income
tax retained at the source are not vested in the trustee; it is not
necessary to call a meeting of creditors unless the majority
request it; the creditors do not have to produce their claims
when no payment of dividend is provided. These amendments
should speed up the procedure and reduce the costs without
depriving the creditors of their right to control the administration of the bankruptcy.
In the case of an individual, in principle the status of
bankrupt will come to an end six months after the date of the
bankruptcy unless the administrator files a caveat during this
period.
This procedure also applies to the agents and former agents
of the bankrupt.
There are also several other provisions concerning the
administrators and officers of a corporation which I will spare
you.
As for Part VI, which includes clauses 235 to 313, it
contains provisions applicable to Arrangements and Bankruptcy. It amends in many respects the provisions of the present
legislation. This part concerns commercial arrangements and
bankruptcies except in the case of a consumer bankruptcy
where the act goes against the general provisions.
*

(2130)

[English]
Senator Connolly: That is Part VI, is it?
Senator Flynn: Yes, commencing at clause 235 and going
through to clause 317.

311

I also wish to refer to Part VII and Part XII, which concern
such matters as guarantees, societies, insurance companies,
infractions relative to mises sous séquestre-1 do not know
how one would translate that-the powers of the courts, and so
on.
One interesting aspect of this bill is the fact that some of the
dispositions are in italics.
[Translation]
As mentioned by Senator Hayden when lie tabled Bill S-1l
and Bill S-14, predecessor to this legislation, the clauses
involving a parliamentary appropriation are identified so that
they will not be approved by the Senate. The only way to have
this kind of legislation passed by the Senate before the other
place is therefore to print in italics the provisions including the
appropriation of monies, so that these provisions will not be
passed in the Senate.
[English]
Honourable senators, I do not know that I need to go into
further details at this point. I have had prepared for me an
analysis of the proposals contained in the reports of the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on predecessor
bills. This analysis indicates that out of 139 recommendations
of the committee, 129 were accepted-and that speaks well of
the committee and its Chairman, Senator Hayden. The committee, in dealing with the bill now before us, will no doubt
examine the recommendations that were accepted and will
take another look at those few that were rejected to see
whether or not we should insist on their implementation.
The text of this analysis is rather technical and is not
something that I think I should read to honourable senators. If
it is agreed, I should like to have this text printed at this point
in the proceedings.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Trustee Licences
On the matter of trustees licensed under the Act, the
Committee made four (4) recommendations.
The four (4) recommendations were accepted and have
been embodied in Bill S-9.
The most important of these was that an appeal process
be made available directly to the Court for a trustee who
loses his licence.
Section 21 at page 19 of the Bill deals with the cancellation and limitations of trustee licences by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. Subsection 5 of section 21 reads
as follows:
"21(5) A decision of the Superintendent given pursuant
to subsection (4) is deemed to be a decision of a federal
tribunal that may be reviewed and set aside by the
Federal Court pursuant to section 28 of the Federal
Court Act.
This subsection was added as a result of our recommendation and, as may be noted, applies not only to the
cancellation of a licence, but also to situations where the

SENATE DEBATES

November 13, 1979

Superintendent imposes any condition or limitation on a
licence.
Consumer Arrangements
One of the most important features of the Bill is Part
i1 which deals with consumer arrangements. A principal
objective of any insolvency legislation in an economy so
heavily reliant on widespread use of consumer credit,
must be to provide an efficient system that will give relief
to consumers who become victims of the pressures exerted
on them to make extensive use of credit. This system must
avoid, in order to be effective, placing the unfortunate
debtor under the stigma of bankruptcy.
For this reason your Committee when it reviewed Bill
C-60, gave very special attention to Part iii and made
twelve (12) recommendations. Of these, eleven (1l ) are
now incorporated in this new Bill.
Each of the recommendations made are equally important but by way of an example, I will mention recommendation twelve (12) on this Part in our Report, in which we
recommend that al] creditors in a consumer arrangement
be required to file a proof of claim with the administrator.
The change has been incorporated in Section 83 on
page 53 of Bill S-9,
Paragraph 1(a) of which now reads as follows:
"83(1) A creditor is not entitled to receive a dividend in
respect of a claim unless

While 129 of the 139 recommendations of the Committee were accepted, there were some that were not accepted. For example, it was recommended that ah debts
incurred for goods supplied or services rendered for necessities of life should not be discharged.
The Committee considered that the release of such
debts might prevent a person from obtaining credit for
such necessaries in a time of need.
This recommendation is not included in Bill S-9. i
understand that the reasons for not accepting the recommendation are that:
(1) a large portion of many bankrupts' debts would
never be released,
(2) such a provision would engender litigation to determine what is necessary.
(3) much of the rehabilitative effect of a discharge
would be lost if a debtor were left with substantial
debts, and
(4) the recommendation may be viewed as a discrimination against the poor.
Senator Flynn: With that, I commend the bill to honourable
senators. Assuming it receives second reading, I propose to
move that it be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce.
On motion of Senator McDonald, debate adjourned.

(a) a proof of claim in prescribed form is filed with
the administrator and the claim is not disallowed."
Commercial Arrangements
The original Bill C-60 contained in excess of one hundred (100) clauses dealing with Commercial Arrangements. These clauses were carefully reviewed by your
Committee with the result that 26 recommendations were
made.
Bill S-9 embodies ahi but two of these recommendations
which dealt with a considerable range of topics.
For example, we recommended that on the annulment
of a proposal, for the purposes of attacking improper
transactions made by a debtor before the proposals, the
date of the bankruptcy should be deemed to be the date of
the filing of the notice of intention.
Subsection 3 of section 132 of Bill S-9 on page 101
embodies this recommendation.
This is a most significant improvement over the present
law. Frequently, arrangements are made by less-thanhonest debtors to avoid the review by a trustee, if there
were a bankruptcy, of certain improper transactions, and
when the time within which the transactions can be
legally reviewed has elapsed, the debtor defaults on his
arrangement. The new subsection inserted on the recommendation of our Committee will thwart such actions.
Recommendations not incorporated in Bill S-9

FEDERAL DISTRICT COMMISSION BILL

[The Hon. theSpeaker]

SECOND READING-- DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Choquette moved the second reading of Bill S-10, to
confirm the authority of the Federal District Commission to
have acquired certain lands.
He said: Honourable senators, i have the honour this
evening to move the second reading of Bill S-10. This is a short
bill of only one paragraph, but its content is important and its
passage before the end of this year will relieve the government
of the threat of possible legal action.
The bill affirms the acquisition, in 1954, of land in the City
of Hull, Quebec, by the former Federal District Commission.
The acquisition at that time took place notwithstanding the
lack of a prior order in council, as required by the Federal
District Commission.
The land in question was purchased by the Federal District
Commission in 1954 for the sum of $20,000, and the purchase
was made without the prior consent of the Governor in Council, contrary to the Federal District Commission Act. The
value of the land is now estimated at approximately $850,000.
Part of the said land was sold by the National Capital
Commission in 1974 to Canada Cement Lafarge Limited,
which has agreed to sell a portion of the land to Hydro
Quebec. Hydro Quebec, in turn, intends to call for tenders in
December 1979 for a $12 million building by way of a
lease-purchase agreement, with construction to commence in
early 1980. The building will be occupied through the termina-

Novernber 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

tion of existing leases elsewhere. However, Hydro Quebec is
prevented from proceeding further with this project as it has
been advised that there is a flaw in the title acquired by the
Federal District Commission.
When land is purchased, a search is made at the Registry
Office and the vendor must give clear title. On making a
search on behalf of the purchaser in this case, it was discovered that there was a flaw in the title. I am going to explain
how that can be remedied, and I am going to ask that these
remedies be not forced upon the purchasers.
* (2140)

The Department of Justice has advised that though the
FDC's acquisition of this land can legally be defended, the
validity of the acquisition is uncertain and this uncertainty
constitutes a cloud on the title, which must be rernoved before
Hydro Quebec can proceed with tender calls in order to
develop the land.
Before introducing this bill, the Crown was faced with three
alternatives. First, it might have resolved the dispute by
acquiring a new title by agreement from the heirs of the
former owner. However, this would have proved to have been
very expensive and time consuming.
Secondly, the Crown might have expropriated all interests in
the land purchased in 1954 except those subsequently sold by
the NCC. This might also have proved to be very expensive,
however, if the court were to determine that the heirs of the
former owner have rights on the land. In any case, the Crown
would not want to engage in the forcible taking of land from
one person to transfer that property to another person.
The third option, the one chosen by the government, was to
introduce this legislation which would expedite solution of the
problem and would not prejudice any vendor of land to the
Federal District Commission. Moreover, since the FDC was
dissolved in 1958, the legislation would obviously not address
recent and possibly contentious acquisitions.
It is my understanding, honourable senators, that if no steps
are taken to correct title, we have reason to believe that Hydro
Quebec will sue Canada Cement Lafarge Limited which, in
turn, will sue the NCC in warranty as well as for its own
personal damages. The amount involved could be very
substantial.
Finally, Hydro Quebec has now indicated that unless steps
are taken to correct title, it will have no alternative but to look
for another site. If Hydro Quebec has to choose another site
for its project, it appears that it will have to be in some other
municipality. The City of Hull has a very keen interest in the
project going ahead and will be obviously disappointed if it

should be cancelled due to failure on the part of the government to remedy this defect in title.
I would hope, honourable senators, that I have been able to
provide you with a straightforward explanation of the intent of
this bill. I commend it to you for your consideration, and
should it receive second reading I intend to move that it be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs.
[Translation]
Senator Lafond: Honourable senators, I thank and commend Senator Choquette for his explanations.
I cannot ask however for the opportunity to study further a
legislation which is only one paragraph long. Nonetheless,
since this involves something going on in my back yard so to
speak, I would like to get more information before agreeing to
second reading of the bill, and to that end I move the adjournment of the debate.
[En glish]
Senator Riley: Honourable senators, I would like to direct a
question to the Honourable Senator Choquette. I do not have
the bill in front of me, but I am wondering about the deficiencies in the title. Is it proposed by the commission to pay money
into court to cover any possible claims of persons who might be
recognized by the court in respect of deficiencies in titles?
Senator Choquette: I am hardly in a position to give a
definite answer to that question, because I do not know as yet
if there are any other claims. But should this bill not go
through and Hydro Quebec is forced to buy elsewhere, then
money would be deposited in court, but I do not sec that at this
stage. I am not aware that any such proceedings were taken,
but you might get this information in committee if the bill is
read a second time.
On motion of Senator Lafond, debate adjourned.

THE SENATE
CONDUCT OF QUESTION PERIOD-POINT OF ORDER

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, before we proceed with
Presentation of Petitions I would like to raise a point of order
arising from yesterday's proceedings. So that honourable senators may understand the context of this point of order, I must
recall to honourable senators the remarks made by the Speaker on October 18 on the subject of the conduct of the Question
Period. I quote from the Debates of the Senate at page 115.
The Speaker said:
-1 think I should point out at this time, to those who
may not be aware of the situation, that it is a traditional
convention of this place that the Speaker does not normally intervene except to preserve decorum.
Then, a few lines later, he said:
The tradition in the Senate is that senators themselves,
as mature legislators, can decide these things and work
out these problems among themselves.
The next thing I should like to say is that I think all
honourable senators appreciate that in the present chamber
our Speaker has a more difficult role to play than at any prior
time, in that we have three cabinet ministers in the Senate. I
want to make it clear that I am, personally, very grateful-and
I feel that others share this view-to our present Speaker for
trying to handle the question period, in these unique circumstances, in a very effective and orderly way.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Frith: Therefore, I do not want anything I say to be
taken as a criticism of the fact that he is-if you will excuse
this rather pedestrian analogy-very successfully playing the
role of a traffic policeman during Question Period in an
attempt to bring some order to that aspect of our functions
here. He is conducting himself in a way that previously was
not necessary.
Now I should like to refer to page 307 of yesterday's
Debates of the Senate when, after some misunderstanding
about the order of speaking, His Honour the Speaker referred
to rule 26. He explained quite clearly that he had the obligation and duty to attempt to decide who had the floor, subject,
of course, to an appeal by the Senate, as he pointed out, on the
question of whether someone else should be allowed to speak in
spite of whom he had chosen.
So I underline again that everything I say is meant in a
constructive and positive way. However, in reading the

Debates of the Senate today, I find this sentence in His
Honour's intervention at page 307:
I should point out that there is, of course, no obligation on
the Chair to recognize an unlimited number of
supplementaries.
I now ask His Honour the Speaker to give us an assurance
that, in spite of what that says, there is no intention to limit
the number of supplementaries-an inference that I think
might easily be taken from those comments, but which I doubt
very much was the Speaker's intention.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I thank Senator Frith for calling this interesting matter to the attention of
honourable senators. It is quite true, if I may change the
analogy slightly, that the teams in this particular game are
getting a little more confrontational, if I might use that word,
and therefore it seems that from time to time there may be a
requirement for the Chair to intervene, largely to make it clear
that every senator has the right to rise in his place, seek
recognition from the Chair, and a signal, if necessary, to go
ahead. It is quite true that perhaps this has not often been
necessary, largely because there were not a number of senators
either rising at the same time or seeking recognition to rise
subsequently. It is true that there are senators who are able to
be heard more easily than others. There are some quiet voices
here who from time to time seek recognition, and I think it is
my duty to look around and seek the quiet voices and give
them the opportunity to rise. It is not exactly a question of
"nice guys finish last" but there is perhaps an element of that
in any group of experienced legislators.
On the specific point raised by Senator Frith, and it is a very
good point, I did say that there was no obligation on the Chair
to permit an unlimited number of supplementaries. I chose my
words very carefully, that there is no obligation on the Chair.
There is also no obligation on the Chair to limit the number of
supplementaries, other than one of our rules, rule 20(4), which
reads:
(4) A debate is out of order on an oral question, but brief
explanatory remarks may be made by the senator who
asks the question and by the senator who answers it.
Now it seems to me that there are times when an unlimited
number of supplementaries would in effect constitute a debate,
and I have observed amongst honourable senators waiting to
be heard some degree of impatience that too many supplementaries from one senator may have the effect of carrying on a
debate on a particular subject, with the result that other
senators who wish to be heard on that particular oral question
are not being heard. I should point out that it is very difficult
for the Chair at any one time to know whether or not an

SENATE DEBATES
honourable senator is seeking to intervene with a supplementary. Some honourable senators, it is truc, make it very clear.
They may put up their hands or indicate a supplementary, but
other honourable senators assume if I nod to them that they
will be able to rise. They do not indicate immediately whether
it is a supplementary or not. It may be helpful if honourable
senators who wish to intervene with a supplementary would
say so, and certainly in that case it would not be my intention
to attempt to limit supplementaries unless it appeared to me
that I should call attention to the fact that the overuse of
supplementaries could constitute a debate which is contrary to
our rules.
I have said before that it is not my intention to intervene any
more than would seem necessary, and certainly no more than
it is the desire of honourable senators that the Chair should
intervene. I recognize that I have perhaps intervened more
often than was the case in carlier times, but I think honourable
senators will agree that the circumstances arc somewhat different in this new Senate, if I may put it that way, than was
the case in earlier Senates.
I trust that that meets the satisfaction of Senator Frith and
other honourable senators. It is not, I repeat, my intention to
arbitrarily limit the number of supplementaries; in fact it is my
intention as far as possible to recognize the right of any
senator to rise and ask a supplementary question.
I trust that meets the satisfaction of honourable senators.

DEtRAILMENT AT MISSISSAUGA- ACTION TO AVOID SIMIL AR
OCCURRENCE

Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Deputy Leader of the Government. I might explain, first of
all, that I was born and reared in the city of Mississauga, so I
have a special interest in what has happened there lately.
Senator Marchand yesterday asked a question with respect
to action being taken by the government pending receipt of the
report from the Canadian Transport Commission. lowever, I
should like to be a little more specific.
It would appear from newspaper reports that this accident
would not have happened if the program to install sensors for
heat losses had covered this particular railway line. If the
government would take action to expedite that program while
waiting for the report of the Commission of Inquiry, it would
appear to me that that might be helpful.
Has the government any intention of moving in that particular area or is it going to await the report from the Canadian
Transport Commission?
Senator Roblin: I cannot speak from first-hand knowledge
on this point, but I know it was covered yesterday in the other
place by the Minister of Transport. My understanding is that
he expects that there will be a quick inquiry into this matter,
and any problems that may be disclosed as a result of this
inquiry, will be dealt with expeditiously.
Senator Godfrey: To have a tank car of chlorine attached to
a train carrying butane, to a layman, would not appear to be

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

the most sensible way to carry dangerous gases. Again, I trust
that the government will look into that particular matter and
will not await the report of the Canadian Transport
Commission.
Senator Roblin: I can give Senator Godfrey the assurance
that the matter will be looked into on a priority basis.
The minister was in touch with the Canadian Transport
Commission yesterday. I believe this was one of the subjects
discussed. If that is the case, I am sure this matter will be
dealt with on a priority basis.

CROWN CORPORATIONS

OWNERSHIP OF AIR CANADA

[Translation]
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I have already put
several questions on the subject of Air Canada but I have
received only vague answers. I would like the Minister of State
for Economic Development to clarify for honourable senators
and Canadians in general a situation that seems to me to be
extremely ambiguous.
I had an opportunity to listen to part of the speech made on
November 5 by the Minister of Transport who indicated he
intended to sell Air Canada to the private sector.
I now read in yesterday's Le Devoir a report of a speech
made by Air Canada President Claude Taylor. It is in nonambiguous terms:
But, he remarked, the government should continue to
run the corporation for some time still and only gradually
turn the corporation over to the private sector.
So 1 have two questions for the minister. Does the minister
think it is ethically normal for the president of a crown
corporation to make a statement of principle on a matter of
general government policy?
Second, are those only empty words from the head of Air
Canada or is that really based on a government policy?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, once again I think
there is a little tendency to take a few words entirely out of
context.
I read that article in the papers about what Mr. Taylor said.
Mr. Taylor was addressing the issue of what benefits there
would be in selling part of the shares of Air Canada to the
public. He mentioned several benefits that could accrue to the
corporation if part of the shares were sold to the public. Then,
it was following those comments that Mr. Taylor said:
Nevertheless, it is important that the major part of the
shares remain in the hands of the government.
So I do not see any contradiction in that. I do not believe
there is any difficulty for the president of a crown corporation
to discuss the possible benefits of new capital structures in his

corporation on a hypothetical basis. I do not sec any difficulty
with that.
Last week when you asked me a question concerning Air
Canada, you mentioned-as my honourable colleague has so
well stated in answering your question-that the remarks of
Mr. Mazankowski were purely hypothetical. It was not a
matter of privatization or to hand over Air Canada to the
private sector. The minister talked about international lines
and about the possibility of closer co-operation or better
understanding between both corporations.
So, I do not sec any contradiction in the question you asked.
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, if I may, as a
supplementary, I note that the English and French versions say
exactly the same thing, that is the minister stated: I do not
want to sell Air Canada tomorrow morning. Here is what he
said:
a

(1420)

[English]
I feel strongly that the government should retain a large
portion of ownership in Air Canada for some time to
come.
[Translation]
That is the minister's position. The text is right there.
Then[English]
-for some time to come.
If I understand English, that means that the time will have
to come when this crown corporation will have to be ceded to
the private sector. Now, Mr. Taylor just takes exactly the
same idea and says, "Well, it is going to take some time, but it
should be given back to the private sector."
If the minister feels that the president of a crown corporation can decide all by himself to make such a statement, then I
do not understand anything about government any more.
[Translation]
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, once more I must
raise the matter of the exact comments made by Mr. Taylor.
Perhaps you are quoting from another article than the one I
read. I read the remarks of Mr. Taylor and he never spoke of
selling Air Canada to private interests. He mentioned some
advantages that the corporation might enjoy if part of its
shares were held by the public.
Furthermore, if my memory serves me well-I read this
over the weekend since it was published in weekend papers-if
I remember well he mentioned that it would be clearly advantageous if the private sector held minority interests in the
corporation. So there is no contradiction with what the Minister of Transport said.
On the other hand, when we say "for some time to come" it
means that in the near future they do not intend to part with
the majority interest in Air Canada.
Now, if you want to speculate on what will happen within
100 years, I entirely agree. But when they say "for some time

SENATE DEBATES
to corne", they have no intention of doing that. I do not see any
contradiction.
Senator Marchand: A last supplementary, honourable senators, and I continue to quote the President of Air Canada who
said immediately after what I quoted earlier:
On that matter, he suggested to the governmentThe president of a crown corporation suggests something to
the government because he is the one who must make
suggestions.
-to follow the example of Great Britain concerning the
privatization of the British Petroleum Co.
Do not tell me it is not true. It is there. So what do you
want? I am simply saying, first that the president of a crown
corporation has no business to express publicly his views on
that matter.
Senator Flynn: He did that before. He did it in your time.
Senator Marchand: He certainly did not do it when I was
there.
Senator Flynn: You were there, but as soon as you left, he
did it.
Senator de Cotret: I quite agree, honourable senator, that
you read the remarks following those you have quoted, but I
would like you to read the preceding remarks as well since
they are the ones I am referring to where it is clearly stated
that his proposition deals with the minority interest owned by
the Canadian private sector.
I do not have the article, otherwise I would read it. I read it
and I distinctly recall the order of these remarks. There was no
contradiction between the position publicized by Mr. Taylor,
which was his opinion, and the avowed opinion of the Minister
of Transport.
Finally, I would like to say that as a minister of the crown I
am happy to hear the suggestions, recommendations and the
comments made by the corporations' presidents in view of
improving the operation of their businesses.

THE ECONOMY
IRANIAN POLICY CONCERNING ASSETS IN UNITED STATES EFFECT ON EXCHANGE VALUE OF CANADIAN DOLLAR

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I wonder if I could ask
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce a question in
another vein. This arises from the indication yesterday that
Iran is going to move massive amounts of its assets from some
United States banks to other places. Can the minister tell us if
there has been any significant movement of any Iranian assets
that may be held by Canadian banks, wherever they may be in
the world, and, more important, perhaps, whether this is going
to cause any significant amount of Canadian dollars to go on
to the foreign exchange market?
Senator de Cotret: I looked into that very matter this
morning, and I can report that we have no indication at the
present time that the Iranian policy with respect to their
[Senator de Cotret.]

November 14, 1979

deposits in the United States has any carryover to Canada; nor
do we have any indication that the oil situation with respect to
Iran and the United States has any direct carryover to
Canada.
The last part of your question, concerning the potential for
this kind of action to lead to foreign exchange flows is a valid
point, but it is a difficult question to answer. My initial
evaluation is that there would not be appreciable Canadian
capital flows towards the United States as a result of what has
happened to date; but in a rather fragile and volatile international monetary market there is always the possibility of
capital flows moving to offset this kind of thing. Certainly, to
the best of our knowledge, however, at this point in time there
are no direct indications of these kinds of movements as far as
the Canadian economy is concerned.
Senator Oison: A supplementary. I can understand the risk,
or the temptation, I guess might be a better word, of people
moving those dollars in behind the United States prohibition,
or, at least, what they have announced as a partial prohibition;
but I was also interested in whether or not significant or
massive amounts of Canadian money would be put into the
international market for conversion to currencies other than
the United States dollar, such as the German or Swiss
currencies.
Senator de Cotret: That certainly is a situation I would be
happy to report on if there were any developments, but to the
best of my knowledge, no. I do not really see why such a
development would occur at this particular point. It could, but
Icertainly have no indication that it is doing so.
THE BUDGET

Senator Perrault: I have a question for the Leader of the
Government in the Senate. Is the leader able to say when the

the Government to give some guidance to the Senate on this
point?

FAMILY ALLOWANCES

ZIMBABWE-RHODESIA-JOINT COMMONWEALTH GROUP

Senator Perrault: i should like to ask the Leader of the
Government another question. There are reports that the
government plans drastic cutbacks in family allowances which
have caused anxiety in many parts of Canada. I wonder if the
leader is able to make a statement today or perhaps give an
assurance that the present system will be retained and, if so,
for how long.

Senator Macquarrie: i should like to pose a question to the
Leader of the Government. It refers to the recent proposals for
a joint Commonwealth group designed to be useful in bringing
about settlement of the long-standing crisis and tensions in
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. Is the minister in a position to indicate if
Canada's participation has been sought, and can he indicate,
even in general terms, the nature of our response to what
seems to be a highly positive Commonwealth endeavour?
Senator Flynn: I will seek to obtain a reply from the
Secretary of State for External Affairs.

Senator Flynn: I think the Minister of National Health and
Welfare has indicated that there was no question of abolishing
family allowances. He was only looking at several options for
directing those funds to those who are in need.

ENERGY
INDUSTRY
DISCUSSIONS WITH UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT-BRIEF OF
AUTOMOTIVE PARTS MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION OF
CANADA

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In view of the
very important subjects that were going to be discussed with
President Carter during his visit to Ottawa on November 9
and 10, and in view of the high expectations that were created
in interest groups, particularly the automotive parts manufacturers, could the minister inform this house whether he intends
to pursue those discussions by going to Washington or by
inviting his American counterpart to come to Ottawa?
Senator de Cotret: First of all, there were a number of very
important issues on the agenda for the meeting between President Carter and his advisers and Prime Minister Clark and
members of the cabinet. There have been indications by the
Prime Minister that many of these issues will be pursued at
the official level before another meeting between the two heads
of state could be scheduled.
i would have to verify this, but I believe that there are some
ministerial meetings, in which I will participate, scheduled in
Washington for the early or middle part of the month of
January which will give us, at the ministerial level, an opportunity to raise a number of these issues.
Senator Bosa: As a supplementary, does that mean that the
minister is not going to respond to the brief that was presented
to him last month by representatives of the Automotive Parts
Manufacturers' Association until January?
Senator de Cotret: No, honourable senators, I will reply to
the brief in the time period I indicated to the automotive parts
manufacturers. I think most of the items raised in the brief,
and the recommendations in the brief, were not dependent on
discussions with the United States. Some recommended discussions with the U.S., but I can certainly indicate to the
automotive parts manufacturers what stand the government
intends to take in these discussions.

DOMESTIC OIL PRICE-FEDERAL PROVINCIAL NEGOTIATIONS

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I know the Leader of
the Government would be disappointed if I did not ask him,
and thus give him an opportunity to give us a full and
up-to-date report, how the oil price negotiations are
proceeding.
Senator Flynn: I have nothing to add to what I said yesterday. I know that the Prime Minister is in the west talking with
premiers of the producing provinces.
Senator Oison: We have got to read it in the newspapers.
Senator Flynn: If there is something wrong in the newspaper
reports, I will let you know.
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
NATIONAL UNITY-POLICY CONCERNING QUEBEC
REFERENDUM

Senator Manning: I wonder if I might ask the Leader of the
Government a question in connection with a statement in the
Montreal Gazette of Tuesday, November 13, attributed to the
president of the CBC. The article says:
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will remain
neutral in the debate over Quebec's future in confederation, according to CBC President AI Johnson.
Speaking to a Canadian Club luncheon in Montreal
yesterday, Johnson said "It would be a betrayal of our
public trust if we were to use our privileged position ... to
influence the results of the referendum."
My question to the honourable senator is: Is this stance by
the CBC a position that is acceptable to the Government of
Canada? The CBC repeatedly attempts to justify its request
for hundreds of millions of dollars of public revenue on the
grounds that it is a great Canadian institution which strengthens the identity and unity of Canada. It seems to me very
strange that in a matter where the future of Canada as a
nation is at stake, it takes the stance that is outlined by the
president. I am interested whether this is a position that the
government endorses or whether they intend to do something
about it.

Senator Ilaidasz: 1 should like to ask the Nlinister of
Jndustry, Trade and Commerce whether it is the intention of
the government to seli to private interests the aireraft industries Canadair and de Havilland.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, we have made a
deeision in principle, and we have eomimunieated that decision
on numerous oeeasions, beginning with a press release by the
President of the Treasury Board followed by commrents in both
the other place and here, that it is our intent to return both of
these corporations to private interests in this country.
That rernains our policy. The tirning of it is subjeet to the
tabling before cabinet of a comprehensive strategy for the
aerospace sector to ensure that the moves made in the privalIzation are consistent with the long-terni strategy of this governrnent with respect to that sector, and also subject to the
report that will be tabled before cabinet on the specific mecans
and the techniques to be used to return these two corporations
to the private sector.
Senator Haidasz: As a supplernentary, in view of the fact
that it is the intention of thc governrnent to privatize de H-avilland and Canadair, will the goverrnent ensure that no jobs
will bc lost as a result of the sales?
Senator de Cotret: When one has the opportunity to look at
the prospects of both corporations, as 1 have had over the last
several months, there is certainly no reduction in ernploynient
to be foreseen in the years to corne. Both corporations are
doing very well at the moment. They both have sorne highly
successful produets on the assemblv fines. Wc are doing well in
terrns of research and development in these corporations, and
both corporations are doing well as regards their international
positions. Therefore. 1 certainly would not foresce any loss of
ernployrnent opportunities as a result of these corporations
being returned to private hands.

Senator McElnian: flonourable senators, 1 have a supplementary to the question asked by Senator Haidasz and the
answer given to that question with respect to De Havilland and
Canadair. The mninister spoke in glowing ternis of the status of
those crown corporations at the present time, and the high
standard of research and developrnent beîng engaged in by
thcrn, which is quite extraordinary, 1 inight say, in the Canadian picture today.
In the light of that excellent record, and in the light of the
past record of both those companies when they were in private
hands, when their activity in research and developinent was
alinost nil and their achievernent in economie terrns very poor,
would the minister reconsider the policy of privatization? 1 arn
drawing attention to the exceedingly good record of these
corporations today, and their poor record when they were in
private handsl
Senator de Cotret: The short answer to your question is no,
and it is absolutely no, and I should like to cxpand on that
somcewhat because it really cornes from a basic difference
between the honourable senator's perception of governinent
and rny perception of governrnent. 1 do not and cannot Liccept
that goverrnent has and mnust play a role in the production of
executive aircraft. 1 do not think that is a tool of public policy,
and 1 find tl very difficult to understand why the elected
goverinment of the people of Canada would be involved in the
production of' executive aircraft only because it happens to be
a profitable area of activity. If we were to follow that kind of
prineiple of goverrnent, one government really would boy
every profitable corporation in this country, and we would
have out and out socialisrn, against which 1 stand in every way
1 can.

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

I think the honourable senator is suggesting that it was the
mere fact that the government took them over that turned the
corner. That whole industry at that point was having difficulty, and right now we have sitting next door to Canadair and
De Havilland in the Canadian aerospace sector some private
corporations such as Pratt & Whitney that are doing equally
well. They have an excellent R&D record. Pratt & Whitney,
for example, with the PT-6 and PT-7 engines, controls some 70
per cent of the total worldwide market in those engines.
The whole industry has been revitalized. It is a dynamic
sector of our economy now, and the reasons for which the
government intervened six or seven years ago-which may
have been very valid at the time-no longer exist. These
corporations have the financial strength, and the industry has
the long-term prospects of viability, that make it an industry
that no longer needs the kind of transitory assistance the
government provided.
I should just like to remind honourable senators once again
that when the government of the day intervened, it did so very
much with the idea of providing transitory assistance, and not
with the idea of maintaining a forever presence in that industry as the direct owner of those corporations.
Senator McElman: I thank the honourable minister for his
reply and I shall be glad to read his statement again two years
down the road when we again study research and development
in this field.
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
NATIONAL UNITY-POLICY CONCERNING QUEBEC
REFERENDUM

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary for the Leader of the Government to the question put
to him by Senator Manning. When he raises this matter of the
CBC with the Secretary of State, would he be kind enough to
ask the Secretary of State to draw to the attention of the
President of the CBC that the mandate of the CBC by law
includes its contribution to national unity.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I do not think I need to
say that to the minister, and I do not think the minister needs
to be told what he should tell Mr. Johnson. I doubt that Mr.
Johnson would ignore a provision in the Broadcasting Act.
There is no doubt about that.
It may be a question of interpretation, but in any event I will
report your views to the Secretary of State.
Senator McElman: I thank the Leader of the Government in
the Senate, and I would simply like to say that my request is
put forward because of a long-standing study of the CBC, both
the English and French networks, and the lack of contribution
they have made to Canadian unity on so many occasions, even
in the very recent past. I am sure I need not draw the attention
of the Leader of the Government, coming as he does from
Quebec, as I come from New Brunswick, the necessity for
drawing this to his attention on a good many occasions.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Senator Flynn: Again I thank the honourable senator for his
comments. We may be thinking the same thing. I have been
involved with the problem of the CBC for years. In 1959 I was
vice-chairman of a committee of the other place looking into
this. It is no easier today to find solutions to all the difficulties
we have encountered over the years since then. If it had been
easy, I am quite sure the former government, which my friend
supported with all his heart, would probably have found a
solution.
Senator Muir: Honourable senators, my question is to the
Leader of the Government. It is supplementary to the question
posed by Senator Manning, but my dear friend, Senator
McElman, stole part of it. The previous Prime Minister suggested on a number of occasions, and I think with good reason,
that separatists operate within the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. I realize that no member of this chamber has the
right to dictate to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
what it must or must not do-but when the message gets
through to Mr. Al Johnson is he going to be very neutral on
both sides and make sure that the message gets through to
those whom the previous Prime Minister and other important
people in this country have spoken about-those who are
out-and-out separatists within the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation? Will that message get through to Mr. Johnson?
Senator Flynn: I am quite sure that the message has been
relayed to Mr. Johnson on several occasions over the years by
members of this house and by members of the other place. It
may be that Mr. Johnson has been unable to find a way to deal
with this problem. Again, if you have specific suggestions, I
am quite sure the Secretary of State and Mr. Johnson would
be quite happy to receive them.
As a matter of interest, the matter of the operations of the
CBC could be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Transport and Communications. Mr. Johnson could appear,
and you would be in a direct position to discuss this with him.
If you would like that, why not make a motion, which perhaps
would be seconded by Senator McElman.
Senator Muir: I will gladly make a motion that Mr. Johnson
be brought before the committee, and I would hope that my
good friend from New Brunswick would second it.
Senator McElman: As this administration begins to face a
good number of problems, and as it establishes committees to
look into those problems in both the medium term and the
longer term, perhaps the time has arrived when it would
consider-and I put this as a question to the Leader of the
Government in the Senate-establishing a commission or a
committee to have a new look at the CBC and how it is
carrying out its mandate in the special circumstances and the
history which Canada is living today?
Perhaps it might be a good time to have such a commission
established to restudy the role of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation within the whole Canadian picture.

On motion of Senator McDonald, debate adjourned.
BORROWING AUTHORITY BILL, 1979-80
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

On the Order:
Second reading of the Bill C-10, intituled: "An Act to
provide supplementary borrowing authority for the fiscal
year 1979-80".-(HonourableSenator Roblin, P.C.)
Senator McDonald: Stand.
Senator Roblin: I wish to speak to it. 1 appreciate the kind
intentions of Senator McDonald to spare me the obligation of
introducing this bill on second reading today, but in view of its
urgency, I am afraid it is important we go ahead with it as
expeditiously as can be.
Bill C-10 is entitled "An Act to provide supplementary
borrowing authority for the fiscal year 1979-80."
The Hon. the Speaker: Order.
It is moved by the Honourable Senator Roblin P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator Flynn P.C., that this bill be now
read the second time. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators,
to adopt the motion?
Senator Roblin: I suppose my friend's invitation to me to
keep my seat overcame me, Your Honour. I got into the pith
of this matter a little prematurely. I thank you for putting me
right in respect to it.
Honourable senators, to continue what I was about to say
regarding this bill, its title is self-explanatory. However, there
are a few features of it which, perhaps, I should bring to the
attention of the chamber.
This borrowing authority seeks permission to procure $7
billion of new money, which is required for the remainder of
the 1979-80 fiscal year. It provides that these new borrowing
powers will come into force, or be deemed to come into force
on November 1, 1979. To that extent, it is retroactive, and I
should like to deal with that before I am through with the
matter.
It also makes it clear that authority is given to borrow the
moneys required in foreign currencies as well as in Canadian
dollars.
I think members of the Senate will recall that in the last
session the previous administration sought a borrowing authority from Parliament in the amount of $10 billion for the fiscal
period 1979-80 through a clause in an act which we recognize
as Bill C-37, to amend the statute law relating to income tax
for the fiscal period 1979-1980. However, this endeavour died
on the order paper when Parliament was dissolved last March.
The $10 billion then sought from Parliament reflected the
$10,750,000,000 in cash requirements that were estimated to
be needed for the fiscal period 1979-80 at that time. The $7
billion which is shown in this piece of legislation represents a
reduction of some $3 billion from the amount that was previ-

ously requested. The reason why this reduction has become
possible is, I regret to say, not because of any reduction in the
pressure for money insofar as the government is concerned, but
rather because there was lying around in the back-shelves of
the treasury some place unused borrowing authority that had
been carried forward from previous years.
I must say that in iny own past experience I have always
reprobated this kind of thing. I am glad to say that borrowing
authorities will now have a termination date on them, at least
insofar as this bill is concerned. I say that because those
previous powers were not subject to automatic cancellation at
the end of the fiscal year and, therefore, they were used. They
amounted to some $3-plus billion, which is the reason why the
requirement for the rest of the year is shown at $7 billion
rather than the $10 billion originally spoken for some nine
months ago.

e

(1500)

The financial borrowing requirements for fiscal 1979-80, as

I said, were forecast to be about $10 billion, and so far we
have raised about $4.3 billion through the issuing of marketable debt-$l.l billion in treasury bills, and $3.2 billion
through the issue of bonds in the domestic market.
The borrowing authority now requested, along with the
remaining portion of the unused borrowing powers obtained in
previous years and still available, which is rather small, should
be sufficient to complete the financing program for the
remainder of the current fiscal year, as well as providing a
margin for contingencies, should that be required. Standby
lines of credit are certainly a case in point. The debt program
for the rest of the current year that is covered by this piece of
legislation also includes the Canada Savings Bonds moneyraising campaign which is now under way.
Ali outstanding and unused borrowing authority provided by
this new act for fiscal 1979-80, and in respect of which no
action has been taken by the Governor in Council, will be
cancelled on March 31, 1980, pursuant to section 37 of the
Financial Administration Act. I should mention that clause
2(2) of the bill is intended to clarify a point that has been
raised on previous occasions with respect to foreign borrowing.
It makes it perfectly clear that the government may borrow
the money in any currency that is deemed advisable at the
time, and not just in Canadian currency alone, and it will
confirm the authority that is sought in that respect.
Clause 2(3) of the bill states that the new borrowing powers
will come into force, or will be deemed to have come into
force, on November 1, 1979. The purpose of this retroactive
provision is to ensure that the new borrowing authority will be
in force on the date that the new Canada Savings Bonds
campaign began. With respect to Canada Savings Bonds, it
should be mentioned that only the net amount of any increase
in the outstanding debt is charged against a borrowing authority, and the government anticipates that there should be
sufficient authority available in the ordinary way to cover the
sale of the Canada Savings Bonds during the current period.
However, these sales are rather volatile. I wish I could report

SENATE DEBATES
to the chamber how they are going at this time. I imagine it is
rather tough sledding.
As I said, the sales are rather volatile, the margin of error in
predicting net sales is large, and as a consequence it is deemed
advisable to make the borrowing authority of this bill retroactive to cover any slippage that there might be. Of course, in
addition, it gives the government the assurance that it needs
from Parliament that its planned debt program can be met,
and that ail contingencies can be catered to.
That is the substance of the matter that is before us with
respect to the immediate terms of the bill. It is a very small
bill. It only has two clauses. It takes up one page, as honourable senators will have seen. It seems, however, to me, to
epitomize a lot of the financial history of the recent period in
Canadian history. Perhaps it would be useful, in dealing with
the matter-after aIl, $7 billion is no small sum-to attempt to
place in perspective some of the facts of our recent history that
have led to the necessity of requesting a borrowing authority of
this magnitude.
I could point out to the house that in the four years from
fiscal 1970-71 to fiscal 1973-74, a borrowing authority of $3
billion a year was granted. That amounted to $12 billion. In
1974-75 the authority was $5.5 billion. In 1975-76 and 197677 it was $6 billion in each financial year, and the total for the
fiscal period 1977-78 and the current year gives us a borrowing authority of $28 billion.
The result of ail this is quite clear. If you look at the figures
that have been brought down for the period ending March 31,
1979, the debt charges alone that the iovernment of Canada
must bear for that period-and they have not declined since
then, let me tell the chamber-are $8,350 million. That represents practically 16 per cent of the entire budgetary expenditurc of the Dominion of Canada. That, surely, must give us
pause for thought.
At the beginning of the period I have been referring to,
March 31, 1971, the public debt of the nation was $16.5
billion, or $744 for every man-Jack of us, every woman-Jack of
us, every person-Jack of us, who was then around when that
figure was calculated. Today, eight years later, on March 31,
1979, the debt has risen to $51.1 billion, and the pcr capita
debt is $2,175. One can sec from the previous figures I have
given that this is becoming an increase on a geometric ratio,
not an arithmetic one, and it is perfectly clear that the
propelling force behind the situation has been the deficit,
which in the year 1979-80 is expected to be, altogether,
$11,790 million. This rate of growth is obviously difficult, if
not impossible, for this nation to sustain.
The magnitude of the task that the Minister of Finance
faces is certainly apparent to me, and I confess that I await the
budget, which we expect quite soon, with a mixture of apprehension and expectation, coloured by some hope that we will
sec that a term has been put on this exponential expansion of
the debt, and particularly of the deficit; and that while we
continue to ensure that services are supplied to the people of
the country, we will so organize our affairs that we may be
{Senator Roblin.]

November 14, 1979

able to sec a reduction in the deficit in the near future, with
the consequence that we wili be able to sec a reduction in the
demands for borrowing authority.
I am not so bold as to predict that I may not, on some future
occasion, ask this chamber for another large authority to
borrow billions of dollars. It may be $7 billion, or it may be
$10 billion, because the real significance of the spending that
is going on today is that it is a $10 billion line of credit that we
need, rather than a $7 billion one.
I can only hope that I will not be put to that test, because I
find it a very difficult task indeed to recommend to honourable
senators that we should be giving the government this authority to borrow money in our name. I have to say that there is no
other choice before us, and that I sec no change of direction;
but I do cherish the hope that a change of direction there will
be.
It is with that expression of opinion that I recommend this
piece of legislation to the house.
On motion of Senator McDonald, for Senator Langlois,
debate adjourned.
STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF FIRST REPORT OF STANDING
SENATE COMMITTEE -DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the first report of
the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and Orders which
was presented yesterday.
Senator Moîson: Honourable senators, yesterdayThe Hon. the Speaker: Order. Do I understand that the
Honourable Senator Molson has already moved the adoption
of this report? I was in some doubt that he had already donc so
at the last sitting.
Senator Molson: Honourable senators, I move that the first
report of the Standing Senate Committee on Standing Rules
and Orders be now adopted.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Molson, seconded by the Honourable Senator Macdonald, that this report be now adopted. Is it your pleasure,
honourable senators, to adopt the motion?

e

(1510)

Senator Molson: Honourable senators, when this report was
tabled yesterday, I made very little comment on the subject. I
said that I would explain it today. As you know, the amendment that the Rules Committee is putting forward was occasioned by the motion made by Senator Bosa on October 31
last. At page 232 of Debates of the Senate, in the course of
speaking on the subject of the right to abstain from a vote in
the chamber, he is reported as saying, very briefly:
I think those senators who do not share the philosophy of
a government measure which comes before this chamber
ought to have the privilege to remain in their place and
have their presence noted and their abstention also
recorded.

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

When your Rules Committee considered this matter, it felt
that it was anything but an unreasonable suggestion. The
Clerk of the Senate and a Law Clerk were in attendance. They
had done some research into the subject. The Clerk said he
had researched the situation back to the turn of the century.
The practices, customs and rules in various legislatures have
been examined, among them the House of Lords and House of
Commons of the United Kingdom, and the New South Wales,
South Africa, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Quebec assemblies.
There is no hard and fast pattern elsewhere. In a couple of
cases there is a compulsion to vote, but in most cases there is
no compulsion to vote.
In discussing this proposal, your committee came up with a
recommendation which, in terms of rule-changing, is very
slight and rather easy to understand. The rule is changed so
that when the vote is called the Speaker will call for the yeas,
then the nays, and then those who wish to abstain. The vote
will be decided, as in the past, by a majority of yeas or nays.
The senator who does not wish to vote on the question can
simply record his wish to abstain. He remains in the chamber;
he does not have to leave; and that will appear on the record.
As you know, the only way a senator can abstain from
voting today is by leaving the chamber or by following the rule
which we are now amending which states that he shall give his
reasons for not voting. The Speaker shall then ask whether his
reasons are acceptable to the chamber. In fact, rule 49(l)(c)
states:
-a senator who declines to vote shall assign his reasons
therefor, following which the Speaker shall submit to the
Senate the question, "Shall the senator, for the reasons
assigned by him, be excused from voting?", which shall be
decided without debate.
Honourable senators, your committee found that there was
no real background to consider this an essential rule. It found
the suggestion that a senator should be privileged, if he so
wishes, to say be is abstaining from voting to be reasonable.
Therefore, the amendment which I presented yesterday is
recommended to your favourable consideration by the Rules
Committee.
Senator Macquarrie: Honourable
laconicism that I can muster at this
afternoon, I should like to say that I
and that is no exaggeration-about
Chairman of the Rules Committee has

senators, with all the
particular hour of the
am very enthusiasticthe report which the
presented.

1 have been interested in this for a long time because we had
fallen into one of the anachronisms of the very fine British
system, perhaps because the old House of Commons was
supposed to have its initial sittings in the choir loft of St.
Stephen's church where there were only two sides. We also
followed the idea of the alternative government in the confrontational system. It became difficult for Parliament, as legislation became more complex, to have it posited that there were,
in fact, only two sides to the question, and if you did not vote
yes or no, you were in some way diminishing your effectiveness

80072-23

as a member and also diminishing the intellectual content of
your participation.
Other bodies have come to the conclusion that there may be
more than one side to an argument or to a question. This
comes from the fact that often today you have legislation so
complex-I am thinking of omnibus bills-that it is extremely
difficult to know exactly what your final vote should be.
I remember being in the other place and being presented, as
all members were, with a series of amendments to the criminal
code in one piece of legislation. It dealt with four main laws
concerning abortion, capital punishment, homosexuality and
lotteries. Quite a collection. Some members could accept the
part about homosexuality, and some could not accept the part
about lotteries. If an honourable member finds he is in favour
of two propositions and against another two, he can make his
distinction clear when he votes clause by clause, but what does
he do in the final vote?
I have always thought it was demeaning to a member of any
legislative body to suggest that if he does not find it incumbent
upon him to vote yea or nay, that in some way he must explain
himself or, even more demeaning, he must absent himself.
At the United Nations, Canadians are often criticized for
too frequently abstaining. This has been pretty well a general
position of Canada, a charter member of the United Nations.
Unless Canadian delegates to the U.N. can say that the
Canadian government would enact the substance of any resolution to which they give their support, then they cannot
support that resolution in that international chamber. I think
that is a very sound, rational approach. The abstention there
becomes very practical. As honourable senators know, in the
United Nations there is a clear distinction between not voting
and abstaining even though you may be present.
I congratulate Senator Bosa and the committee on this
amendment.
It is often said that this is a chamber which moves very
slowly and quietly and with not much imagination or initiative,
but I believe that when people look carefully at this very small
amendment which is proposed, and give some thought to what
bas been recommended, they will realize that this is a very
important step. It will bring a good deal of meaning to the
voting process. It is not something which is confined to the
present situation-which, I suppose, will only be temporarywhere supporters of the opposition are here in large numbers.
This will be corrected as time goes by. This amendment is
something which will have a great deal of value in the years
ahead.
I support the amendment as strongly as I can, and I
commend and congratulate the chairman and the committee,
of which I am a member.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of this debate.
Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, with the permission of
Senator Frith, I should like to add a few remarks to what has
already been said concerning the report of the committee. I
know that it bas always been the practice in our parliamentary

SENATE DEBATES
system to look to Westminster, the mother of our Parliament,
for precedents. We have done that, and we have seen in the
Standing Orders of the House of Lords that there is no
provision for abstaining from voting. However, I did sorme
research in this area in other jurisdictions, and I want to assure
honourable senators that if we adopt this report, we wili not
really be breaking new ground.
In the Bundesrat there is a provision which reads as foilows0 (1520)
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, i wonder if i could
raise a point of order. i do not wish to interrupt Senator Bosa's
speech, because it is at his initiative that we have this report
now before us, but I should like to clear up one point.
i think Senator Frith moved the adjournment of the debate
to the next sitting, and if Senator Bosa wishes to make his
contribution to the debate on the report now before us, then
perhaps the motion to adjourn the debate should not be taken
into account, and that is perfectly ail right with me, if Senator
Frith is willing to move the adjournment of the debate after
Senator Bosa has finished his speech. But it seems to me that
we are in a state of being not quite in order at the moment.
The Hon. the Speaker: I have not been asked for a ruling,
but i am sure honourable senators would appreciate my pointing out that the question was not put by the Chair because the
motion was not seconded.
Senator Bosa: i thank Senator Oison for his interjection, but
i thought i had Senator Frith's permission to proceed. Was i
correct in assuming that?
Senator Frith: To the extent that my permission is necessary, then my colleague has it.
Senator Bosa: As I was saying, in the Bundesrat they have a
ruling concerning abstentions which is as follows:
-ail deputies leave the Plenary Chamber and enter it
again from the lobby through one of three doors, which
are marked, "Yes", "No" or "Abstention". According to
the door through which he re-enters the Chamber, the
deputy registers his consent, dissent or his abstention from
voting.
I have a standing order from Manuel Des Chambres Fédérales from Switzerland which reads as follows:
[Translation]
The members' votes and abstentions are recorded in the
proceedings. Only those members who immediately
answer at the call of their name are recorded as having
taken part in the vote.
[English]
i am abbreviating somewhat because my pronunciation in
French is not exactly the best.
In the United Nations, as was mentioned by Senator Macquarrie, the standing order is as follows:
The name of each member shall be called in any roll-cal],
and one of its representative shall reply "yes", "no" or
[Senator Bosa.

November 14, 1979

"abstention". The result of the voting shall be inserted in
the record in the English alphabetical order of the names
of the members.
A standing order of the Congress of the United States reads
as follows:
During roll calls, members are required to vote yea or
nay. Members who do not wish to vote may answer
"present."
Another one from the Senate of France is:
[Translation]
Senators who wish to abstain must give a red ballot to the
cierk in the centre of the floor of the Chamber and must
then return to their seat.
[English]
So, honourable senators, there are many precedents in other
legislatures and other jurisdictions for a provision for abstaining from voting, and therefore I want to support Senator
Molson's motion for the adoption of the report of the
committee.

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, i have some appreciation of this move-initiated by Senator Bosa, and then taken
up by the committee which has now come back to the Senate
with a report-to, in fact, change our rules so that it is
permissible for a senator to abstain while he is in the chamber
and without giving an explanation.
i am willing to try that on an experimental basis, but i have
some reservations about whether or not we would fulfil our
obligations as a chamber of the Parliament of Canada if this
were to be abused. I can sec how easily it could evolve into a
kind of a cop-out. We in this chamber, just as the members of
the other place-and in the other chamber they are elected
while we are appointed-are sent here to take under consideration the business of governing Canada and to make decisions.
Sometimes they may be unpopular, but that is of less importance to us, i suggest, than it is to the members of the other
place.
i have been in the position many times where I have had to
make my decision by a recorded vote knowing full well that i
did not have ail the background on everything, because that is
an impossibility. Of necessity, you have to specialize in certain
fields-some do it in transport, some in social policy, some in
legal affairs and others in agriculture, which happened to be
my specialty for three or four years. So i suggest that we could
try this on an experimental basis, but i would be extremely
unhappy if i looked around here when a vote was being taken
and saw a significant number of senators choosing to abstain,
for whatever reason. The fundamental reason, I presume,
would be that they had not made up their minds.
Senator Macquarrie said that he felt uneasy with omnibus
bills, bills that contained a wide variety of subject matter. i
can tell him that I hope that the new government will be as
good as-and perhaps i should even say a little better thanthe previous government in bringing before both houses of
Parliament bills that do not contain matters that philosophically are at different points of the spectrum, if that is the right

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

word. I do not like that type of bill either, and I think that bills
of that type should be discouraged. However, that is not the
same as having an unlimited opportunity to abstain simply
because of what is in a bill. We should probably be doing more
of that if we get bills of this kind from the other place. We
should take them apart and have separate votes on their
different parts. We probably could make some arrangements
to do that.
The government should be discouraged from putting such
things as Senator Macquarrie mentioned in the same bill,
simply because they are all legal matters. That is not a good
reason, in my view. I have been faced with that situation many
times. When we have before us a measure that deals with such
important matters as lotteries, abortion, drugs, and other
subjects that come under the Criminal Code, when we get it
down to a single issue, I do not believe we have the right, if I
may put it that way, to abstain from making a decision. That
is what we are here for. That is what the members of the other
place are there for.
Your decision may be a little unpopular. You may find a
variety of opinions among the people in your constituency. Our
constituencies are not as defined as those of members of the
House of Commons, but mine is southern Alberta. I call
myself the senator from Alberta South, and I know that on
almost any issue that can come up, especially on matters of
social policy, there will be a wide variety of opinion. In no case
can you accurately reflect the opinion of al] the people in your
area or your constituency.

e

(1530)

One cannot accurately reflect the opinion of all the people in
a constituency, but that does not excuse one from being here to
vote. Some decisions must be made. However, I wish to state
that I hope that it can work for some beneficial purposes.
I respect the reasons given by Senator Bosa, in the first
instance, and other reasons given by Senator Molson, why the
committee has come forward with this kind of report. However, I want to put in the caveat that it should be on an
experimental basis only. I am not suggesting that it be put in
for a temporary period in our rule book, or anything like that.
We can change the rules. If i see that it is being used
extensively-and perhaps some people would not regard that
as an abuse-then I serve notice that i would not like that rule
to remain in our rule book. We are appointed to this chamber
to make decisions.
Senator Bosa: Would you permit a question?
Senator Olson: Certainly.
Senator Bosa: Notwithstanding this report, what action do
you propose to take, in the event of a senator's being absent
from the Senate, to compel that senator to express himself on
the issue that is before the house?
Senator Olson: I have had that problem, too. I must say that
I do not like absence from the house any more than I like
abstentions. If a senator is unable to make a decision that he
has a responsibility to make, I do not want to make it easier
for him to evade that responsibility.

If I understand the report, there is another easing off-that
is, you do not even have to explain why you abstained. You can
simply abstain.
There is a description of when there may be abstentions, but
I will not get into that. It does not bother me any less to see
somebody absent himself from the house because he does not
wish to vote with one side or the other.
This brings me back to my point. We can try it for a while,
but if it becomes extensively used and I think it is an abuse
and a neglect of the responsibilities we have in making decisions for and on behalf of the people of Canada, I will ask that
it be removed from the rule book.
On motion of Senator Frith, debate adjourned.
CANADA-UNITED STATES INTER-PARLIAMENTARY
GROUP
TWENTIETH MEETING

Senator Molson rose pursuant to notice of Tuesday, October
16, 1979:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Twentieth Meeting of the Canada-United States InterParliamentary Group, held in Alberta, the Yukon and
Alaska, August 9 to 17, 1979.
He said: Honourable senators, on Wednesday last, November 7, 1979, at my request, the report of the Canadian Section
on the Twentieth Meeting of the Canada-United States InterParliamentary Group was printed as an appendix to Hansard.
The report covers the annual meeting with the delegations
from the United States Senate and House of Representatives.
The meetings are held by rotation in the two countries, and
this year Canada was the host.
You will see in the report the aims of the Canada-United
States Inter-Parliamentary Group, as set out in the terms of
reference, and also the composition of both the Canadian and
American delegations. You will also observe that the discussions with our American friends were broken down and organized into three committees and two plenary sessions.
As in previous years, the subjects covered ranged far and
wide, but one of the reasons for holding the meetings in
Calgary, and traveling through the Yukon and Alaska, was
that energy, it was agreed, was the most important subject for
discussion at this time.
This twentieth meeting took a slightly different form this
year in that after the committee meetings were held in Calgary, delegates and their wives visited Fort McMurray, Whitehorse, Skagway, Anchorage and Prudhoe Bay. The itinerary
had originally included Valdez in Alaska but, unfortunately,
weather prevented a visit there.
Honourable senators, over the years in this chamber I have
been strongly opposed to long descriptions of meetings in
distant places, no matter how enthralling. We call them
"travelogues." In reporting on this year's Canada-United
States meetings, I was going to speak only for four or five
minutes and leave the report to speak for itself. However, these

SENATE DEBATES
annual meetings with our American confreres are too important to our mutual understanding, trade and goodwill to treat
them so lightly. I am, therefore, going to take just a few extra
minutes to explain our activities.
i would ask you to take time to read the report which, as I
have said, appears as an appendix to Hansardof November 7
last. i am going to run over quickly the subjects discussed in
various committees:
Committee I-Trade, Economic and Defence Issues:
1. The Canadian and U.S. economic and monetary
situation
2. GATT and bilateral trade
3. Protectionist trade practices
4. Problems under the Auto Pact
5. Investment Issues
6. Defence Issues
7. Agricultural Issues
Committee Il-Energy Issues:
1. Gas
(a) The Alaska Gas Pipeline
(b) Additional Canadian gas exports to U.S.
2. Oil
(a) Oil supply
(b) U.S. proposals for transportation of Alaskan oil
from Valdez
(c) Strategic petroleum storage
(d) Progress on future technologies
3. Electricity
4. Nuclear issues
5. Energy conservation
The first item, the Alaska gas pipeline, because of its preeminent importance, was discussed in a plenary session rather
than in Committee il.
Committee III-Environmental and Fisheries Issues
1. East coast fisheries and boundaries agreements
2. Fisheries trade
3. Air quality-including acid rain, Cornwall Island,
Atikokan and Poplar River
4. Role of the International Joint Commission
5. The disposal of toxic wastes
6. Great Lakes, including water quality and levels and
extension of the navigation season
7. The Garrison Diversion
8. Seabed mining
9. West coast issues, including Beaufort Sea, Bowhead
Whale, tanker routes, halibut fisheries, the albacore tuna
and salmon negotiations.
It was rather interesting, I might say as an aside, that the
albacore tuna provided the first cause for some disagreement
just a matter of approximately two weeks after our friendly
[Senator Molson.]

November 14, 1979

meeting with the members of the United States Congress. As
you will remember, there was complete disagreement between
Canadian and American authorities over the American fishing
boats' right to pursue the albacore tuna into Canadian waters.
Fortunately, that seems to be settled for the moment by the
albacore tuna themselves, which took off for distant waters.
The second plenary session was devoted to subjects of
general interest to the two delegations, other than the Alaska
gas pipeline. That second plenary session included discussions
on the political situations in both countries.
It is a long report, and I will not tire you by giving you
verbally an analysis which is better donc in the report. i do
want to tell you that quite apart from the meetings being
satisfactory, the first-hand view of the Syncrude operation, of
Great Canadian Oil Sands, the Alyeska pipeline, the Prudhoe
Bay drilling site, the route of a possible Whitehorse-Skagway
pipeline, and also the enormous hydro-electric power development potential of that area-that is, the area between Whitehorse and Skagway-was a valuable education.
* (1540)

At various points we were assisted in understanding some of
the problems by most competent briefings from company
officials. In addition, the delegations gained an impressive view
of Alaska, which in its enormous area contains so much
beauty, so much wild life, and so much resource potential that
it opened up a whole new appreciation of that part of America.
While we missed seeing the terminal facilities for loading
tankers at Valdez, we felt that the awesome development at
Prudhoe Bay was one of the most important sights on our trip.
It is true that the cost overruns on the oil wells, pipeline and
infrastructure making up the project were staggering.
Nonetheless, on the shore of the Beaufort Sea the orderly
layout of wellheads, pump stations, roads and living accommodations present one of the most impressive, and, I could say,
cleanest projects I have ever seen.
The care given the environment has been so well thought out
that one sees caribou all over the tundra area near the pipeline,
sometimes even lying under the pipeline for its shade, and we
were told that 60 caribou had calved within the security fence
of one of the pump stations. This would seem to indicate that
the caribou herds and their migration pattern have not been
seriously affected.
I had not planned to do so, but I cannot refer to Prudhoe
Bay without trying to describe in a very few words this
extraordinary development.
First of all, the shore of the Beaufort Sea is flat. It is so flat
that it is hard to see where the tundra changes to water at
ponds, inlets or the shore. The height of land, I would think, is
probably no higher than 8 feet above sea level. When we were
there it was a hazy day, quite soft, quite lovely, with a
temperature of about 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The scenery
stretched off into the distance without a real beginning or end,
with no horizon.
On this endless landscape there are a few very visible pieces
of man-made construction. There are excellent gravel roads

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

and airstrips, and there are clusters of wellheads which are
boxed in because of the climate, and appear in clusters of
about a dozen. In the distance, they look like beehives. Then
there are the pumping stations which are clean and clear and
practical, surrounded by their security fences. The enormous
construction works and clusters of accommodation buildings in
the two sections administered in the one case by Arco and in
the other by Sohio are also visible, but certainly do not have
the startling effect that one would perhaps expect in a scene
such as that. It is really an engineering miracle.
Last, but certainly not least, there is the pipeline itself.
Some of the pipeline is below ground, and the sections where it
is in permafrost are refrigerated. This is quite an undertaking
when you think of refrigerating the ground for various lengths
of the pipeline, about half of which is buried, but not that
much of which is in permafrost. Above ground the pipeline is
insulated, and it is never straight. It goes in a zigzag line which
is described as "trapezoidal". It is carried on supports which
permit lateral and vertical movement for temperature differences, and even make special allowances, for the possibility of
earthquake in an earthquake fault area.
The detail is quite extraordinary. For example, the supports
going down into the permafrost are filled with a chemical
which vaporizes and then condenses, to prevent thawing of the
permafrost. In addition, these pipe supports hold a plate
covered in teflon, a material which as some of you will know
coats your wife's frying pans in order to prevent things from
sticking. In this case, it lets this enormous pipeline slide
sideways.
Honourable senators, I could tel] you a lot more about the
really fantastic engineering work of this project, but time does
not permit this, and I know that I have said enough to give you
a general picture.
In summary, I believe that our discussions and travels
enabled both groups to have a much better appreciation of the
picture with regard to oil and gas and their transmission, that
on many issues the groups had an opportunity to appreciate
each other's point of view in a way that is simply not possible
in the normal course of our parliamentary lives, and that at
least on the scale of our two delegations, American and
Canadian, warm and friendly relations were furthered. I hope
honourable senators will have time to read the report and
examine its ramifications.
Before concluding I want to express to the Parliamentary
Relations Secretariat, which provided as always a most competent staff under Colonel Bowie, now our Black Rod, a very
sincere word of appreciation for a job very well done. We were
also most ably and thoroughly supported in the committee
work by Mr. Peter Dobell, Mrs. Seaborn and Mr. Miller of the
Parliamentary Centre.
Finally, may I say that it was a privilege to serve as
co-chairman of the Canadian group and to receive the generous courtesy, consideration and support of our own delegation,
leaving me with a feeling of both gratitude and debt.

The Hon. the Speaker: If no other senator wishes to participate, this inquiry is considered as having been debated.
THE ECONOMY
BANNING OF 1.5 LITRE SOFT DRINK BOTTLES-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) rose pursuant
to notice of November 8, 1979:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
adverse effects on the Canadian economy of the banning
of 1.5 litre bottles from the soft drink producers in
Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I beg your indulgence for a
few minutes because I feel it is my duty to protest against a
great injustice committed lately by the government which in
fact, in my opinion, was based on an error due largely to the
news media and lack of information. I would like to say that as
usual my remarks will be brief.
May I be permitted to read part of a letter to the editor of
the Ottawa Journal, which was published on October 16,
1979? The title appearing above the letter is "Too-hasty ban,"
and it reads as follows:
Sirs: On Sept. 23, on the CBC-TV program, "Marketplace", a number of incorrect assertions and false implications were made about Canadian bottlers.
Glass bottles by the billions have served their purpose
well for many years, especially when handled with normal
care.
I want to emphasize "when handled with normal care".
When the federal government over-reacted by banning
the 1.5 litre bottle, it was not aware that it was drastically
reducing $106,000,000 in national sales of that size container, and it had no idea that it was freezing $40,000,000
worth of these bottles and cases in the warehouses of more
than 200 bottlers across Canada.
If my information is right, these figures have now doubled.
Add to this the environmental question of not being
able to use cans, and the fact that each province has its
own different environmental legislation, and you start to
get some idea of the complications introduced by the
too-hasty ban.
"Marketplace" would have you believe that the soft
drink industry has been twiddling its thumbs in technical
development: exactly the opposite is the case. In addition
to continuing research and development by individual
firms, our technical committee has been working hard on
improvements and, incidentally, providing the federal government's safety protection branch with extensive and
wholehearted co-operation from all quarters of the
industry.
* (1550)

Honourable senators, I have no special interest in the soft
drink bottling industry except that I enjoy soft drinks and, as I
said at the beginning, I have a duty to fight for justice.

SENATE DEBATES
We all know that in Canada today we are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to create jobs. The average cost of
creating jobs today is $50,000 per job and, in some cases,
$100,000 per job. We are spending hundreds of millions of
dollars to modernize industries in order to compete in the
world market.
On August 8, without warning and while the inventory was
at its highest-the warehouses were filled to capacity to take
care of the summer season-the minister saw fit to torpedo the
industry. In terms of timing, this decision could not have done
more damage to the economy, the industry, and the labour
force. There is clear evidence that the minister was not aware
of the whole situation and acted hastily under pressure.
Within two weeks of the change in the rules and regulations,
Coca-Cola provided a bottle with a rubber ring that met the
safety requirements of the Hazardous Products Act. Out of
two tests of 100 bottles each, not a single one failed to meet
the new requirements.
I have a number of letters in my possession that are critical
of the minister's decision to change the rules while the game
was being played. The question of why the minister made the
decision at this particular time remains unanswered.
During the week of October 5, 1979, the research branch of
the Library of Parliament embarked upon two surveys at my
request. The findings from those surveys indicate that there
are several thousands of people in the business of bottling soft
drinks across Canada employed by such large companies as
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Orange Crush, Pure Spring, Canada Dry
and 7-Up. There are also many smaller independent companies.
Honourable senators, let me describe to you the effect of the
banning of the 1.5 litre bottles on one of these companies at
their New Brunswick plant. At the time of the banning in
June, this company employed some 130 men. Thirty-two had
to be laid off immediately, with 18 more scheduled to be laid
off in the future.
This same firm invested some $1.25 million on new equipment two years ago in order to produce these 1.5-litre bottles.
They have on floats and ready for market 200,000 bottles in
30,000 plastic cases valued at $8.60 per case, for a total of
$258,000, plus 420,000 empties valued at 40 cents each for a
total of $168,000, al] of which have to go to the dump yard.
They have approximately $20,000 worth of bottles on order in
Montreal which have to be hauled by truck to the dump in
Moncton since they can be of no further use. In all, it would be
fair to say that this parent company has lost approximately $3
million. Honourable senators, this is the effect on only one
small producer.
Let us think for a moment of the effect on large producers
in Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, and right
across Canada to Vancouver. The survey showed that some
400 bottling plants with a capacity of 60,000 to 8 million cases
per year have been affected. This represents several hundred
layoffs and several hundreds of millions of lost dollars.
[Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

November 14, 1979

Assuming that the 1.5 litre bottle was a danger to the
public, this danger was not born overnight, and surely there
must have been a more comprehensive way of liquidating the
stock at hand without ruining many producers.
When we think of the billions of bottles used all over the
world in the last 100 years, we find that, according to the
records available, only one death is attributed to the explosion
of a 1.5-litre bottle. This happened two years ago in a remote
area in Israel when a woman was carrying a bundle containing
one of these heavy bottles and, due to expansion as a result of
the heat from her body, the bottle exploded. The explosion of
the bottle did not kill this lady. The fact that it took the
ambulance over an hour to arrive caused the patient to bleed
to death.
Honourable senators, we do not ban the manufacture of
automobiles, yet we al] know that the automobile has killed
more people than all the wars combined. We do not ban the
production of motorcycles, skidoos, and such other dangerous
vehicles, yet we are all aware of the hundreds of lives they
claim every year, not counting the permanent injuries they
cause. We do not ban the use of gas, natural or propane, yet
we know of the constant danger to the user. We overlook the
hundreds of deaths caused by the use of gas and the millions of
dollars incurred in material loss.
We do not ban lawnmowers, snowblowers, skis, or winter
sports. They are all part of our way of living, yet they take
their toll every year. We overlook the dangers of cigarette
smoking. I could go on and on. No one likes to see someone
being hurt, but I dare Mr. Lawrence to ban from the market
any of those commodities mentioned above.
We do not ban the manufacture of firearms. Instead, we try
to regulate their use, but this takes time; it is not done
overnight as was donc with the regulation concerning the soft
drink bottles.
The business of manufacturing soft drinks is one which must
be handled with planning and care. The producers have to
depend on approximately four months of operation, apart from
the Christmas period, to survive, namely, June, July, August
and September. For most producers the other months are
floating periods where they try to keep their heads above water
in order to keep the working staff, the bank account and other
liabilities in order.
There is no question that this hasty action was due to
pressure from operators of chain stores and supermarketswho have always objected to returnable bottles-and other
interests who manufacture non-returnable plastic or polyester
bottles. I presume the minister was not aware of the fact that
this conflict brought about the non-returnable bottles, until
Environmental Protection and Pollution Control stepped in
because the country was being flooded with non-returnable
bottles. Aside from the millions of bottles going to waste, there
were the millions of dollars going into replacements.

November 14, 1979

APPENDIX
(See p. 323)
LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE CONTAINED IN ITS REPORT
DATED 10 DECEMBER 1975 ON THE STUDY OF BILL C-60, BANKRUPTCY ACT 1975

Terminology
1. We recommend that the Bankruptcy Administrator be
named Bankruptcy Supervisor; this would more closely
describe his role in the bankruptcy and arrangement process.
2. The bill refers to a "Proposal" and is used in the context
of an "offer", which "offer" if accepted becomes an "Arrangement". In our opinion, this is a confusing use of language and
the term "Arrangement" should be used throughout.
3. We recommend that the terms pertaining to arrangements should be abbreviated as follows:
"Arrangement by way of Composition" should be
abbreviated to
"Composition Arrangement";
"Arrangement by way of Extension of Time" should be
abbreviated to
"Extension Arrangement",
and the term "preventive commercial arrangement" should be
deleted as a preventive commercial arrangement only appears
to prevent a bankruptcy.
4. The Bill uses the term "Bankruptcy Order" as opposed to
the terminology under the present Bankruptcy Act of "a
Receiving order in Bankruptcy" which change in terminology
we are in accord with. As to the word "petition" we recommend that the Bill should refer to a "voluntary petition" or an
"involuntary petition" so as to clarify exactly what type of
proceedings have been followed.
5. The "Certificate of Non-Responsibility" should be
changed to "Certificate of Discharge".
Administration
1. The office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy is presently geared to handle "no asset personal bankruptcy" cases
and, accordingly, we concur that their present policy should be
so extended to include all "no asset personal bankruptcy" cases
as we deplore the necessity of honest financial hardship cases
being required to pay a fee in order to go bankrupt and free
themselves of their debts. Private trustees should also be
permitted to handle "no asset bankruptcies".
2. We are in accord with the provision whereby the administrator will administer arrangements for the consumer debtor;
however, the Bill proposes to give creditors very little say in
the administration of consumer and wage-earner debtor
arrangements. We are of the opinion that necessary amend-

ments should be made to the Bill whereby creditors have
substantially more input in arrangements filed with the
administrator.
3. We are of the opinion that the administrator must obtain
input from interested creditors when opposing discharges and
when applying to the court for an order imposing the status of
"deemed bankrupt" and must not be granted the sole right to
act independent of the trustee, the creditors and the inspectors
of a particular file.
Licensing of Trustees

1. It is our opinion that the Minister of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs plays a vital role in the appointments to the
Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy both as an
administrative control and as a cost control and, accordingly, it
is our opinion that these appointments together with the
renewal and issuance of trustee's licences should not be left
solely to the discretion of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.
The procedures now instituted should continue under any
future legislation. We have been advised by representatives of
the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy that under the
present procedure there may be a delay in this area of administration. We, however, do not believe this delay to be of any
great significance.
2. With regard to corporate licensing we recommend that
Section 18(2) be amended to read:
"Every corporation that holds a licence may carry on the
business of a trustee in bankruptcy or as a receiver
throughout Canada and shall not, in respect of its operations as a trustee in bankruptcy or as a receiver, be
construed to be carrying on the business of a trust
company".
3. We recommend that there be an appeal process available
directly to the court for the trustee who loses his license.
4. We recommend that Section 35 be amended to establish a
higher standard of care to be imposed upon interim receivers
and trustees.
Duties and Responsibilitiesof Trustees
1. No application to a court or to the administrator should
be required for a redirection of mail. The trustee without an
order should be entitled to require the post office redirect to
the trustee mail addressed to the bankrupt for a period not
exceeding three months from the date of the bankruptcy. A

November 14, 1979
November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

court order should be required if the trustee wishes the redirection of mail to be extended beyond the three month period.
2. We agree with the recommendation of the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants as it pertains to the realization of assets.
3. We are of the opinion that in a bankruptcy, any surplus
funds should be remitted to the trustee on the file and not to
the administrator and only paid to the debtor if all monies
owing to creditors have been fully discharged.
Interim Receiver
In our opinion an Interim Receiver should be appointed in
the terms and conditions of a proposal as well as during the
Notice of Intention period while the proposal is being
formulated.
Investigation by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy
1. We concur with the extension of the investigatory powers
of the Superintendent to include any offence committed in
connection with proceedings initiated under the Bill whether or
not the proceedings had in fact been commenced when the
offence was committed.
2. Where information relating to the dealings and transactions of a person under investigation by the Superintendent is
maintained in a permanent master file together with information relating to other parties, the Superintendant shall only be
entitled to production of the source documents and the transcription of the data of such person stored in the permanent
master file. The Superintendent shall not be entitled to remove
from its usual location the permanent master file.
Conflict of Interest
1. We agree with the recommendation of the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants that the foregoing should
be incorporate into the new Bankruptcy Act in substitution for
Section 30.
2. We are concerned with the strict codification of the
definition of the meaning of a conflict of interest within the
statute and accordingly are of the opinion that the question of
conflict of interest should be dealt with under the rules of
conflict of the respective professional bodies.
3. Consideration should also be given to formulating amendments to the Bill whereby trustees may act in two or more
estates which are related, particularly where we are dealing
with parent, subsidiary, associated and, related companies, and
husband and wife.
4. A solicitor who has acted for a debtor in a particular
matter should be entitled to continue to act in that matter if
the trustee and the inspectors are of the opinion that it would
be beneficial to the bankrupt estate. This would permit the
estate to take advantage of the knowledge of the matter
acquired by the solicitor.

80072-24

Arrangementsfor the Consumer Debtor
1. A debtor entitled to make a consumer arrangement
should not include a debtor with liabilities in excess of twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000) or such other amount as may be
prescribed excluding any debt secured by real property. Using
the total amount of the liabilities of the debtor gives the most
precise method of determining which debtor is entitled to
make a consumer arrangement as opposed to a commercial
arrangement.
2. The terms "extension arrangement" and "composition
arrangement" should be defined in order to avoid any doubt as
to the meaning of the terms.
3. The period of time which may elapse between the filing of
a request for a proposal and the filing of a proposal or the
rejection of the request should be limited to ten days.
4. A creditor whose debt is secured by real property should
be required by the administrator to value his security. The
difference between the debt and the value of the security
should constitute a claim admissible in an arrangement. If a
creditor does not value his security he shall be deemed to be
fully secured.
5. Proceedings by all creditors to exercise a remedy against
the debtor or his property should be stayed by the filing of a
request for a proposal, save and except proceedings by a
creditor to realize upon real property of the debtor subject to
his security.
6. A creditor should be given the right to vote by voting
letter on both an extension arrangement and composition
arrangement. If a majority of the creditors do not approve an
extension arrangement it should be held to be rejected. An
extension arrangement is an offer of payment to the creditors
which permits the debtor to continue using his assets. This
privilege should only be accorded to a debtor if his creditors
consent thereto.
7. Voting by creditors should be simplified by basing a
creditor's votes on the dollar value of his claim.
8. Secured creditors whose claims are admissible in an
arrangement should be given the right to realize upon property
of the debtor subject to their security if there is one month's
default in the performance by the debtor of his obligations
under an arrangement.
9. An arrangement should be annulled if there is three
months default in an arrangement, whether consecutive or not,
unless such default is waived by the administrator.
10. If a proposal is annulled the debtor should be deemed to
be automatically bankrupt. This would avoid any harassment
of the debtor by his creditors and the administrative cost of
separate bankruptcy proceedings. Any money deposited with
an administrator on hand when an arrangement is annulled
should be paid to the creditors of the debtor by the trustee in
bankruptcy of the debtor. For ease of administrative conveni-

SENATE DEBATES

ence the administrator should act as trustee in bankruptcy
where a consumer arrangement has been annulled.
I1. The creditor should not be required to pay a fee to the
administrator on any reasonable request by him for information concerning an arrangement and the performance by the
debtor of his obligations thereunder.
12. Creditors should be required to file claims with the
administrator. The provisions in the Bill waiving such a filing
if the debt is acknowledged by the administrator could lead to
serious abuse by collusion between the debtor and a creditor.
Commercial Arrangements
The only term which should be used under part IV of Bill
C-60 is the term "commercial arrangement". It should have a
meaning equivalent to the meaning of "proposal" under the
present Bankruptcy Act. The use of the adjective "commercial" will enable the proceeding to be distinguished from an
arrangement by a consumer debtor.
Who is Affected by an Arrangement

1.Section 91(2) of Bill C-60 should be amended in order to
provide that a creditor is deemed to be affected by an arrangement only if his claim or any part thereof, is materially or
adversely affected by the arrangement.
2. Recognition should be given to the fact that one creditor
with several classes of claims may be affected by an arrangement in respect of one class of claim and may not be affected
by an arrangement in respect of another class of claim.
3. Section 91(3) of Bill C-60 should permit the court to
determine to what extent a creditor may be affected by an
arrangement.
Who may Make a Commercial Arrangement
1. The provisions of Bill C-60 which allow persons other
than the debtor to make a commercial arrangement for the
debtor will only be viable if powers are given to such parties to
control the property and affairs of the debtor.
2. If a commercial arrangement is made on behalf of the
debtor by someone else pursuant to the provisions of Section
93(3) of Bill C-60:
(a) if the debtor is a corporation the trustee named in the
commercial arrangement should be entitled to vote the
shares of the corporation at all meetings of creditors of
the corporation held during the period in which the
arrangement is outstanding. Thus the trustee would be
entitled to elect the board of directors of the corporation.
(b) if the debtor is an individual the trustee named in the
commercial arrangement should be appointed attorney for
the debtor with complete powers to manage the business
affairs of the debtor and to control the non-exempt property of the debtor during the period in which the arrangement is outstanding.

November 14, 1979

Notice of Intention

1. Section 94(2) should be amended to provide that where a
notice of intention has been filed with respect to a debtor no
creditor of the debtor may exercise a remedy against the
debtor or his property or institute or continue a proceeding for
the recovery of a claim without leave of the court.
2. The debtor must obtain leave of the court to file a notice
of intention to make a commercial arrangement and such leave
should not be granted unless a licensed trustee is appointed
interim receiver of the property and assets of the debtor.
3. Immediately after the filing of a proposal, the trustee
named in the proposal should be appointed interim receiver of
the property of the debtor with such powers as may be set out
in the proposal or as the court may determine.
4. The court could authorize the interim receiver to perform
one or more of the following functions depending upon the
circumstances:
(i) to take possession of the property and assets of the
debtor;
(ii) to control the receipts and disbursements of the
debtor;
(iii) to manage the business of the debtor;
(iv) to inspect the books and records of the debtor;
(v) to make an inventory of the property and assets of the
debtor;
(vi) to borrow for the purpose of financing the business of
the debtor and to pledge the assets of the debtor as
security for such loans;
(vii) to receive daily the cash receipts of the business of
the debtor and to control the disbursements of the debtor.
5. The trustee named in the notice of intention or in the
proposal should be required to stipulate which of the above
mentioned powers would provide the creditors with sufficient
protection without undue expense.
Acceptance by Creditors

1. Acceptance of a commercial arrangement by any class or
sub-class of creditors should require an affirmative vote equal
to 60% of the votes cast.
2. If one class or sub-class of creditors does not vote in
favour of acceptance of a proposal the proposal should be held
to be not to have been accepted by the creditors.
Definition of Classes of Creditors
1. Unsecured creditors whose claims rank on the same level
in the order of priority set out in Section 254 of Bill C-60
should constitute a separate class.
2. Secured creditors whose claims are payable out of the
same property pro rata on an equal basis should constitute a
separate class.

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

3. For the purposes of a commercial arrangement, a class of
creditors may be divided into a sub-class based on the amount
of the claim or the type of claim or creditor.
4. A commercial arrangement may stipulate that the classes
and sub-classes of creditors may be affected differently.
Chairmanof Meeting of Creditors
Bill C-60 should retain Section 279 (1) which stipulates that
at every meeting of creditors, the administrator or his
nominee, shall act as chairman.
Voting
1. The right of a creditor to vote by voting letter on a
commercial arrangement should be retained.
2. The trustee should be required to mail a voting letter to
each creditor with the notice of the meeting of creditors.
Inspectors
1. At the first meeting of creditors held to consider the
terms of a commercial arrangement, the creditors shall be
entitled to elect inspectors for the purpose of advising the
trustee acting in the commercial arrangement.
2. The inspectors should be entitled to all the powers of
inspectors in a bankruptcy insofar as they may be applicable to
the commercial arrangement unless such powers are restricted
or enlarged by the terms of the commercial arrangement.
Effect on Security Agreement
Notwithstanding the terms of a security agreement, the
court should be granted the power to determine whether the
filing of a proposal should accelerate repayment of a loan or
constitute default under the terms of a security agreement.
This would be very desirable if the constitutional problems
created could be resolved.
Amendment to Commercial Arrangements
Specific references in Bill C-60 should deal with the right to
amend a commercial arrangement and the problems arising
from an amendment. Such provisions should include the
following:
(a) If a proposal is amended prior to the mailing of
notices of the first meeting of creditors, only the amended
proposal should be mailed to the creditors.
(b) An amended proposal, whether amended before or
after the meeting of creditors, or before or after the
approval of the proposal by the Court, should be deemed
to have taken effect as of the date of the filing of the
original proposal. This result would contrast with the
consequence of a second proposal being filed by the
debtor. A second proposal would only take effect as of the
date it was filed.

(c) A proposal may be amended and voted upon at a
meeting of creditors without further notice to the creditors if the amended proposal provides all the creditors
affected by it with benefits equal to or better than those
provided by the original proposal.
Default in Performanceof Terms of Commercial
Arrangements
For the purpose of attacking improper transactions such as
fraudulent preferences after the proposal has been annulled,
the date of bankruptcy should be deemed to be the date of the
filing of the notice of intention or of the proposal.
Priorityof Wage Earners
It is the opinion of your Committee that the provisions of
Bill C-60 providing that a claim for wages up to $2,000.00 has
priority over all other secured creditors should be struck out.
Consideration should be given to the creation of a government
administered fund under the authority of the Bankruptcy Act
out of which unpaid wages of employees could be paid forthwith upon the bankruptcy. The claim for unpaid wages would
cover wages in arrears to a limit of $2,000.00 and should not
include vacation pay, severance pay and fringe benefits. Contributions to this fund could be received from employers and
employees. The trustee in bankruptcy would ascertain complete details of the unpaid wages, provide the necessary information to the officials administering the fund and distribute
the payments to the unpaid employees. The fund could be
subrogated to the rights of the employees and rank as an
unsecured creditor in the distribution of the assets of the
bankrupt.
The representatives of the Department of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs who appeared before us estimated that the
annual amount to be disbursed by such a fund throughout
Canada would not likely exceed $4,000,000.00 if severance
pay is not included. Since there are over 9,000,000 employees
in the work force in Canada, the amount of each contribution
would be relatively modest.
The representatives of the Department who appeared before
us stated that a fund of the nature contemplated would provide
the employees with the best possible protection. The creation
of an insurance fund would assure payment of wages in arrears
to a maximum of $2,000.00 whereas the method of priority
proposed under the Bill gives no such assurance.
Stay of Proceedings
All creditors should be permitted to take any steps necessary
to perfect their security such as registration or giving notice to
third parties, notwithstanding the fact that bankruptcy proceedings have been commenced. This does not mean that there
would be no restrictions with respect to their realization upon
the assets of the debtor subject to their security.

SENATE DEBATES

Realization by Secured Creditors

1.The stay of proceedings imposed upon the realization by a
secured creditor should be modified. If permitted by the
security instrument, the secured creditor should be allowed to
take possession of the property of the bankrupt subject to his
security, to carry on the business of the bankrupt and to collect
the accounts receivable of the bankrupt. Upon the making of a
bankruptcy order, the right of the secured creditor to realize or
sell the property of the bankrupt out of the ordinary course of
business should be stayed for ten days from the date the
secured creditor files with the trustee a proof of claim setting
out the following information if applicable or for ten days after
the first meeting of creditors, whichever is the later:
(a) The total balance owing;
(b) The amount of any payments in arrears;
(c) The security agreement;
(d) The court order appointing a receiver;
(e) The instrument appointing an agent or receiver;
(f) All acts taken to date and expenses incurred;
(g) The method of sale proposed by the secured creditor;
(h) An estimate of the value of the property;
(i) Details of the property in the possession of the secured
creditor.
2. Such a proof of claim should be filed by the secured
creditor with the trustee within ten days after receiving a
notice from the trustee requiring the same. If the secured
creditor does not file such a claim, the secured creditor should
bc required to deliver all the property of the bankrupt in his
possession to the trustee.
3. Upon the filing of the notice of an intention to make a
proposal, a proposal or a petition for a bankruptcy order, any
party, including an interim receiver, should be entitled to apply
to the court for a stay of the proceedings by a secured creditor.
Such an order should only be granted if the postponement does
not cause hardship to the secured creditor and no payment of
principal or interest is delayed for more than six months. A
similar power is given to the trustee in bankruptcy in Section
242(l).
4. In addition, the court should be given the power to control
the method of realization by a secured creditor and the costs
incurred in the realization. The costs and expenses of realization by a secured creditor should be subject to taxation by the
court. The secured creditor should be required to pay to the
trustee any surplus remaining within fifteen days after the
accounts have been taxed.
In these recommendations, your Committee has attempted
to maintain an even balance between the right of a secured
creditor to realize upon the assets covered by the security
agreement for which he bargained when he loaned the money
to the bankrupt and the need of the trustee in bankruptcy to
have a reasonable time to assess the situation in order to
obtain the maximum recovery for unsecured creditors.

November 14, 1979

Exempt Property
1. Property that does not vest in the trustee for distribution
among the creditors of the bankrupt should include all property which is exempt from seizure under federal and provincial
law.
2. No maximum limit should be imposed upon the value of
such exempt property.
3. Uniformity of exemption across the country is not
necessary.
Unenforceabilityand Review of Transfers
The definition of "insolvent" should be enlarged to read as
follows:
"A person is insolvent if:
(a) a fair realizable value of his property would be
insufficient to pay all his certain and liquidated debts
whether due or not, or
(b) if he is unable to pay all his debts which are certain,
liquidated and payable, or
(c) if he has ceased to pay his debts generally as they
become due."
Definition of Gift
The definition should be changed to read:
"(b) a gratuitous designation of a bencficiary under an
insurance contract."
Use of Terni Unenforceable
The word "invalid" should be substituted for the word
"unenforceable". It should also be used in Section 155(5) of
Bill C-60 which uses the term "void" with a relation to
reviewable transactions.
Right of Trustee to Relv on Provincial Legislation Avoiding
Transactions
A specific section should be included in Bill C-60 to provide
that a trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to rely on provincial
legislation to set aside fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent
preferences and any other transactions which are invalid as
against creditors under provincial law. Creditors are entitled to
the maximum amount of protection available.
Security for Pre-ExistingDebt
Section 161(1) should be deleted since the provisions relating to the avoidance of fraudulent preferences are sufficient to
protect creditors.
Validity of Assignments of Book Debts and Other Security
Instruments
1. Section 166(1) of Bill C-60 should be deleted. The
present Bankruptcy Act and Bill C-60 do not require registra-

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

tion of debentures, chattel mortgages or conditional sale contracts. The validity of these security agreements depends on
provincial law. There is no logical reason for the treating
assignments of book debts any differently.
2. Section 169 should be varied by deleting the words "third
parties" and inserting in their place the words "a trustee in
bankruptcy of the transferor".
Rights of Trustee if Transfer Unenforceable
1. Subject to recommendation 2, if a transfer is unenforceable as against the trustee, the trustee should be entitled to
recover the property or the value thereof or the money or
proceeds therefrom from the person who acquired the property
from the bankrupt or from any other person to whom the
original transferee may have resold or paid over the proceeds
of the property.
2. If the subsequent transferee of the property has paid or
given adequate valuable consideration for the property in good
faith, a trustee should not be entitled to have recourse against
him but should only be entitled to have recourse against the
original transferee of the property for recovery of the consideration paid or the value thereof.
3. Where the consideration payable for or upon any sale or
resale of such property or any part thereof remains unsatisfied
the trustee should be subrogated to the rights of the vendor to
compel payment of the amount unpaid.
4. The provisions of Section 161(2) of Bill C-60 should be
deleted.
Treatment of Non-Arm's Length Creditors
1. Your Committee is in agrement with the provisions of Bill
C-60 which provide that preferential transfers within longer
periods prior to the date of bankruptcy may be attacked by the
trustee but it is not in agreement with the introduction of the
new untested terms and concepts.
2. A transfer that is a preference should only be set aside if
it is proven that the transfer was made with the intent of the
debtor to prefer the creditor.
3. A transfer that is preference in favour of a creditor with
whom the debtor was dealing at arm's length should be invalid
against the trustee where the transfer is made:
(a) when the debtor is insolvent,
(b) less than six months before filing of a bankruptcy
petition, and
(c) the debtor intended to give the creditor a preference.
The presumption contained in the present Bankruptcy Act that
if such a transfer took place less than three months before the
filing of a petition, the transfer was made by the debtor with
the intent to prefer the arm's length creditor should be deleted.
4. A transfer that is a preference in favour of a creditor with
whom the debtor was not at arm's length should be invalid as
against the trustee where the transfer is made:

(a) when the debtor is insolvent, and
(b) the debtor intended to prefer the creditor.
If such a transfer took place less than twelve months before
the filing of a bankruptcy petition, there should be presumption that the transfer was made by the debtor with the intent
to prefer the creditor and the onus should be placed upon the
creditor to rebut that presumption.
5. In addition, if the preferential transfer was made to
non-arm's length creditor within one month prior to the filing
of the bankruptcy petition, it should only be upheld if the
consideration therefor was given within thirty days prior to the
date of the transfer.
Effect of Insolvency Clauses in Leases

1. The rights given to a trustee in bankruptcy of a tenant by
Section 183 of Bill C-60 are desirable but that section should
specifically state that such rights may be exercised by a trustee
notwithstanding any term or stipulation in the lease to the
contrary.
2. Bill C-60 should include a provision that a debtor who has
filed a commercial arrangement shall be entitled to retain the
leased premises for the balance of the unexpired term of the
lease notwithstanding any provision in the lease which gives
the lessor the right to terminate it as a result of the filing of a
commercial arrangement. Of course, the debtor must observe
the other terms and conditions of the lease.
3. A similar provision should apply to leases of chattels.
Preferred Claim of Landlord
1. Section 183(13) which gives a landlord an unsecured
claim for damages as a result of the disclaimer of the lease by
the trustee should be deleted.
2. The right of a landlord to a preferred claim for three
months accelerated rent should be continued.
3. Any payment made by the trustee on account of occupation rent should be credited against the claim of the landlord
for accelerated rent.
4. A landlord should not be entitled to rank as a secured
creditor for rent in the event of the bankruptcy of a tenant.
This is the law in certain of the provinces at the present time.
It is desirable to have uniformity in respect of this matter
throughout the country.
Inquiries by the Administrator
We recommend that the Bill be amended to provide for
input into the investigation by the administrator by interested
parties such as creditors, inspectors and the Trustee; and that
prior to the administrator's report being filed a summary
procedure be established for a reply to the report by the
Trustee, the bankrupt and/or his agents.

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Liability for Deficiency in Bankrupt Estate

1. The phrase "in his own interest" should be clarified in
order to establish that it does not include any benefit enjoyed
by the agent and others in their capacity as shareholders of the
company.
2. The words "other than the corporation" should be inserted after the words "or the interest of someone related to him"
in order to clarify the fact that the person related to the agent
must be someone other than the corporation.
3. Sub-section 1(a), (b), (c) and (d) of Section 176 should
use similar language. We would recommend that Section
176(1 )(a) read as follows:
"to carry on business in a manner that, at the time, would
not have reasonably been considered to be in the interests
of the person."
Sub-section (b) would read:
"to enter into a transaction that, at the time of the
transaction, would not have reasonably been considered to
be in the interests of the person."
Sub-section (c) would read as follows:
"to refrain from carrying on business in a manner that, at
the time, would reasonably be considered to be in the
interests of the person."
Sub-section (d) would remain the same.
Inposing the Status oja Bankrupt
1. The concept of deeming an officer or director of a
bankrupt corporation to be a bankrupt should be deleted.
2. An officer or director of a bankrupt corporation who has
been guilty of culpable conduct with respect to the affairs of
the bankrupt corporation should have sanctions imposed upon
him similar to those sanctions which may be imposed on an
individual bankrupt who is guilty of improper conduct.
3. The sanctions imposed upon a bankrupt should not derogate or affect the rights of third parties.
4. The complicated civil sanctions imposed upon an undischarged bankrupt as set out in Sections 210, 211, 212, 213 and
214 of Bill C-60 should be deleted.
5. An undischarged bankrupt and an agent for a bankrupt
corporation should be prohibited from directly or indirectly
carrying on the same or similar business to that carried on by
the bankrupt for a period of two years from the date of
bankruptcy. This prohibition would be automatically imposed
upon the making of the bankruptcy order without the necessity
of an investigation by the administrator. The court should have
the power to reduce the period of prohibition or to remove that
prohibition if the conduct of the bankrupt or agent was not
subject to censure. The court should also have the power to
extend the period of prohibition.
6. If a court found that the conduct of a bankrupt or the
conduct of an agent of a bankrupt corporation was subject to

censure, the following restrictions may be imposed by the court
for such period of time as the court may determine:
(a) He shall not be entitled to act as an officer, director or
agent of a corporation;
(b) He shall be prohibited from directly or indirectly
managing or carrying on any type of business.
Such an application could be brought by the administrator, the
trustee or a creditor.
7. An individual bankrupt should be required to disclose the
fact that he is subject to an order of the court vesting in the
trustee the whole or part of his income or property to:
(a) all persons with whom he incurs debts in the course of
carrying on a trade or business, and
(b) all persons from whom he obtains credit to the extent
of $500.00 or more.
8. A bankrupt or agent of a corporation who fails to follow
these restrictions should be guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.
Meetings of Creditors
1. We are of the opinion that the requirement to file a proof
of claim "at least one clear day before the date fixed for the
meeting" may be an onerous burden placed on the creditors
and accordingly recommend that the creditor should be entitled to vote provided he files a claim up to the time called for
the meeting and at the place the meeting is held. This method
which is provided in the present Bankruptcy Act has not
placed any undue hardships on the creditors and on the
chairman of the meeting.
2. We recommend that voting be based on the actual dollar
value of the claim allowed by the chairman of the meeting for
purposes of voting.
3. We are of the opinion that the filling of a vacancy on the
board of inspectors by a meeting of creditors is a costly and
unnecessary expense to the bankrupt estate and recommend
that the present practice continue whereby a vacancy on a
board of inspectors can be filled by a meeting of inspectors.
Board of Inspectors
1. We are of the opinion that the maximum number of
inspectors in an estate should be 5 and that representatives of
the Crown must be elected by the creditors to be an inspector.
Also, the position of Supervisor should be eliminated and in its
stead the Trustee should be required to send notices of all
meetings of inspectors to the Bankruptcy Administrator, who
may designate a person to attend such meetings of inspectors
as he deems necessary.
2. In our opinion, the present provision where a Trustee is a
chairman of inspector meetings works well and should be
continued.
3. We are of the opinion that implementation of the provision of Section 295(2) will result in an unnecessary expense

November 14, 1979

Noveber14, 979SENATE
DEBATES

and vacancies shouid be filled by the surviving inspectors on
any estate.
4. In addition to the powers of inspectors, we recommend
that the Trustee must present annualiy for approvai to the
inspectors a statement of receipts and disbursements on his
administration, which statement or a summary thereof when
approved should be forwarded for information purposes to ail
known creditors in a file.
Order of Priority
i. Your Committee concurs with the removal of the preferred position of dlaims of the Crown.
2. Subsections 254(i)(i)(vi), 257(2), 257(3), and 257(4)
shouid be deleted.
3. Subsection 254(1)üj) which provides for payment of
interest after the date of bankruptcy shouid have priority over
Subsection 254(l)(i). The order of priority of the subsections
shouid be reversed.
Discharged of Debts
1. The present provisions of the Bankruptcy Act should be
retained subject to the removai of the anomaiy that only debts
for goods supplied as necessaries of life are not discharged. Ail
debts incurred for goods supplied or services rendered for
necessities of life should not be discharged.
2. If a creditor seeks to establish that the debt owing to him
by the bankrupt is not discharged by the bankruptcy he should
be required to file a notice of opposition to the discharge of the
bankrupt. The failure to file such a notice shall have the effect
that such a debt and ail other debts of the bankrupt outstanding at the date of the bankruptcy shail be dischargcd with the
exception of those debts iisted in Section 233 of Bill C-60.
Upon the fiiing of such a notice of opposition the court should
direct a trial of an issue before the Registrar or any judge or
officer of any of the courts of the province in order to
determine whether or not the particular debt is discharged by
the bankruptcy. The order of discharge shouid set out any
debts for necessaries or incurred as a resuit of fraud which are
not discharged.
Stockbrokers
1. Where securities are in safekeeping or "segregation",
they should not be treated as assets of the stockbroker. Those
securities should be returned to the clients as quickly and as
inexpensively as possible. ln most cases there is little difficulty
in determining which securities are in safekeeping and to
whom they belong.
This recommendation is not intended to continue the cumbersome concepts of tracing. The rights of the trustee to retorn
securities under these circumstances should be strictly iimited
to securities in "safekeeping" which should be defined in the
Bill. Securities in transit should not fali within this definition.

2. Securities belonging to related or deferred customers
should vest in the trustee in bankruptcy for the benefit first of
customers whose securities are iost or misplaced or whose
pledged securities have been sold, and subsequentiy in the
order of priorities provided in the Bill.
3. The following provision should become applicable if a
compensation or contingency fund established by the securities
industry is in existence and participates in a bankruptcy.
Where such a contingency fund is in existence and participates
in a bankruptcy, its involvement is normaliy either:
(i) to guarantee the bank indebtedness or the stockbroker
50 that the bank will not realize on its security and there
wiii not be a shortfall, or
(ii) to reimburse individual customers wtih respect to any
shortfall resulting from the sale of pledged securities or
from any ioss or misappropriation of securities or money.
Customners wjth claims for securities in transit sisould be treated in tise same
fashion as customers whose securities were delivered to the stockbroker to secure
the indebtedness of the customer to the stockbroker. Ail suds customers should
share equally inithe money and securities in the possession of the trustee at tise
date of bankruptcy save and except the securities held isy the stockbroker in
safekeeping whicis sisould be returned to the customner by the trustee as soon as
possible after the bankruptcy has occurred. Tise concept of a special customers'
fund sbould be maintained to give tise customer wisose securities were flot in
safekeeping thsegreatest possible protection. This would resuit in a general
sharing of the burden of tise Ioss among such customers and simplify administrative problems.

There are a number of problems to this approach. The first
of these is to determine what kind of contingency fund should
permit the use of this provision. Provincial securities legislation
refer to compensation funds or contingency trust funds
required in respect of registrants under such legislation. If
such a fund is satisfactory for the purposes of that legislation,
it shouid be considered to quaiify for the purposes of the
Bankruptcy Act.
A second difficulty is the determination by the trustee in
Bankruptcy of when the contingency fund has become committed to involvement in a bankruptcy. Such a fund should be
required to do some overt act to establish its involvement.
Once it becomes involved, the dlaims of ail customers, other
than related and deferred customers, should be satisfied by the
assets of the stockbroker and the fund. The securities in
safekeeping would be returned to the customers immediately.
Any deficiencies arising with respect to securities in transit,
proceeds of pledged securities or securities which have been
lost, misappropriated or misplaced shouid be make up by the
contingency funds. Thus, the customers wouid be completely
protected.
The specific commitment that a trustee in bankruptcy would
require from the fund would be for it to either guarantee ail
bank indebtedness or to undertake that aIl customners other
than reiated or deferred customers were fuliy compensated at
the conclusion of the bankruptcy for any loss suffered as a
resuit of the bankruptcy.
4. If no contingency or compensation fund was in existence
or if such fund could not or did not participate, the following
provisions would apply:

SENATE DEBATES

(a) All securities in safekeeping would be returned to the
customers;
(b) Customers who are able to trace their securities using
tracing rules specifically set out in the Bill would be
entitled to receive all the securities which they could
trace. A codification of the rules relating to tracing would
alleviate the necessity of the trustee in bankruptcy spending time and money to obtain court approval with respect
to all but the most unusual situations. This would result in
a more rapid and less expensive resolution of stockbroker
bankruptcies.
The rules of tracing should be based on the following
principles:
(i) Securities which are "in transit" may be claimed
where they can be identified or traced to the customer;
(ii) Where the securities of a particular type on hand
equal or exceed the claims of customers, other than
related and deferred customers, for securities of that
type, the securities would be returned;
(iii) Where the securities of a particular type on hand
are less than the claims of customers, other than related
and deferred customers, for securities of that type, a
pro rata distribution of the securities on hand would be
made.
(c) All other moneys and securities of all customers,
including related and deferred customers and the stockbroker would be pooled and either liquidated or used in
specie at their values as at the date of the bankruptcy.
The distribution of the proceeds and/or the securities
would be made to all customers, other than related and
deferred customers, on a pro rata basis.
Insurance
1. With respect to an non-life insurance company third
party liability claims should rank rateably with other types of
claims under a policy. This maintains the law as it presently
exists under the Winding Up Act.
2. Claims for the value of subsisting policies should be
subordinated to claims arising under a policy issued by a
non-life insurance company.
Receivership

1. The Bill should stipulate a standard of conduct which a
secured creditor or a receiver is required to adopt in realizing
on security and out of which he cannot contract. We would
recommend that the secured creditor or receiver should be
required to act in a commercially reasonable manner with
respect to matters relating to realizing upon the property of
the debtor. If a secured creditor or receiver deviates from such
a standard he would be liable to the trustee for any damages
suffered.
2. The provisions of Section 242(1) of Bill C-60 which
provide the trustee with the right to apply to the court for an

November 14, 1979

order postponing realization by a secured creditor should also
be applicable to realization by a receiver.
3. Sections 343 and 344 of Bill C-60 should be deleted.
4. The court should have the power to tax the remuneration
and the expenses of the receiver and to order the receiver to
pay to the trustee any surplus funds realized from the assets of
the debtor.
Courts
1. The office of the registrar in bankruptcy should be
retained. The registrar should continue to perform functions
sirnilar to those being performed at the present time, such as:
(a) adjudicating on unopposed matters;
(b) the appointment of an interim receiver;
(c) ruling on disallowance of claims;
(d) setting the remuneration of the trustee, interim receiver and accountant;
(e) taxation of the costs of realization of a secured
creditor including the costs of a receiver;
(f) taxation of solicitors' accounts;
(g) hearing matters relating to practise and procedure;
(h) hearing trials of issues referred to him by a judge of
the Supreme or Superior Court;
(i) settling and signing orders and judgments.
2. The office of the registrar should maintain its traditional
independence and should be free from outside direction and
controi.
3. The office of registrar should only be filled by a lawyer.
Designation of a Bankruptcy Judge
The present system whereby the Chief Justice of a province
may designate specific judges to hear bankruptcy matters
should be continued.
Powers of the Court to DischargeBankrupt
1. Bill C-60 provides that upon his discharge, the bankrupt
is entitled to a certificate of non-responsibility. The more
accurate description of the procedure in our view would be
achieved by the use of the term "discharge" as in the present
Bankruptcy Act.
2. The ninety day period provided in Bill C-60 for the filing
of a caveat by the administrator is too short a period of time in
our view. If a notice of opposition has not been filed within six
months after the date of the bankruptcy a certificate of
discharge should be issued without an order of the court.
3. The creditors and the trustee in bankruptcy should be
given the right to oppose the discharge of the bankrupt along
with the bankruptcy administrator.
4. If a notice of opposition is filed, the trustee must apply for
a date for the hearing of the bankrupt's application for dis-

November 14, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

charge and notice of the date of hearing must be given to the
person filing the notice of opposition and to the bankrupt.
5. Each creditor and the administrator would be given thirty
days' notice by the trustee of the fact that the bankrupt would
be entitled to a certificate of discharge automatically unless a
notice of opposition was filed.
6. The court upon an application for discharge could:
(a) suspend the granting of the certificate of discharge for
any period of time up to a maximum of five years;
(b) order the bankrupt to pay a portion of his future
earnings to the trustee for distribution among his creditors, provided that the amount to be paid shall leave the
bankrupt with earnings not less than the amount of the
earnings which are exempt from seizure under provincial
law.
Powers of the Court to Authorize Advance to Trustee or
Solicitor on Account of his Remuneration
1. The present practice of requiring the trustee to obtain
court approval of an advance on account of his remuneration
should be retained.
2. A similar approval of the court should be required for an
advance to a solicitor.

amount of his remuneration. Notice of the application and all
supporting material should be served on the person filing the
notice of opposition at least ten days prior to the date of the
hearing.
2. If there is no objection to the statement of receipts and
disbursements, the trustee should be entitled to apply ex parte
to the administrator to have his accounts taxed. Upon the
passing of the accounts the administrator would not have the
power to vary the amount claimed for remuneration. If the
administrator is satisfied that the accounts are correct, he
would issue a certificate of termination which would certify
that the appointment of the trustee has been terminated.
Accounts of Solicitors
The account of a solicitor for services rendered to the
bankrupt estate should be submitted to the trustee and to the
administrator. If either party objects to the amount of the
account within fifteen days, the solicitor must take out an
appointment for taxation of the account by the court. Notice
of the appointment should be served upon the trustee and the
administrator at least ten days prior to the date of hearing. If
no objection to the account is served, the account should be
paid by the trustee as soon as sufficient funds are available.

Taxation of Accounts

Control over the Administrator

1. The trustee should prepare his final statement of receipts
and disbursements and insert therein the amount claimed for
remuneration. A copy of this statement should be sent to all
creditors and to the bankruptcy administrator for the district.
If there is an objection by a creditor and/or the administrator,
the trustee must apply to the court for an order fixing the

The court should be given the power to review and overrule
the decisions of the administrator upon the application of the
bankrupt, any of the creditors or any other person who is
aggrieved by his decision. This power should not apply to
decisions of the administrator in routine administrative
matters.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
ADIOL RNIM[NI

Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1 )(g), 1 move that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Monday
nexi, November 19, 1979, ai 8 o'clock in the evening.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave grantcd, honourable
senators'?
Senator Oison: Mr. Speaker, before ]eave is granted, 1
wonder if the deputy leader would give us a brief explanation
of why he thinks il imperative that we meet on Monday
evening.
Senator Roblin: 1 thank my honourable friend. 1 should be
glad to give that explanation. The other place is now dealing
with Bill C-23, which, as honourable senators may rccognize,
is the supply bill. It is anticipated that that bill will be disposed
of in the other place by about 4.30 tomorrow afternoon, which
means that the carliest lime we can deal with it is on Monday.
Thc urgcncy arises from the fact that unless this bill receives
favourable consideration here by Tuesday there will be some
problems in supplying money for the activities of the government, including the payment of the wages of the civil service.
* (1410)

So my hope is that the house will agree to mecet on Monday
evening and on that occasion consent to give not only first but
also second rcading to that supply bill. Should that happen, it
bas nul been the custom, so far as 1 amn awarc. to refer such

bills to committee but rather to deal with them in this
ch amber.
If the bill is read the second time on N4onday, it will thenl be
suggesîed that it be considered again on Tuesday night, in the
hope of securing third reading and passage at that time. That
would enable the financial machinery of government to remain
in gear in order to make sure that the obligations of the
govcrnment are respected.
1 would solicit the co-operation of thc Senatc in this respcct.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is il agrecd, honourable senators'?
Senator Roblin: Perhaps 1 might be allowed, Mr. Speaker,
to say that the Clerk bas given me notice of committee
meetings for next week and, if it is the wish of the Senate, 1
might give those limes now in case there should not be another
opportunity.
Senator Flynn: 1 think we should put the question first.
Senator Roblin: 1 thought 1 would give the information
before the question was put.
Senator Flynn: The question was with leave, howevcr.

Quebec.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, even if I am a big "C"
ConservativeSenator Langlois: A small "c" conservative.
Senator Flynn: No, no; in this particular instance I am a
small "c" conservative, but I share the enthusiasm of the
Liberals, either big "L" or small "l" Liberals, with regard to
the three Quebec ridings which elected Liberal members
yesterday.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: I am very comforted by the results, because I
think they support the attitudes of the present federal government toward the problem in Quebec. It is one of not seeking
confrontation but leaving Quebecers to decide on their own
what they want in the future. That does not mean that the
present government will remain inactive. It has been active in
many ways up to now, and will continue to be, in order to
prove to Quebecers that the best thing for them is to remain
within the federation and within a united Canada.
[Translation]
Senator Denis: Honourable senators, I should like to put a
supplementary question. In view of the fact that the Honourable Roch La Salle, Minister of Supply and Services, is
considered as being sympathetic to separatism, I would like to
know in which of the three ridings he was a nuisance.
Senator Flynn: I do not think, honourable senators, that he
was a nuisance, because in the constituency of Prévost, which
is the nearest to his own constituency, the Liberal candidate
got the largest majority. I can reassure my good friend,
Senator Denis, that the Minister of Supply and Services, the
Honourable Mr. La Salle, was as pleased as I was with the
results. I spoke to him this morning and there is no doubt
about our position. We on this side do not intend to make
partisan politics out of the referendum question. I hope that
the members on the other side will take the same attitude.

RESULTS OF BY-ELECTIONS

Senator Perrault: I have a question to put to the Leader of
the Government regarding the results of the by-elections held
yesterday in the Province of Quebec. The by-election results in
that province seem to constitute a very positive indicationHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: It is good to note the applause for the
outcome of those particular by-elections. The results constitute
a positive indication by the people of that province that they
favour continuation of Confederation as opposed to separatism.
I ask the leader: Is the government planning any positive
response, any new initiatives, to support the efforts of the
people of Quebec to remain a part of the Canadian family?
The Right Honourable the Prime Minister, when questioned
on this matter on November 2, was rather vague about any
plans that he may have in mind. i wonder whether the
by-election results may have firmed up the resolve of the

ORDERS AND DECORATIONS
CHANGE IN WORDING OF PREAMBLE

Senator Lang: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government in the Senate which, I suspect,
he may wish to take as notice. I should like to say that,
unfortunately, I have been unable to frame the question in
such a way as to bring embarrassment to the government,
because the events to which the question refer occurred last
year.
By way of recital, I should like to say that my question
relates to the three honorific institutions that we have under
the federal system, namely, the Order of Military Merit, the
Canadian Bravery Decorations and the Order of Canada.
e (1420)
Honourable senators, appointments to these Orders are
published in the Canada Gazette. In connection with the Order

SENATE DEBATES
of Canada, I note on January 14, 1978, the following
preamble:
The Governor General, the Right Honourable Jules
Léger, in his capacity as Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada, and with the approval of
Her Majesty the QUEEN of Canada, Sovereign of the
Order, has appointed the following Canadians-et cetera.
That preamble is in conformity with article 9 of the constitution of the Order of Canada. On July 8 last year we had the
following preamble:
The Governor General, the Right Honourable Jules
Léger, in his capacity as Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada, has appointed the following Canadians, who have been recommended for such
appointment by the Advisory Council of the OrderHonourable senators, with respect to the Canadian Bravery
Decorations and the Order of Military Merit, the same thing
applies. In other words, from these gazetted announcements,
there have been omitted since the beginning of last year the
words which I quoted previously:
-with
the approval of Her Majesty the QUEEN of
Canada, Sovereign of the OrderMy question is: Was the omission of those words inadvertentwhich I can hardly presume from the fact that they arc
omitted from the preambles respecting all three honorific
titles-or deliberate? If the omission of those words is deliberate, does that constitute one more attempt by a person or
persons unknown to divest Canada of its monarchial tradition?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, because I wish to give
an objective reply, I shall have to take that question as notice.
I do not know whether Bill C-60 had anything to do with it.
An Hon. Senator: Touché.
ENERGY
DOMESTIC OIL PRICE-FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL NEGOTIATIONS

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to ask the
Leader of the Government the same question that I have asked
each day for the past two weeks: Since the meetings between
the Prime Minister and the Premier of Alberta in Saskatoon
yesterday seemed to end without an agreement, or at least
without an announcement of an agreement, are any additional
meetings scheduled between those two first ministers and
perhaps first ministers of other producing provinces? If not,
presumably the Prime Minister intends to make a decision and
announce it. If that is the procedure to be followed, when can
we expect that announcement regarding oil prices?
Senator Flynn: I may say that there was no agreement
reached yesterday or the day before during the course of the
meetings between the Prime Minister and Premier Lougheed.
But the door is not closed; negotiations are continuing. We are
still optimistic about an agreement eventually being reached.
Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question for the
Leader of the Government. I will not pursue this matter very
[Senator Lang.]

November 15, 1979

far today, although there was some press speculation. I have to
say that I disapprove of anyone on this side of the house
having to obtain his or her information from press reports,
which contain speculation. We would like to get the straight
goods from the government.
Senator Perrault: From the horse's mouth.
Senator Oison: Yes. I suggest that there was some speculation that there was a large measure of agreement on many
parts of the package. Could we find out what it is that they did
not agree on that is still subject to negotiation'? If they are so
close-and Premier Lougheed does not seem to agree that they
are that close-when can the general public of Canada rest
their minds as to how much this increase is going to be?
Senator Flynn: It will be as soon as possible.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- GOVERNMENT FUNDING

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. Canadians
have listened with a great deal of interest to the ministcr's
statements about a revival of Canadian industry-his plans to
expand industry, to broaden its base and, in effect, "to bake a
bigger economic pie." A great many inspirational talks have
been given by the minister since he assumed his important
responsibilities.
However, certainly many Canadians are disturbed by a
statement made by the Minister of State for Science and
Technology, the Honourable Heward Grafftey, who is reportcd to have said yesterday, when appearing before a committee
of the other place, that the government will increase total
research and development funds by less than 2 per cent in the
next fiscal year, which is far below the rate of inflation.
Sone Hon. Senators: Shame, shame!
Senator Perrault: Given the fact that science and technology
are vital components in making Canadian industry competitive, surely the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce
must be disturbed about this proposa to invest so little in
research and development. Perhaps the minister would share
with us some of his views on this matter.
Senator de Cotret: I would be very happy to do so. However,
I would like to take the specifics of your question as notice. I
would like the opportunity of reading the transcript to assure
myself that the statement in question is not taken out of
context. While I am sure the honourable senator would not
deliberately take the statement out of context, I would like to
assure myself as to exactly what components of science and
technology my colleague in cabinet was referring to.
As I have mentioned in a number of talks I have given
across the country in the last little while, one of the basic
cornerstones of our approach to economic development in this
country is a greater emphasis on research and development,
investment and innovation. I have said repeatedly that this
government would substantially increase its efforts in these

SENATE DEBATES

November 15, 1979

fields so as to improve the very poor performance that we as a
country have experienced in the field of research and development, lagging far behind the performance of that of most of
our industrial trading partners.
Senator Haidasz: And how!
Senator de Cotret: That is our intent.
Senator Haidasz: Japan's is 90 per cent.
Senator de Cotret: Japan's is 90 per cent of what? Are you
saying that Japan spends 90 per cent of its GNP on research
and development? Come now!
A number of measures will be announced, some possibly in
the budget, some through other forums, aimed at improving
our research and development efforts in this country. Without
looking at all of the various components of research and
development in which the federal government is involved or
which it may support, I can assure honourable senators that
there will be an appreciable increase in the level of funding in
the coming fiscal year.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I rise to ask a
supplementary. One of the election promises of the Progressive
Conservative Party was to double the budget for science and
technology by 1985. Yet, we appear to be moving in what can
only be described as a highly negative fashion.
I again go to the remarks made by the cabinet colleague of
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce before the
committee of the other place, and I quote:
All told ... the government's total science and technology
expenditures in 1979-80 will increase by $28 million . . .
or less than one per cent of the gross national productThis statement flies in the face of all of the statements made
by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister during the
campaign and by the Minister of Industry, Trade and CommerceSenator Flynn: What year?

Perrault: The Leader of the Government. I do not

Flynn: You certainly are. You are talking of the
Perrault: This is the first time I have made that

Senator Asselin: You will do it again.
Senator Perrault: It must be acutely distressing, particularly
for the industrial sector of this nation, to be faced with this
very dire outlook for science and technology. Indeed, Dr.
William Schneider, President of the National Research Council, is reported to have said that the effect of the cuts could be
devastating for small businesses in this country, and surely
assistance to small businesses was one of the cardinal princi-

ples which featured that passionate Conservative campaign in
May. Where is the program? Where is the proposal to double
research allocations by 1985?
*

(1430)

Dr. Schneider said he hoped the program would receive at
least $5 million more this year, but it was granted only $1.3
million to bring the total budget to $ 19.2 million. Surely this is
totally insufficient to meet the targets set forth by the
minister.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, I very much want to
give you a complete answer to your question. I take it that my
honourable colleague was appearing before the committee on
estimates.
Senator Perrault: In the other place, yes.
Senator de Cotret: I also take it that my honourable colleague was referring to the fiscal year 1979-80. He could not
have been referring to 1980-81. I would like to remind the
honourable senator that the estimates for that particular
department, for 1979-80, were very significantly cut in the
expenditure constraint program of the previous government,
and this has left many of our research endeavours in this
country in very poor shape. We are working on restoring some
of the expenditures that have been cut in these areas, and
when you see the estimates for 1980-81, you will see that we
are taking a very comprehensive view of research and development, and not living in the past, as you are, when you quote
numbers that the last government put in place, making very
significant cuts in an area that is very important to the health
of our whole industrial structure.
Senator Perrault: You know, at some point in the life of this
government the "honeymoon" period-that period in which it
is always possible for a new government to use the "escape
hatch" and say, "Don't blame us, blame the previous government"-is going to be over. The fact is, that fiscal year does
not end until March 31, 1980. The truth is that no encouragement at all for adequate research allocations was given by the
Honourable Mr. Grafftey in his remarks yesterday before the
committee in the other place. Indeed, he dropped all reference
to 1985, and the target to double research funds by that year.
And again today, essentially, the statement made by the
minister is another cop-out. At some point the government is
going to have to deliver on many of the Tory promises which
buoyed up the hopes of Canadian businesses, particularly
small businesses, in recent years.
Here we have, Mr. Minister-and I do not want to make a
speechHon. Senators: Order! Order!
Senator Perrault: Here we have a situation where many
small businesses are against the wall because of rising interest
rates, and now they have been served with a "double whammy". They are told, "We are not going to help you through the
degree of research and technology allocations that we
promised."

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Hicks: Honourable senators, when the minister
makes his comprehensive reply concerning research and development, will he please include the research and development expenditures by grants directed to universities and other
research institutions as well as in-house rescarch at the National Research Council, so that we may have a complete
picture before us?
Senator de Cotret: Yes. I can give the honourable senator
assurances that university research is very high on the list of
priorities. It is already an item that is before cabinet, and it
features prominently in our over-all plan for research and
development in this country over the next five years. We
attach great importance to the whole spectrum of research and
development-as the honourable senator well knows, it is a
chain that is only as strong as its weakest link-and we will
certainly be giving due consideration to the primary research
being conducted by Canadian universities.

DEVI LOPMENT OF STOL AIRCR[T

Senator Haidasz: In view of the fact that the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce, in reply to a question yesterday with regard to the STOL aircraft research in the de
Havilland Company, said that we are doing quite well in ternis
of research and development with regard to this corporation
and others, could the minister explain to this chamber why his
department, the Department of Industry, Trade and Conimerce, has been delaying a decision for the past two months on
a request from de Havilland, Toronto, for a $2 million grant
for development of its DASH-10, a new commuter plane, to
replace the twin Otter?
Senator de Cotret: The request for the extended funding for
the DASH-10, which is the new model of the STOL aircraft,
is not being delayed by my department. This was a request
made under the DIPP program. The DIPP program, for the
current fiscal year, is totally allocated, and we have made a
request to Treasury Board for additional funding so that we
can move expeditiously in dealing with this application. We
are awaiting what we hope will be a favourable response from
Treasury Board in ternis of increasing the ceiling under the
DIPP program.
Senator van Roggen: As a supplementary to that same
question, honourable senators, would the sanie minister undertake, in arranging his answers to questions by the Leader of
the Opposition, to instruct his officiais to look carefully at
testimony given before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Senate a couple of years ago on the subject of research and
development? To the best of my recollection, the evidence
indicated that, in addition to the need for direct government
assistance in the case of snall businesses and, of course,
institutions like universities, there is a further need for tax
incentives to encourage large business to make its own decisions in expenditures for research and development rather than
[Senator Perrault.]

November 15, 1979

rely on the largesse of bureaucrats in terms of what they can
research. I hope that will be part of the minister's answer when
he responds to the Leader of the Opposition.
Senator de Cotret: We are actively reviewing not only the
potential for cash expenditures in this area, but also the
potential for tax expenditures. As you know, there is also a
compelling case that can be made for the grant approach,
particularly in the case of universities. In other instances, the
tax expenditure route can possibly be more effective, and that
is very much under active consideration as we put together a
comprehensive R&D plan for this country.

TRANSPORT
RAILWAYS

CARRIAGE OF HAZARI)OUS PRODLCTS-SAI FTY
STUDY

Senator Thompson: I should like to ask a question of the
Leader of the Government. An editorial appears in the Globe
and Mail and refers to the study donc by Professor Julius
Lukasiewicz of Carleton University. The study points out that
there were 300 derailments a year on Canadian railways. In
the article Professor Lukasiewicz indicates that deficiencies
are found in 17 per cent of the annual inspections carried out
by the Canadian Transport Commission.
In view of the tragedy in Mississauga, would it be the
intention of the governnent, during the course of its investigation, to look at the safety and efficiency of Canadian railways
and at what inspections are made by the Canadian Transport
Commission?
Senator Flynn: I must say that the occurrence of this
terrible accident in Mississauga is a great preoccupation of the
government. It has directed the Canadian Transport Commission to make an investigation into the circunstances, as well as
the implications of the accident. I am hoping that decisions
and recommendations will be made very soon that will directly
prevent the recurrence of such an event.
Senator Thompson: 1 take it from the Leader of the Government's remarks that the terms of reference of the study will be
broad enough to include the safety of the railways.
As a further supplementary, in the short term, I believe
there is still anxiety on the part of people living in or near
Mississauga with respect to interini measures which could be
taken. Questions were asked by Senator Godfrey and Senator
Bosa concerning these interim measures, and the leader
responded that he would immediately bring forward any
interim measures that the government would take, such as not
coupling chlorine and propane cars. Does the Leader of the
Government have any information for us in that regard?
Senator Flynn: The only response I can give concerning that
is that the minimum measures that can be taken, are envisaged
to be taken at this time; and that the long-term probleni is also
of concern to the Minister of Transport. Eventually decisions
will be made both on the short-term problens and on the
longer-term solutions.

November 15, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

* (1440)

Senator Thompson: With the knowledge that every day a
ton of chlorine is used by industry including the waterworks in
Toronto, and therefore going into the very heavily populated
area of Toronto, it seems to me that it would be proper for the
governrment to give some assurance that some immediate
action is being taken. The obvious solution to one question that
comes to the mind of everyone living in or near Toronto is that
a chlorine tank should not be coupled between two highly
explosive propane tanks. It would be of great reassurance to us
if the government would act immediately in giving us that
assurance.
Senator Flynn: Obviously, the total solution to this problem,
if one is available, would be to end this practice. The suggestion was made also that that kind of train should not go
through urban areas, that it should be directed outside of
urban areas. These, of course, are all options under consideration by the Department of Transport and by the Canadian
Transport Commission. While they are already fully aware of
these matters, i am quite sure that they will appreciate the
suggestion made by the honourable senator.
Senator Thompson: What i am really seeking, honourable
senators, is an immediate guarantee by the government. i
suggest that re-routing is something that has to be looked at,
perhaps in the longer term, but i certainly suggest that the
question of coupling, which I see is something the Leader of
the Government agrees with me on, is a natural, logical
precaution, and it would be reassuring if the Leader of the
Government could say that as of now, today, to those of us
returning to Toronto, quite apart from the people already in
Toronto, that this is being done.
Senator Flynn: i will check on that. It may be that this is
already being done by the railway company and that other
things are also being done. I am quite sure that the railway
company does not want this to happen again.

ENERGY
DOMESTIC OIL PR ICE-FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL NEGOTIATIONSSTAND OF PREMIER OF ONTARIO

Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, i have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, or perhaps
it is rather more a favour that I want to ask of him. If he
cannot assure me that he can fuifill my request, perhaps he
would ask his seat-mate to do it over the weekend.
My question arises from the fact that up to now there is still
no apparent agreement between the federal government and
the Premiers of Alberta and Ontario regarding an oil and gas
price. i wonder if the honourable minister would convey to the
Premier of Ontario the appreciation and thanks of the people
of New Brunswick especially, and i am sure a great number of
people from Nova Scotia and P.E.I., for the approach and
stand that has been taken by the Premier of Ontario in this
whole question of the pricing of gas and oil, which is different
from the approach taken by the Premier of New Brunswick,

who seems to be more concerned with an increase in the price
of oil and gas so that he can gain more money in equalization
payments than showing any concern for the direct hardship
that this terrible increase is going to cause to the people of
New Brunswick during the coming winter.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, i have certainly
taken note of the honourable senator's comments, and I will
acquaint the Minister of Energy with his point of view. I am
sure he will take whatever steps he deems appropriate in the
circumstances.
Senator Thériault: What I am really asking the minister to
do is to convey the message from the people of New Brunswick
to the Premier of Ontario, which may give him some more
strength to keep up the fight.
MOVEMENT OF OIL FROM ALASKA TO LOWER FORTY-EIGHT
STATES

Senator van Roggen: i have a question for the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce. i am sure the minister will
forgive me for my preoccupation with the subject of the
northern tier pipeline, a project which i feel, if proceeded with,
would not be in Canada's best interests-and i am sure we
agree on that. i happen to feel strongly that it would not even
be in the best interests of the United States, subject only to
certain offers being forthcoming from Canada.
My question is in two parts: First, am i correct in my
understanding-and the minister may wish to take this part of
the question as notice-that the President of the United
States, who must make a decision on this question by a date
which I believe is December 6, or something of that sort, may,
in making that decision, make no decision at ail? In other
words may he choose no pipeline?
Whether the answer to that question is yes or no, my second
question is: In view of the cancellation of President Carter's
trip to Ottawa when this was to be a major item on the agenda
to be discussed in depth, as expressed by the minister in
answering my question a week or so ago, have alternative
meetings at the highest level, other than heads of state, namely
at the level of the Canadian minister and the American
secretary, been scheduled to pursue this matter prior to the
deadline for the decision of the President, and, if so, on what
date and at what location?
Senator de Cotret: Well, honourable senator, i think i can
answer the first part of your question and I might have to take
the second part as notice.
It is my understanding that the President must make a
recommendation to Congress on December 6. He need not, as
I understand it, come out in favour of one or another of the
proposais. You are quite right, I believe, in saying that he may
make no decision. There is a third option also open to him, and
that is to make any recommendation that he may deem
appropriate in terms of future or further evaluation of the
various proposais. So there is quite a range of options open to
the President. It is not a clear-cut "this project or that project"
type of recommendation or decision.

SENATE DEBATES
In terms of your second question, I will once again indicate
that on the agenda for the President's visit here there was a
substantial amount of time reserved for the discussion of
energy questions in general and this one in particular, and
there has been a decision on this issue as on other issues, as I
indicated to Senator Bosa last night. Discussions will continue
at the official levels between now and the time when a visit by
the President can be organized. But I will have to take notice
of your question in terms of the specifics of who would
participate, and the precise dates of any such meetings.
Senator van Roggen: I certainly hope it will be pursued at
the ministerial level, at least. Thank you.

of the Senate shall notI should like to underline "not".
-on anv account, under penalty of being committed to
the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod or to prison
during the pleasure of the Senate, go down to the House
of Commons, or send his answer in writing, or appear
[before any committee].
The rest I will not read. It scems to me that there is no
ambiguity in that rule at all.
Therefore, if the minister for CIDA and Minister of Justice
wish to remain legally within the rules of this house they
should arrange for permission if they want to appear before
House of Commons committees. I say that, because it is being
dismissed lightly. There probably is a bit of a comical clement,
[Senator de Cotret.]

November 15, 1979

but there is also a serious element. I have donc some checking
into why that rule is in here, and it is to make certain that no
senator can be subpoenaed by the House of Commons or a
committee thereof. Therefore, we should not handle it lightly,
because we know what happens to precedents.
Senator Flynn:

I don't see why you say "lightly".

Senator Oison: Precedents become acceptable practices
after a while.
I understand that these two ministers have been before
House of Commons committees on several occasions. If that is
so, they are in violation of rule 104, and I would like them to
stay out of trouble and stay out of jail by correcting their
inadvertence, if that is what it was, because I am sure they
would not have donc it if they had known about this.
Senator Flynn: On a question of privilege. I think I can
speak for Senator Asselin on this. We are willing to surrender
ourselves to the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. I don't
know where he will commit us to prison-perhaps in the Peace
Tower-but we are willing to serve for a few minutes, if that is
the desire of the Senate, in order to show our respect for the
rules. Because we do respect them.
However, it is obvious that this rule was designed for
senators who are not members of the administration, and there
are valid reasons for that. While Senator Olson may have
looked back to the reasons for this, he did not appreciate that
there is quite a difference between a senator being forced or
invited to appear before a House of Commons committee and
a minister, with his responsibilities as a departmental hcad,
appearing and explaining, not his position as a senator, but his
position as a minister, which is quite different.
In any event, I would think this could be solved, at least for
the time being, after Senator Asselin and I have served our
term of a few minutes, or even severai hours if you wish. But I
am quite sure that you would not want us to be absent from
this chamber. You would be really sorry if we were absent
from a sitting of the Senate, and you were not able to question
us because we were confined in the Peace Tower.
Senator de Cotret has just been invited to appear before a
committee of the House of Commons at 3.30.
I would therefore move, honourable senators, that senators
who are members of the cabinet be not constrained by rule
104, but that they be allowed to appear before any committee
in their capacities as members of the cabinet.
Some Hon. Senators: With leave.
Senator Flynn: With Icave, evidently. If Icave is not granted,
then I withdraw my motion now and I am willing to serve my
term before moving it.
The Hon. the Speaker: I take it that the Leader of the
Government has moved a motion.
Senator Flynn:

I asked ]eave.

The Hon. the Speaker: Is Icave granted, honourable senators, for the Leader of the Government to move the motion'?

DEBATES

Senator Oison: Mr. Speaker, before leave is granted, 1 want
to suggest to the Leader of the Government that he bas
admitted he is guilty.
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Oison: He has admitted that be is willing to serve
time.
Senator Perrault: Throw him on the mercy of the Senate.
Senator Oison: 1 think we on this side would be sufficiently
generous as to release them on tbeir own recognizances.
Senator Flynn: Parole.
Senator Buckwold: For good behaviour.
Senator Oison: The problern is tbat we now have this
admission that they have flaunted the rules of this bouse. This
is flot the first time a minister bas appeared before a Commons
committee witbout seeking leave. If tbey bad been denied leave
from this bouse to make that appearance, tbat is one set of
circumstances. But tbey were not denied, because tbey neyer
even botbered 10 ask, and the Leader of tbe Government
agrees that tbat is also the case. Perbaps tbey can take it
ligbtly, and I arn willing to go part way with tbat.
Senator Flynn: 1 hope so.
Senator Oison: I sbould like to know from tbe Leader of tbe
Government at what stage be takes off bis Senate bat so tbat
he is no longer a senator.
Senator Flynn: No, no.
Senator Oison; Rule 104 does not qualify or byphenate a
senator.
Senator Flynn: 1 agree.
Senator Oison: If be is a senator be must not go without
permission.
Senator Smith (Colchester): No.
Senator Oison: There are no qualifications in tbat rule at
ail. 1 think tbis bouse would bave given bim and Senator
Asselin, and Senator de Cotret who wants to go today, permission if tbey had asked. 1 arn not going to resist leave being
granted to tbe Leader of the Government to gel a specific
request for Senator de Cotret 10 go today, but if tbe interpretation put on tbis rule by tbe Leader of the Government is to
stand, then tbe wording doesn't mean anytbing and we sbould
cbange it, if that is wbat needs 10 be done. 1 do not happen 10
think tbat we sbould change it, because 1 believe tbat we have
to assert our independence in our rules that say a senator
cannot be sent for.
I expeet that senators are among tbe few people in Canada
who are immune t0 a subpoena by House of Commons committees, and perhaps they are the only ones. 1 think we sbould
maintain that independence, so let us not disregard this rule so
lightly. We could give leave for today, but 1 tbink tbere bad
better be an examination of tbis rule if this is tbe kind of
interpretation tbat is 10 be put on it.

Senator Flynn: Would tbe honourable senator permit a
question? Wben we ask a member of tbe House of Commons
10 appear before one of our committees because be is a
minister, does the bonourable senator tbink tbe same rule
sbould apply?
Senator Oison: Tbe answer 10 that is very simple. We, on
tbe floor of this bouse, do not interpret the rules of the House
of Commons. Wbatever the rules are over tbere, tbey are
enforced by tbeir own Speaker.
* (1500)

Senator Smith (Colchester): On a point of order, 1 tbink one
bas to look carefully at rule 104 and 1 ask tbe Deputy Leader
of tbe Opposition 10 do just tbat, not from the point of view of
seeing if be can amuse bimself or otber senators about il but,
rather, witb a careful effort 10 see if be can understand wbat il
means. It reads:
104. (1 ) Wben tbe House of Commons requesîs tbat a
senator or any of the officers, clerks, or servants of the
Senate attend before tbe House of Commons 10 be examincd or appear before any commitîce thereof, sucb request
sball be by message from tbe House of Commons1 arn not aware that tbe House of Commons bas made any
request t0 any member of tbe Senate, wbetber or not be is a
minister, 10 attend before il. I bave not beard any evidence
produced by the Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition 10 indicate
that tbat is tbe case. As 1 understand il, tbe ministers are
appearing voluntarily before the committec. If tbey refused, or
did not wisb t0 do so vcluntarily, then rule 104(l1> would bave
10 be invoked.
The purpose for wbich tbe rule is put in place, surely, is
simply 10 prevent one bouse baving tbe rigbî 10 summon tbe
members of another bouse 10 answer charges before that
bouse.
Senator Oison: It does not say that.
Senator Smith (Colchester): It does say that. Look aI
subsection (3):
Witbout sucb leave, a senator ... shalh not, on any
account. ...go down t0 the House of Commons, or send
bis answer in writing, or appear by counsel 10 answer any
accusation there.
Now, nobody bas been making any accusations against these
ministers-except some of these raîher absurd accusations
that tbey bave not immediately remedied ail the sins of tbe
late government. So I say notbing bas bappened 10 invoke tbis
rule aI ail.
1 would be one of the first, provided 1 was agile enougb 10
catch the Speaker's eye first, 10 support the Depuîy Leader of

coercion or any tbougbt of inîerfering in any way wiîh the
privileges of tbis bouse, or indeed of the other bouse, in the
appearance before tbe committees of one by a member of tbe
other. But 1 say that so far noîhing bas bappened 10 make rule
104 applicable and, therefore, there is notbing to become
disturbed about or in any way 10 take offence aI. Indeed, one

should, 1 think. be happy that these distinguished colleagues of
ours have flot only attained the high office which is theirs, but
that they have willingly and gladly and without any coercion
or any formalities. without any application of the rules, been
perfectly willing to share their knowledge with a committee of
the other house for the help and assistance of that committee
and the illumination of that committce.
Senator Perrault: Don't go

far!

Senator Frith: Just on that point of order and t0 be sure that
we have it clear on the record, Senator Smith, when reading
subsection (3), skipped some rather significant words.
Senator Perrault: Oh, he would neyer do that, surely!
Senator Frith: J-e read, -Without such leave, a senator,
officer, clerk or servant of the Senate shaîl flot, on any

cetera, and then he skipped righî over t0 -answer aecusations."
But whaî it says is:
-go down 10 the House of Commons. or send his answer
in wriîing. or appear by counselAnd then follows the part that he read:
-t0 answer any accusation there.
J think it should be clear that, as Senator Smith read the
words of subsection (3) that served his argument, which he is
entitled 10 do. he did omnit some raîher significant words.
Senator Perrault: iust accidentally.
Senator Smnith (Colchester): 1 omitted no significant words
whatsoever. Indeed, when J make an argument that depends
on the omission of words which ought 10 be there, that will be

Senator Godfrey: Oh, that is fine. 1 thought you had made a

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Oison: So you can now put your motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Leave is granted to the Leader of the
Government to move his motion.
Senator Flynn: The motion that I make is that Senator de
Cotret, without prejudice to the interpretation of the rules, be
given leave to appear this afternoon and possibly Monday.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, include Monday just in case.
Senator Flynn: Let us say "until the Rules Committee has
had the opportunity to examine this rule and report thereon."
And I would suggest that it be not merely for Senator de
Cotret but for my colleague Senator Asselin and myself.
Senator Thériault: For the three wise men, yes.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed?
Senator Argue: I don't sec why in this motion you need to
refer in any way to changing the rule. The rule is there and it
is clear. 1 think what Senator Flynn wanted to do, initially at
any rate, was to ask that Senator de Cotret be given leave to
appear before that committee, let us say between now and the
time the Senate next sits. I do not really think, with the
greatest of respect, that you can have any reference to the
rules being considered at another time. Let us stick to the one
thing.
* (1510)

Senator Flynn: I have no ojection to that, but I must appear
before a committee myself next week. I do not know exactly
what day that will be, and I may ask leave to attend, but at
this time I only ask for forgiveness.
Senator Argue: We will give you leave.
Senator van Roggen: Honourable senators, I do not wish to
prolong this discussion, but I feel that there is no question that
this chamber cannot be less than forthcoming in permitting
ministers responsible for government departments to appear
before House of Commons committees, any more than we
would want to restrict ministers from the House of Commons
appearing before our committees.
However, it seems to me that we are breaking the rules all
over the place. As I read rule 104, I see that it is on a message
from the House of Commons. We only have a message to the
Leader of the Government. I do not think we have a message
from the House of Commons. However, I will not quibble over
that.
I would simply like to have it clear that we are giving an
interim consent to these ministers to discuss departmental
matters before committees of the House of Commons, not the
House of Commons as a whole, and that the matter be
referred to the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and
Orders. Is that what you are asking for?
Senator Flynn: That is what I was asking.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I do not want the Senate to
look any sillier than it has to.
Senator Argue: Then you know what you can do.

Senator Smith (Colchester): This, it seems to me, is really
reducing the thing to complete absurdity. If that is what
honourable senators wish to do upon reflection, then, of course,
they are perfectly at liberty to do so. In any event, I do ask
that my point of order be seriously considered, because I
believe careful reading of the rule will show clearly that no
infraction thereof has yet taken place, as far as any evidence
we have is concerned, and there is no need for permission of
this chamber to be given to a senator who is a minister to
appear voluntarily without a message from the House of
Commons.
I feel that that is a very important thing to be decided. I
would not like the passage of this motion giving leave to
Senator de Cotret, or whomever, to be in any way taken as an
indication that I agree that the rules do not need to be
examined in this case.
Senator Perrault: Your Honour, may I suggest that, with
the utmost dispatch, this matter be dealt with by a motion?
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Perrault: No, the general question of ministers
appearing before Commons committees should be referred to
the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. This
should be in the form of a motion, and should come before the
Senate as soon as possible.
Senator Flynn: I suggest that we do not need that. I think
the committee has had sufficient notice to know that it should
look into this matter. I think, as well, that Senator Smith's
point of order is well taken.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, certain senators have raised important points of order with respect to rule
104. I understand that it has now been moved by the Honourable Senator Flynn, P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator
Roblin, P.C.:
That notwithstanding any interpretation that may be
made of rule 104, permission be granted to the three
senators who are members of the ministry and have
departmental responsibilities to respond to requests to
appear before committees of the House of Commons until
such time as a ruling may be made by the Chair or a
decision reached by the Senate on the recommendation of
the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion agreed to.

TRANSPORT

HIGHWAY CARRIAGE OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL-SAFETY
REQUIREMENTS

Senator Flynn: I have a reply to a question asked earlier this
week by Senator Thompson concerning the transportation of
nuclear materials.
The senator was particularly concerned about a nuclear
device which he alleged was lost in transit in New Brunswick. 1
have ascertained that the package has been found. In fact, it
never left the warehouse.
This leads me to the senator's second question concerning
the labelling of nuclear materials. In reply I would say that it
is my understanding that the bill to be introduced next week in
the Commons relating to the transport of dangerous goods
makes provision for stricter labelling of all such materials.
Finally, I will table, for the attention of Senator Thompson
and all other senators, the specific federal regulations governing the transport of nuclear materials, as soon as they can be
obtained from the Department of Transport.

might quickly reach the Commons committee, where he anticipates that members may bring forward their concerns in the
form of proposed amendments to the bill. It is anticipated that
the bill will be introduced in the Commons next week, and it is
anticipated, therefore, that certain of these particular concerns
could be legislated upon in advance of the final report of the
CTC investigation.
I would suggest that the question of adequate staff of the
CTC can be raised in the Commons committee, and, of course,
it could be raised here when the bill reaches the Senate. At
that time, the honourable senator may be able to see whether
there is any relation between this accident and the lack of staff
at the CTC.

FEDERAL DISTRICT COMMISSION BILL
SECOND READING

CANA DIAN TRANSPORT COMMISSION-STAFFING CUT-BACKS

Senator Haidasz: I should like to direct a question to the
Leader of the Government. In view of the record high level of
derailments in Canada, and the serious responsibility of the
Canadian Transport Commission to carry out annual inspections of Canadian railways and other modes of transportation,
is the Leader of the Government aware that the already
inadequate staffing in the Canadian Transport Commission is
now being further reduced by another 100 people following the
government's cut-backs, thereby further imperilling the safety
of the public and movement of goods in Canada'?
Senator Flynn: I am not aware of that fact, and I doubt that
there is any relation between that situation and what took
place in Mississauga.

DERAILMENT AT MISSISSAUGA-ACTION TO AVOID SIMILAR
OCCURRENCE

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, 1 should like to take
this opportunity to respond to some of the concerns raised by
Senator Marchand and Senator Godfrey over the last two days
relating to the Mississauga train derailment.
I have said that the Canadian Transport Commission investigation of the matter will begin in the first week of December,
and will be very thorough in examining all questions raised in
this chamber, in the other place, and elsewhere.
It is a fact that the CTC has been directed to seek information, on an urgent basis, relating to matters such as sensors for
heat losses, et cetera, which could conceivably have a direct
bearing on the level of safety offered to the public.
The minister is attempting to hurry the introduction of the
bill relating to the transport of dangerous goods, so that it

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, November 13, the
debate on the motion of Senator Choquette for the second
reading of Bill S-10, to confirm the authority of the Federal
District Commission to have acquired certain lands.
[Translation]
Senator Lafond: Honourable senators, last Tuesday I asked
that this debate be adjourned to allow me to get additional
information. Those data, which I asked Senator Choquette to
supply me with, were obtained very graciously and promptly
less than 24 hours after I had requested them. Since then, I
have also had the opportunity to consult with some of the
authorities of the city of Hull, where I live, where I was born,
and where my family took root over a century ago.
I agree with Senator Choquette that this project, whose
realization depends on passage of this bill, will have a rather
serious effect on the future and the economic development of
the city of Hull. 1 invite honourable senators to adopt it
quickly. I also share the view of Senator Choquette that it
should be referred briefly to our Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee. Senator Choquette should know-I do
not-if he is a member of the Quebec Bar Association. As for
me, though I am not a member of any bar association, since
this is strictly a legal matter, I feel there is good reason to give
members of the Quebec Bar the opportunity to study it
further. I therefore leave the matter to honourable senators,
and suggest that they give second reading to this bill.

QUESTION PERIOD
NEWFOUNDLAND
RESUI-TS OF FEDERAL BY-EILECTION

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question to
put to the Leader of the Government. In our carnest quest for
information, the opposition in this place wonders whether the
Leader of the Government can confirm the fact that the
Liberal Party is winning the by-election in Newfoundland by a
two-to-one majority over all other parties. Does the Leader of
the Government have similar information that would serve to
confirm these interesting reports?
Senator Flynn: No. I have heard they are in the lead, but I
would rather wait until the end before I comment.
Senator Buckwold: This is the end.
Senator Oison: The beginning of the end.
Senator Flynn: The bitter end.
Senator Perrault: It is my understanding, honourable senators, that the Liberal majority in that by-election has increased
substantially over that achieved by the party in the May
general election-a fact that is hcartening, at least, to some of
us in this chamber.
THE BUDGET
ASSUMPTIONS RE FEDERAI-PROVINCIAL OIL PRICE AGREEMENT

Senator Perrault: I should like to ask a question of the
Leader of the Government. Since May of this year, the nation
has been teetering on the brink of a new budget. For a time the
Honourable Minister of Finance stated that the reason for the
budget delay was a lack of an oil price agreement. The
Minister of Finance is reported to have stated this afternoon
that he is "tired of waiting" and that he will proceed with a
budget based upon "certain assumptions" regarding oil prices.
I have two questions: First, what are some of these assumptions; and second, with the oil pricing issue such a vital if not
critical component in the economy, how can the Minister of
Finance possibly proceed with a realistic budget on the basis of
the tenuous and unrestricted pricing situation that now exists?
Senator Flynn: In response to the first part of the question, I
can only say that I am not about to make a budget speech here
tonight. With regard to the second part of the question, I
should like to say that if there is no agreement before the
SOl n.]

November 19, 1979

budget there may be a decision by the government, and the
assumptions may by then be realities.
Senator Perrault: As a supplementary, what are the "certain assumptions" that are going to be a component of this
budget-a rather risky budget, I suggest, to bring in under
so-calied "assumptions"-with respect to oi prices? Is there a
range in which it is expected that an oi pricing agreement will
be achieved with the Province of Alberta and the other oi
producing provinces?
Senator Flynn: We certainly hope there will be an agreement, but if there is no agreement, the government has indicated very clearly that it has the responsibility of making a
decision, and it will make it. I may say that any budget is
based on a certain number of assumptions, not necessarily in
respect of oi prices but on a multitude of other factors.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
IRAN-SAFETY OF CANADIANS

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to ask the
Minister of State for CIDA, who answers in this house on
external matters, a question. I ask it because of the, to put it
mildly, volatile situation in Iran. Some news reports late this
afternoon almost indicate that there is a deteriorating situation. Is it not time the government took the decision to take
some of the 60 or 70 Canadians out of Iran? It seems to me
that, while the government may have a contingency plan, if the
same process is used at the Canadian embassy as was used at
the American embassy, no matter how good the plan may be it
will be inoperable by the time it is started.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, the government is
certainly worried about the situation in Iran. And even more
so since hearing the latest reports.
[English]
Senator Oison: On a point of order. There is something
wrong with the translation system. We are getting one language on all channels.
Senator Asselin: I was saying that the situation in Iran has
worried the Canadian government very much. We heard that
there was a statement by Iranian students that Canadians mav
be held for their own safety. On Friday the Under-Secretary of
State for External Affairs met with the chargé d'affaires of
Iran in Ottawa and was told that Canadians in Iran are in no
danger at al]. We will be in touch with our embassy in Teheran
tomorrow morning, and we will continue to inform the house
of the situation.
Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question. I think the
Canadian ambassador, either on his own initiative or on
instructions from Ottawa, did in fact encourage all Canadians
who did not have a demonstrable urgent need to remain in
Iran to leave. Can the minister advise whether or not all those

SENATE DEBATES

November 19, 1979

Canadians who do not have such a reason for staying have
been able to find a way out?

CANADIAN AND AMERICAN INTEREST RATES

[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, it is obvious that we
must rely on daily reports from our embassy in Iran.
As I said a while ago, the Secretary of State for External
Affairs told the House of Commons this afternoon that we
keep daily contact with our ambassador. The ambassador has
assured us that the situation in the Canadian embassy is under
control and that he is in contact on a daily basis with Canadians living there. We urged him not to take any chance and we
told him that, should the lives of Canadians be in jeopardy, we
trusted he would take whatever steps would be deemed
necessary.

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. Earlier in
this session, at a time when bank interest rates were increasing, I put forward some questions in respect of the relationship
of the Canadian prime rate with the American prime rate, and
we received a very reasonable answer in response-a very
prompt answer. Naturally, some of us are watching the situation that has been developing.
Since that time, the Americans have raised their rate, and it
is now three-quarters of 1 per cent above the prime rate in
Canada-I am talking of the prime rate in New York as
against the prime rate here-and, in fact, the Canadian dollar

[English]

closed at 84.95 cents U.S., which is about 20 points higher on
the day.
My question to the minister is: What is your interpretation
of this situation? Is it time to reassess the present policy of
linking our interest rate with the American rate? Would your
government be ready now to reduce Canadian bank interest
rates and, if not, what would be your time schedule for taking
such action?
Senator de Cotret: In terms of the assumption you make in
your statement to the effect that domestic interest rates in
Canada are tied to U.S. rates, I should like to say, as i have
said often before in this chamber, that we do not follow an
automatic one-to-one relationship with changes in American
interest rates. As a matter of fact, over the summer months
there were a number of times when we waited. We follow the
monetary conditions and foreign exchange conditions before
we in Canada decide on the proper course to follow with
respect to domestic rates following increases in the American
rate, and that is still very much our view.
i do not think we are following a precision formula
approach. The situation is one that has to be monitored on a
continuing basis, as it is at the moment, to ensure that the
domestic monetary policy levers are set in position of maximum benefit for Canada as a whole.

has stabilized reasonably well. Today, the Canadian dollar

HEALTH AND WELFARE
FAMILY ALLOWANCES

Senator Croll: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government. Some time ago the Minister of
Health and Welfare indicated that much of the money for
welfare purposes had been spent on the rich rather than the
poor, and that he was opposed to universality and was favourable to selectivity.
When he was asked whether he intended to do anything
about old age security benefits, he simply said he had not
intended to do anything in that regard. When he was asked
whether he intended to do anything about family allowance
benefits, he replied, "Not this year," leaving the impression
that there was the intention at a later date to bring it in line
with selectivity. The press indicated that he was opposed to
giving family allowance benefits to rich kids.
My question is: How do you define a rich kid? What is the
measure? How do you distinguish between a rich kid and a
rich elder as between giving one family allowance benefits and
not the other?
Senator Flynn:

I do not know if that is a question for me

or-

Senator Croil: No, it isn't. I would ask that you pass it on.
Senator Flynn: -or more of an argument that you are
trying to make. The minister said very precisely that there was
no question of doing anything about family allowance payments in 1980, but thatSenator Croil: 1979.
Senator Flynn: In 1980-that the system would remain as it
is for the whole of 1980. In the meantime, the minister is
reviewing it and consulting with his provincial counterparts
about it.
Once he has reached a conclusion, he might be able to
answer the subtleties that Senator Croll has raised as between
a rich elder and a rich child. I can sec some differences, and
perhaps I should share these views with the honourable senator
in a private conversation.

THE ECONOMY

*

(2020)

Strength in the Canadian dollar, to which you have just
referred, is certainly a heartening development, and it certainly will be considered in any further action to be taken with
respect to monetary policy in Canada relative to monetary
policy in the United States. But the whole monetary market is
one that evolves very rapidly and is not one in which arithmetical formulas can be followed. So it is a question of really
following and monitoring developments on a daily basis.
CROWN CORPORATIONS
CANADA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION-SALE OF SHARES
Senator Oison: I wonder if I could ask the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce if he could clarify for us the
report, or perhaps

i should

clarify it as an announcement, that

SENATE DEBATES

the government is now inviting purchase or tenders for reducing the government's share of the Canada Development Corporation to something less than 50 per cent. And since it is not
clear that the purpose for which the CDC was set up in the
first place can be enhanced by such a sell-off of the shares,

Canada to do at this time.

government is, of course, fully aware that it is within the
mandate of the CBC to promote national unity, and it is a fact
that much of the broadcasting company's programming is
directed explicitly to that end.

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I must take that
question as notice, and I shall endeavour to give a precise
answer. In the interim, I can only say that when the CDC was
originally formed by the previous government it was always
the intent to have Canadians hold shares in it. Over lime,
depending on the market conditions, private participation by
CDC equity was gradually increased. I might have to talk with
my colleague, the Minister of Finance, who is responsible for
the CDC to obtain more information about the recent
announcement that you are referring to, and I shall be happy
to do that and report back to you.

RUMOURED MERGER OF AIR CANADA AND CP AIR

Senator Oison: The announcement was made this afternoon,
I think, probably for and on behalf of the Minister of Finance,
but by the minister responsible for the Treasury Board. So I
wonder if in his investigation the minister would try to find out
why it is beneficial for Canada to sell off such a large block of
those shares at this time, reducing the government's holding
from something like 66 per cent to less than 50 per cent. I am
aware of the stated policy when it was put in place, but in his
examination would he try to find out the reason why it is
beneficial to Canada to have such a large block of shares sold
off, or at least offered for sale, all at once?
Senator de Cotret: Once again, honourable senators, I shall
be very happy to obtain the information, but I would like to
say that that was always the game plan with respect to the
CDC. But I shall certainly endeavour to find out why now, and
why the exact number of shares.
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
NATIONAILUNITY -POLICY CONC'ERNING QUIBIEC

REFERENDUM

Senator Flynn: Senators Manning, Muir and McElman
raised concerns last week about remarks by the President of
the CBC, Mr. Johnson, that the national network will not
interfere on any side of the debate over the unity of the
country.
Honourable senators may know that the minister responded
at the end of last week to demands that he order the CBC to
adopt an obvious pro-unity stance, by saying that the CBC and
Mr. Johnson had taken a responsible position on this issue.
Mr. Macdonald reiterated his faith in the tradition of noninterference with the CBC on political matters and stated the
government's intention not to in any way censor the broadcasting agency.
I think it fair to say that the government believes that the
integrity of the CBC can be maintained only if it gives
opportunity to all voices on national political issues. The

TRANSPORT
Senator Flynn: Subsequent to the speech of Mr. Mazankowski to the Air Transport Association of Canada, Senator
Perrault asked if the government had received communications
from either Air Canada or CP Air regarding the remarks of
the minister.
I have determined that the minister has heard from neither
company concerning the matters raised for discussion in his
speech of November 5.
RAILWAYS-CARRIAGE OF HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS
STUDY

-SAFETY

Senator Flynn: Last Thursday I assured Senator Thompson
that I would inquire as to the prospect of government action in
advance of the report of the Canadian Transport Commission
investigation of the Mississauga derailment-action which
would ensure greater safety in the transportation of dangerous
goods. Of course, as I indicated last week, government legisiation on the transportation of dangerous goods is to be introduced by the end of this week. As well, the railways have been
requested, through the Canadian Transport Commission, to
show cause why immediate action should not be taken relating
to the coupling of tankers carrying dangerous materials on a
train, the speed at which those trains travel through urban
areas and other problems of the same kind.
The government will consider any representations made by
the industry, and will base its action upon that and other
information expected in the near future.
I might also advise Senator Thompson that the minister is
actively considering establishing a full-fledged inquiry, under
the Inquiries Act, into the Mississauga incident. He is currently consulting with the Province of Ontario and the Municipality of Mississauga in order to reach agreement on the possible
terms of reference of such an investigation.

point, and after we adjourned last Wednesday afternoon I
asked Senator Fournier to verify this point with representatives of the bottling industry so that I could be informed by
telegram before I addressed you tonight. This telegram was
received in my office last Friday. It comes from Moncton,
New Brunswick, and is addressed to me at The Senate,
Parliament Buildings, Ottawa. It reads as follows:
As per Senator Fournier's request we at Brunswick Bottling Limited as a bottler were never advised that there
might be a ban on the 1.5 returnable container until the
day that the Hon. Lawrence banned the container on
August 28th, 1979. Though we were aware that the
government had been investigating the 1.5 container for
at least a month or month and one half. I have also
checked with the Canadian Soft Drink Association and
Coca Cola Co. of Canada and neither party were advised.
I remain yours truly Rino Fournier Vice-President Operations Brunswick Bottling Ltd.
Honourable senators, I submit that we now have enough
information to decide between two courses of action. First, we
can let this inquiry die on the order paper after a few speeches
or, second, we might come to the conclusion that we are
justified in referring this whole matter to a standing Senate
committee.
Before we embark on such a course of action, I should like
to remind you that the most important responsibility of the
upper chamber is to review legislation. There is no doubt about
this. However, over the last ten to fifteen years we have
developed another important responsibility, one which we fulfil
through our standing and special committees. I submit that
more and more we must show to any group of fellow citizens
who face difficulties-especially difficulties resulting from an
administrative decision-that we share their concern. I would
like to see the door of the Senate opened to permit citizens to
express their grievances, especially when they seem to have,
what we call in legal terms, a "colour of right".
On different occasions certain groups have very effectively
used our standing Senate committee system as a public platform to express their views and to try to justify their claims. I
think we have many precedents to that effect.
The specific case that comes to my mind dates back to 1973
when, after a motion by Senator Buckwold, seconded by our
beloved friend, the late Senator Maurice Bourget, the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications was
authorized to examine the problern of commercial publicity on
radio and television in order that both francophone and anglophone Canadian artists be protected against imported American publicity. The CBC and the CRTC were called to justify
their policies in respect to Canadian content. As a result of this
intervention by the Senate committee, an agreement was
reached to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. This, in my
view, is the Senate at its best.
Honourable senators, I think I have said enough to justify
our intervention following the inquiry notice by Senator Fournier and, as far as I am concerned, I submit that it would be a

pity not to permit the bottling industry to express their views
before a standing Senate committee.
For all these reasons, honourable senators, I move, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Edgar Fournier (MadawaskaRestigouche), that the matter regarding the adverse effects on
the Canadian economy of the banning of the 1.5 litre bottles
from the soft drink producers in Canada be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
Senator Buckwold: I move the adjournment of the debate.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I rise on a point of
order. This is an inquiry. I am not opposed to the motion in
substance, but I am opposed to the procedure whereby during
an inquiry, which is only debating a certain matter, a motion is
made to refer the matter to a committee without due notice.
Normally any motion of that kind would require at least one
day's notice. I would suggest that Senator Deschatelets give
notice that he intends to move tomorrow that this matter be
referred to committee; otherwise, we are concluding the debate
at this time. We are not going to debate the motion.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, if I may be
permitted an observation at this point: I have made this motion
because it is justified by at least one precedent. Senator
Desruisseaux will remember that he introduced an inquiry in
1975. After he completed his remarks, the Honourable Senator Asselin spoke, and at the end of his speech moved that the
subject matter be referred to the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce. This can be found at page
380 of the Journals of the Senate of May 27, 1975. I say this
only to meet the point that has been raised. I would agree to
the matter being taken under advisement by the Chair at this
time, and perhaps we could have a decision by tomorrow.
* (2100)

Senator Flynn: Alternatively, I would be agreeable to your
reverting to Notices of Motions and indicating that you will
move tomorrow that this matter be referred to a committee,
and let other people who want to speak on the inquiry do so. It
is only a technical matter, but tonight there are not very many
senators here and we may have been taken by surprise. That
may have occurred before, but it does not prove it was right.
Under the circumstances, I would agree to the suggestion that
the Speaker take it under advisement.
Senator Deschatelets: I would prefer to follow that course of
action, because when I make a motion I like to think that I am
on firm ground. This is the reason why I would like the Chair
to consider the matter. However, this would not prevent other
senators speaking on the inquiry tonight, with agreement.
Senator Oison: Further to the point of order, I think there is
substantial agreement between Senator Deschatelets and the
Leader of the Government, so I will not make any suggestions
on that. After having listened carefully to the speeches of
Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) and Senator Deschatelets, I wonder if between now and tomorrow, when they
and the Speaker are considering this matter, they might give
some thought to referring this to the Joint Committee on

SENATE DEBATES
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments rather than the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
It seemed to me that the argument being made was that
there was a delegated authority that was being used, flot
perhaps illegally but differently than it was intended to be
used. It therefore seems to me that for that reason it would be
better to have that joint committee looking into the matter.
My suggestion on the point of order is simply that between
now and when the formai motion is moved by Senator Deschatelets he might want to take that into account.

November 19, 1979

respectfuhly suggest to Senators Desehatelets and Fournier
that they might also consider sending this matter to the
Standing Senate Committee on f-ealth, Welfare and Science.
The fact is that it is a health matter, affecting a lot of people,
which is really the reason why the Mvinister of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs has abandoned it, because it is considered a
hazard, although, granted, it is a regulation. I amn only respectfu]Iy suggesting this, and I hope I have an opportunity to
continue the debate in due course.
My question at the moment is whether this is the proper
time to move the adjournment of the debate.

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY

SECOND REPORT OF STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE PRESENTED

Senator Godfrey, Joint Chairman of the Standing Joint
Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments, presented the second
report of the committee as follows:
Tuesday, November 20, 1979
The Standing Joint Committee on Regulations and
other Statutory Instruments has the honour to present its
Second Report as follows:

(Statutory Instruments No. 8)
Your committee submits again to both Houses of Parliament the criteria it will use for the review and scrutiny
of Statutory Instruments:
Whether any Regulation or other Statutory Instrument
within its terms of reference, in the judgment of the
committee:
1. (a) is not authorized by the terms of the enabling
statute, or, if it is made pursuant to the prerogative, its
terms are not in conformity with the common law; or
(b) does not clearly state therein the precise authority
for the making of the Instrument;
2. has not complied with the provisions of the Statutory
Instruments Act with respect to transmittal, recording,
numbering or publication;
3. (a) has not complied with any tabling provision or
other condition set forth in the enabling statute; or
(b) does not clearly state therein the time and manner
of compliance with any such condition;
4. makes some unusual or unexpected use of the powers
conferred by the enabling statute or by the prerogative;
5. trespasses unduly on the rights and liberties of the
subject;
6. (a) tends directly or indirectly to exclude the jurisdiction of the Courts without explicit authorization therefor in the enabling statute; or
(b) makes the rights and liberties of the subject dependent on administrative discretion rather than on the judicial process;
7. purports to have retroactive effect where the enabling statute confers no express authority so to provide
or, where such authority is so provided, the retroactive
effect appears to be oppressive, harsh or unnecessary;
8. appears for any reason to infringe the rule of law or
the rules of natural justice;
9. provides without good and sufficient reason that it
shall come into force before registration by the Clerk of
the Privy Council;
10. in the absence of express authority to that effect in
the enabling statute or prerogative, appears to amount to
the exercise of a substantive legislative power properly the
subject of direct parliamentary enactment, and not merely
to the formulation of subordinate provisions of a technical
or administrative character properly the subject of delegated legislation;

SENATE DEBATESNombr2,17
11l.without express provision to the effect having been
made in the cnabling statute or prerogative, imposes a
fine, irnprisonrnent or other penalty, or shifts the onus of
proof of innocence t0 the person accused of' an offence;
12. imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains
provisions requiring payment to be made to the Crown or
to any other authority in consideration of any license or
service to be rendered, or prescribes the amount of any
such charge or payment, without express authority to that
effect having been provided in the enabling statute or
preroga t ive;
13. is not in conformity with the Canadian Bill oj'
Rights;
14. is uncîcar in its meaning or otherwise defective in
its drafting;
15. for any other reason requires elucidation as Io its
formi or purport.
In relation 10 its permanent reference. section 26 of the
Statutory Instruments Act, 1970-71-72, c. 38, your comrnittce recoinmiends that it bc givcn ihe authority to
conduct a comprehensive study of the means by which
Parliamient can better oversec the governmnent regulatory
process and in particular to enquire into and report upon:
1. the appropriate principles and practices to be
observed,
(a) in the drafting of powcrs enabling delegates of
Parliament to make subordinate laws;
(b) in the enactmnent of statutory instruments:
(c) in the use of executive regulation-including dolegated powcrs and subordinate laws:
and the manner in which Parliamientary control should
bc effccted in respect of the saine;
2. the role, functions and powers of the Standing Joint

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators. this raises a problemi
that has been of concern to the Senate for quite somne time. I
appreciate the excellent work that the Banking, Trade and
Commerce Committce is doing, but we have been trying t0
avoid committee meetings while the Senate is sitting. I feel
that it is the general mood of the Senate that this should not
happen. In any event, I mcrely want t0 have the Senate express
its views on this malter.
I can understand that there may be comipelling reasons for
the comimittee t0 mieet tomorrow aftcrnoon. However. the
Senate sat last night and the committec had the opportunity to
sit aIl day today, and it can sit again on Thursday. It seems 10
mie that it is not in the interests of' the Senate that committees
should be able to do this. If one committee is meeting. another
commiitîce might want t0 meet, and with two comnmittees

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Olson: Honourable senators, I believe that if we are
going to authorize committees to sit while the Senate is sitting,
particularly during the preliminary period of each sitting,
which includes items such as the introduction of new bills,
down to when Orders of the Day are called, then it should be
for an extraordinary reason.
There will be times, I am sure, when the Banking, Trade
and Commerce Committee-which has done an excellent job
and has a very heavy work load-will have an extraordinary
reason for meeting while the Senate is sitting. On those
occasions we shall give the matter consideration. I do not
believe that any committee, as a matter of practice, should set
a regular meeting time while the Senate is sitting, whether it is
on Wednesday or any other day.
I also believe that if the Senate is going to be called to give
this authority to any one committee, there should be the
restriction that it will not meet until perhaps an hour or an
hour and a half after the Senate has commenced its sitting. I
was going to say that preferably it should not sit until Orders
of the Day are called, but that moment is difficult to predict,
because we have had Question Periods lasting from 15 minutes
to slightly over an hour.
Senator Flynn: Sometimes two hours.
Senator Olson: Therefore, it is not easy to predict that
moment with any precision. But I should think that from an
hour to an hour and a half would be a reasonable time.
I wish to say also that if we turn an ad hoc set of circumstances into a practice and a precedent so that any committee
may meet at the same time every week while the Senate is
sitting, it pre-empts the option for another committee which
may have an extraordinary reason for asking the Senate to
authorize it to sit while the Senate is sitting. That, in my
opinion would be an unjustifiable and unwarranted precedent.
Last week the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee
sought leave to sit on Wednesday afternoon while the Senate
was sitting. No doubt it had good reason for doing so, and
perhaps there is good reason for the committee to sit tomorrow. But I would suggest that we should not be led down this
path to the point of authorizing this arrangement unless there
is a very good sufficient and, I may say, extraordinary reason
for doing so. It may be that there are witnesses from outside
the city to be heard, or some important reason of that nature.
I have to agree with the Leader of the Government that I
would not wish to approve this procedure as a matter of
practice, particularly during the first hour or hour and a half
of the sitting of the Senate.
Senator Walker: Honourable senators, I have been a
member of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee for
the past 16 years and I know its workload, and I appreciate the
work done by the chairman of the committee, Senator
Hayden. He is doing a most excellent job. It just happens that
at this particular time we have under study the subject matter
of the bill to revise the Bank Act. We are striving valiantly to
complete that study, and we must complete it. We cannot have
any more delays such as we have had in the past.

80072-26

The committee sat from 9.30 this morning until 4.30 this
afternoon, and except for the first hour tomorrow afternoon,
when we will be here in the chamber, we are sitting all day
tomorrow.
I appreciate that it is absolutely essential that we be in the
house every possible moment of our time, but we do have these
other commitments. We are also faced with new developments
in the Senate, where the Question Period now lasts for an hour
to an hour and a half-and it is all very entertaining. As a
matter of fact, it is brilliant. I am amazed how able everyone
is, particularly those people who day after day engage in
asking and answering the questions. The Question Period now
represents some of the most brilliant displays we have in the
house. I have to tear myself away to go to committee. It is a
sacrifice I do not make easily. All the actors are good, and
they are getting better day by day. We expect more and more,
and they never disappoint us.
Therefore, I beg of you at this time to have consideration for
those of us who, against our wishes, have to tear ourselves
away from the show to perform our duty as we see it-a duty
we are performing under the expert guidance of Senator
Hayden, who does not waste any time. All the time we are in
committee, we are engaged in serious work. Until we get this
banking legislation through, I beg of you to let us slip away
from our joy after half an hour or an hour to enable us to go
down the hall and carry out our other duties. I would ask the
Senate to give this matter its very serious consideration. The
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee has a heavy workload ahead of it, and without your consideration I do not know
how far we are going to get.
That is my contribution as one who is not an officer but
merely a humble member of that committee.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Lang: Honourable senators, while I appreciate the
remarks of Senator Walker, I am satisfied that this problem
would vanish if some ephemeral persons, be it the whips or the
leaders, would stop trying to preclude us-and when I say
"us," I mean the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee-preclude us from sitting on Wednesday mornings, as has
been our habit from time immemorial. If we could go back to
that time slot, we would not have to be repeatedly asking for
leave to sit while the Senate is sitting.
The reason, of course, is that many people here feel they
have to attend caucus meetings. Those of us who spend most of
our time and energy on such committees as the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee could not care less whether
we attend caucus. Without this injunction or influence in
trying to preclude the committee from sitting on Wednesday
mornings, I feel sure that the committee could carry on
adequately, as it has in the past. If the committee could sit on
Wednesday mornings, the problem we are discussing this
evening would vanish.
Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, I have always been
baffled as to why sittings of this house should take precedence
over committee work. Committees of the other place, as a

SENATE DEBATES
general rule, start their work at 3.30 in the afternoon, allowing
members of those committees to be in the house for the
Question Period. As everyone here knows, after 3.30 on a
Wednesday afternoon there is never more than 30 senators in
the chamber. I do not see any reason why senators not in the
chamber should not be sitting in committees from 3.30 on. The
work of the committees of the Senate is usually more important than what we do in the chamber. I see nothing wrong with
committees meeting at 3.30 in the afternoon, as Senator Olson
suggests. Those senators in the house at that time could then
go to committee instead of going to their offices.
* (2020)

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I happen to be the
chairman of a caucus, and I used to attend al] caucuses. I
think attending caucus is part of our duties. If I were a
Conservative I would like to attend the caucus of my colleagues. Perhaps this opinion is not shared by my friend,
Senator Lang, but I think the caucus is a very important
institution in our democratic society. This is why I think that
when caucuses are sitting senators should be there and
nowhere else.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, we have heard an
expression of viewpoints from a number of distinguished senators now, many of whom have had extensive experience in
provincial legislative assemblies and in the other place. Several
have been invested with ministerial responsibility, such as the
distinguished Senator Walker. Let me say at the outset that I
do not think there is a more competent committee in all of
Canada than the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce, chaired by Senator Hayden. This is a
committee of undoubted ability, and one which does inestimable service on behalf of the Canadian people. Perhaps the
quality of that service is not properly appreciated at times by
people in various walks of life; nevertheless, those of us who
know the committee know its value. As well, we have other
outstanding Senate committees.
There is a feature of the parliamentary system known to all
of us who have been practitioners of the art, and that is that at
the outset of the day's sitting, insofar as it is humanly possible,
as many members of the assembly as can do so are present to
participate in the Question Period, raising matters and concerns that are of interest to the people they serve. They focus
the attention of that assembly on matters of urgent public
importance. That Question Period is a very key responsibility
and an important feature of our parliamentary system. Insofar
as the period of questioning is a vital and historie responsibility
of parliamentarians, the Senate should attempt to observe and
to enhance this tradition.
The second matter I wish to raise relates to the heavy
workload of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce. It does have a great deal of work-and
critical work, as far as Canada is concerned-before it. I do
not believe, that in conscience we can say to this or any other
committee, "Under no circumstances may you sit on Wednesday afternoons," and that Wednesdays must be ruled out
absolutely for meetings of standing committees. That would be
[Senator Godfrey.]

November 20, 1979

unreasonable. I suggest it is reasonable, however, honourable
senators-and usually we find a middle way in matters which
pose difficulties for us-that if there is an urgent, clear and
evident need for a committee meeting on a Wednesday afternoon, a conscious effort should be made to keep the Question
Period for that day to a reasonable length and to attempt to
assure that only questions of real importance are asked on such
an occasion. Needless to say, Senator Walker, invariably we
on this side endeavour to present only matters of urgent
importance.
Senator Walker: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: That would certainly shorten the Question
Period.
Senator Perrault: But it seems to me that we might dispose
of these preliminaries-if one may term the Question Period
as part of the preliminaries-in 60 minutes. If we insist that
any committees with an urgent need to meet may not meet
until the Senate has disposed of a Question Period without
time limits, that would make it very difficult for witnesses who
have been invited to appear. Some could be required to wait in
the hall for as long as two hours in order to allow the whole
Senate questioning process to be exhausted.
As a possible solution, may I suggest that we could authorize any committee with an undoubted need to meet to commence their deliberations at either the end of the Question
Period or at 3 o'clock or 3.15 p.m., whichever time comes first.
It scems to me that in that way we may achieve all of the
objectives that most of us, I am sure, feel to be desirable. If it
can be demonstrated that a Wednesday afternoon committee
meeting is required-and I have no doubt that a meeting is
required tomorrow afternoon, as Senator Walker and others
have stated-then I think we can resolve this question amieably, and without causing harm to the parliamentary system
and without engaging in practices and procedures that are
contrary to the great parliamentary tradition.
Senator Flynn: If a meeting of the committee has been
arranged and witnesses called, and if inconvenience would
result if the committee did not meet, I suggest that we could
permit them to meet tomorrow. I would ask the chairman and
the other fighting members of the committee, such as Senator
Walker and Senator Lang, to look into the matter in the light
of the comments that have been made this evening. If the same
request is made next week, perhaps consideration should be
given to meeting at, say, 3 o'clock. Would that be agreeable to
Senator Hayden?
Senator Hayden: I really do not know why you are asking
my opinion. You have already named a committee to study the
situation. While it might seem appropriate that you should ask
the opinion of the chairman-he might know something about
the subject-the meeting has been arranged. There have been
mumbles and rumbles from time to time, even from the Leader
of the Government, about sitting on Wednesday afternoons,
but nothing has been done.
My only concern was that I did not want to give up all of
Wednesday without making some use of part of the day. We

November 20, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

gave up on Wednesday mornings, but planned to sit on
Wednesday afternoons. The meetings have now been
organized.
The house leader is pressing me as to how much longer we
are going to take in our consideration of the revision of the
Bank Act. He is asking when we are going to finish our study
of the subject matter of Bill C-17. From the government's
point of view, this is an important bill and, therefore, we are
moving our study along. Then we have these forces pulling
back and forth, to suit the purpose of the particular person
who is talking to the chairman.
It takes time to do the work. It takes time to hear the
witnesses on important bills. If it is not the wish of the Senate
that we move along with ail speed, and that we do not
contemplate sitting on Wednesdays at ail, then the Senate can
make that direction, and there is nothing the committee can do
about it. It will slow up the work, but that is obviously not the
number one consideration.
The government leader in his remarks was a little concerned
that this might hurt my feelings, but he should not be unduly
concerned about my feelings.
Senator Flynn: I have always been concerned.
Senator Hayden: I have not struggled and moved along as
many years as I have with a thin skin, so whatever has to be
said, let it be said.
However, the meeting tomorrow is important. The witnesses
have been organized and, therefore, one would expect the
committee to sit, especially since this matter was not discussed
with me today. If we suddenly notify the witnesses that they
should not come tomorrow, then next time they may well say
that it is not convenient for them to come to us. Then you have
further delays.
This is a decision for the Senate, and that decision may
make it impossible to use some part of Wednesday for our
committee meetings. No one wants to meet on Wednesday
evenings, although I can tell you that there have been times
when this committee has met on Wednesday evenings with no
protests from the members. However, it is up to the Senate to
decide, but I feel the committee and the chairman are entitled
to some notice.
The only intimation I had that this might happen was when
I requested the Clerk to prepare a motion so that we could
meet when the Senate was sitting. At that time, I called the
house leader and was told that he would be in at 5 o'clock, and
that he would be in touch with me. He was in touch with me,
but only when I walked over to his desk a few minutes ago.
This is the only intimation I have had. Whatever the decision
is, we have to take it.
0 (2030)
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I am not sure whether
I can add anything to the debate that has taken place on this
subject, except to say that I think the outlines of a reasonable
compromise are clearly in sight. As house leader it is in my
interest, as I am sure it is in the interest of ail here, that we
should be able to resolve these questions in a manner that

would seem to be reasonable to aIl parties concerned, and I
certainly include as foremost among those the chairman and
members of the committee.
It is probably not particularly fruitful to recount the recent
history, but seeing that my name has been brought into the
discussion I think it proper for me to say that last Wednesday,
when the same motion came before the house, I was unable to
present it myself, and I told the chairman of the committee
that I thought it would be a good idea if he presented it in view
of the circumstances, because at that time I explained to him
some of the views I had had communicated to me as to
whether or not we should meet on Wednesday afternoon. I
have to admit, quite frankly, that I was not successful in
persuading the chairman of the committee that this intimation
should be considered as a portent of things to come, because I
think from his point of view, very justifiably, he has been
concerned as to whether the committee could meet at any time
on Wednesday. I know it is the feeling of some members of the
committee that there is absolutely no reason why the committee should not meet on Wednesday morning, because there is a
difference of view as to the importance of attending the caucus
at that particular time.
Speaking for myself, it would possibly be a very productive
course to consider whether we should not adopt the suggestion
put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and by the
Leader of the Government, to the effect that if we wish the
committee to meet on Wednesday then it might meet at some
fixed time, say 3 o'clock, when the Question Period might
normally be finished or pretty close to being finished. That
would meet the ends that the speakers in this debate have in
view, namely, that there should be a good attendance of
senators at the Question Period and in the early part of the
sitting when so much important business is done. It is certainly
conceivable that at the time that Orders of the Day are
reached it would be not derogatory at aIl to our duty to have
this committee meet at that time to conduct its very important
business.
I am here to say that the committee has an important place
in our structure, and, speaking for myself as house leader, I
have the responsibility of presenting to the chairman of the
committee the hopes of the government as to the passage of
bills through their consideration phase in that committee. And
I have to say that the chairman of the committee has never
failed to be courteous and obliging to me whenever I have
given him any suggestions as to the order in which we would
like to have the bills considered, and the urgency of dealing
with them expeditiously. So I want to pay my compliments to
him. He bas been unfailingly courteous and unfailingly attentive to the requests I have had to make in that way, and I
would like to have that fact recorded.
It seems to me that if this committee could meet Tuesday
mornings, as it did today, as a pretty regular matter, and on
Tuesday afternoons, then I would not be surprised if the
pressure for Wednesday meetings was somewhat reduced. It
might be possible to avoid Wednesday meetings at any time. I
say that because when I was discussing the passage of bills

SENATE DEBATESNoebr2.97
through thie cornnittee, the chairman and 1 sat down and we
made a rough estirnate of the number of meetings required t0
move the bis through the committee. We spoke about the
bank bill, the lax bill and thc morîgage interest bill and whiie
our estimates were nothing but estimates they did indicate that
with any kind of iuck with meetings on Tuesday mornings and
Tuesday afternoons and Thursday mornings there was a very
good chance that we wouid be able to compiete the bis within
the aihotted lime. 1 arn the first to say that if that shouid prove
to be unrealizabie or difficuit 1 would have t0 support the view
of the Leader of the Opposition, and 1 think of the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition, that there wouid be circumstances in
which we would urge the committce 10 meet on Wednesday, if
neeessary. in order to comple the program we have in mmnd
for the disposai of legisiation.
So, 1 simpiy say to the house that I lbink we have the
makings of a very reasonable compromise here. M4y proposai
wouid be that Tuesday mornings oughî t0 be dedicatcd to this
commitlee. 1 aiso think that if the house were 10 give this
commitlee ieavc 10 meet on Wednesday afternoons when the
Question Period is over, that wouid be a reasonabie suggestion,
and it seems 10 me that with those two lime periods biocked
off, or aI icasî avaiiabie f'or consideration from time 10 time,
especiaiiy Wednesday aflernoons, that we wouid meel the
objective of conîinuing the excellent work that this commitcee
does, aiiowing people 10 go to caucus, and at the same lime
rcspecting the position of the house on Wednesday aftcrnoons.
1 do nol know wbat the committce iîscîf, which 1 think
shouid cerîainiy be consuited in respect of Ibis malter. wouid
îhink about il, but I know that îbcy wiii consider il carefuiiy.
But il does sem 10 nie that there is the basis for a reasonabie,
working compromise bere. It bas been fioating around; il bas
been in the air; il bas been discussed in an unofficiai manner
on severai occasions before. If wc are able 10 gel il adopîed, tl
wouid enabie us Io mccl ahl our objectives. and make sure that
the work of the eommitcc is done and that the work of the
Senate is donc.
Senator Beaubien: Honourable senators, we bave bad an
intercsling discussion, and in many ways wbaî bas been said by

We have been waiting f'or tbrcc years 10 gel tbe Bank Act

Senator Molson: Ycs, a few years ago in the Ruies Committee we cbanged the ruies. On the inside cover of the rule book
you wiil sec "Question Period." The Question Period did flot

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
SMALL BUSINESSES
BANKRUPTCIES-MEASURES TO ASSIST

Senator Perrault: Hlonourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of State for Economic Development.
The by-eîection events of yesterday, Mr. Minister, suggesî
aI least some dissatisfaction wiîh the policies and the actions of
the new governmenî since May 22. As well, the resulîs appear
10 reflect a concern on the part of many smalî businessmen
regarding their current position. Can the minister tell us the
number of smalî business bankruplcies that have occurred
since May 22?
Senator Flynn: Because of the situation prior 10 May 22?
Senator Perrault: Can the minister tell us as welI what
measures are going forward on an urgent basis 10 help the
smaîî businessmen in this country who, 1 suspect, provided a
great deal of support for the Conservative Party during the
general election campaign in the hope that something wouîd be
donc for îhem.
Senator de Cotret: WeII, honourable senator, 1 wiII be happy
to provide you with the exact statistics on the number of
bankruptcies since mid-May or the first of June-I arn not
sure which, but 1 will have 10 take that question under notice,
as you are weII aware.
With respect 10 the measures we are looking at in terms of
smaîl business, I shouîd like 10 assure the honourable senator

and members of the Senate that we are conscious of the
difficulties that small businesses in this country face and have
faced for many years: problems dealing with management
skills and problemrs dealing wiîh availabiliîy of financial
resources for expansion of equity capital. There are a number
of specific proposaIs that are under study at the moment that
will be announiced in the near future. Some will probably be
announced in the budget of December 11.
I shouîd also like 10 reiterate la the honourable senalor a
statement 1 made to this chamber onîy a week or two ago,
namely, that we were monitoring closely the impact of the
interest rate situation in North America on our small
businesses.
We have a bill before the other chamber the purpose of
which is to increase the capaciîy of the Federal Business
Development Bank, which caters to the financial needs of the
small business in this country. That bill will allow il to further
ils activity in this field. Certainly that is a bill that 1 hope
members of the opposition in the other place will see fit t0 pass
expeditiously and that will pass through this chamber expediîiously. We are acting on a number of fronts and we wiIl
continue 10 do s0 in the interests of small business in this
country.
Senator Perrault: 1 have a supplementary, Mr. Minister.
The governmenî has told us many times during this current
session that they are "~monitoring" certain situations "closely"
and that they are "watching things" closely and are in the
process of "evoiving policies" after "studying the situation"
carefully. Can the smali businessmen expect some positive
remedial action in the forîhcoming budget? Has a date yet
been set for the production of Ihat budget? This is an urgent
malter.
Senator Oison: December 11.
Senator de Cotret: The Minister of Finance announced
several days ago the exact date of the budget. It wiIl be
December Il. It was given wide publicity. 1 amn happy 10
reiterate that information for the Honourable Leader of the
Opposition in this chamber.
Senator Perrault: The budget has been promised and the
date has been changed several limes.
Senator de Cotret: I don't believe so. I think if you look at
the record il will show that there was no date set except the
date of December I1. The budget wilI be brought down aI that
time and the Minister of Finance wiII explain exactly the fiscal
situation thal this country faces and the economic situation
that this country faces and the measures that we, the government, intend t0 bring forward 10 deal with the difficulties and
the opportunities and the potential we have in front of us.
Senator Oison: Would the minister give us the benefit of the
resulîs of their monitoring of the problerrs that have corne
about as a result of the change in interest rates, especially 10
small businessmen? If there has been any monitoring, we have
no indication of what the resulîs of that monitoring have
indicated.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator de Cotret: Well, there has certainly been a monitoring of the situation in terms of the availability of credit; in
terms of the access to financial institutions on the part of small
businesses. We are looking at that situation closely. There is
no question that we are living in a period where interest rates
are very high. There are costs associated with those high
interest rates. They are not a phenomenon unique to this
country.
I went to great lengths to explain the interrelationships
between our interest rate structure in this country and the
interest rate structure of our neighbour to the south. It is
certainly something that at the moment is creating difficulties
for certain sectors of our economy, and we are following the
impacts of these policies very closely.

IRAN--CANADIAN

INITIATIVE AT UNITED NATIONS

Senator Bosa: I have a supplementary question. In view of
the apparent stalemate in the United States embassy situation,
would the minister undertake to discuss with his colleague the
Secretary of State for External Affairs the possibility of
Canada taking an initiative at the United Nations by urging
the members of that body to speak out and show their solidarity in upholding international law, diplomatie immunity and
the sanctity of embassies?

Senator Olson: I will ask some supplementary questions
tomorrow.
Senator Perrault: There is a time factor.

Senator Asselin: I think the Secretary General of the General Assembly of the United Nations has already made a
statement on the situation in Iran and has urged the Iranian
people to release the hostages being held in the United States
embassy. We must not go too far on this question, because we
are afraid to endanger the safety of Canadians in Iran. I
therefore do not think we should take the initiative of raising
this question again at the United Nations.

IRAN

SAFETY OF CANADIANS

Senator Macquarrie: Honourable senators, I should like to
ask Senator Asselin, who answers questions in the Senate on
external affairs, about the situation in Iran. I recognize that I
am following up on the very perceptive and thoughtful question of my former and present colleague, Senator Oison,
yesterday.
Can the minister advise us if there has been any development respecting Canadians in Iran, particularly those in the
embassy, and further if there has been any development of our
country's attitude or action in this very serious and grave
situation in which our ally and neighbour, the United States,
finds itself as a result of the outrageous actions of the Government of Iran.
Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, i can only repeat
what I said in this house.
It is obvious that the Canadian government is following very
closely the explosive situation in Iran. It is quite obvious as
well that the holding of American hostages deeply concerns us.
We do not know exactly what will be their fate. The fact is
that we did not directly intervene with the Ayatollah Khomeini
up to now. We have been reassured by the Iranian chargé
d'affaires here in Ottawa that there is no danger, that the
safety of the 48 Canadians now in Iran is not jeopardized.
However, as a precaution, we have asked our ambassador in
Iran with whom we have hourly contacts to urge and advise
those Canadians who do not have to remain in Iran to leave
the country.
The ambassador has told us that so far the safety of
Canadians is not threatened but of course if something rather
special comes up he will immediately take the necessary steps
to warn us.
[Senator Oison.]

ADOPTION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN-

FEDERAL AID

Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I have a question
to put to the Leader of the Government. By way of preamble, I
should like to say that I am sure all senators recognize the very
real contribution that outstanding Canadian families have
made in taking into their homes and legally adopting children
who are seriously handicapped.
Since the Government of the United States has a program
called "Program Title 20," which provides subsidized granting
for the care of such children to adopting families; in view of
the fact that both Ontario and Saskatchewan have also subsidized adopting programs for these severely physically handicapped children; and in view of the fact that if these children
were not legally adopted the federal government would be
paying the costs through the Canadian Children's Aid Society
or to other sources of foster homes to subsidize the treatment
and welfare of these children, will the federal government,
through the Department of National Health and Welfare,
provide cost-sharing for these subsidized adoptions? Secondly,
will the federal government now give up insisting that its
subsidized share to adoptive parents must be considered as
taxable income?
Senator Flynn: I thank Senator Thompson for having given
me notice of his intention to ask this question.
I have been able to determine that the program of assistance
to adoptive parents of seriously handicapped children meets ail
the requirements for shared cost programs under the Canada
Assistance Program. There is absolutely no intention on the
part of the federal government to cease or diminish its 50 per
cent contribution.
With regard to the senator's concern about the taxable
nature of this assistance, unfortunately I have not been able to

November 20, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

contact the appropriate official, but i will do so and report as
soon as possible.
Senator Thompson: Thank you very much.
[Translation]
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
SEARCH OF PROFESSOR'S HOME

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, I should like to put
a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I
am not doing so because he is Minister of Justice and Attorney
General of Canada but mostly because he is government
leader.
I do not know whether or not this question bas been put to
him before, but I am referring to the news published in the
newspaper La Presse on November 12 concerning the accusation, or rather the inquiry into a university professor, Mr.
Hugh George Hambleton of Laval University in Quebec City
who is allegedly suspected of spying for the Soviet Union.
I must say, for the information of the minister, that this case
was first spread around by the TV station Télé-Capitale of
Quebec City. To my utter surprise, it was later confirmed by
the Superintendant of the RCMP. In this regard, La Presse
wrote as follows, and I quote:
In Ottawa, a spokesman for the RCMP, Superintendent John Bentham, revealed that thorough searches have
been made and that the inquiry was being pursued with a
view to determining whether or not the Official Secrets
Act had been violated.
The RCMP suspect the professor of having provided
information in writing to a Soviet agent in exchange for
sums of money.
According to that report and the statement of the Superintendent, the inquiry has not been completed. I wonder if the
minister would give the Senate the assurance that he will ask
his colleague the Solicitor General, who is responsible for the
RCMP, to give instructions to put a stop to this type of
reputation-mongering, which publishing the results of an
inquiry while it is still underway constitutes, especially before
the RCMP is in a position to make complaints or accusations.
Senator Flynn: I want to assure Honourable Senator Langlois that his description of RCMP activities is totally
unfounded.
Channel 4 in Quebec City heard about the searches and
reported on them after meeting with the person in question. I
myself saw on television that this person admitted to being
searched, and gave many details on this matter. All the
publicity around this arose not out of RCMP information but
out of information which came from the media in Quebec
City.
The inquiry is still ongoing and has not reached any conclusion as of yet. As Senator Langlois mentioned, this is a matter
for my colleague, the Solicitor General who is responsible for
the RCM P. But I can say that if there were indiscretions, it is
not the RCMP who is responsible but rather the media and
maybe in fact the person who was searched.

I must also add that I discussed the possibility of prohibiting
the media from mentioning that a search had taken place, so
long as charges had not been laid, unless the person searched
agreed to give out the information. I know that even this
suggestion was not well received.
Of course, when the media are aware of facts related to a
search, of law enforcers invading some place and coming out
with piles of documents and what have you, they make it
known to the public. It is impossible to prohibit them from
doing so. Again, it is not the police, it is not the RCMP who
gave out the information.
Senator Langlois: As a supplementary, first perhaps my
honourable friend will allow me to set the facts straight.
I got the statement by Mr. Hambleton that was reproduced
a week after confirmation by Superintendent John Bentham
concerning the gossip of Channel 4. That is what I object to,
and I ask the minister to discuss this with his colleague to see
if there is a way of issuing directives to stop the confirming of
gossip that is published indiscriminately in the newspapers.
Senator Flynn: I too read a lot of comments in the newspapers about that. I always noticed the representatives of the
RCMP were refusing to give information. But they had to
admit that a search had taken place. The facts were there.
They were known to the media. But once again it is not the
RCMP that gave the information.
I suggest, honourable senators, that it might be premature
to use the word "gossip". I have nothing to say about that
inquiry until the findings are made public.
Senator Langlois: But what I am asking the minister-this
is my last question on the subject-is that he asks his colleague
whether it would be possible to issue directives to stop the
RCMP from confirming anything that is published in the
newspapers?
Senator Flynn: I do not have to give my colleague such
directives. He knows what he has to do. The RCMP know
what they have to do. I say that in this case I consider from
what I have been able to see that the RCMP behaved perfectly
and unfortunately it is the media that said a lot of things. If
you ask the RCMP if it is true that they made a search in such
or such a place when everybody knows full well they did, what
do you want the RCMP to answer? No, it is not true. They
said: Yes, it is true. But there is no other conclusion.
As far as I saw, that was the only information given by the
RCMP, whatever the interpretation La Presse might place on
those facts. I tell you, I know, I was aware of the situation and
I refused to make any comment, as did the RCMP. But the
media have ways of cross-cutting answers, yes and no, et
cetera, and to make a whole story out of it. That is the
responsibility of the media. It is not the responsibility of the
RCMP or the minister.
Senator Langlois: I regret to insist again that the minister
might allow me to repeat what the RCMP is reported as
having statedSenator Flynn: Is "reported" as having stated.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Langlois: Well, it is reported in the paper, and the
name of Superintendent John Bentham is there:
The RCMP suspect the professor of having provided
information in writing to a Soviet agent in exchange for
sums of money.
That is more than confirmed, it is adding to the gossip.
Senator Flynn: No, no, I do not read the paper the same
way you do. I say it is a conclusion the paper draws from the
fact that was known, that there had been a search. It is the
paper that says the RCMP suspect him. It is obviously easy to
draw that conclusion if there is a search.
Senator Langlois: Did Superintendent Bentham make that
statement to the papers?
Senator Flynn: Not that I know.
Senator Langlois: Can you check for us?

November 20, 1979

Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Nurgitz, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Macquarrie, for the second reading of the Bill C-23,
intituled: "An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain
sums of money for the public service for the financial year
ending the 31st March, 1980".-(Honourable Senator
Perrault, P.C.).

Senator Perrault: I yield to the Honourable Senator Everett.
Senator Everett: Honourable senators, Bill C-23 is an
appropriation bill in which we will vote supply for ninetwelfths of the main estimates and all of supplementary estimates (A).
We have been treated to an explanation of the bill by
Senator Nurgitz, and I would like to thank him on behalf of
the Senate for his excellent exposition, and also, since I did not
have an opportunity earlier to do so publicly, to welcome him
to the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

TRANSPORT
WHITEHORSE, YUKON TERRITORY -NEW
BUILDING

AIRPORT TERMINAL

Senator Lucier: I have a question for the Minister of State
for Economic Development, which he may wish to take as
notice.
In a letter from Mr. D. J. Dewar, Western Regional
Administrator for Transport Canada, concerning a new air
terminal building for Whitehorse, I was advised that "current
planning is directed toward constructing a new air terminal
building in the fiscal year 1979-80." That letter was dated
December 13, 1976. That is a deadline which obviously will
not be met.
I wonder if the minister can advise me what plans his
government might have concerning the new terminal building
in Whitehorse, and when it will now be built?
Senator de Cotret: I shall be happy to take that question as
notice and provide the house with whatever remedial action we
are planning to expedite a matter that obviously was left
dormant by the previous government.
Senator Lucier: It may be a good idea for the minister to
ascertain whether the previous government allowed the matter
to drop.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I understand that
royal assent is scheduled for 9.45 p.m. In view of this I suggest
that opposition followers and supporters exercise restraint in
asking questions at this time.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1979-80
SECOND READING

On the Order:
iSenator Flynn.]

Senator Everett: Senator Nurgitz is an outstanding lawyer
from Winnipeg, a former President of the Progressive Conservative Party, and a man who, in my terms, as a Liberal in
Manitoba, has had an enviable track record in electing Conservatives-I regret to say.
Senator Flynn: You are a Conservative in Manitoba?
Senator Everett: I won't answer that.
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has
examined supplementary estimates (A), and is in the course of
examining the main estimates. There are 12 votes in the supply
bill in which we are asked to grant full supply.
That is an unusual situation, because until the main estimates are passed by Parliament we are usually asked to grant
only nine-twelfths of supply. However, these votes refer to
summer programs, and programs where payments are to be
made prior to December 31.
There are four votes in which only eleven-twelfths of the
expenditure have been met under Governor General's warrants, and, indeed, the granting of full supply, does contravene
the general rule of Parliament. In this case, I think Parliament
is wise to accede. These expenditures were covered by Governor General's warrants and, as Senator Nurgitz has so ably
explained, those warrants should be included in the first supply
bill.
* (2110)

In the course of examining the President of the Treasury
Board, we were told that the main estimates total $52.9 billion
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1980, and that it was
estimated that, when they were tabled by the former government, there would be an additional $1.35 billion in supplementary estimates, bringing total expenditures for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1980, to $54.25 billion.
The government at that time had said that, through lapses
in spending and the repayment of loans, spending in the fiscal
year 1979-80 would be held to $52.6 billion. Already we have

November 20, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

had supplementary estimates (A) and (B), which total over $2
billion, and supplementary estimates (C) are still to come.
I quote the President of the Treasury Board:
-it is clear that the $52.6 billion spending ceiling is
completely unrealistic.
I can say to honourable senators that I am very disappointed
to hear that. While it may be justified in the circumstances, I
do think that the former government was keeping its spending
under control. Yet we have the situation today in which the
President of the Treasury Board has said that the spending
ceiling is completely unrealistic. I hope by that he does not
mean that spending ceilings ought to disappear, because I
think they are a useful discipline. I would hope that the
President of the Treasury Board would, after some thought on
his part, reinstitute them.
Honourable senators, I should like to make three very brief
points in respect of the estimates and this supply bill. While
they do not directly relate to the supply bill, they do put it in a
context which will allow us to better understand it.
I should like to view this bill, first of ail, from the point of
view of government spending. I think we are ail agreed that we
have to bring government spending under control. There are
those who say we must do so because government deficits lead
to inflation. That is the popular conventional wisdom. But I
suggest to you that, in fact, there is no empirical data to prove
that statement. Inflation can be controlled, even in a deficit
situation, by other means.
If one looks back in history, one finds there have been many
times when, through periods of high deficits, there has been
virtually no inflation. So, we do not have to control spending,
in my judgement, because it leads to inflation. I believe we
have to control spending and eliminate deficits simply because
deficit spending prevents us from employing the sound fiscal
measures that will make our economy more efficient and more
productive. That is the reason for controlling government
spending.
The Economic Council, in its recent report entitled "Two
Cheers for the Eighties," brought out an interesting point
about fiscal measures. The savings rate in Canada is, I believe,
in the neighbourhood of 10 per cent-I see Senator Austin
indicating more, so I shall amend my statement to say more
than 10 per cent-whereas the savings rate in the United
States is less than 5 per cent. Why is the savings rate in
Canada double that of the United States? Why does that
occur?
Weil, the Economic Council says that Canada, through its
fiscal policies relating to the deduction of the first $1,000 in
interest, the deductions for RHOSPs and RRSPs, and other
tax deduction measures, encourages people to save, whereas
the fiscal measures in the United States discourage savings. I
think that is one of the most dramatic examples of how useful
fiscal policy can be in creating a more efficient and effective
economy.
Honourable senators will recall that Mr. Carter said a buck
is a buck; that there was no special emphasis to be placed by

taxation on any objective. Well, I think he was quite wrong,
and I think this proves that fiscal measures are important in
directing an economy. If we want more multiple housing built,
allow an income tax deduction for MURBs. Another example
is the money that is today pouring into oil exploration from
individuals because of a fiscal measure.
These fiscal measures are important. They are effective. The
reason you control government spending, the reason you eliminate deficits, is to have the ability to bring into play those
kinds of measures. If you are in a deficit situation, as we are
today, you can only do so much, and the result is that you are
precluded from doing many things that you should be doing.
The question, then, is how to control spending. The President of the Treasury Board gave us some suggestions in this
regard, and I should like now to read from his testimony
before the National Finance Committee, as follows:
There is room for a committee such as yours, Mr.
Chairman, to come back with some suggestions as to
where you feel there has been an overly, if you like,
generous request for funds.
And then the following exchange:
THE CHAIRMAN: As a supplementary, are you talking
about suggestions that would reduce the current spending,
or about suggestions that would affect future estimates?
HON. MR. STEVENS: I would say, sir, both, in that I
think there is room for suggestion, and certainly we will
respond to any suggestions that this committee wishes to
make concerning current spending in the fiscal year 1980.
THE CHAIRMAN: That is, to amend the blue book?
HON. MR. STEVENS: Yes. It will probably be reflected
in our next supplementary estimates. We shall be bringing
in the supplementary estimates (C) in February or March
and it could be reflected there.
That is an amazing suggestion from the President of the
Treasury Board, but in fact it will not work. The spending
estimates are far too large to allow for that kind of manipulation. Suggestions could be made, but they could not be incorporated into the spending estimates, and anyone who has spent
some tirne with them knows that this is not a feasible method.
A method used by the previous government, a government
of whose party I am a member, was global cuts in spending.
The trouble with them is that the savings have to come from
within departments, with the result that departments kill
programs in order to get more effective programs going, but do
not really look at what makes programs tick. Global cuts work
while the pressure is on, but as soon as the pressure comes off
the spending goes right back up.
* (2120)

The present government has suggested an innovation in the
global cuts system. This is known as the "envelope" system
which, if I understand it correctly, means that instead of the
savings coming from one department for a prograrn that is
being launched or expanded by that department, there are a
series of departments that relate to each other in an envelope,

would prevent the sort of rigid price rises that corne out of,
say, agreed-upon pay increases. He has since changed his mind
and has corne to the conclusion that one of the reasons for
inflation can be laid at the door of indexation. He has done a

I do not know that I have corne down on either side. It seems
to me that if there is inflation, there will be indexation of one
form or another. For example, if you reduce the term of
mortgages to one year, you have effectively indexed them. If
labour contracts get down to one year, they are indexed. One
way or the other you will have indexation of all those segments
of the economy that can look after themselves. Of course,
there will be no indexation of those segments that cannot look
after themselves.
I would say yes, I am still in favour of indexation because
the only way in which you can control inflation is not to feed it
with additional money. In other words, until you control the
money aggregates and say they will grow at a reasonable level,
it does not really matter whether you have indexation or not.
You will have inflation, and one way or the other people will
index against that inflation. I do not corne down on either side.
The side I corne down on is the present policy of the Governor
of the Bank of Canada to control the money aggregates.
Senator Thompson: I wonder if I might ask a question?
The Hon. the Speaker: I should like to draw the attention of
honourable senators to the fact that we are in a time bind in
view of the possibility of the arrival of the Deputy of His
Excellency the Governor General. I do not want to cut off the
debate, but we are fairly close to our time limit.

Although the expenditures financed by special warrant were
legally appropriated, the government's view is that they should
be confirmed by Parliament, which is why the special warrant
is referred to in clause 3 of this bill.
The specific items covered by he special warrant pertaining
to the last fiscal year are detailed in the Report on Supplementary Estimates (B), 1978-79, which was made available to
honourable senators after being tabled by the President of the
Treasury Board in the other place on October l1, 1979.

The Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform the Senate that if
the Honourable Senator Nurgitz speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate on second reading of this
bill.
Senator Nurgitz: Honourable senators, I shall attempt to be
brief. When I concluded yesterday, Senator Connolly asked
me a question. According to yesterday's Debates of the Senate,
he said:
Can he give us any further information about that special
warrant? What was the amount of the warrant? What
was it intended to cover? Are those new items that were
not included in the main estimates or in the supplementaries?
Very briefly, the special warrant referred to amounted to
$147.8 million, and it covered the cash requirements of certain
items which appeared in the final supplementary estimates for
1978-79 and had to be paid in that fiscal year. If you have a
look at the clause, you will see that the special warrant was
issued on March 29 last.
These are not new items and, since they pertained to 197879, they were not included in the 1979-80 main estimates nor
in supplementary estimates (A) of 1979-80.

next March. But the life of our party, as the life of ail political
parties, must carry on and must continue. The members of our
party shall set about selecting a leader, but not without
thinking much of the events that have taken place under the
leadership of a great Canadian, Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
I think it not unduly partisan to say that Mr. Trudeau has
made a contribution to this nation that is simply immeasurable
in ordinary terms, whatever standard may be chosen-Canadian unity, economic growth, the elimination of regional disparitics, the protection of minority rights, cultural recognition and
fulfillment, Canada's efforts in foreign affairs, and so on.
Many of these policies, as is inevitable, were controversial, and
there have been some failures in the record, as there are
failures in the record of any government or Prime Minister,
regardless of the political party. The government now entrusted with the responsibilities of governing Canada is discovering that the governmental process does not assure one success following another. Many difficulties arise for those
entrusted with major responsibility, difficulties which made
certain policy successes impossible.
Whatever the success or failure rate of his policies-and
they are mostly successes-history will show that Pierre Elliott
Trudeau leaves his role as a national party leader after more
than 11 years of dedicated service and positive achievement,
and this achievement through one of the most difficult periods
in the history of our country.
I think we can agree, regardless of party, that our country
today is stronger and better, and a more decent land because
of Mr. Trudeau's contributions as Leader of the Liberal Party
and as Prime Minister. And we can take encouragement from
the fact that he has let it be known that he intends to carry on
his never-ending fight for a united Canada, and his fight
against separatism, that he is going to play an active role in
the referendum debate and dialogue in his home province in
the weeks and months to come.
He has been one of Canada's great Prime Ministers and
leaders, and it is certain that historians, when they write of his
years of stewardship, will accord him a very high place in the
history of this country, a place along with the other great
Prime Ministers, including Laurier and Macdonald, and other
outstanding Liberals and Conservatives. Mr. Trudeau will go
down as one of this country's great leaders.
Hopefully, Mr. Trudeau will continue to render service
within Canada and internationally, and for that reason my
remarks are not to be thought of as a eulogy, for today's events
do not mark the end of Mr. Trudeau's career. They mark the
beginning of a new and productive career in the service of the
people of this nation, and perhaps internationally. AIl of us
wish him well.
[Translation]
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, it is as difficult
for me to speak as it is to remain silent. However I know it
would be inexplicable if I did not say a few words about the
sudden departure of Mr. Trudeau as Leader of the Liberal
Party, he who was Prime Minister of Canada for 1I years.
[Senator Perrault.]

November 21, 1979

Of course I am at a disadvantage in that I am a personal
friend of Mr. Trudeau. I will therefore try to set that consideration aside for a moment because personal friendships and
politics belong to different realms and should be confused as
little as possible.
I think that Mr. Trudeau was a great servant of the country;
in my opinion, there in no doubt about it. We can discuss the
way he wanted to serve or how he served the country. Such a
freedom is a characteristic of our democracies and the basis of
our fundamental rights. However, it remains that this great
man, intelligent and with deep moral convictions, has lived an
extremely significant experience for the entire country. I could
say that this experience is not exclusive to the Liberal Party. It
is not necessarily over because Mr. Trudeau has decided to
resign. It must continue to show that Canada is a country
which not only can survive, but which can live fully.
This experience is at the very heart of the Canadian problem, and that applies to aIl political parties. What is therefore
to be donc to make francophone Canadians feel at home in this
country and prevent anglophone Canadians from feeling that
they are being shoved about by a group secking a better place
under the sun? That is the great dilemma we must face. Mr.
Trudeau has been at the focus of this dilemma for the past 1
years. He is stepping down. Personally, I regret his decision for
a number of reasons. Yet, we must consider the pros and cons
of this event, analyze this experience, and find out how we can
pursue it in order to reach, as soon as possible, the objectives
we set for ourselves in 1965. The Quebec problem is real, but
there are others which, although of a different character, are
no less important. That is the challenge of federalism itself. Is
it really possible to reach a perfect balance, not permanent of
course, but stable enough so that everybody may be proud to
belong to our great country?
Honourable senators, Mr. Trudeau lived that experience. He
gave it aIl his talent. He gave it ail his energy as well as ail his
honesty. He is not the only one to have done so. And doubtless
others will attempt ta do so after him. I hope others will do it
with as much courage. The worst political situation in which a
man can find himself in Canada is to be held suspect by both
francophones and anglophones. The great difficulty, naturally,
is one of communications, which stems from the very nature of
our country. In any event, I believe that experience was
extremely rewarding. It is far from being over. I hope that
those who are in power at this time will pursue it further
because it is the only one that is worthwhile. I believe there
can be no real peace and harmony in this country until such
time as we understand one another well, until such time as
everyone feels that he is treated fairly.
As for the personal qualities of Mr. Trudeau, I feel a bit
frustrated because the Deputy Leader of the Government
described them so much better than I could, although I am
happy that he should have done so. And I thank him for it.
To my mind, today is a sad day for ail of Canada. It is not a
day of sorrow because Mr. Trudeau is still alive and active.
Even this morning, he told me that he would continue to fight
for his ideas on federalism, not only among francophones but

November 21, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

also with anglophones. Both need to understand better what
federalism is ail about, and learn to accept the responsibilities
it implies, as well as its advantages. What is meant by a
common life? By living together? What is tolerance? What do
we mean when we speak of mutual respect? That is "Canada's
challenge." That is part of Mr. Trudeau's experience. Naturally, as we aIl know, in politics circumstances make the man.
Man can change them but in their turn politics can destroy
him. That is a universal law. No one, unfortunately, can
escape that fact of life.
I do not intend to analyze here ail the reasons why Mr.
Trudeau has decided to resign today. History will tell us. I
hope I will write part of that history, if circumstances ever
allow me to do so. For now, I believe we can ail together and
without restriction regret the departure of the Liberal Party
Leader, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. We must be grateful to him for
ail the services he has rendered. He will keep on fighting for
the idea in which he deeply believes. Indeed, his ideas are
shared by most members of this house and of the House of
Commons. We can always argue about approaches and attitudes but the basic idea of a tolerant Canada is to have regions
which understand and help one another, ethnic and linguistic
groups which co-operate for mutual enrichment. These are
fundamental values that we must share. Such an ideal is not
particular to anyone: it belongs to ail of us collectively. I think
Mr. Trudeau has served well in that sense. I hope we and
others will ail go further in that direction.

QUESTION PERIOD
[Translation]
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
SAFETY OF CANADIANS IN MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA

Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, perhaps you will
allow me to give you an overview of the situation in the Middle
East.
First of ail I would like to thank honourable senators for
refraining for a long time from asking questions which might
have embittered the debate. This could easily have happened,
of course, had we followed our natural instincts and given way
to our normal reactions following certain recent developments
in Iran.
I also want to limit myself to that particular situation this
afternoon. However in light of other incidents last night,
especially in Pakistan, I would like to advise the Senate of the
information I have received from the Department of External
Affairs. Apparently a number of Pakistani students attacked
and set fire to the American embassy in Islamabad. We have
not yet received sufficient information to be able to comment
on this but I want to indicate to the Senate that we are in
direct contact with our embassy there and that the 95 Canadians, including our embassy staff around Islamabad, are in no
danger.
There are now 300 Canadians in Pakistan, so we will be
following the situation very closely. There were reports that
our embassy had been attacked, but that is not so. Attacks
were aimed at American institutions. Since there was an
American school near the area where some Canadians were
living, we thought it best to move Canadians immediately to
our chancellery and our embassy. To date the safety of
Canadians in that region does not appear to be compromised.
As for the incident in Saudi Arabia, we have not received
any information about the events in Mecca but it is doubtful
that there were many Canadians there when this happened.
For the information of honourable senators, there are 1,800
Canadians in Saudi Arabia. We have been told they have
reported to the embassy and that so far there is no danger to
their safety.
In Iran the situation seems to evolve very, very slowly. Our
ambassador calls the external affairs officials just about every
hour. I repeat what I stated yesterday; there has not been any
escalation concerning the hostages kept prisoners in the
American embassy compound. The fact remains that, indirectly, our ambassador is doing his utmost to offer mediation

which could in due course lead to an acceptable solution for
both parties involved.

[English]
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I know that al] of us
are appreciative of the statement made by the minister on the
subject of the Middle East situation. Certainly Canadians are
concerned about a number of matters in that area, but if
detailed answers to our questions are not available today that
will be understood by the opposition.
Can the minister provide us with a complete status report on
all Canadian diplomatie offices in the Middle East and give us
the assurance that all of our officers and employees in those
offices are safe and secure? One must necessarily conclude
from the news reports that the disruptions are spreading from
country to country. Consequently, some of us have had inquiries asking about the security of Canadian citizens and the
security of our offices in the Middle East countries.
Would the minister provide comprehensive information,
from whatever sources, about other Canadians presently in the
Middle East, giving the count by countries? Can we be assured
that all Canadian citizens in that troubled area are presently in
no danger?
I do not expect the minister to be able to provide that kind
of information at this time.
Would the governnent explain in detail the procedures
which are now in place to monitor developments in the Middle
East so that we can be absolutely sure that we are on top of
the situation and will not be taken by surprise by unexpected
events.
That may be a rather tall order, in view of the fact that
communications between North America and the Middle East
cannot be easy at the present time.
The fourth question that is of interest is: What steps are
being taken by the government to guarantee the security of
Canadian government property in countries in the Middle
East?
I shall be glad to provide an immediate text of these
questions for the minister. I know there are a great number of
inquiries for reply. I shall be glad to send the questions across
the chamber in their typewritten form.
My fifth question is: What steps are being taken by the
government to evacuate Canadian citizens from that troubled
part of the world, if such a drastic step should become
necessary to ensure their safety?
Those questions are of concern not only to members of the
opposition, but I suggest, to all members of this chamber.
Senator Asselin: I thank the Leader of the Opposition for
asking those very important questions. i shall try to provide
the necessary details. The Leader of the Opposition will understand that in order to protect the security of Canadian citizens,
it may not be possible for me to provide all the information he
requires. However, I shall try to provide the answers
tomorrow.
[Senator .Asehn

November 21, 1979

Senator Buckwold: I have a supplementary question for the
Honourable Senator Asselin. Perhaps my question might be
added to those that have just been asked by the Leader of the
Opposition. Are we in close contact with our American friends
and neighbours with regard to the matter of immediate concern? Concerning our relationship with the United States, are
we maintaining close contact regarding any move that the
United States may make which might possibly involve
Canada?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, of course our
embassy in Washington is keeping in constant contact with
U.S. authorities. If, of course, the Americans were to ask
Canada to serve in any way as an intermediary to help them
solve the conflict, i am sure the Government of Canada would
not hesitate to take the necessary steps to do that.
[English]
Senator Olson: Honourable senators, I have a further supplementary question. Will the minister who is replying on
behalf of the Department of External Affairs provide us also
with an accurate report of the action taken by the United
Nations, particularly with respect to the action taken by
America yesterday? Will he also advise whether or not there
has been a policy pronouncement from the Secretary General,
and whether or not the Security Council has this whole matter
under consideration? Can the minister provide us with a direct
report from our embassy there on what occurred at the two
U.N. offices in New York?
Senator Asselin: Yes, I will do that.

THE ECONOMY
PURCHASE Of 011 FROM OPEC -CURRENCY Of PAYMENT

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, i have a question for
the Minister of State for Economic Development arising out of
reports that the Government of Iran is seeking to have all
OPEC countries require payment for oil in other than United
States currency. Can the minister tell us whether this report is
truc, and whether the Canadian government has been making
representations to its traditional international suppliers regarding the question of payment in U.S. currency; also whether we
have a contingency plan if, indeed, we are not going to be able
to pay for international oil supplies in U.S. dollars?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I shall have to take
that question as notice.
* (1440)

i am not aware of any official communications on that topic.
i will have to talk to my colleagues, who might be more
directly involved in such discussions, and report back very
shortly.

SENATE DEBATES

November 21, 1979
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
GUN CONTROL-RESTRICTED WEAPONS LIST

Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, if we are close to the
end of our usual Question Period, perhaps I might be allowed,
on behalf of Senator Flynn, to respond to a couple of questions
that could not be answered at the time they were asked.
The first reply is to an inquiry made by Senator Frith on
November 8 last concerning the Colt AR-15.
The reply is as follows: The Colt AR-15 was added to the
restricted weapons list in 1977. After a report out of Calgary
that a youth had been able to purchase one, controversy
ensued over this matter, and the suggestion was made that
such weapons should not be so readily available. Consequently,
after this event, Bill C-51 was introduced and approved by
Parliament, providing for a system of firearms acquisition
certificates, which is a universal screening system for ail
persons acquiring firearms. That system is now in force. The
principal reason for restricting the Colt AR-15 in the first
place no longer applies because of this new system.
There are approximately 5,000 of these guns in Canada, and
their owners use them for target shooting and vermin control.
Under the new definition of restricted weapons in section 82
of the Criminal Code, the Governor in Council may only
restrict weapons that in his opinion are not reasonably
required in Canada for hunting or sporting purposes, which is
not the case with the Colt AR-15.
The provincial chief firearms officers were consulted, and it
was their unanimous opinion that the Colt AR-15 could safely
be derestricted.
TRANSPORT
TRANSPORTATION OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS-SAFETY
REQUIREMENTS

Senator Roblin: I have another answer, in this case for the
Honourable Senator Thompson, who inquired on November
13 and 15 about regulations covering the transportation of
nuclear materials.
Canada subscribes to the regulations for the safe transport
of radioactive materials as determined by the International
Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, in 1973. Those regulations
are controlled and enforced here in Canada by the Atomic
Energy Control Board. The labelling of cars is in accordance
with international placarding regulations, and no parcels of
radioactive material may be placed close to anything combustible, inflammable or explosive.
I can also tell the honourable senator that I have obtained a
copy of the IAEA regulations. Unfortunately, they are only in
English, but I will be glad to table them at present so that the
honourable senator will have a chance to look at them, should
he wish to do so.
Senator Roblin then tabled:

Standards, Safety Series No. 6, entitled "Regulations for
the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials," 1973

Revised Edition. Code of Practice sponsored by IAEA
and WHO. (English text)
ENERGY
IMPORTATION OF OIL FROM MEXICO-AGREEMENTS TABLED

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I have here a reply
to a question raised by Senator Lamontagne on November 8,
1979, with respect to our agreements with Mexico. I would
like to state that the energy co-operation agreement negotiated
and initialled in May of this year provides for the commencement of oil shipments from Mexico in small quantities prior to
the end of 1980. The flow of oil is to reach 50,000 barrels per
day within 12 months of the commencement of shipments, and
100,000 barrels per day as soon as Mexican production
permits.
The agreements, initialled but not yet signed, have been
approved by both governments, and are considered by both
sides to be operative de facto. We have every reason to believe
that the oil shipments will begin on schedule.
The text of the agreement, and the text of the industrial
co-operation agreement, were released to the public by the
then Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and the then
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce on May 4 of this
year. I am pleased to provide copies of both agreements as
requested by Senator Lamontagne.
Given the importance of these agreements to both countries,
the two governments consider that signature at the level of
President and Prime Minister should take place on the occasion of the proposed visit to this country of the President of
Mexico, President Portillo, in the spring or early summer of
1980.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. Before the minister proceeds,
I wonder if I might ask if it is his intention to table those
documents or to ask that they be appended to the proceedings
of the Senate.
Senator de Cotret: It suits us to have them tabled, sir.
Senator de Cotret then tabled:
Copies of Text of the Canada-Mexico Industrial Cooperation Agreement. Initialled at Mexico City, March 7,
1979.
Copies of Text of the Canada-Mexico Energy Cooperation Agreement. lnitialled at Mexico City, May 4, 1979.
SELF-SUFFICIENCY-RESOURCES AND COST OF
DEVELOPMENT-ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRINTED AS AN
APPENDIX

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I have had an
answer prepared to a question on energy raised by Senator
Connolly, and a supplementary question raised by Senator
Smith (Colchester). Those questions dealt with self-sufficiency
and some of the statistics on how the self-sufficiency scenario
might develop. This is a fairly lengthy reply of some seven

SENATE DEBATES
pages. I believe it might serve the purposes of the house if I
just tabled it.
[Later:|
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I wonder if I may ask
for a slight revision of what the minister has asked for. We
have just had what amounts to almost a quick caucus, and we
believe that the document with regard to energy and the
self-sufficiency program, which I understand is some seven
pages long, has generated enough widespread interest to justify
having it printed as an appendix to today's proceedings. Therefore, I ask that the document be printed as an appendix to
today's Debates of the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
VIA RAIL- DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

Senator de Cotret: On November 13 there was a question
from Senator Lamontagne, arising from an initial question
from Senator Riley, with regard to VIA Rail, at which point I
indicated that to the best of my knowledge there had been no
active consideration of VIA Rail as a candidate for privatization. But I assured the house at that point that I would be in
contact with my colleague, the President of the Treasury
Board to verify the answers I had given on that occasion. I
would just like to tell honourable senators that the answers I
gave then were indeed confirmed by the President of the
Treasury Board, and that VIA Rail is not being considered for
privatization.

now more than ever before an attractive investment instrument
for many Canadians.
Senator Oison: I do not think the minister explained how
long that document concerning the availability of shares in the
CDC is-or did he, in fact, have a document to support what
hejust said?
Senator de Cotret: That was just a verbal answer to the
question based on conversations I had with my colleague, the
President of the Treasury Board.

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, on October 10 I
asked two questions of the Minister of State for Economic
Development. I do not know if he has yet had an opportunity
to compile the necessary information but if he has not I
wonder if I could press him for a response to one question, the
answer to which I understand will emanate directly from his
department. I would also urge him to ask the Minister of
Finance to answer the other question.
Senator de Cotret: I will certainly undertake to do that.

BORROWING AUJTHORITY BILL, 1979-80
SECOND READING

CANADA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION -- SALE OF SIIARES

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, November 14, the
debate on the motion for the second reading of Bill C-10, to
provide supplementary borrowing authority for the fiscal year
1979-80.

Senator de Cotret: Finally, I would like to give a brief
answer to a question from Senator Oison which was also on
the topie of privatization, but on this occasion with specific
reference to the announced plans to decrease the federal
ownership of the Canada Development Corporation from some
60 per cent of equity at the moment to something below 50 per
cent. The specific question was as to why the government
should move at this point towards making these shares available to the public.
As I indicated at the time the question was asked, it was the
original intention of the prior government, when the CDC was
set up, to have the CDC act as an investment funnel to enable
Canadians, broadly distributed across the country, to participate in the development of Canadian corporations. The government was obviously providing the initial incentive for that
type of development with the express hope and intent of
making these shares available to Canadians when the time was
appropriate.
In answer to the specific question as to the appropriateness
of this particular time, I would like to say that it is a matter of
the profitability of the CDC at the moment, together with its
expected profit picture, which makes this crown corporation

Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, before dealing with
Bill C-10 1 would like to seize this first opportunity offered to
me to congratulate His Honour the Speaker for his nomination
to the high office he now holds in this house. His long
parliamentary experience and his constant participation in our
past debates are, in my opinion, an assurance that he will fulfil
his new and important role with competence and distinction.
Our best wishes of success accompany him.
Honourable senators, I would not want to let go unnoticed
the double nomination of our distinguished colleague Senator
Flynn to the position of Leader of the Government in the
Senate and Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada. We already can rest assured that he will successfully
carry out his heavy responsibilities. We wish him the good
health he will need in the accomplishment of the hard work
called for by his new duties which I would not hesitate to
qualify as very highly demanding.
To another old friend of mine, Senator Asselin, I wish to say
that I am very happy to take this opportunity to congratulate
him on his appointment to cabinet as Minister of State for the
Canadian International Development Agency. I wish him
every success in his new position.

[Senator de Cotret

November 21, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

I have the pleasure as well to welcome most cordially our
new colleague, Senator de Cotret, and to congratulate him on
his elevation to cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce and Minister of State for Economic Development.
Lastly, to my honourable colleague and friend, Senator
Roblin, I wish to extend most sincere congratulations and best
wishes of success in his new duties as Deputy Leader of the
Government, duties of which I think I know the complexities
and demands. I also know he possesses the necessary qualities
to assume his new responsibilities with brilliance and success.
As I recall the good words he had to say on my account
when I announced some time ago my resignation as Deputy
Leader of the Opposition, it is my pleasure to assure him that I
will not deprive him of the shakes of the head, approving or
disapproving, to which apparently he has become accustomed
in the past.
Honourable senators, I had the opportunity to read the
Commons debates on Bill C-10 which began with the introduction of the legislation on October 18 and were resumed and
carried on on the 23, 25, 26 and 29 of the same month, and
were concluded only on Monday, November 12, when the bill
was passed on third reading.
However I will spare you a long review of those debates,
which for a good part, I have to admit, was beyond the scope
of the legislation under study. I will merely recall one comment made in the course of the debates, that the bill is seeking
borrowing authority to meet public expenses even before the
budget promised by the new government has been tabled in the
House.
While that argument might seem valid at first sight, it is
proper to bring out the fact that the expenses covered by that
borrowing authority were for the most part covered by the
budget and the estimates tabled before the dissolution of
Parliament, last March, by the previous government.
However, the opposition, both in this house and in the other
place, must not be denied the incontestable right to criticize
the new government for its delay in disclosing at least the
highlights of the economic policy it will offer the Canadian
people. After five months in power, the new government seems
to have forgotten already its numerous and attractive electoral
promises. We barely hear about rumours of possible budgetary
cuts, whose term is constantly deferred from week to week.
Meanwhile the price and interest rate escalation is continuing
and the economic situation of this country is deteriorating.
I hope the new government will soon get a handle on itself
and most of all that it will recover its memory and remember
the wonderful panaceas it was offering the Canadian electorate the day after the election.
In that regard, I express the wish that the government will
follow the wise advice it was given in the Senate last night by
Senator Everett in his outstanding address.
Honourable senators, in introducing Bill C-10, the Deputy
Leader of the Government stressed, among other things, the
fact that the bill before us limits the borrowing authority to $7
billion while the authority requested by the previous govern-

ment, for the fiscal year 1979-80, amounted to $10 billion,
which request died on the order paper when Parliament was
dissolved on March 26 last.
1 note that on page 323 of the French version of our
Hansard for November 14, Senator Roblin is reported to have
referred to the dissolution of Parliament in "May" instead of
in "March". Obviously, it was a "lapsus linguae" or an error
in transcription. Needless to say, I prefer to think it was the
latter.
The borrowing authority was reduced from $10 to $7 billion
because the treasury benefited from the unused or residual
previously granted borrowing authority.
It must be noted also that a similar situation will not recur
in the case of this because the authority sought by the government will expire at the end of the fiscal year, that is on March
31, 1980, as a consequence of which the government will have
to come back to Parliament to obtain whatever additional
borrowing authority it may need past that date.
Finally, the authority requested under this bill is retroactive
to November 1, 1979. Although retroactivity in a bill is not
always desirable or acceptable, I must accept the justification
of the government, namely that its new borrowing authority
should become effective on and coincide with the date on
which the last Canada Savings Bonds campaign was launched.
One last comment: I should like to stress the fact that this
bill authorises the government to borrow Canadian or foreign
funds.
Before resuming my seat, I should like to offer one last word
of advice to the Deputy Leader of the Government. Perhaps
we could skip the formality of referring this bill to a committee
of the Senate before giving it third reading since this is now
November 21, and also because the bill is retroactive to
November 1.

Senator Langlois: I am suggesting that this bill should not
be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on National

the fact that we have now reached November 21, and also on
account of the fact that this bill is retroactive to November 21.

SENATE DEBATES

This year Canada will have a trade deficit on oil imports of
$1.7 billion, but this will be more than offset by exports of oil,
natural gas and uranium. But by 1990, ten years from now,
our annual net trade deficit in energy imports will be an
estimated $9.3 billion-and that is assuming that foreign oil
imports will still be available at that time. There is surely some
question about this in the light of the instability of the Middle
East at the present time.
On page 13 of this background paper, honourable senators
will find this further disturbing observation:
Assuming no further rise in OPEC prices, gross imports
as currently projected for the second half of 1979 would,
over the course of a full year, cost Canada about $4.2
billion, which is equal to 80 per cent of Canada's 1978
current accounts deficit on its balance of payments. This
would mean that Canada as a country would be making
annual payments to foreign oil producers amounting to
over $700 for every Canadian family of four.
Bear in mind that all of these are payments going out of the
country to producers in foreign nations. It is almost impossible
to estimate the adverse economic impact of the staggering
future balance of payments deficits.
For all of these reasons, and many more that might be cited,
we simply cannot continue to ignore the energy-related problems we will face unless we act without further delay to put
into place a realistic national energy policy. It is imperative
that the Canadian people and their governments recognize and
acknowledge the reality and the seriousness of our energy
position, and it is equally important that they make a firm
commitment now to accept and to do whatever is necessary to
attain domestic energy self-sufficiency at the earliest possible
date. To that end, we must address ourselves to at least four
things a national energy policy must accomplish if it is to be
successful.
In the first place, it must ensure an effective program of
energy conservation. In the light of the energy problems we are
facing, the current waste of energy in this country is little
short of criminal. In fairness, it should be said that in the
industrial community a significant number of effective energy
conservation programs have been put in place during the last
two or three years. However, apart from a few limited programs, such as the home insulation program, the majority of
citizens are doing little, if anything, to cut down on energy
consumption. There is a potential for significant reductions in
energy use in every home, every office, and every place of
business, and, above all, in the area of transportation. Many
families could perhaps struggle along with two cars instead of
three, and some might even be able to get by with one car
instead of two. A national highway speed limit of 50 miles an
hour would save millions of gallons of gasoline every year, to
say nothing of a great many lives. Smaller, lighter, more
energy-efficient cars would save millions of gallons of fuel
annually. The automobile industry has been slow in coming to
grips with this necessity, but one of the reasons is that there
has been no significant public demand for such vehicles. I say
with regret that in my own province statistics show that sales

of large gas-guzzling automobiles increased in some centres by
14 per cent this year over last year.
One of our most inefficient and wasteful uses of energy is in
the area of movement of people to and from work in our urban
centres. In all large cities, thousands of cars carry one person
to work every morning and home every night. The average
distance travelled is a round trip of probably 10 or 15 miles of
urban driving, which means the use of at least a gallon of
gasoline per trip. In even moderately-sized cities, some 20,000
cars are used every day for this purpose.
And what does this represent? It represents a capital investment of around $5 million in the cars, the utilization of about
4 million horsepower consuming 20,000 gallons of gasoline
each day at a cost of approximately $20,000 for fuel alone.
Surely, there are more cost-effective and energy-efficient ways
of transporting people to and from their work than what we
use at the present time.
* (1520)

Raising fuel prices is not, to my mind, an effective or
equitable way to impose conservation. It will have only a
limited effect. It is unacceptable to most people that a large
bank account should give one citizen a licence to waste energy,
while excessive energy prices work a severe hardship on those
in lower income brackets. Perhaps we are coming close to the
time when government will have to give consideration to
energy allocations, at least in some categories of uses, if we are
going to come to grips with this problem.
The point I want to stess is that it is absolutely essential that
we address ourselves to the problem of effective and equitable
energy conservation without further delay.
In the second place, a national energy policy must stimulate
and facilitate the development of known and new sources of
energy. The federal and provincial governments have already
moved to provide necessary tax and depletion allowance incentives for oil and gas exploration and development, and, on the
whole, these have proven adequate. One area in which there is
need for much more to be done is the further improvement of
technology. Many people do not realize that the present recovery from conventional oil fields is only about 30 to 40 per cent
of the oil in place. In other words, for every 100 barrels we
take out, we leave 250 to 300 barrels in the ground. If we can
increase the recovery rate to 50 or 60 per cent, this alone
would go a long way towards making this country self-sufficient as far as oil is concerned.
In regard to this matter of improving technology, it is
important that there be close industry and government cooperation. It is so easy for governments to move into a field of
this kind, only to find later that they have spent millions of
dollars of public money simply duplicating the technological
research already being carried by the industry itself. What we
need is a proper partnership between the private and public

three in number--offshore devclopmnent, Arctic development
and the developmient of the oil sands. Ail of these are cxtremcy costly sources of energy. In offshore and Arctic drilling il is
flot uncommon for a single well 10 cost from $5 million Io SI 0
million, or even more. In ihe development of nil sands, a plant
producing 140,000 barrels of oil a day now costs at lcast $5
billion. This points up the lack of realismi on the part of' thosc
who say, "Let us solve Canada's encrgy problemns by bringing
a couple of tar sand plants on streamn every ycar or so until we

Let us flot underestimate the magnitude of thc problem.
Hydro and thermo-generation of' electric cncrgy and the
development of our vast coal resources arc other areas wherc
Canada should go ail out. But xxe must rcemnber when wc
talk about developing new energy sources, whether it be hydro,
oil, gas. coal, offshore or in the Arctic, that this devclopment
can continue only if these new sources of supply are tied into
markets by the cons(ruution of' adequate transportation systemis. Unless that is cûonc. development simply cannot continue. You cannot expc .ý comipanies to go into Aretie or offshore

expectations among native people with respect to land dlaims,
native rights and so on.
We need an alI-out national programr 10 develop new sources
of energy supply -solar, tidal, geothermal, anything that is al

that we avoid unrealistie optimism. While there is potential in

There is an ever-present danger in putting nuelear reactors
the hands of politically unstable nations, no motter how
many safeguards are put in place. Surely il would bc preferable. Io keep our nuelear technology, our uranium and our
Candu reactors in our own country under our own control.
We live next door 10 the world's greatest industrial nation,
which has insatiable energy requiremenîs and which also
happens t0 bc our major trading partner. We could export ail
the surplus electri ecnergy we could produce with nuclear
power, whieh would assist significantly in resolving our serious
balance of payments problem. What is more, Canada is a
nation with vast territory and a small population, and that in
itself enables us t0 locale nuclear power plants away from
populated areas-which only makes good sense. 1 suggest that
this is deserving of serious and objective consideration by the
governmcnts and people of this country.
In the third place, our national encrgy policy must resolve
the controversial issue of domestie oul pricing. It is understandable that the intcrests of produeing and consuming provinces
will bc extremcly difficult 10 reconcile. The task is flot mode
easier by reason of the overlapping responsibilities of the two
levels of goverfiment in our federal system. The best premise
fromn which to work towards an amicable arrangement is the
mutual interest of aIl Canadians in atîaining domestie energy
sel f-su fficicncy.
In the current cnergy prîcîng debate somne rather uncomplimcntary things have been said about the Province of' Alberta.
Whilc 1 cannot speak for the Governmnent of Alberta, 1 do
know the history of oul development and nmarketing in Alberta,
and 1 think 1 know the feeling and attitude of ils people. May 1
briefly sketch in the background of the presenit set of
cireumstances?
At the lime of the second world war oil was the biggcst
single import for which Canada had to find United States
dollars. While the first major crude oul wells in Alberta came
in in 1939, the Leduc oil field was flot discovered until 1947
and the Redwater field until 1948. With the development of
those two major fields, production became adequate for the
supply of Alberta, western British Columibia and Saskatchewan. A little later a pipeline was built to Sarnia in western
Ontario. Shortly thcreafter production agaili exceeded the
available mnarket.
We wcre faced at that time in the Government of Alberta
xwith o serious marketing problem. Small Canadian companies
engaged only in production found themscl,.cs in a very difficult
position. The integraîed companies which had their own refincries and marketing systems could produce enough oul from
their own wells to supply their own necds without buying oil
fromn companies which wcre only producers. That led to the
governmcnt's having 10 prorate production to market tu enable
ail] producers. whether integrated companies or flot, Io share in
the markets avoulable.
The goverfiment was onxious at that samne time 10 make at
least a starî in the commercial development of the oul sonds in

mbt

November 21, 1979

SENATE E EBATES

order that technology might be perfected for larger development at a later date. This created concern on the part of the
conventional industry, because a plant to process oil from the
sands would have to have a constant throughput to be viable,
and the only way its oil could be marketed would be to take
some of the market away from the conventional industry. We
got round that problem, at least temporarily, by assuring the
industry that we would limit the market assigned to oil sands
production to not over 5 per cent of the existing market.
Then began a period when there was an intense struggle to
increase markets for western Canadian crude. Oil wells in
Alberta at one time were producing at less than 50 per cent of
capacity for the simple reason that adequate markets were not
available.
The United States at that time had a quota on oil imported
into the country. While they could get all the offshore oil they
needed for the Atlantic Seaboard region at rates cheaper than
those at which they could provide their own oil, they felt it was
vital to build up a strong domestic oil industry. The quotas
imposed on the amount of foreign oil that could be brought in
applied to Canadian oil as well.
I well recall that, when representations were made to the
American authorities hoping to persuade them to take a larger
volume of Canadian oil, their reply was, "Why should we?
Your own people in eastern Canada are not using your domestic oil because they can get foreign oil cheaper there than they
can move your oil to the east. Why should we cut back our oil
production to take more of yours when your own people are
not willing to open up markets for your oil in eastern
Canada?"
Strong pressure continued on the Government of Alberta
and on the federal government, by oil producers, to get more
Alberta oil into Ontario and into the Montreal market area.
Some honourable senators may recall-this is now 20 years
ago-that in 1959 the Borden Commission was established to
map on overall energy policy for Canada and to examine into
the feasibility of extending the interprovincial pipeline from
Sarnia to Montreal.
Ontario and Quebec argued that western oil would increase
the cost of their gasoline possibly by two cents a gallon. It was
unofficially suggested to the Government of Alberta that we
should consider cutting our provincial oil royalties to enable
our oil to go to the Montreal market without increasing the
cost of gasoline to the people of Quebec. In other words, we
could absorb the increased shipping costs at our end of the
line. i need hardly tell you that that suggestion did not get
very far.
At that same time, the Province of Quebec said no to any
extension of the oil line to Montreal because of concern over
higher gasoline prices. The Province of Ontario agreed to a
compromise proposed by the federal government following the
Borden Commission report. The proposal was to extend the
use of western domestic oil as far as the Ottawa River Valley.
From there on east the country would continue to use gasoline
and oil products processed from foreign imports.

387

* (1540)

The reason why the Ottawa River Valley was chosen was
geographic. It was approximately the point in Canada where
the cost of Alberta oil coming east equated the cost of offshore
oil coming in from eastern Canada. So it did not upset the
pricing structure to any significant degree.
In the year 1959 the OPEC oil producing nations cartel was
formed. It has been around for 20 years. It did not test its
power to raise world prices until 1971, when its member
nations effected modest price increases amounting in the
aggregate to about $730 million that year. Then, in 1973, the
Arab-Israeli War erupted. The Arab combatants appealed to
OPEC's Asian members to cut off oil supplies to western
nations supplying aid to Israel. That marked the beginning of
what we might call political oil price-fixing.
In 1973 OPEC was supplying 27 million barrels of oil per
day to the rest of the world. That figure is 14 times more than
the total daily consumption of oil in Canada. The little nation
of Kuwait alone, smaller than Prince Edward Island, has 20
per cent of the world's conventional oil supply. Honourable
senators will recall that that was the time when the Arab
nations imposed a six-month embargo on oil shipments to
Western nations.
From October 1973 until lune 1974, world oil prices
increased from $2.75 a barrel to $1 1.75 a barrel, an increase of
approximately 300 per cent. Immediately the question was
raised, what was going to happen to the price of domestic
crude oil sold in Canada?
Traditionally, products arising from the production of
Canadian resources sold domestically at international prices or
higher. Traditionally, industrialized central Canada supplied a
wide variety of manufactured goods to Canadian markets ai
prices equal to and often higher than the price of comparable
products in the international market-this is particularly true
when comparing prices between the United States and
Canada. Many imported lower-priced U.S. products were
subject to tariffs resulting in a price to Canadians equal to or
higher than the price of similar products produced domestically on the grounds that it is in the national interest to develop a
healthy industrial base in Canada.
This created some bewilderment in the minds of some
Canadians-certainly some of our people in western Canada.
People in southern Alberta would drive down to Butte or
Billings, Montana, would see in the stores electrical appliances, televisions and radios, and all the other stuff, selling at
prices significantly lower than those at which comparable
products could be bought in Lethbridge, a couple of hundred
miles to the north, and would wonder why they could not buy
those products at the same low prices. They were told that the
higher prices in Canada were necessary in the national interest, in order to develop local Canadian industry, and that the
extra cost was the contribution made by Canadians to the
national interest. So the family would return home, swallow
hard, sing "O Canada" and shell out the higher prices, in
order to help the national interest.

SENATE DEBATES
But with the rapid rise in international oil prices, a new
philosophy was heard in the land. Western oil producers were
told that it was now in the national interest for them to sell
their domestic production to refiners in central Canada at
substantially less than the international price-a total reversal
of what they had lived with for so many years. Western
producers, and the people and Governments of Alberta and
Saskatchewan, wondered why that philosophy applied only to
western oil.
When the people of Alberta buy lumber, which cornes in
from British Columbia, the price they pay is what that lumber
will bring in the markets of the western United States, where a
great deal of it is exported. If we buy B.C. salmon, we pay the
price that the canneries can get on the international market. If
a Canadian comes into Ontario to buy gold, some of which is
produced there, he is not quoted a special discount price
because he is a Canadian and the gold is mined in Canada.
The price he is quoted is the price in Tokyo, London or Zurich,
the international bullion market that sets the price of gold.
The same is truc of Ontario nickel, Quebec iron, and so on.
They arc all sold at the international price. Western oil is the
only commodity that should be treated differently.
In 1973 and 1974 the Canadian government froze the price
of oil within Canada and imposed an export tax on oil exported
to the United States. It is worth noting, in passing, that such a
tax had never before been imposed on Canadian natural
resource products; it had never been imposed on B.C. lumber
or salmon, on Ontario gold or nickel, or Quebec iron and pulp.
Why? At that point Ottawa was collecting twice as much
revenue as Alberta on every barrel of Alberta oil exported, and
that brought a series of confrontations between Ottawa and
the producing provinces, with the industry caught in the
crossfire.
At about the same time, Quebec, which had rejected Alberta oil in 1959-60 in favour of offshore foreign oil, pressured to
have the interprovincial oil pipeline extended from Sarnia to
Montreal, but with two stipulations: First, they did not want to
pay the $200 million it would cost to build the line, and,
secondly, they wanted the right to revert to offshore foreign oil
if OPEC prices fell in the future.
Honourable senators will recall that at that time there was
some speculation that OPEC might disintegrate and that
individual member nations might start selling oi to Western
industrial nations at below the OPEC price. What actually
happened. of course, was exactly the reverse. Increasingly
members of OPEC started selling their oil at premium prices
above the agreed OPEC price. However, in 1976 the line was
built, with all users and the Canadian government footing the
bill.
A federal-provincial energy conference was called in 1976,
and an agreement was reached that there should be one single
price of $6.50 per barrel for ail Canadian domestic oil, increasing at the rate of SI per year toward the world price level. The
federal government agreed to take no part of the $6.50 price.
[Senator Manning j

November 2 1, 1979

At that time Alberta increased its provincial royalty on the
new price increase from 22 per cent to 65 per cent. The
Province of Saskatchewan imposed royalties that were even
higher. As a result, the federal government refused any longer
to permit the oil companies to deduct provincial royalties as an
operating cost before taxes.
Those actions had a devastating impact on exploration and
development. Seismic and drilling rigs by the dozen headed
south to the United States.
S(1550)

By 1975 both levels of government were forced to make
major concessions in taxation, depletion allowances and royalties to reverse the decline in exploration and development. The
result was an upsurge that has continued ever since, and has
reached an all-time high.
Meanwhile, the world oil price continued to increase. The
cost of imported oil has jumped from $16.50 per barrel a year
ago to $25.70 today, with spot sales bringing well over $30 a
barrel. The Canadian domestic price is $15.63 a barrel, or
more than $10 under the present prevailing world price.
By selling to central Canada at the domestic price instead of
on the worid market, Alberta alone has foregone over $15
billion in revenue, or nearly three times as much as the
province has taken into its Heritage Trust Fund to offset the
sale of an irreplaceable natural resource. Let no one accuse
Albertans of putting their own interests ahead of the interests
of Canada. This $15 billion subsidy, paid by one province, as
the Province of Alberta has pointed out, is unprecedented in
Canadian history. It has created a wholly artificial situation in
Canada with respect to actual energy costs, and simply cannot
continue. At the recent conference the federal and every
provincial government, with one exception, acknowledged this
fact, and agreed that domestic oil prices must move to a level
much closer to parity with international prices.
Remember that we are no longer talking about oil prices
fixed by the political whims of the members of OPEC. We are
talking now about prices set by worid oil supply and demand,
and related to the costs of replacing the oil that is sold.
Neither Britain nor Mexico is a member of OPEC, but both
countries are selling oil today at prices often higher than the
OPEC prices.
My own conviction is that our domestic price should be tied
to the Chicago composite price, which more accurately reflects
the cost of oil in North America than docs the world market
price. I think it would be desirable for Canada to consider
raising its domestic oil price immediately to, say 15 per cent
under the Chicago composite price, which would be about
$20.15 a barrel, or an increase of $4.50 over the present price.
Perhaps by mid-1980 the price should be adjusted to 10 per
cent under the then Chicago composite price, and beginning
with, say, January of 1981, should fluctuate with the Chicago
price, less 10 per cent.
I believe the 10 per cent discount to the domestic market
can be justified from the standpoint of helping to make
Canadian products more competitive in international markets,

November 21, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

which is advantageous to all regions of Canada, and from the
standpoint of helping ease the staggering balance of payments
deficits that threaten our economic future. From the standpoint of the producing provinces, a 10 per cent discount under
the Chicago market would be much less onerous than the
excessive domestic subsidy these provinces are now absorbing.
All these percentages, of course, must be matters of negotiation between the federal government and the producing provinces, but the principle is the important thing. Let us tie our
domestic price to the Chicago composite price and move up to
that level by stages, by adjusting the percentage of discount
over the next couple of years, and, from there on, let the price
fluctuate with the Chicago composite price, with a continuing
discount of perhaps 10 per cent for domestic oil consumed in
this country.
While resolving the problem of domestic price it is also
necessary to resolve the problem of revenue sharing between
the producing companies and the two levels of government.
Few would dispute the validity of the claims of the producing
provinces that they are entitled to an adequate royalty from
the sale of their mineral resources. Such a royalty is not a
matter of taxation; it is a matter of equitable compensation to
the owners who are selling to development companies an
irreplaceable natural resource. The royalty issue is a separate
matter altogether from taxation. What the producing provinces are doing is giving up, permanently, an irreplaceable
resource, and through royalties getting some measure of financial compensation in return for a capital asset. This is why,
until recent years, such royalties were recognized as a legitimate cost of doing business, and were deductible from the
producing companies' taxable income. This is why the Government of Alberta argues-and I believe rightly-that any federal tax on oil company revenues should be based on the actual
profits of the producing companies, and not on a percentage of
the market price.
Much of the often irrational debate about so-called windfall
profits misses entirely what should be the main point of
government and public concern. If the goal is energy self-sufficiency, the concern must be to make certain that the maximum amount of increased cash flow generated by higher
prices does not go into government coffers or company dividends, but back into the production of additional energy
supplies.
The estimates of capital required to attain self-sufficiency
range from a minimum of $100 billion to $300 billion over the
next 10 years. There are only three sources from which these
staggering amounts of capital can be obtained. First, there is
the sale of equity stock, but that certainly has limits, and you
cannot sell equity stock unless you pay dividends, so there is a
debt service charge attached to capital if you acquire it by the
sale of equity.
A second source of capital is debt financing, through bank
loans or the issuing of bonds and debentures. That means, at
today's rates, you will have to pay 12 per cent or more for your
money, which adds a staggering debt service charge to the cost
of the capital.

80072-27

The third source from which development capital can be
obtained is the cash flow generated by the selling price. In this
case there is no debt service charge, dividends or interest to
pay. From the standpoint of the consuming public, the generation of capital through prices is the cheapest way such capital
can be received. What we have to address ourselves to, therefore, is making certain that the increased cash flow generated
by higher prices is used for the purpose of developing new
energy supplies.
I need hardly say that there are many wild misconceptions
regarding the excess profits of oil companies. What many
people do not realize is that for a company engaged in
producing a continuous supply of energy the real profits are
not the difference between the selling price and the cost of the
oil being marketed, but between the selling price and the cost
of replacing the oil that is being sold.
a

(1600)

Let me give an oversimplified illustration. If an oil company
had a volume of oil that cost $10 a barrel to produce, and sold
that oil for $18 a barrel, the socialist mind would immediately
say that is an 80 per cent profit and scream for the company's
expropriation. However, if you keep in mind that the replacement cost of that $10 barrel of oil is now $20-and I assure
you that $20 a barrel is cheap if you are talking about
replacing it with oil from tar sands, the Arctic, or offshore
development-then what has happened takes on a different
complexion. The company sold the barrel of oil that cost it
$10; it received $18 for it, but it now has to pay out $20 to
replace the barrel of oil it sold. Then someone starts shouting,
"We have really got to do something about these terrible
excess profits the oil companies are making."
The matter on which governments must concentrate is not
how much additional tax revenue they can gain for the public
treasury through higher prices, but what steps are necessary to
ensure that the revenue to producing companies generated by
higher domestic prices goes into development of new sources of
energy supplies. Honourable senators will agree that it is well
within the legislative competence of the federal government of
this country to do this, and to do it effectively. What is more,
they can and should do it without the government itself going
into the oil business. That is probably the most inefficient and
undesirable way of attempting to attain the desired goal of
energy self-sufficiency.
In closing, let me touch on a fourth goal that a national
energy policy must accomplish. It must include steps to
remove man-made obstacles that presently stand in the way of
unimpeded development of present and new sources of energy.
Two examples will suffice to illustrate this need.
The first is the unrealistic environmental restraints that
developers are confronted with today. All responsible people
recognize the need for and importance of adequately protecting the environment. Unfortunately, the cause of intelligent

SENATE DEBATES
environmental protection today is more often prejudiccd than
fostered by irresponsible, emotional opposition to almosi any
and ail major projeets necessary to avert the future energy
crisis. It has become almost impossible to open a coal mine,
drill an offshore oul or gas well, build a pipeline, a power fine, a
hydro line, a geothermal plant or a nuclear power plant
without encountering vehement, even violent, obstruction by
environmental groups for whom such obstruction has become a
cause rather than an intelligent expression of legitimate
concern.
[n the past five years, a significant number of projeets
necessary to meet future and even prescrnt national energy
needs have been dropped or proceeded with at a far higher cost
only after long and costly delays because of the lack of
intelligent balance between demonstrable public nced and
legitimate environmental concerns.
The second obstacle is excessive and cumbersome government regulation. 1 have had the opportunity, in the past few
years, to be associated with several studies in this field, and the
findings have been enlightening and disturbing. In the area of'
rate regulation alone, gas and electrie utility companies in this
country are subjeet to the provisions of some 40 different
statutes of the federal government, the provinces. and the
Yukon and Northwest Territories. There is a host of complicated federal and provincial statutes and regulations governing almiost every facet of energy resource development: and a
multiplicity of regulatory boards, tribunals and departmental
bureaucrats from whom approvals and authorizations must be
obtained before projeets can be initiated, the nature and scope
of their operation defined and rates of return established.
Required public hearings are frequently long and costly.
The current practice of permitting almost any special interest
group to appear as intervenor slows the regulatory process and
further aggravates the situation. [n addition to the exorbitant
cost aIl of which is ultimately reflected in prîces-senior
technical personnel, the applicants, the intervenors and the
members of the tribunal itself are required to devote their time
and expertise to long drawn-out proceedings rather than to
facilitating the development and implementation of production
and transportation facilities necessary to the well-being of the
nation. The long delays occasioned by lengthy public hearings
and waiting for departmcntal rulings are particularly serious
in a period of inflation. when every month's delay adds significantly to the ultimate cosi of the projeet if and whcn it is
approved.
H-onourable senators are aware that when the Alaska pipeline projeet was first proposed the price tag was put at S8.5
billion. Today t is up to $15 billion. If construction is delayed
another couple of years, we are probably talking about $17 or
$18 billion.
The Syncrude tar sands plant has been completed in Alberta
at a cost of around $4 billion. The president of that company,
addressing a seminar in Edmonton recently. pointed out that
to complete that one projeet the company was required to
obtain over 250 different permits and authorizations. Think of
the tirne consumed& think of the man-hours of work, and
Senator Manning.]

Nvme2,17 21, 1979
November

remember that every month's delay means a further increase
in the ultimate cost in a period of high inflation.
Some honourable senators may have followed the interesting
case in the United States just over a year ago concerning the
oil from the north slope of Alaska that is now being moved
across Alaska and taken by tanker down the west coast to Los
Angeles and San Francisco. The Standard Oil Company of
Ohio proposed a projeet to build an oil pipeline from the
Pacifie coast to refineries in the mid-western states to enable
the crude to be rcfincd inland wherc the finished products are
needed. The company spent over three years trying to obtain
the necessary authorization to build the fine that just about
everybody seemed to agree was necessary. In a speech about a
year ago, the company's president stated the company would
be required to obtain over 500 permits. authorizations and
approvals to build the fine, to say nothing of fighting injuncetions and other forms of man-made obstructions. The company
spent over $50 million and three years of time by key personnel trying to get the authorizations. Finally, they decided they
could not spend any more and threw in the towel.
Honourable senators, this kind of thing is going on ail the
time today. No one will dispute the necessity of appropriate
legislation for such a measure of regulation as is demonstrably
nceded to protect the public interest, but it should be kept to
the absolute minimum, consistent with providing the necessary
public safeguards. Few familiar with the current situation
would deny that there is an obvious need to reduce. clarify and
simplify both federal and provincial statutes and regulations
pertaining to energy resource development. and there is an
equal necd to streamlinc and modernize procedures governing
public hearings before regulatory bodies.
Honourable senators, I must not detain you longer. 1 have
tried to outline the seriousness to Canada of this energy
problem as it exists today, and the absolute necessity in the
public interest for governments and people to act now to put in
place a meaningful national energy policy, if we are to have
any hope of becoming energy self-sufficient in the years that
lie ahead.
Senator Goldenberg: Will Senator Manning permit a
question'?
Senator Manning: Certainîy.
Senator Goldenberg: I understood Senator Manning to say
on the question of revenue-sharing that he is in agreemnent with
the attitude of the Government of Alberta that the proposed
federal self-sufficiency tax should be imiposed on profits and
not on revenue. If that were to happen, what is there to prevent
miultinationals from diverting profits to non-resident subsidiaries which are not subject to Canadian income tax through
inter-company arrangements? I am sure Senator Manning is
aware of the Imperial Oil case in Nova Scotia, which was
widely publicized.
Senator Manning: That is a very pertinent question. There
are real problems in ensuring that the increased cash flow
fromn higher prices goes to the purpose of finding new energy

November 21, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

and is not siphoned off through subsidiaries or by other means.
I would not want to suggest that it is a problem with any
simple solution, but it is within the competence of the Government of Canada to ascertain the amount of revenue collected
by any oil company doing business in this country and the
amount of that revenue that in turn has been reinvested in oil
development in this country. If the amount being reinvested is
much less than the revenue they are collecting then it would be
a clear indication that something is being siphoned off. At that
stage, the government should step in and say that as a condition of doing business in this country that kind of thing cannot
go on. I know ways will be found to get around such requirements. Good lawyers can find their way around any legislation,
but the government has the power to do what is necessary.
Senator Goldenberg: I don't act for any oil company.
Senator Muir: Honourable senators, may I pose a question
to Senator Manning?
Senator Manning: Certainly.
Senator Muir: We have heard a masterful, learned, interesting and, to my mind, intelligent dissertation from Senator
Manning, whether or not we agree with all he has said. He has
dwelt on many subjects pertaining to energy. One commodity
that I was waiting patiently for him to discuss is coal. He
touched on it very briefly, and I was wondering if Senator
Manning could, in a few words, tell us what, in his opinion, is
the future of coal, both in Alberta and on the east coast, where
he knows we also have billions of tons of coal available.
Senator Manning: Honourable senators, I did not really say
anything about coal. In fact, there are a lot more things I
would have liked to have said something about, but it would
not have been fair to the house to go into all of these areas.
In my view, any major source of energy in this country is
going to be required in the years to come to meet the national
need. There is a tremendous future for coal in the maritimes as
well as in the west. Coal has some disadvantages. It is not as
clean a fuel as some others, and its movement is more difficult.
But all these various types of fuel will find their place in
relation to each other as prices go up. In other words, if it
becomes much more economic to use coal than oil, then you
are going to use coal. In earlier years, all over this country, we
used to burn thousands of tons of coal in locomotives. Then it
became more economical to make them oil burning, so coal
lost out to oil. We may well see the day when that is reversed.
I would certainly anticipate coal playing a very prominent part
in the energy picture of Canada in the future, and I think that
any area that has coal is very fortunate.
Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I should like to ask a
brief question. In his speech, Senator Manning made a comparison which I thought was rather unusual. He used, as an
example, gold which the province of Ontario appears to be
producing in greater quantities than any other region in
Canada, pointing out that Ontario charges the international
price for that commodity. Senator Manning used that argument to justify Alberta's objective of increasing the price of oil
to near world prices. Gold is a luxury and does not have the

dramatic impact on inflation and the cost of living in Canada
as oil does. Does the honourable senator think that that
comparison is valid?
Senator Manning: Certainly the impact that adjustments in
the price of energy have is far greater than at least the
immediate impacts of higher domestic prices in other fields. I
am not sure of-and I frankly don't think anybody could
accurately establish-the financial impact on consumers by
reason of the fact that for a hundred years they have been
paying higher domestic prices for many commodities in order
to protect industry in central Canada. Perhaps it was a necessity, and I think most of us would agree that to some extent it
was. However, the adverse financial impact on the Canadian
people has been spread over a long period of time.
When it comes to energy, the difference is that here we have
had an increase of 300 per cent in two years, and the impact,
of course, is very significant. That is why I favour-and, if I
understand their position correctly, the Government of Alberta
favours-a transition period, so that we do not jump immediately from a price, which is now only about 50 per cent of the
world price. Spreading the adjustment over a period of time
will permit the economic adjustment to take place without the
serious dislocation that otherwise would occur.
Senator Thompson: I wonder if I could ask Senator Manning a question. I was interested to note that Senator Manning
suggested, as I understood him, that the differential between
the Chicago price and the price for home consumption would
be 10 per cent. Did he decide on 10 per cent because of
comparisons with other oil-producing countries and what they
charge the internal market, or was there some other basis for
his saying 10 per cent?
*

(1620)

Senator Manning: Honourable senators, the figure of 10 per
cent was pulled out of the air. That is why I said I was using
these percentages more as illustrative figures rather than firm
figures. These are matters which would have to be negotiated
between the Government of Canada and the producing provinces. Whether it is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, or 5 per cent, is
properly a matter for negotiation.
The vital point I tried to make was that we need to tic the
domestic price in Canada to the composite price in Chicago,
and then decide how much of a discount is desirable to provide
for this transition period leading up to the higher price and
how much, if any, permanent discount should be provided in
order to help make Canadian goods more competitive abroad.
Senator Goldenberg: Is it not a fact, Senator Manning, that
Venezuela and Mexico charge a considerably lower price for
oil consumed domestically than they do for the oil they export?
Senator Manning: Yes, that is the case. I think they are
making the same mistake as we have been making, and sooner
or later they will have to correct it.
Senator Thompson: I realize you were not intending to go
into the administrative complexities, but I wonder if I might
put a question to you in relation to the impact of higher prices

SENATE DEBATESNombr2,17
on the agricultural sector. Even at a discount of 10 per cent of
the Chicago price. the agricultural producers are going to be
faeed with a tremendous increase in costs. and thcy will have
to pass those nreases through to the consumer, thereby
creating more inflation. Would you care to comment on that?
Senator Manning: I am flot quite sure 1 undcrstood the
question. Perhiaps you could repeat it.
Senator Thompson: I am suggesting that, even wiith a 10 per
cent differential from the Chicago price, tremendous cost
increases wiil arise, and I am thinking particularly of the
agricultural seetor. I realize you did flot want to elaborate at
great lcngth, but there is this concerfi. especially as it relates to
the agrieultural sector. Would you propose that there be a
furthcr differential for the agricultural producers?
Senator Manning: [-onourable senators, I do flot doubt for a
moment that a number of sectors of the Cdnddian cconomny
will pressure vcry strongly for additionai discounts, and it
would thcn be up to the goverfiment to decide whcther or flot
sueh discounts are reasonable. The question of further discounts is one that should be kept separate fron3 the overali
pieture of cstablishing and maintaining a tic between the
Chicago price and the base price in this country. If in the
wisdom of the government it is feit there shouid be a further
discount for the agricultural sector, such a discount could be
impicmented. Decisions in that regard can only bc madc after
a thorough examination of the reasons advanced for such a
diseount.
On motion of Senator Oison, debate adjourned.
REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
SECOND REPORT 0F STANDING JOINT COMNIITTEE ADOPT[ED

Leave having been given to revert to Orders of the Day:
The Senate proceded to consideration of the second report
of the Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and House of
Commons on Regulations and other Statutory Instrum3ents,
which was prescnted yesterday.
Senator Godfrey movcd that the report be adoptcd.
He said: Honourable senators, the Second Report of the
Standing Joint Committcc of the Senate and I-buse of Commons on Regulatioris and other Statutory Instruments comes
in two parts. The first part rcquests approval of the criteria
whieh the committec has uscd since its inception. This approvai is sought and reeeivcd at the start of every session.
The second part of the report deals with the question of
giving the committec the power to make a comprehensive
study of the means by which Parliament can better oversce the
governmental regulatory process-and in this respect the latter
part of Senator M\anning's speech could flot have been more
timcly.
The committee was given this power last year by both the
Senate and the flouse of Commons and had actually started
the process of looking into the regulatory proeess. We were in
ISenator Thornpstn

November 21, 1979

Washington for that purpose when the election was called, and
nothing has been donc since.
It is flot the purpose of the committee to engage a large
staff. Wc ail know that the Economie Council has engaged a
large staff, and is looking into the regulatory process at this
particular moment and will be bringing out its first report
within a week or two. We have lcarned enough because of our
previous work to realize that wecean make some very practical
suggestions to improve the regulatory proess in Canada.
One of the problems with the present powcrs of the committee is that we can only see the regulations after they arc
passed. We feel it would help if those clauses of bis coming
beforc Parliament eontaining the enabling power to pass regulations wcrc referred to the eommittee at the time the bis are
referred to the appropriate eommittee for consideration as a
whole. Our eommitteeceould at that point look into the enabling powers only, and make appropriate suggestions.
There is also the matter of regulations which arc the subjct
of affirmative and negative votes. In thc British Parliainent,
some 60 or 70 pcr cent of the rcgulations passed do not take
effct until an affirmative resolution is passed by cither the
Housc of Comnmons or the House of Lords, or both, and in
other acts thcre is a waiting pcriod to give anyone wishing an
opportunity to propose a negative resolution when regulations
are enacted under the statute.
When a bill is introduced for the first time, there is no
rcason why the first draft of the regulations should flot also be
submittcd to the parliamentary committee considcring the bill.
Olten, bills arc merely skeleton bills. One does flot know what
kind of effeet they wiil have until thc regulations arc passed.
This procedure, by the way, was very effective in connection
with thc recent ncw Immigration Act. The committee studying
the bill requcsted that the departmcnt submit the draft regulations, and because the comm-ittee had thc draft regulations
before it the study of the bill was carricd out with a greater
degree of comprehension as to what the terms of the final
product would bc.
Under the American systcm, there is a pre-publication of
regulations proposcd to be passed, with the resuit that there is
an opportunity for public iniput into the regulations before thcy
become effective.
While in Washington, we mct with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Costie. One of the members of
our committec was rather anti-regulation, and gave a speech
somewhat along the uines that we hcard from Senator Manning today, pointing out how adversely over-regulation can
affect small business.
* (1630)

Mr. Costie pointed out that in the United States thcre was a
small business that neyer employed more than 30 people-the
average numbcr of empioyccs was 20-loeated on the James
River in Virginia. They were flot making a particularly toxie
or dangerous substance. The waste was dumped into the James
River, and the actual eost of clcaning up the Chesapeake River
and James Bay as a resuit of the dumping of that waste will

amount to $9 billion. I could hardly believe it when I heard it.
When 1 inquired around from various other people, I found it
was a famous case in the United States, and the company
which had originally owned this small company had been fined
some $20 million for its involvement up to the time they sold it
some years ago.
As usual there are two sides to this coin, and we want to
consider the whole question so that we can make some suggestions as to how generally we can improve the regulatory
process.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I would like to say a
word of appreciation of the remarks that Senator Godfrey has
just made, and to thank him for bringing to our attention the
rather important second section of the report that he is recommending for our consideration today.
This second section, as he has said, seeks to find ways and
means by 'vhich his committee can do a better job of dealing
with the flood of regulations that now come before us every
month, and I for one am heartily in favour of some way in
which the authority of Parliament can be more effectively
exercised in the scrutiny of this flood of regulations. It is an
inevitable trend of modern government, I suppose-one which
I have deplored for a long time, but to which I contributed to
some extent-in that we find it necessary and inevitable that
certain really legislative powers, powers to make laws, are
delegated to people who are not parliamentarians or members
of a representative body, but to members of the civil service,
the bureaucracy. My experience has been that, by and large,
they do a very conscientious job in trying to interpret statutes
fairly, and to prescribe regulations that are within the four
corners of the law.
We sometimes find that governments have been ill-advised
as to how extensive are the powers that they convey in this
way, and I think a good point is contained in this committee
report that the principles under which the government should
approve regulatory powers in statutes might well be very
closely examined. I think that is a very fruitful field of
endeavour. My view is that as far as possible we should
minimize regulations. Legislative matters should be within the
statute itself. In cases where they are not, then there has to be
this scrutiny of the regulations, which Honourable Senator
Godfrey has referred to.
If this authority enables us to extend the scrutiny and the
effective control of Parliament over the regulatory mechanism,
then I am very much in favour of it.
There is another item that might be considered by the
committee-I do not suggest this in any more than my private
capacity as an individual member of the Senate-and it has to
do with the institution of administrative courts. These days we
find that, as well as the regular judicial process in the country
that deals with civil and criminal law, there is a need to
consider whether there should not be provision for courts to
deal with administrative matters, many of which arise out of
regulations and statutory instruments of the type we are
talking about here.

I know that in Europe, and in France particularly, there is a
well-established regime of administrative courts where one
gets quick justice, so to speak, in dealing with disputes with
bureaucrats. It seems to me that something along that line
might well be looked at by the committee in the course of their
study of this matter. It may not be entirely appropriate for
Canada, and I am not in a position to offer a firm recommendation on the matter. However, I know that it has been found
very useful in other jurisdictions, and it might be considered
here. Instead of having the necessarily elaborate and costly
procedures for taking matters to court that we normally
employ, it might be advantageous to find some better method
of dealing with problems of administrative law that would be
less expensive and would permit those problems to be dealt
with promptly.
With those few comments, I would like to say that we are
certainly happy to support the full report that the honourable
senator has presented.
Motion agreed to and report adopted.
THE ECONOMY
BANNING OF

1.5

LITRE SOFT DRINK BOTTLES-ORDER STANDS

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) calling the
attention of the Senate to the adverse effects on the
Canadian economy of the banning of 1.5 litre bottles from
the soft drink producers in Canada.-(Honourable
Senator Buckwold)
Senator Buckwold: Stand.
Senator Deschatelets: Honourable senators, a point of order
was raised on Monday evening after a motion was made, and it
was taken under advisement by the Chair. I was wondering if a
decision could be given.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I thank the
honourable senator for drawing this to my attention. I understand, however, that at the present time there is a request that
this order stand. That being the case, I think it would be
inappropriate for me to suggest what the results of taking the
point of order into consideration might be. I suggest, therefore,
if it is agreeable to honourable senators, that early in the
proceedings tomorrow I should intimate the conclusion I have
reached, after very exhaustive study of the interesting point
raised.
Senator Deschatelets: I would appreciate it if that could
done early tomorrow, because if the decision of His Honour
the Speaker should be adverse I would then be in a position to
give notice of another motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: I appreciate the point made by the
Honourable Senator Deschatelets, and I trust that when I
make known my decision he will find it satisfactory.
Order stands.

SENATE DEBATES
INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION
SIXTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE HELD AT CARACAS,
VENEZUEL A-REPORT OF CANADIAN DELEGATION PRINTED AS
AN APPENDIX

On the inquiry of Senator Molgat:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Sixty-sixth Annual Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union held at Caracas, Venezuela, 13th to 21st September, 1979, and in particular to the discussions and proceedings of the Conference and the participation therein
of the delegation from Canada.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, I prefer not to speak
this afternoon on the inquiry standing in my name, but I would
ask that the report of the Caracas Conference be appended to
the Debates of today. This will give honourable senators an
opportunity to read the material before this inquiry is debated.
*

(1640)

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Senator Molgat, are you asking that
the debate on Inquiry No. 4 be adjourned in your name?
Senator Molgat: In effect, yes. I do not propose to proceed
today, and am simply asking that the report be printed as an
appendix to the Debates of today, if that is agreeable to
honourable senators.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have some
doubts about appending to Hansard a report which has not
been discussed, and in respect of which there has not been a
clear indication to the Senate of what its contents are.
The question has been raised before as to whether it is
desirable, without any discussion or without a clear indication
of what a document might contain, to have such a document
appended to our proceedings and therefore form part of the
permanent record. Questions have arisen as to whether that
should not always be preceded by a discussion or an indication
of the contents of the document. We have had past experiences
in which regret on the part of some honourable senators has
been expressed that documents have been appended when it
was felt later that had senators known the contents they would
not have agreed.
I therefore suggest to Senator Molgat that he consider this
and make his motion. If he so desires, I will certainly put it.
Senator Godfrey: May I ask Senator Molgat a question? Is
this the report that landed on my desk this morning? Have we
not already seen it anyway? I agree that in the end it should be
appended, but I do not see the point of appending it tonight
when we have already received copies. In other words, I agree
with His Honour.
Senator Molgat: First of ail, I think we have established a
precedent in the course of this particular session in that
Senator Molson made the same request with respect to the

November 21, 1979

report of the Canadian delegation to the Twentieth Meeting of
the Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group.
Secondly, in reply to Senator Godfrey, the problem is that
while the report has been published and distributed, it was sent
only to those honourable senators who are members of the
IPU, because it is a report to the members. In other words,
honourable senators who are not members did not receive a
copy of the report.
I understand the views of His Honour the Speaker perfectly.
Possibly the answer is for me to table the report and then after
it has been perused, request tomorrow or the day after that it
be printed. I am in the hands of the Senate.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, the question of procedure raised by His Honour the Speaker is worth discussing. I
must say, without having given it any profound thought, that I
am inclined to agree with the position he has put before us,
that it would be advisable to be aware of the contents of
documents before we take the action of appending them to the
Debates.
However, I also understand what Senator Molgat wants to
do and I think it desirable that he achieve his end somehow.
He wants us to know what is in the document so that when he
makes his speech on the subject we will be in a position to
listen intelligently. What could be fairer than that?
Is it not possible for him to obtain other copies of the report
which could be sent to those senators who did receive one? I
thank him for the copy he sent me, but could he send copies to
those senators who may not be members of this particular
body? They could then read the report and the senator's
objective would be achieved and our position in the house
preserved.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I hope I am
not in danger of engaging in a debate. At times it is a great
temptation while I sit here.
However, I would observe that had I heard the title of the
report, or had it been in my hands, I would not have made the
observation I did. I therefore suggest that, if Senator Molgat
were to move, it being duly seconded, that the document
entitled: "To Ali Members of the Canadian Group: Report on
the 66th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Caracas, Venezuela,
September 13 to 21, 1979" be printed as an appendix to the
Debates of the Senate of today, I would certainly not have
made the observation I did, because I would then have been
aware that the appending of such an Inter-Parliamentary
Relations document has become almost a convention of this
house.
It is moved by Senator Molgat, seconded by Senator McDonald, that this report be printed as an appendix to today's
proceedings. Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Motion agreed to.
(For text of report see Appendix "B", p. 397)
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

ENERGY
SELF-SUFFICIENCY-RESOURCES

AND COST OF DEVELOPMENT-ANSWER TO QUESTIONS

1. In 1978, Canada produced about 9.1 quads of primary
energy from all sources (a quad is a measure of the thermal
value, Btus, of energy, equal to 180 million barrels of oil).
Approximately 8.6 quads of primary energy were required to
meet the energy consumption of Canadians in that year.
Canadian production of crude oil and its equivalents in 1978
averaged 1.58 million barrels per day. This accounted for 36%
of the total energy produced. The production of natural gas
was at the level of 1.9 billion cubic feet. This provided 27% of
Canada's total energy production. Primary electricity from
hydro sources, amounting to some 235 billion kilowatt hours,
accounted for 26% of primary energy. The 30 billion kilowatt
hours provided by nuclear energy contributed about 3% to
energy supply. The remaining 8% was provided by coal.
Since Canadians consumed about 8.5 quads of energy in
1978, Canada was a net exporter of energy in that year even
though it was a net importer of petroleum. In that year the
average gross oil imports were at the rate of 665,000 barrels a
day, approximately 50 of which were in the form of refined
products. After allowing for exports of crude oil and equivalents, refined products and liquid petroleum gas, net imports
were at the level of approximately 180,000 barrels a day.
The 6% surplus of production over consumption in 1978 is
not likely to persist over the medium-term future. According
to projections in the National Energy Board's Oil Report
(1978) and its Gas Report (1979), this surplus is projected to
fall to about 3% by 1980 and become a deficit of 5% in 1985
and 10% in 1990. Because of changes in prices of world oil
since these reports were compiled, they contain a possible
overstatement of total energy demand. Therefore, the extent of
the projected shortfall from a condition of energy self-sufficiency may also be overstated.
A recent analysis by Energy, Mines and Resources, which
attempts to take into account changes in world energy prices
since the NEB report, projects lower levels of energy demand.
This new set of demand projections attempts to take explicit
account of the effects of the changes in the relative fuel prices
on interfuel substitution.
One of these projections assumed that Canadian domestic
oil prices would be at parity with the international price by
1986. Based on this scenario, the total primary energy demand
is projected to grow at about 2.2% per year to 2000 (compared
to an average rate of 5.6% from 1973 to 1976 and 2.7%
between 1973 and 1978) or an increase of 24% from current
levels.

Among individual fuels, nuclear power is projected to
increase its share of consumption most rapidly, while the
relative shares contributed by oil and gas fall. Of the 13.7
quads of primary energy consumed in the year 2000, 31%
would still be in the form of oil, 17% would be provided by gas,
30% by hydro, 13% by coal, and 9% by nuclear.
2. In terms of achieving energy self-sufficiency by 1990,
Canada has a bountiful, but difficult, energy resource endowment. There is a broad agreement that more supplies can be
found if the incentives are right. The aforementioned EMR
report deals primarily with projections of demand and therefore does not attempt a definitive statement of the future
patterns of increases in supplies of oil and gas. It does,
however, for the purpose of discussion, suggest a more optimistic scenario for non-conventional oil production than was
contained in the NEB reports. The National Energy Board
foresaw the possibility of an increase of some 495,000 barrels a
day in non-conventional oil production by 1990. Based on
more recent development results, the revised EMR report
foresees the possibility of an additional 185,000 barrels a day
by 1990 (for a total of non-conventional oil production of
680,000 barrels a day more than in 1978). This analysis
cautions that despite the increased levels of international oil
prices, strenuous efforts will be needed to achieve the very
rapid increases in non-conventional oil supplies which are
assumed here. The same positive linkage between supplies and
incentives is also widely believed to be true for the high-cost
frontier basins. Given the changes in international oil prices
that have already occurred, even these supply revisions may be
pessimistic.
As a consequence of these revised demand and oil supply
projections, there is a good basis for some significant improvement in the extent to which Canada could be self-sufficient in
total energy. Canada could be in a state of rough energy
balance in 1985, switching to a deficit in later years. However,
this trend to a deficit could be reversed by greater substitution
of oil by gas and more effective conservation measures.
Towards the end of this century, the shares of the several
energy sources in total supply, all from domestic sources,
would likely match the energy demand projections previously
mentioned.
3. In 1978, Canadians spent about 10% of the value of the
GNP on meeting their energy requirements (expenditures on
energy equals $12.6 billion (1971 $), GNE was $126.7 billion
(1971 $). This ratio under assumptions of reaching domestic

SENATE DEBATESNoebr1,99
paritv with world prices in 1986 would deteriorate only slightly
($22 billion out of $207 billion in 1971 $).
The exact amounit of investment required and the manner in
which it would be financed is highly dependent upon the
relationship between world and domestic oil prices. These are
at preserit the subject of negotiation between the federal and
provincial governiments. A more adequate answer to this question will have to await suceessful resoluÉdon of these negotiations. The fiscal regimes will largely influence the tirning and
nature of cnergy investment. Il is clear that there is a large
mneasure of agreement between the federal and provincial
governments and industry as to the principles essential to tax
policy directed at achieving satisfactory future energy balances, namely:
1. lndustry needs adequate cash flows to undertake its
investments;
2. lndustry needs reasonable profit expeetations, commensurate with risks to undertake these investmients;
3. The provinces, as owners of resources, require their
share of economie rent; and

November 21,

1979

4. The federal government needs to proteet its tax base if
the oil and gas industry is to contribute to the financing of
federal economie programs.
Although the principles are simple enough, the difficulty is
to define the formula for the division of revenues which
accommodate the above objectives.
It is apparent that moving Canadian energy prices to international levels within existing institutional arrangements raîses
major financial and economie issues, even if the increases were
phased in over a period of several years. Consideration must be
given to ways in which the negative effeets might bc reduced,
while recognizing the legitimate interests of aIl concernied. It is
in this context that the federal government has called for a
process of reviewing carefully the structure of incentives
designed to influence new energy investînent to ensure that
they are both adequate and compatible with energy and economic policy objectives, including the stimulation of Canadian
participation. With appropriate fiscal regimnes, achieving
energy self-sufficiency by 1990 would be a difficult but not an
impossible task within the competence and financial capacity
of the Canadian private sector.

SIXTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CON FERENCE. CARACAS, VENEZUELA

I-CANADIAN DELEGATION
The delegation was led by Senator Gildas Molgat, Chairmani of the Canadian Group and consisted of Senators Rhéal
Bélisle, Joseph Guay, P.C. and Joan Neiman, and from the
House of Commons, Derek Blackburn, Charles Caccia, Dennis
Dawson, Benno Friesen, Rosaire Gendron, Bruce Halliday,
Robert Holmies, Douglas Neil and Patrick Nowlan. Mr.
Nowlan was accompanied by his daughter and ail other delegates except Senator Neiman and Messrs Blackburn, Caccia,
Dawson and Halliday were accompanied by their wives.
Staff support was provided by Jean Macpherson, Executive
Secretary-Treasurer of the Canadian Group, Maija Adamsons, Deputy Executive-Secretary Treasurer and Mr. Roger
Hill, Adviser to the delegation.
The Ninister of Transport authorized a Viscount aircraft to
take the delegation to and from the Caracas conference. Due
to the length of the flight an overnight stop in San Juan,
Puerto Rico was arranged en route to Caracas and one in
Jacksonville, Florida on the return trip.
Il-INAUGURAL CEREMONY AND FIRST PLENARY
SESSION
The opening of the 66th lnter-Parliamentary Conference
took place in the Circulo de las Fuerzas Armadas, at 11:-00
a.m. in the presence of the President of the Republic of
Venezuela, Dr. Luis Herrera Campins. The summary record
of this inaugural ceremony is attached as Appendix A.
Parliamentarians from 82 countries participated in this 66th
Inter-Parliamentary Conference. As their first item of business
they unanimously elected Mr. Godofredo Gonzales, President
of the Venezuelan Congress and Inter- Parliamentary Group,
to be President of the Conference.
The United Kingdom delegation requested that a supplementary item entitled Refugeesfrom Viet Nam be included in
the Conference agenda. The United Kingdomn delegation presented the following draft resolution:
"The 66th Inter- Parliamentary Conference,
Recalling the undertakings reached at the Conference
arranged by the United Nations Secretary General at
Geneva on 20 and 21 July regarding the Vietnamese
refugees,
Dep!oring the exodus of large numbers of these refugees
and recognizing the great strains on neighbouring territo-

80072 -28

ries, constituting a threat to peace and stability in South
East Asia,
Cails on the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the International Community and the United Nations to fulfil
expeditiously and positively the decisions reached at the
United Nations Geneva Conference".
M4r. Jlack Page of the United Kingdomn spoke in favour of
the proposai arguing that it was the duty of the Inter-Parliamentary Conference to support the United Nations particularly in the field of Human Rights and that it would be a
dereliction of duty not to discuss the plight of the refugees
from Viet Nam, Mr. Darvasi of Hungary was against the
proposai for procedural reasons. He said that agreement had
been reached between Viet Nam and the United Nations High
Commissioner which could be harmed by any discussion and
he urged rejection of the proposai in the interest of peace and
progress. Mr. Maitre Phan-Ahan of Viet Nam deplored what
he described as a provocative proposai. He said the subject had
been discussed at length in Geneva, that substantial results
had aîready been obtained and that there was no need to
discuss the subject.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure a roll-caîl vote
was taken on whether or not this item should be added to the
agenda. The result of the vote was as follows: valid votes cast
634, for the proposai 372, against the proposai 262 and
abstentions 298. As a majority of two thirds (423) was
required for the adoption of the proposai, the President
declared the proposai rejected. A tally of the votes by country
on the request for the insertion of a supplementary item on
Refugees from Viet Nam is attached as Appendix B.
111-GENERAL DEBATE
Three Plenary Sessions were allotted to consideration of:
(a) the Political, Economic and Social Situation of the
World and the Activities of the Union;
(b) Implementation of the Final Document of the 1Oth

Disarmament; and
(c) the Middle East Question and the Palestinian
Problem-,
Approximately 105 speakers took part in this debate, including observers representing the Palestine National Council.
Speaking on behaîf of the Canadian delegation, Senator
Molgat expressed the view that the world in 1979 was not a

SENATE DEBATES

very happy place for many of its peoples, and that it was
necessary to do everything possible to relieve the most dangerous tensions and promote positive developments. He said that
one was struck by the plight of the Vietnamese boat people
and the population of Cambodia. The continuing violations of
Human Rights in Latin America should also be deplored.
However, one should not point the finger at any particular
continent since the I.P.U. was concerned with such problems
wherever they might occur. Developments with regard to
decolonization in Africa were also cause for dismay, at times,
as well as hope. He said Canadians were also very concerned
about peace in the Middle East and had shown evidence of this
concern by providing troops for a whole series of peace-keeping forces in the area, and hoped to do whatever they could to
help rather than hinder the achievement of a just and lasting
peace in the Middle East. This was the context in which recent
discussions about the Canadian Embassy in Israel should be
seen. He said the Government of Canada is presently undertaking a study of this question, in the context of making
whatever contribution it can to progress towards a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East and to that end has
appointed Mr. Robert Stanfield-a distinguished and respected Canadian-to conduct a commission of enquiry. Senator
Molgat pointed out that Mr. Stanfield had already left on a
mission to the Middle East, where he would engage in consultations with aIl the parties concerned, and the Government
would obviously consider his recommendations very seriously
in any decisions it might subsequently take.
Also participating in this debate, Mr. Caccia spoke of the
position of Canada as being placed physically between the two
super powers. The enormous amount of money spent on arms
did not make sense. He said that general disarmament was the
ultimate goal, but many questions had to be answered as
progress is made towards that end. The best policy was a step
by step approach. The preservation of peace rested on a
balance of deterrents between the great powers. One problem
was how to control the technological development of new
systems of nuclear weapons. This had an impact on foreign
policy, which was in danger of becoming the servant of defence
policy. The dialogue between the major powers had led to
some limitation of weapons but not to a reduction of existing
forces. Mr. Caccia called for a comprehensive test ban, for a
prohibition on the development of new systems and on the use
of fissionable material for military purposes and for a limit of
expenditure on military systems. Such measures, if pursued,
could lead effectively to disarmament he concluded.
IV-SUBJECTS DEBATED AND RESOLUTIONS
ADOPTED
(a) Implementation of the Final Document of the 10th Special
Session of the U.N. General Assembly devoted to Disarmament
Following the general debate the draft resolution on this
subject, together with 12 amendments to it presented by the
Groups of the Federal Republic of Germany, the U.S.S.R.,

November 21, 1979

India, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Spain, Cyprus, the
German Democratic Republic, Belgium, the U.S.A. and conposite amendments presented by the Groups of the Nordic
countries, was submitted to the Committee on Political Questions, International Security and Disarmament.
Prior to the meeting of this Committee, Mr. Caccia consulted with Senator Guay and other members of the delegation to
review the amendments to the original draft resolution and to
decide which ones could and could not be supported from the
Canadian standpoint.
Under its Chairman, Mr. Sture Ericson (Sweden), the
Committee on Political Questions, International Security and
Disarmament dealt with ail the amendments before it and
came up with an amended draft resolution which was adopted
by 51 votes to 0, with 1 abstention, by the Committee. While
voting against some particular paragraphs at the Committee
stage, Canada supported this new draft resolution which was
unanimously adopted by the Conference at its final plenary
sitting.
The full text of the resolution on Implementation of the
Final Document of the 10th Special Session of the U.N.
General Assembly devoted to Disarmament can be found in
the enclosed booklet RESOLUTIONS, NOMINATIONS,
ELECTIONS.
(b) The Middle East Question and the PalestinianProblem
As this subject had not been studied at the Spring Meetings
in Prague last April, delegations were invited to present draft
resolutions. Five were tabled---one by the Jordanian, Syrian,
Lebanese and Tunisian Groups, one by the Israeli delegation,
one by the French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese delegations to which an amendment was submitted by the Egyptian
Group, one by the Netherlands delegation and one by the
United States Group.
In the hope of arriving at a single text the Committee on
Political Questions, International Security and Disarmament
struck a Drafting Committee consisting of representatives
from Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, U.S.S.R., U.S.A.,
Yugoslavia, Senegal, France, Spain, Kenya, Sri Lanka,
Venezuela and the Netherlands. The Yugoslav representative
was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee which,
after long hours of work, presented a single draft resolution on
this subject.
Mr. Nowlan took prime responsibility for this question.
Unfortunately the entire Canadian delegation could not be
convened to consider the text presented by the Drafting Committee as it was circulated only at the Committee on Political
Questions, International Security and Disarmament when it
was to be considered. Mr. Nowlan was prepared to support the
text presented by the Drafting Committee but as the full
Committee proceeded with its work, the Yugoslav delegatewho had, in fact, chaired the Drafting Committee-led an
assault on the text which drastically changed its nature from a
balanced to a very one-sided one. This development was so
remarkable and unusual that it thoroughly upset the Drafting
Committee's rapporteur-Mr. Chandernagor of France-who

November 21, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

denounced the entire proceedings and left the meeting. Consequently Canada, like several other countries, did not support
the draft resolution adopted on this subject by the Committee
on Political Questions, International Security and Disarmament by a vote of 37 for to 4 against, with 10 abstentions.
The Canadian delegation met to discuss the various issues
included in the new text prior to the vote at the final plenary
session.
As Chairman of the Committee on Political Questions,
International Security and Disarmament, Mr. Ericson
(Sweden) reported to the final Plenary Session that 5 different
draft resolutions had been received on this subject. He said
that a Drafting Committee had been appointed which after 12
hours of work had presented a text supported by 10 votes to 1,
with 3 abstentions. He reported that during subsequent considerations by the Political Committee a series of three amendments were proposed by those who had voted for the original
text in the Drafting Committee. He suggested that this was a
waste of the Drafting Committee's time. Those who had voted
for the text should have supported the Political Committee
otherwise it would make work impossible. Having said that he
presented the text as amended.
Following interventions by delegates from France, the
Syrian Arab Republic, Israel and a representative of the
Palestinian National Council, the Conference proceeded to
vote by roll-call on the draft resolution. The result of the vote
was 494 for the resolution, 110 against with 288 abstentions.
Since the number of valid votes cast were 604 the required
majority was 303 so the resolution was adopted. The Canadian
delegation cast 8 votes against the resolution and 6 abstentions. The result of the roll-call vote on the Middle East
Question and the PalestinianProblem is attached as Appendix
C.
The text of the resolution adopted in the Middle East
Question and the Palestinian Problem is included in the
enclosed booklet Resolutions, Nominations, Elections.
It is worth noting that, while the Canadian delegation
decided to mention the Stanfield Mission, no other delegation
referred to the location of the Canadian Embassy in Israel
during the formal plenary or committee sessions.
(c) The Legislative Aspects of Space Law
Senator Neiman, as Rapporteur from the Spring Meetings
on the question of space law, presented her report and said
that there could be no doubt that our country recognized the
contribution made by the United States and the U.S.S.R. to
the advancement of space technology. The draft resolution
prepared at the Spring Meetings tried to combine a mood of
conciliation in dealing with space technology with a determination to press governments to reach further and more significant accord in the cause of world peace. In respect of the
Moon Treaty, several amendments had been tabled recognizing a significant milestone in space history. At the Spring
Meetings divergent views were expressed on certain areas of
space law and the draft resolution represented a consensus on
a number of vital matters of concern to all countries.

Approximately 30 delegates spoke during the Plenary Session allocated to consideration of the Legislative Aspects of
Space Law.
Speaking on behalf of his delegation, Mr. Neil said that
Canada had been active in space programs for a number of
years. Her latest satellite would undertake exciting trials in
bringing communications and television to remote areas and
small scattered settlements. Canada was continuing to cooperate with the United States and other countries. Forest management experience was a particular field in which Canada had
shared her knowledge with others. He said that Canada had
tabled certain amendments to the draft resolution on space law
being considered by the Conference, in an effort to clarify it
and bring it up to date. He explained the significance of these
amendments. Exploration and knowledge of space was in its
infancy. It was vital that we proceed with extreme caution to
ensure that the development of space law was for the benefit of
all and not for a few States.
The draft resolution and 1l sets of amendments presented
by the U.S.S.R. Group, the Indian delegation, the Bulgarian
Group, the Romanian Group, the Moroccan Group, the
French delegation, the Canadian delegation, the Mexican
Group, a Moroccan delegate, the United States delegation and
the Spanish Group were referred to the Committee on Parliamentary, Juridical and Human Rights Questions for
consideration.
The Canadian delegation met under the chairmanship of
Mr. Neil to consider the various amendments to the original
draft resolution. These were then considered by the full Committee on Parliamentary, Juridical and Human Rights Questions which adopted an amended draft resolution by 27 votes
to 0 with I abstention.
Senator Neiman, on behalf of the Committee on Parliamentary, Juridical and Human Rights Questions, presented the
draft resolution to the final Plenary Session. Mr. Pickle
(U.S.A.) intervened to say that his delegation could not support the draft resolution because of the number of restrictions
and limitations put on the dissemination of information
derived from satellites. Mr. Sobarso (Mexico) said that his
delegation would support the draft resolution but that he
regretted there had been no mention about the common
patrimony of the moon.
The result of the vote by roll-call on this draft resolution was
682 for to 39 against with 65 abstentions. The number of valid
votes cast were 721 so the resolution was adopted having
achieved more than the required majority of 361 votes.
Canada cast all 14 votes in favour of the resolution even
though it included references to the delimitation of Outer
Space and the particular rights of equatorial countries with
respect to geostationary orbit which Canada had voted against
when the text was considered in the Committee stage. The
final resolution takes a position on direct broadcasting by
satellite which is based on positions which Canada has
advanced in the United Nations. The result of the roll-call vote

(d) Protection of the Faniily auid General Gare of Chi/dren
and Youth in connection with the International Year of the
Child
Approximately 57 delegates, including a representative of
the Palestinian National Council and Mr. Charles Egger,
Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF, participated in the
two Plenary Sessions allotted ta consider this subject.
Mr. Friesen explained that Canada was already working
towards many of the aims of the resolution on the family and
children. He citcd the fact that Dr. Halliday had just returned
from the Conference on Population and Development in Sri
Lanka; the problems of handicapped children and emnphasized
the anguish resulting from the breakdown of marriage as an
increasing phenomenon. Ail too often marriages broke down in
a spirit of acrimony. The greatest victims in that situation
were the children, who became helpless pawns with divided
loyalties. With the growth of international travel and intermarriage it was ail the more likely that relationships would
breakdown and mare child tragedies would result. H-e cited a
specific case of a child being abducted by onc of ils parents.
The problem might not involve many people but governments
should acknowledge the importance of the question of custody
of children. He asked for support for a Canadian amendmcnt
ta the draft resolution intended ta enhance the physical and
emotional security of children of divarced or separated parents
by recogni7ing as binding the custody arrangements established in the courts of thic country where they are residing at
the time of separation.
Following the general debate the draft resolution and 12
amendments presented by the Croup of the Federal Republie
of Germany, the U.S.S.R. Croup, the Indian delegation, the
Bulgarian Group, the Romnanian Croup, the N4oroecan Croup,
the Luxembourg Croup, the Croups of the Nordie Countries,
the Canadian Croup, the British Croup, the Spanish Croup
and the Cyprus Croup were referred to the Econoiei and
Social Committee for examination.
Mr. Friesen met with miembers of the Canadian delegation
ta discuss the amendments prior ta the meeting of the Economie and Social Committee. The latter unanimously adopted
a rcvised draft resolution which included Canada's proposed
amendment. This same draft resolution was subsequently
unanimously adopted by the Conference at the final Plenary
Session.

Approximately 52 delegates, including Mr. Enrique Oteiza
representing UNESCO. partieipated in the debate on this
topie.
Dr. Halliday expressed the support of the Canadian delegalion for the draft resolution on education for peace and related
matters. He also drew attention to the need for education and
the dissemination of information in the field of population
activities. World population growth was outstripping the ability of the world to support it. It has been estimated that the
population of the world will reach 8 to 10 billion by the middle
of the next century. The implications of that growth were
alarming, especially as by far the greater part of it would be in
the developing countries. It was essential to devclop population
policies. Parliamentarians should ensure that their governments gave proper attention to population problems; the need
was 'evident and urgent" to quote the Colombo Declaration.
There should be incentives to reverse the emigration from
rural ta urban areas. The role of women should be enhanced.
Family planning services and education in this field should be
provided. Only a tenth of one per cent of the amount spent on
armaments was spent on population activities. Dr. Halliday
concluded by stressing the vital importance of tackling the
problems posed by the growth of the world's population.
Mr. Dawson had presented an amendmnent, on behaîf of the
Canadian delegation, to the original draft resolution on the
subjeet. Following the general debate, the original draft resolotion and 15 sets of amecdments presented by the U.S.A.
Croup, the U.S.S.R. Croup, the Indian delegation, the Bu]garian Croup, a Moroccan delegate, thc (iroup of the Federal

Croup. the British Croup, the Cyprus Croup, thue Canadian
Croup, the Sudanese Croup, the Egyptian Croup, the New
Zealand Croup and the Spanish delegation were relerred ta
the Commnittee on Education, Science, Culture and Environment for consideration.
Mr. Dawson and Dr. Halliday convened the Canadian delegation to examine ail the amendiments prior ta the meeting of
the Committee on Education, Science, Culture and Environment which ultimately adopted a revised text which included
the Canadian amendment by a vote of 31 for to 1 against with
no abstentions. This revised draît resolution was unanimously
adopted by the Conference at ils final Plcnary Session.

Approximately 60 speakers took part in the debate on this

assessing the tenar of the debate it was decided that littIe
would be gained by another speech so the Canadian delegate

Lanka), Mr. E. Cuvelier (Belgium), Mr. Mirza Gholam Hafiz
(Bangladesh), Mr. S. Ericson (Sweden), Mr. C. Kallias
(Greece) and Mr. R.N. Mirdha (India). In discussions with
delegates of the western caucus, and before the vote was taken,
Mr. Kallias withdrew his candidacy. Subsequently the 3 candidates that the western caucus had agreed to support-Messrs
Cuvelier, Ericson and Navaratnam-were each elected to a
four year term of office on the Executive Committee.

During the conference each of the 5 Study Committees
suggested subjects which might be included in the Work
Program for 1980. At the Committee on Political Questions,
International Security and Disarmament the Canadian delegation suggested that an appropriate topic for next year's Work
Program would be "the urgent need to review the structure
and procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in order to
make it a more effective forum for parliamentary discussion
and international understanding".

IX-SOCIAL AND SPOUSES' PROGRA MS
(a) Social Program

evening participants were treated to the International Ballet of
Caracas featuring Zhandra Rodriguez at the Teatro
Municipal.

Out of the 15 items reviewed by the Committee this one
received the highest number of votes. Eighth on the preference
list was another topic suggested by the Canadian delegation;
namely, "the importance of considering on a regular basis the
structure and procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union by
having the retiring President of the Inter-Parliamentary Council submit a report reviewing his term of office". While neither
of these topics were included in next year's Work Program, the
issues involved were aired and will be further considered by the
Executive Committee at its meeting in Oslo next Spring.

On Sunday, September 16, an all day excursion was
arranged including a visit to "Historical Caracas" followed by

SIXTY-SIXTH INTER-PARLIAMENTARY
CONFERENCE
13-21 SEPTEMBER 1979-CARACAS, VENEZUELA

INAUGURAL CEREMONY OF THE 66th
CONFERENCE
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER

13th,

1979

The Conference was opened at 11.05 a.m., in the presence of
the President of the Republic of Venezuela, Dr. Luis Herrera
Campins.
Mr. Godofredo Gonzalez, President of the Delegation of
Venezuela, welcomed the representatives of the Parliaments of
the member countries of the IPU on behalf of the Parliament
of Venezuela. He paid tribute to the Union as the representative body of more than eighty Parliaments. Its basic objective
was the development of parliamentary institutions which it
sought to achieve through the discussion of international issues
with a view to finding solutions to them through parliamentary
channels.
The agenda of business to be discussed by the Conference
was too lengthy and comprehensive for him to refer to all
items. He wished however to cite three important subjects
which were down for commission. The first was the question of
world disarmament, a complex and delicate issue. The Parliaments of the world should bring an element of rationality to
the problem and help to arrest the suicidal search for armaments. The second subject was decolonization, a specially
sensitive subject for Latin America with its past history of
struggles against colonialism. He welcomed the new members
of the Union. The third subject was human rights, which had
long been the concern of Parliamentarians. He referred with
regret to the existence of repressive regimes in Latin America.
Venezuela in the past had suffered from such regimes. She
now shared the sufferings of her sister countries and lamented
the absence of Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.
Mr. Gonzalez continued by referring to the multiplicity of
interests represented in the Venezuelan Parliament and to the
free expression of ideals and respect for minorities on which
that body was based. It was not enough to have goodwill and
noble intentions with regard to the rights of man. It was
essential to have a clear determination to translate the goodwill and intentions into reality so that freedom, justice, dignity,
self-determination and sovereignty among men were not an
illusion but a fact. He concluded by once again welcoming
delegates to the Conference and hoped that their discussions
would contribute to the achievement of the fundamental aims
of all democratic Parliaments.
Sir Tom Williams (President of the Inter-Parliamentary
Council) said that one of his greatest privileges as President of
the Inter-Parliamentary Council had been to act as the
Union's spokesman in expressing thanks for the unfailing
generosity of the hosts of various conferences. Mohammed had
once said that the greatest gift to man was that of being

hospitable; it was a double blessing because it blessed him who
gave and him who received.
He expressed his gratitude to the Parliament and people of
Venezuela for their invitation to Caracas, for the warmth of
their welcome and the trouble that had been taken to ensure
delegates' comfort during their stay. He expressed thanks to
the President for honouring the Conference by his presence.
There was a story that when God made the world he gave
that part that came to be called Venezuela the most beautiful
hills and valleys, the richest ores and minerais and the most
precious metals and stones. St. Peter had complained that it
was not fair that so much that was precious and valuable
should have been given to such a small part of the world. God
had said, "Ah, but you have not seen the people that I am
going to put there yet." He was of the opinion that what God
meant was that the people he intended to put in Venezuela
would be equal in value to all the other things he had deposited
there.
In the people of Venezuela blazed a love of freedom that
made men courageous enough to be prepared to sacrifice
everything to be free. Their great national hero had said that
freedom could not be divided and he had led the whole of
Latin America to fight until it had thrown off its chains of
tyranny. Venezuela had had other tyrannies since the time of
Simon Bolivar but had overthrown them ail. Today parliamentarians felt a quickening of the blood to be in the land where
the flame of freedom burnt with so bright a glow.
Today, they were inaugurating a conference that had more
members than ever before. When the Union had been born,
less than 100 years ago, it would not have been possible for 80
or more nations to have met together, because most would
have been in the bondage of foreign overlords. Freedom
remained a tender plan and they must be vigilant against the
threats of tyranny.
They could re-learn from Simon Bolivar the strange paradox
of history-that men were born to be free; that at all times and
in all places men had been in chains, but would always
struggle till their chains fell free.
The lesson that had to be learned was that if tyranny was to
perish for ever those of our generation and those that followed
would have to keep clear the vision that our fathers had-that
every tyranny perished and that the end of mankind was to be
for ever free.
He had not always been successful in giving, in the language
of host countries, suitable quotations. In London, he had
spoken a Latin grace before a public dinner and had subsequently been asked by their distinguished Secretary General,
"Mr. President, was the language that you were speaking
Welsh?" However, he would, on the last occasion on which he
would be privileged to speak at an opening session of a
conference, choose a Welsh quotation. Translated into English
it was that man's journeys through history were as through a
desert, but with always the distant vision of the hills of peace.
When, through time's trials, its portais he reached, none of the

SENATIE DEBATESNombr2,17

hardships would purposcless sccm. With fear as companion,
and threatened with stormns, knowing death as his awn separate end, yct if while life lasted he was truc to his heritage hc
would have triumphcd over history's storms and left to his
childrcn a path ta a heaven that no tempcst might touch.
That quotation caught the truth of our human situation. The
worid was a dangereous place and often proved the descrt of
the soul but the truc man had always been more than conqueror of the evils that had beset him. Many had dicd for the vision
of a world at peace and wc werc the inheritors of their vision.
It was flot a littie thing ta bciong ta a union of men and womcn
chosen by their fcllows ta find the way of peace and the way ta
a warld in which thcy might live without fear. They must be
truc ta that heritage and finish what their fathers had begun.
Because thcy were leaders in their cauntries they had ta use
their time together ta learn how better ta serve those who had
eicctcd them. For anc of his faith, he could do no better than
ta repeat the prayer with which the Qucen of England ended
every speech with which she opened Parliament -N4ay
Almighty God guide your thoughts and wards and bicss you in
ail your endeavours for the good of aur people now and
always." Whatcvcr anc's faith, those wcre gaad words. However interpreted thcy must mean ta cveryone that man's daing
was nothing worth unlcss he knew himself ta be serving a
greater cause mcrcly than himself.
Mr. Pere: de Cuellar, Undcr-Sccretary Gencral of the
United Nations, dclivered a message on behaîf of the General
Sccrctary of the United Nations. The General Secrctary had
great pleasure in scnding grcctings to the representatives of
world Parliaments. In his report he refcrred ta the past ycar as
being full of canfliet: The international scene was very dcpressing. There had been sudden shifts in political, social and
economie balances. In different ways these shifts affected ail
nations and peaples and ncw and unprcdictable events aftcn
followed. What was naw necded was a period of assessmcnt
and stocktaking. Nations had perhaps lost sight of many of the
political, scientifie and tcchnicai advances made over the past
thirty ycars. Thcy needcd ta pause ta assess and take advantage of those Avances. There was still a great nced ta redress
long standing palitical and economie grievances and ta alieviate the suffering that existcd in many parts of the world. There
wcre many unrcsalved problems which led ta a sense of
disillusion. ldeaiism was not cnough by itself. What was
needed was practical stcps ta realise the basic aims of the
community of nations. The IPU through its discussions cauld
assist the work of the United Nations. He coneluded by
wishing the Conference cvcry success.
Dr. Louis Herrera Carnpirn, the President of the Republie
of Venezuela, extended a warni wclcomc ta delegates attending the Conference on behaif of the Gavernment and people of

1979

Venezuela. It was an honaur for Caracas ta be able ta welcamne them. He spake of the IPU as anc of the oldest, if not the
oldest. international organization. It was an assembly for the
meeting of representatives from aIl] over the world in order that
they cauld exehange opinions and discuss the fundamental
problems affecting mankind. His persanal mcmlory of the IPU
was its constant concern for human rights. It was essential ta
guarantc that ail people enjoyed the rights of frcedam, justice
dignity and solidarity. Some countries ignored these rights on
anc pretext or another, The struggle for human rights nceded
constant effort and dedicatian.
This was not a national problcm; it was anc faccd by
everybody. It was necessary ta make human rights rcspectcd.
Man had ta live in an environmcnt of freedom, but freedom
within the law.
Mvan could not carry on scientifie ereatian withaut bcing
cnablcd ta enjoy the excellence af pluralist organisations. Man
wishcd ta live in social justice, free from the exploitation of the
poar by the powerful. He could not live in an environmcnt that
dcnicd him the oppartunity of bcing a thinking creature.
There was an anxiety about national independence in
America, Africa and Asia. People were fighting ta bc masters
of their own future. In America this had been the case with
several countries in the past few ycars. Thcy had taken on
obligations so that thcy could, through integration, be guarantccd their independence.
It had been said that it was nccessary ta bear in mind the
fact that the people of South America were nat Eurapean.
They included a combinatian of African and American people.
There was a mixture of characteristies. Europcans werc mixed
together with Americans and Africans and they in turn had
mixed with Indians.
There wcrc fears of a population explosion and gencral
impaverishmcnt: Everyone was awarc that it was necessary ta
develop full potential in the face of universai hunger. Thcy
were trying ta do so by achieving an international economie
order. The difficuity of devcloping countries was that their
unity and soiidarity did nat always prove sufficient for them ta
understand each other. It was nccessary ta proteet the price of
raw materials. Wc had ta establish conditions that were indispensable in terms of the strcngth of investment. It was necessary ta attain the highest level of teehnology of which thcy
were capable.
There was an important raie for Parliament ta play, not
simply because it had the authority ta legisiate and contraI
administration but because of the importance of historical and
social evolutian. On behaif of dcmocracy, he weicamed the
delegates ta the Conference.
The Inaugural Ceremony was concluded ai 12.05 p.i.

THE ECONOMY
BANNING OF

1.5

LITRE SOFT DRINK BOTTLES-SPEAKER'S
RULING ON POINT OF ORDER

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, before I proceed to call the order of business, I have the duty to respond to
a request from two honourable senators for consideration of a
point of order that was raised at Monday night's sitting of the
Senate.
Honourable senators will recall that when the Senate
adjourned at that time the point of order was left in abeyance
with a request that it be taken under advisement by the Chair
and a report made to the Senate.
Perhaps I should recite the circumstances very briefly. A
debate was under way on an inquiry in the name of Senator
Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) concerning the bottling of
certain soft drinks. Senator Deschatelets spoke to the inquiry
and then moved as follows:
-honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Edgar Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche),
that the matter regarding the adverse effects on the
Canadian economy of the banning of the 1.5 litre bottles
from the soft drink producers in Canada be referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce.
At that point the Leader of the Government, the Honourable

Senator Flynn, P.C., said:
-I rise on a point of order.
He said:
-I am opposed to the procedure whereby during an
inquiry, which is only debating a certain matter, a motion
is made to refer the matter to a committee without due
notice. Normally any motion of that kind would require at
least one day's notice.
Senator Deschatelets then said he believed that the motion,
without notice, was justified by at least one precedent. He then
cited the precedent, which is found in the Journals of the
Senate of May 27, 1975 at page 380. I might say that in
Senate Hansard for November 19, 1979, the year was given
incorrectly as 1978. The point was raised in 1975. Senator
Deschatelets then suggested that the matter be taken under
advisement.
0

(1400)

Senator Flynn said it may have occurred before but perhaps
it was not an applicable precedent and asked that it be taken

under advisement. Other senators made several suggestions
following that as to which committee the inquiry might be
referred.
I have given very careful consideration to the matter and
have consulted the authorities, as they appeared to be
appropriate.
The point of order was, as I understood it, that notice was
required before that question could be put. The position taken
by Senator Deschatelets was that no notice was required
because of a precedent set in 1975 and, presumably, that rule
46(b) was applicable.
Perhaps I may deal with the precedent first. I realize I am
treading on ground where angels should fear to tread, because
the precedent was cited by a distinguished former Speaker,
Senator Deschatelets, one who, we all know, knows the rules
thoroughly. The precedent took place when another distinguished ex-Speaker was in the Chair. I refer, of course, to
Senator Lapointe. Therefore, I tread very gently on the question of the precedent.
However, the decision I reach is that the precedent is not
applicable. The reason for that is, very briefly, that since that
time there has been a very substantial change made to our
rules, which, I believe, changes the whole situation. Senator
Deschatelets was on firm ground in respect to the precedent at
that time. The circumstances are almost identical. At that
time there was a debate on an inquiry in progress in the
Senate. The inquiry was from Senator Desruisseaux, and
Senator Asselin moved that the subject matter of the inquiry
be referred to a committee. As I say, therefore, the circumstances are identical. Why, then, do I say that the precedent is
not applicable? The reason is that in the meantime, as honourable senators may recall, there has been a thorough revision of
our rules, and a new rule book came into force in October,
1977. These changes in the rules are the reason for my
statement that the precedent is not applicable.
It is interesting &ednote that of the changes to which I
refer, two of the most important relate to the definition of
"inquiry" and to the definition of "question". Rule 46, which I
take to be the only authority that may be cited for moving a
motion without notice, reads in part as follows:
46. No notice is required of the following motions:
Subparagraph (b) of this rule reads:
(b) for the referral of the question to a committee;
I need hardly say, honourable senators, that t searched the
rules very carefully to see if I could find anywhere a justification for referring the motion before us on Monday night to a
committee without notice. I was unable to find, particularly in

SENATE DEBATESNoebr2.17
rule 46, dcaling with motions for which no notice is required,
anything other than 46(b), which might justify il.
Again. why do 1 say that 1 do flot believe that 46(b) offers
the requisite justification? This is because of the change in our
rules, which define "question" very narrowiy. Il appeared to
the ruies cemmittee at that time, 1 understand, that there was
some confusion about the interpretation that shouid be made
in respect of various words that have more or iess similar
mneanings: -inquirv", "'interrogation", "question", and even
"motion".
The new rule 5(n) now reads:
(n) "question", exccpt in respect of the question period
and a question of privilege, means a proposai presented to
the Senate or a committee thereof by the Speaker or
chairman for consideration and disposai in some manner;
In view of that definition 1 have to rule that in mny view
46(b) does flot appiy, because at that time what was before the
Senate was flot a question but a motion, and in case the matter
arises again 1 cail the attention of honourabie senators to the
word "the" in ruie 46. It reads, "t'he question" before the
Senate. It wouid seem obvious te me that this is a generai
reference to a situation that is before us very often. i refer te
occasions when a question has been put bv the Chair, is read a
second time, and then there is the normai motion that it be
rcferred te a commnittee. but at that lime a question is before
the Senate. With aul duc respect for the knowiedgc and
understanding of the ruies of Senator Dcschatcicts. i find it
necessary te ruie that notice of his motion was required. 1 ami
sure Senator Deschaiclts understands the many options that
aire now open te him.
1 trust that my ruiing wiii be acceptable te honourabie
sena tors.

SENATE DEBATES

QUESTION PERIOD
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of State for CIDA. May I ask the minister
whether any further reports have been received with respect to
the situation in the Middle East, particularly where the interests of Canada and Canadians may be involved?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, at the end of the
question period, if 1 may, I shall make a statement in reply to
the questions put to me yesterday by the Leader of the
Opposition and other senators.
In short, I can say that the situation in the conflict is about
the same. Of course, it seems to have become more explosive in
that the students in Iran are now threatening the lives of the
hostages if the United States should decide to intervene
militarily.
I must say that the situation is now being looked into very
closely by the Secretary General of the United Nations. We do
hope the mediation of the Secretary General, which he is
seriously considering at this point, will help to improve the
situation.
[English]
Senator Perrault: I should further like to ask the Minister of
State for CIDA whether Canada's representatives in Iranour External Affairs personnel-continue to be actively
involved in initiatives to attempt to resolve the situation.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: As I have already said, our ambassador in
Iran meets privately, not officially, with his counterparts from
other countries every day.
I might add that our ambassador, again very discreetly, has
made representations to the authorities in Iran and informed
them of the position of Canada on the American-Iranian
conflict.
Moreover, our ambassador is ready to act as intermediary at
a moment's notice, should either party wish to call upon
Canada to act as middleman in an effort to make some
progress in the current conflict.
Naturally, one cannot give the details you are asking me for,
I am sure, about the steps taken by our ambassador. We are
dealing here with private conversations. I have been asked to
keep them confidential.
[English]
Senator Oison: The minister made reference to the activities
of the Secretary General of the United Nations, but I suppose
the minister cannot tell us when the Secretary General will
give a report, if he does, indeed, intend to do some mediation.
Is the extent of the U.N. activity confined to the Secretary

General or has there been some attempt to refer this matter to
the Security Council?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I believe I have
already told the Senate that the Secretary General of the
United Nations has already taken a position in the conflict. I
believe all members of the United Nations have condemned
the attitude of Iran. This is not something new, the Senate is
aware of that.
In addition, the Secretary General of the United Nations
has also condemned publicly the attitude of the Iranian students with regard to the American embassy.
We have just been told that the Secretary General is taking
new initiatives about which we know very little. But we do
hope he will succeed in his endeavour.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
PETRO-CANADA-REPORT OF TASK FORCE-GOVERNMENT
POLICY

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, my question is for
the minister responsible for economic development. Recent
reports would indicate that the government is finding the
report and recommendations of its task force on the dismantling of Petro-Canada to be less than satisfactory or acceptable. At least, that is the nature of some of the reports. Instead
of following the task force's suggestion of giving shares in a
small, private, profitable Petro-Canada to all Canadian citizens, one report involves the concept of making certain shares
available for sale to all Canadians of legal age.
Can the minister confirm the accuracy of these reports? If
so, will he explain the rationale behind the apparent change in
government thinking on the issue?
Senator de Cotret: As the honourable senator is well aware,
the question of the privatization of Petro-Canada was referred
to a task force. We received the report some time ago. The
report has been under active consideration. Recommendations
are before cabinet at the moment. We expect to be in the
position in a fairly reasonable period of time to announce
exactly how the government intends to proceed with the matter
of Petro-Canada.
Senator Perrault: May I ask the minister, then, to tell other
honourable senators whether the options which are being
studied by the government include the possibility of abandoning altogether the idea of dismantling Petro-Canada? I ask
that question in the light of the recent by-election results in
this country in which the issue of Petro-Canada figured prominently. Certainly, the results of those by-elections indicate a
clear repudiation of the government's insistence that they must
proceed in this direction.
Senator de Cotret: I will not claim to be able to be quite as
precise in the interpretation of the results as the honourable
senator seems to claim. I will just say that a number of options

SENATE DEBATES
are being considered by cabinet at the moment with respect to
Petro-Canada.
Senator Perrault: Is the abandonment of the idea one of
them?
Senator de Cotret: Obviously, the subject of the task force
report is front and foremost in our deliberations and we will be
in a position to announce in the very near future our intended
action with respect to Petro-Canada.
Senator Perrault: Would the minister, however, not agree
that this prolonged period, this hiatus, this period of agonizing
reappraisal is doing little to assist that agency, is doing little to
advance the interests of Canadians with respect to the development of a coherent oil policy?
There is a continuing cloud of uncertainty over Canada's
national oil policy. Surely at this time the minister will provide
us with at least a specific timetable for action on this issue.
When does the government intend to make the decision?
Mr. Minister, before you answer may I say that on so many
of these issues either there are studies proceeding or the
matters are being taken under consideration or there is a
report being awaited or we are told that a joint committee will
ultimately bring in some determination. Can we now have a
specific, firm timetable for a decision on this matter?
Senator de Cotret: First of all, I think the only anguish that
exists in this situation is among the members opposite.
Senator Oison: No!
Senator de Cotret: There is certainly no anguish on my part.
You know, I can understand from the perspective of members
opposite, who may be more used than we are on this side to
shooting from the hip, that a question of study and careful
thought is difficult to accept.
An Hon. Senator: Oh, come on!
Senator de Cotret: And it is anguishing! Anguishing! Particularly when it is beneficial to the interests of this country.
When you talk about an oil policy, when you talk about an
energy policy, I think I have made the position of my government very clear on that matter. We are actively pursuing a
comprehensive energy policy that will sec this country self-sufficient by the year 1990, and no longer subject to the vagaries
of price.
Senator Hays: How long is that study going to take?
Senator de Cotret: I can tell you that we will have an
announcement on the overall energy package very soon
indeed-much sooner than the years and years and years that
have been spent by the former government.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
AUTHORIZATION FOR ILLEGAL ACTS

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the government leader. In view of the lingering confusion
and disturbing views in recent press reports on RCMP activities, could the leader state clearly whether it is a federal
[Senator de Cotret.]

November 22, 1979

government intention, or even present policy, to allow the
RCMP to perform illegal acts with the permission of a
minister?
Senator Flynn: No, not without proper legislation.
Senator Haidasz: I have a supplementary question. Would
the minister inform this chamber whether the press is correct
in stating that Canadian espionage operations have ceased
because of the Macdonald Commission, confusion of government policy and budget cuts by Treasury Board?
Senator Flynn: I would have to study that phrase to understand it. Perhaps you can explain it to me.
Senator Haidasz: I have another supplementary question for
the minister. Would he inform this chamber when we can
expect government legislation on illegal RCMP activities?
Senator Flynn: Of course, it would be very desirable to have
the report of the Macdonald Commission. Legislation, however, depends in part upon whether this report will be presentcd soon enough to cope with the situation.
SPORTS
WORLD JUNIOR HOCKEY TOURNAMENT

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Leader of the Government, which I would ask him to
pass on to the Minister of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport
and Multiculturalism. I am sure I speak for a large number of
Canadians when I say that they have been disturbed by the
announcement that Canada has pulled out of the World Junior
Hockey Tournament, which is to be held in December of this
year in Finland.
I think the Leader of the Government is aware that I was
Chairman of the Committee on International Hockey, whose
members included representatives of the House of Commons
of all parties, and I am sure he will be glad to know that this
question is not in any way politically oriented. Some of us are
very concerned at this development.
Senator Asselin: Are you still the chairman?
Senator Buckwold: The committee is no longer operative.
Senator Asselin: Shall we revive the committee?
Senator Buckwold: If you want to give me another job with
high pay, certainly.
This is a serious question, because most Canadians consider
that hockey is a very important sport. In the international
world of ice hockey Canada is an important member, and is, as
a matter of fact, a major drawing card. I think it is regrettable
that this situation has developed.
My two questions to the Leader of the Government, which i
presume he will take as notice, are: First, will the minister give
a detailed account of the background that led to this unfortunate decision, and inform us whether this was because of
money, or because of an inability to find a suitable national
team as opposed to a club team, or because of some problem

November 22, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

related to the relationship between Sports Canada, Hockey
Canada and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association?
Secondly, will the minister involve himself personally with
the objective of enabling a Canadian team to be iced at the
world ice hockey junior championship this year, and will he
use his good offices to try to ensure a Canadian entry?
Senator Flynn: I shall certainly take that question as notice.
May I say that I appreciate the continuing interest of Senator
Buckwold in this area of sports, and I take this opportunity to
thank him for what he has done up to now.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
AGRICULTURE
CHICKEN IMPORT QUOTAS-RENEGOTIATION OF
CANADA-UNITED STATES AGREEMENT

Senator Argue: I should like to direct a question to the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It arises out of a
report in the Globe and Mail of November 20, that the
Quebec Minister of Agriculture, Jean Garon, had stated that
the Canadian poultry industry was threatened with bankruptcy
as a result of the chicken import quota agreement with the
United States.
Senator Flynn: Do you believe him?
Senator Argue: He has also stated that Quebec will consider
pulling out of the national marketing plan unless import levels
are changed substantially. There seems to be real chaos and
confusion in the industry on this whole question. If I am
correctly informed, I believe there is a meeting tomorrow
morning between the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, the Minister of Agriculture and a delegation from
Quebec and Ontario producers, and others. Will the minister
say whether at this forthcoming meeting the question of
negotiating the quotas will be discussed and considered?
0 (1430)

Senator de Cotret: The meeting to which the honourable
senator is referring, to the best of my knowledge and from
looking at my schedule, is that between myself, the federal
Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Agriculture for
Ontario. I am not aware that there will be a Quebec delegation
or, for that matter, representatives from the producers, but
there may well be. It is a meeting at which I am sure the whole
issue will be put on the table, and I am certain there will be
questions about our ability to renegotiate the agreements that
were reached between ourselves and the U.S. earlier this year.
As I did in this chamber in answers to questions raised by
honourable senators previously, I will explain the basis on
which negotiations were carried out and the overall framework
of GATT. I will endeavour to explain to all concerned, with as
much candor as is humanly possible, exactly the situation that
we now face and the reason why the quota was set the way it
was.
Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I am unable to agree
with that explanation because mistakes have been made all
along the way.

I would ask the minister a question specifically about supplementary quotas for the importation of chicken for the
manufacture of products not wholly composed of chicken. In a
publication put out by the department, Export and Import
Permits Act, dated October 19, it says on this point:
An import permit supplementary to the annual quota may
be issued if chicken is not available in Canada at a price
to allow Canadian processors to compete with comparable
imported products.
Would the minister agree that this provision allows imports
into Canada at the competitive U.S. price for chicken imported into Canada; and this supplementary quota, as it reads
here, could open the whole area of imports of U.S. chicken and
will destroy the Canadian industry?
We have the quota that has been set and established. Could
the minister explain why these supplementary quotas are based
on competition with comparable imported products? It seems
to me that it goes against the whole idea of stability based on
the Canadian market and on the Canadian price.
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to verify the precise language of the agreement. I can assure the honourable senator
that the only condition under which supplementary import
permits are considered is not price, but the out-and-out availability of chicken in the domestic market.
Senator Argue: What I read seems to be in contradiction to
what the minister has now stated. I would appreciate further
explanation.
Senator de Cotret: No one gets a supplementary quota
unless I sign it. I am telling the honourable senator that I will
sign those supplementary import permits only if I am satisfied
that there is no domestic supply of the product, and only in an
interim period, to allow for the adjustment from the level of 65
million pounds that we were importing up to October 22 to the
lower level of 45 million pounds that we will be importing from
now on.
Senator Argue: I appreciate the minister's explanation-I
shall have to read it in Hansard-butdoes he not feel that he
himself should be informed on what is being sent out by his
department? With great respect, the minister should be looking at these publications before they are issued, and should not
try to rewrite them after they are issued, although the rewriting is most important.
Senator de Cotret: When I addressed the question of that
particular news release, I believe I explained to honourable
senators that I was quite dismayed that the news release had
been published before I made my comments to this chamber a
day or two later, but that in the general thrust of the release
my concerns had been considered in terms particularly of the
base time period that was used in the allocation of quotas. At
that point I indicated I was not satisfied with that process, and
I have taken steps to ensure that that will not happen again. I
would reiterate to the honourable senator that I am fully
aware of his concern, and I share it.

THE ECONOMY
FiF I-CT OF DOMLSIC 0]iL PR ICI: IN CREASE

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, 1 should like to direct
a question to the Nlinister of Statc for Economic Developmnent.
Canadians are deeply concerncd about the rising cost of
energy and are flot the leasi bit comforted by the unfeeling
statement of the Minister of Finance, the H-onourable John
Crosbie, to the effect that no one really objects to paying more

for oul.
In the west, for example, some farmers will find themselves
paying $3,000 to $4,000 a year more for their fuel. In the long
terni that could be even more serious than the federal government's thinking on the Crowsnest rate for the movement of
grain.
My question is: 15 the government's planned $4 per barrel
increase in the cost of Canadian oil inevitable, or will the
government reconsider its rush to higher domestie oul prices in
the light of the growing evidence of the disruption that such a
quick and massive price hike will bring about to the Canadian
econorny and Canadians everywhere? 1 arn speaking particularly for western farmers.
Senator de Cotret: 1 should like to reiterate the policy of this
government, that we are committed to moving the Canadian
price of domestie oil toward-not to but toward-world levels.
We are committed to maintaining the domestic price of crude
at a level sonmewhat lower than that prevailing in the United
States, to maintain a competitive position. We feel, as do the
vast majority of our premiers, that sueh a policy is necessary if
vwe are to ensure self-sufficiency in energy by 1990, and we feel
and believe strongly that self-sufficieney is a desirable, neeessary goal, if we are to ensure tic stability of supply that is
required for our economie development in the years beyond.
Senator Steuart: 1 arn sure that Premier Davis will find
soie objection to your statement.
Senator Flynn: What about Blakeney?
Senator Steuart: Blakeney has enough oil to make Ontario
niad. So Premier Blakeney agrees with what you are doing.
Senator Flynn: Try that ai the next provincial election.
Senator Steuart: 1 will, indeed. We just tried it in the
by-election, and you know what happened.
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Steuart: We won one and ve lost one. You fellows
got wiped out in two. As a mnatter of fact, you lost more votes
n Prince /\Ibert than we got.
In the meantime, as a supplementary. will the government
consider somne forni of compensation to western farniers to
alleviate the tremendous burden placed on them not only for
fuel costs, but for such things as fertilizer, in consideration of
the fact that at the other end they have absolutely no control
over the prices they receive?
Senator de Cotret: As 1 believe 1 have mentioned a numiber
of times before, when we are talking about energy policy it
goes far beyond the question of setting energy prices. If it were
ISenator de Coîret J

November 22, 1979

only a question of setting energy prices there ssould probably
have been agreement a long time ago. We are talking about a
much more comprehiensive policy, to deal not only with the
setting of prices, with the revenue sharing. but also having to
deal very importantly with both the industrial offsets that
would be useful to cushion some of the negative adjustment
by-produets of the move, as well as consumner offsets in certain
areas of the country that rnay be more harshly influenced by
the move toward world prices than other parts of the country.
So certainly we are looking at offsets as well as prices, sharing,
further enhancement of our supply capacity, and conservation.
It is a comprehensive package, and we are lookîng at that.

WESTERN GRAIN STABILFZATION A(T

Senator Steuart: One of the few cost protections available to
western farmers is the Western Grain Stabili7ation Act which,
incîdentally, was fought tooth and nail by the NDP and tlie
Tories. Can the minister, one of the most powerful ministers in
the governinent, give the people of western Canada an assurance that the government will maintain the Western Grain
Stabilization Act, which was brought into effeet by the last
government"
Senator de Cotret: 1 will take that question as notice.
Senator Perrault: He wxill have to stud',

t.

Senator de Cotret: No, 1 will not have to study it. 1 mnay
have to refer to one of my colleagues on this. When I do so, 1
will be happy to give a specifie ansvîer to the question.
Senator Steuart: Does that mean you are studying il; that
you are not sure whether you are going to keep il or let it go?!
Senator de Cotret: 1 have not discussed this particular
matter during the past few weeks with the appropriate nlinister. I would rather have an opportunity, with your permission,
to speak with the minister responsible so that 1 mnay give as
precise an answer as I cao.
Senator Steuart: Is the minister aware that his departm-ent
has paid out over $2 million on that programi this year?
Senator de Cotret: Yes.
Senator Stcuart: Yet he does not know sshether he is going
to keep it or get rid of it?
Senator de Cotret: That is rîght. The whole grain and oil
seeds sector of the estimates of my department is an administrative arrangement in whieh the Chairman of the Wheat
Board answers for those estimates on my behaîf. It is really a
question on which we have to dialogue very closely. We
administer the program, but it is certainly not a prograin thai
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce runs.

SENATE DEBATES

Novemnber 22, 1979
YUKON TERRITORY

GOVERNMENT POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

Senator Lucier: I have a question for the Leader of the
Government in the Senate.
Since taking office, the Minister of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development has made some fine speeches concerning responsible government for the people of the Yukon. On
Tuesday, November 20, his Yukon representative, Deputy
Commissioner Bell, signed an order appointing an administrator to take over the affairs of Dawson City, denying the people
of Dawson City their right to hold a municipal election and
their right to elect a mayor and council. This action was taken
without consulting the present city council, and without any
breach of the municipal ordinance having been committed by
the Dawson City council.
Could the Leader of the Government ask the minister what
the term "responsible government" means, and when this
undemocratic action by his officials will be rescinded, thus
allowing the people of Dawson City to continue enjoying the
same rights enjoyed by all other Canadians?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Flynn: I thought it was a question and not a
statement, and that the applause or boos would come after the
answer.
Senator Perrault: I see that you just happen to have the
reply on your desk.
Senator Flynn: Yes, because Senator Lucier was kind
enough to give me notice of his question, otherwise I would not
have been able to reply and would have left Senator Perrault
to applaud without knowing what is coming-which would not
be the first time, in any event.
Senator McElman: Answer the question.
Senator Flynn: The reply I have been given reads as follows:
The government is deeply committed to bringing
responsible government to the Yukon, and this action is a
step in that direction.
Wait a minute. Who laughed? Senator Hays? Oh, it was
Senator Austin. I should have known.
Senator Austin: I will laugh even more.
Senator Flynn: Listen to the facts. I would not dispute them.
The reply goes on to state:
Dawson City, with a population of 700, has a municipal
government of five aldermen. Three council members
constitute a quorum. The Mayor of Dawson City
resigned, one alderman died and another is ill and out of
town.
These are facts Senator Lucier might have known had he
dared speak to someone there. The reply further states:
Consequently, to meet without a quorum, which the senator seems to be advocating, would hardly constitute
responsible government.

The Deputy Mayor, Mr. Byron Chandler, asked the
Territorial Government to set up the position of administrator to take over the affairs of Dawson City. Once
before when similar circumstances were in effectI suppose this was under the former government.
-a highly respected municipal administrator from the
province of Saskatchewan was made administrator of
Dawson City. The government bas been in regular communication with this gentleman, and he too has advised
that in these circumstances an administrator should be
appointed for Dawson City. The ordinance appointing the
administrator also established an advisory board of five
stalwart citizens of Dawson City.
The Yukon Government is examining the structure of
government in Dawson City and, in an effort to ensure
that citizens of Dawson City enjoy responsible government, is aiming for municipal elections within one year's
time.
That is the situation, in fact.
Senator Perrault: That sounds like a campaign speech.
Senator Flynn: Do you speak of the question or the reply?
Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, the reason my questions are usually long is because I know Senator Flynn has to
go to someone else to obtain the answers. Unfortunately, his
information is not always accurate. There are three members-at least there were until this order was signed-of the
Dawson City Council. They held their November meeting, and
the nominations for the new council were to take place 10 days
from that meeting. The person who was sick said that she
could be available if a quorum were required for another
meeting to hold them off until the elections were held.
This action was taken in consultation only with the deputy
mayor, and not the council. I think this is very important. The
deputy mayor has absolutely no power to deal in these matters;
only the council has. This is a duly elected council which has
the power to ask the Territorial Government to do exactly
what it is doing. Perhaps it would have received permission to
do exactly what it is doing.
The point is that the people of Dawson City were not
consulted and this was done without the approval of the city
council, a duly elected legal city council.
I think the Leader of the Government, in his capacity as
Minister of Justice, should check the Yukon Act to see how
close they are to breaking the law on this matter.
Senator Flynn: If there is a dispute with regard to the facts,
I am willing to look into them. It seems to me that a municipal
council cannot meet without a quorum. I don't know if there
was a quorum, but if there was a quorum I do not see why they
did not meet. I will check on the facts, but it seems to me that
the Yukon Government or the federal government for that
matter, would not want to intervene if it were not necessary.
Senator Lucier: We will see.

TRANSPORTATION POLICY

Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, I have a question foi
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. On October
17 I asked a question regarding a request from the Manitoba
government for the reconvening of the grain transportation
meeting which had been held in Winnipeg in early January
and which was attended by most of the western premiers,
representatives of the federal government and representatives
of the railways. At that time the minister indicated to me that
he did not have an answer at hand but would obtain one
shortly. In fact, he said then that he would obtain an answer
for me the next day.
1 have been waiting for the answer. I have checked carefully
and yet find no reply. 1 wonder if the government has agreed
to the meeting, and where the matter stands.
Senator de Cotret: I do apologize. 1 did not give an answer
to the question. 1 will verify with my own staff as to why we
have not been able
obtain an answer. I do not know that
there are any deep, dark, mischievous goings-on here.
Senator Perrault: The study has not been completed.
Senator de Cotret: No, no. I will attempt to get an answer
as soon as I can.
Senator Flynn: The former government is waiting for the
election
THE ECONOMY
EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE INCREASES

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. I should like
to ask him when he is going to bring into this chamber
information he has promised, 1 think almost from the outset of
this Parliament, on the monitoring of the effects of these
higher interest rates.
I know I asked him the question recently and he gave us the
same answer he had given some time ago, although perhaps
not in the saine words. What is happening to farm machinery
sales? What is happening to small business inventory costs?
I should like to have some information that comes out of the
monitoring and then, of course, following that, I should like to
know what the government will do about it. Until we get some
results from the monitoring, it is difficult to know.
* (1450)

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, 1 shall be very
happy to do that. As a matter of fact, I have some information
of the kind that I was going to put before the Senate later in
reply to a question by Senator Perrault. I do not know if I
should do it now, or at the end of the Question Period.
Senator Flynn: Go ahead.
Senator de Cotret: Senator Perrault mentioned the bankruptcy situation on Tuesday last. His question, in part, was as
follows:
[Senator Lucier.]

November 22, 1979

Can the minister tell us the number of small business
bankruptcies that have occurred since May 22?
I indicated at that time that I would be happy to do this,
depending on the reporting date of the agency. This is done on
a monthly basis. I am very happy to report that in the five
months since we have been in office the number of small
business bankruptcies has fallen in this country relative to the
same period a year ago.
Senator Muir: It would be informative if you were to go
back over the last five years.
Senator de Cotret: Well, it reverses an upward trend since
1977, as a matter of fact. The number of bankruptcies in this
five-month period was 2,101, compared to a level of bankruptcies in the same period in 1978 of 2,212.
We are monitoring these statistics. I would like to mention
that the sharpest decline was in the last month of that period,
in case there is any doubt. Whereas in September of 1978
there were 473 bankrupteies, in September of this year there
were only 392.
That is one indication of the monitoring that is going on.
Obviously, we are looking at a number of other indicators, and
as the information is available I will be very happy to provide
it to the honourable senator.
Senator Oison: May I ask a supplementary question?
The minister now, I take it, has given us a very firm
commitment to bring in something at some time. We are not
quite sure what is being monitored, except undesirable side
effects. At the next sitting could he tell us what it is that is
being monitored, whether il be sales, inventory costs and
controls, or whatever it may be, so that we can follow it as
well?
I wonder if he could also make sure that it is not nerelv
generalities that are brought in as to the effects that are being
produced. He has been very specific now about some bankruptcies, and I appreciate that, but I wonder if we could have
information in more specific terms on the other effects that are
showing up, as it comes in.
Senator de Cotret: Certainly. Many of these effects will take
a while to manifest themselves fully.
I indicated before why the policy was being pursued. In
some cases it is for international reasons, in others for foreign
exchange reasons, and in yet others for domestic policy reasons. There are some plusses and some minuses.
I will not stand in this chamber and say that I like having
high interest rates. I will not say that high interest rates per se
are a good thing. I would much rather be in a situation where
we have a level of interest rates that is quite a bit lower than
the one we have. The question is: Is this policy appropriate for
the time, and is it dealing with the problems this country is
facing? I say that it is, and I say that we have no other option.
I would like very briefly, in further answer to your question,
to quote from a statement made by Mr. Bulloch, the President
of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in this
country. Mr. Bulloch is quoted as saying:

November 22, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

There are no options ... The option of not pursuing [that
policy] is a 75-cent dollar and wage and price controls
and foreign exchange controls ... That's a very scary
scenario.
He was joined by Carl Beigie, the President of the C.D. Howe
Institute, in much the same kind of language.
We are monitoring the situation. It is not an easy situation.
We are dealing with a very tough set of economic circumstances, and what we are looking at is placing this economy on
a sound footing as early as possible so as to be able to benefit
from the tremendous potential this country has in the decade
of the 1980s.
Senator Perrault: A supplementary, Mr. Minister. Is it not
the concern of Canadians today that this party was elected on
the basis of lower interest rates? The situation has not changed
measurably between May of this year and the present timeHon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Perrault: -and yet there has been a complete
reversal of policy on the part of the government. Surely this is
a concern of many Canadians.
Senator de Cotret: I would like to assure the honourable
senator that this government was elected on the basis of
providing this country with sound fiscal management and
sound economic policies, and that is exactly what we are
providing this country with at the moment.
Senator Perrault: It is a complete policy reversal.
TRANSPORT
DERAILMENT AT MISSISSAUGA-ACTION TO AVOID A SIMILAR
OCCURRENCE

Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, I would like to
direct a question to the Leader of the Government with respect
to the Mississauga accident.
On November 14, I said:
To have a tank car of chlorine attached to a train
carrying butane, to a layman, would appear not the most
sensible way to carry dangerous gases. Again, I trust that
the government will look into that particular matter and
will not await the report of the Canadian Transport
Commission.
In the current issue of Maclean's Magazine, dated November
26, 1979, the following statement occurs:
In an immediate response to the Mississauga incident,
British Rail last week issued a directive that no train may
carry both toxic and flammable goods.
The questions I would now like to ask are as follows:
1. Will the government inquire as to whether or not the
report in Maclean's is correct?
2. If it is correct, will the government ask the two Canadian
railways whether they have issued the same directive?
3. If they have not, will the government ask the railways to
explain why it is practical for British Rail to issue such a
directive and not Canadian railways?

Senator Flynn: Well, I am able to reply to the first part of
the question by saying that the Canadian Transport Commission has issued interim orders on the spacing of rail cars
carrying dangerous materials, and, of course, when the legislation which has been introduced in the other place is adopted by
Parliament it will be casier to arrange for definite instructions
in this respect.
As you know, the Minister of Transport has initiated an
independent inquiry to examine all areas of rail safety. With
regard to whether the railways have accepted the orders, I
would suggest that they have, but I will have to verify that. I
am quite sure that they would not refuse to obey directives
issued by the Canadian Transport Commission.
Senator Godfrey: My question was really directed to whether there should be any necessity for orders to be issued. The
railways should do it on their own, I suggest, and I was
wondering whether they had or not.
Senator Flynn: I would suggest that they have. I would be
surprised if they had not. In any event, I will inquire.
Senator Thompson: Would it be possible for the Leader of
the Government to tell us the date when the Canadian Transport Commission sent that directive? The reason I ask that is
because in the Globe and Mail of yesterday there occurs the
following statement:
Spokesmen for both CP Rail and Canadian National
Railways have said no changes have been made in their
operating procedures as a result of the accident.
I do not know if that is an accurate report or not.
Senator Flynn: What is the date of that report?
Senator Thompson: That was in yesterday's Globe and
Mail.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE
VALUATION OF GOODS AT CANADA-UNITED STATES BORDER

Senator Muir: Honourable senators, my question is directed
to either the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce or the
Leader of the Government.
Honourable senators, I have in my hands this booklet, which
all of you are familiar with, entitled, "Canadian Customs, 'I
Declare'." I am sure many of you have read and used it. On
page 4, among explanatory notes, I find the following:
After 48 hours' absence or more, any number of times
per year, you may bring in goods to the value of $10. Only
an oral declaration is required.
Once every calendar quarter, you may bring in goods to
the value of $50. A written declaration may be
required ...

Once every calendar year, you may bring in goods to
the value of $150. A written declaration will be required.
You will notice, honourable senators, that the reference is to
"dollars", using the dollar sign. We assume that Canadian
dollars are referred to.

SENATE DEBATES
During the 22 years that I was in the other place, and in the
short few days that I have been in this place, I have never had
a complaint similar to the one presented to me in the last few
weeks.
A Canadian citizen comes to the border on his return from
the United States. Please observe that this booklet does not
refer to deutschmarks, Japanese yen or United States dollars;
it simply says "$150", which is taken to mean Canadian
dollars. Right on.
* (1500)

The Customs officer took the position that the exchange also
had to be included-and the exchange, of course, was already
paid by these individuals when purchasing the goods-the net
result being that the two people had to pay between $30 and
$40 in duties.
I would ask the minister to inquire as to whether or not this
is a new policy. To me, it is unfair, and certainly this is the
first time I have come across it. I realize the minister would
not carry this information around in his head, so I would ask
that he take the question as notice.
Senator de Cotret: I shall be happy to do so. However, I can
assure the honourable senator now that there is no new policy.
Certainly, in any Government of Canada document where the
regulation is expressed in terms of dollars, the only pertinent
value of the currency is its value in terms of Canadian
currency. We are certainly not putting these regulations out
denominated in currencies of foreign countries, and it would
only bc so if it were specifically specified.
I shall certainly inquire into the specific cases raised by the
honourable senator, and determine what happened in those
two instances.
THE ECONOMY
MONITORING OF PROFITS RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN
INTERFST RATES AND OIL PRICES

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I have some questions
for the Minister of State for Economic Development, and these
are by way of follow-up to earlier questions dealing with the
monitoring of profits realized, first, by the banks as a result of
interest rate increases and, secondly, by oil companies as a
result of oil price increases.
With reference to each of those areas, the minister indicated
that the monitoring was being carried out by the Department
of Finance, and he undertook to obtain for us the criteria upon
which the department was basing its judgment as to whether
profits in either of those two areas, banks and oil companies,
were undue.
I would ask the minister now to consult with his officials
over the weekend, and on Tuesday provide us with information
as to when we might expect answers to those questions.
Senator de Cotret: I shall be happy to do so.
[Senator Muir.]

November 22, 1979

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
SEARCH OF JOURNALIST'S HOME

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, questions were put to
the Minister of Justice arising out of a warrant executed by
the RCMP in the Gosselin affair, and at that time the minister
undertook to seek a report on the matter.
I would ask the minister to consult with his officials over the
weekend to determine when we might expect that report.
Senator Flynn: I can inform the Senate that the last word I
had on that inquiry was that it was not yet complete. No doubt
when it is complete, I shall be informed. I shall endeavour to
obtain a progress report and provide it to the Senate on
Tuesday next.
TRANSPORT
HIGHWAY CARRIAGE OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL-REGULATING
AUTHORITY

Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, at the outset

I

should like to thank the Deputy Leader of the Government for
the reply given yesterday to my earlier question in relation to
the regulations covering the transportation of nuclear materials. The regulations, of course, are those relating to the safe
transportation of radioactive materials under the International
Atomic Energy Agreement signed in 1973, to which Canada is
a signatory.
In view of the fact that over 60 per cent of radioactive
material is shipped by truck, and that under our Constitution
the trucking industry is, for the most part, under provincial
jurisdiction; in view of the fact that the control of radioactive
material is a federal matter; in view of the fact that Mr.
White, head of the Atomic Energy Control Board, said last
week, "I think the carrier companies [trucking companies],
because there are so many of them, probably aren't aware of
the requirements incumbent on them"; and in view of the fact
that some provinces have their own varied legislation dealing
with radioactive material-for example, Ontario has never
really defined radioactive material-and that all organic
matter, including human beings, contain some radioactive
material, may I ask what authority is, in fact, in charge of
formulating the regulations for the truck movement of radioactive material?
I might indicate that for a long time there had not been
regulations covering nuclear matter and governing the trucking industry in every province. I think it is important that we

look into this.
Senator Flynn: This may be yet another problem which we
have inherited from the former administration.
Senator Olson: What will you do when you run out of that
excuse?
Senator Roblin: Believe me, it will be a long time before we
run out.
Senator Flynn: I shall look into this matter. I suggest it
probably depends on the company or institution shipping the

November 22, 1979

nuclear products. If the shipper is under the jurisdiction of the
federal government, I do not see why the federal regulations
would not apply to the carrier, notwithstanding that the carrier
is governed by provincial regulations. In any event, I shall
endeavour to provide a more complete answer in due course.
The Hon. the Speaker: Are there delayed answers?

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
SAFETY OF CANADIANS IN MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA

Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, yesterday, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition asked me a series of questions concerning the situation in the Middle East. I replied in
part to his questions at the beginning of this sitting. However,
the honourable senator asked me to give him more specific
information about the situation of Canadians in the Middle
East and I was obviously not able to obtain complete information about the Canadians now living in these 18 countries.
Still, in those countries where their safety might be endangered, we must say that, according to the reports received from
the Department of External Affairs, Canadians are in no way
threatened at the present time.
The honourable senator also asked me to specify what
security measures are taken to ensure the safety of Canadians
especially in Iran, and even to evacuate them if it became
necessary. In this regard, I would like to quote the statement
made yesterday in the House by the Prime Minister in reply to
a similar question asked by the honourable member for
Beauce:
I must admit frankly to the House and the hon.
member that it is impossible, in such circumstance, to be
absolutely certain of the efficiency of our plans, but we
have made plans, we have developed a way of helping
Canadians in Iran to get out of that country, if they or the
Canadian government consider it necessary.
We were also asked whether the government should insist
that the embassy personnel remain in Iran. Once again, I
believe that in the present situation, Canada has an extremely
important role to play in Iran. We believe that, at least for the
time being, it is necessary, in order to enforce international law
and find a solution to the Iranian crisis, that our representatives in Iran remain at their post. Our diplomatic personnel
must assume certain responsibilities, even when the situation is
as serious as it is now in Iran, because some Canadians in Iran
might want to leave the country and require assistance from
our embassy. We also provide other services to the American
nationals who are, of course, deprived of their own consular
services.
About the question put by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition concerning the intervention of the United Nations, I think
I answered rather clearly earlier this afternoon the question he
put to me yesterday. I assured him that Canada was following
the situation at the United Nations very closely. As soon as
there are major developments, they will be announced to this
house.

HAITI-DISTURBANCE AT HUMAN RIGHTS MEETING

Senator Asselin: I should also like to take this opportunity,
honourable senators, to answer a question asked by Senator
Deschatelets, I believe, last week, concerning the incidents that
occurred in Haiti when, following a human rights meeting, two
of our embassy secretaries were involved in a scuffle and were
injured.
The Secretary of State for External Affairs, Miss MacDonald, had instructed the Canadian ambassador in Port-auPrince, Mr. Pierre Garceau, to protest officially to the Haitian
government. That was done through the then acting Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gérard Dorcély. He expressed his deep
regrets, saying his government had nothing to do with the
matter. The Haitian government later issued an official communiqué stating that an inquiry was underway in order to
identify and punish the culprits. It also expressed its sympathy
to the victims.
I met this morning the Haitian ambassador concerning
certain CIDA projects in that country. I then took it upon
myself, on behalf of the Canadian government and following
the inquiry of Senator Deschatelets, to discuss the recent
incident that occurred in Haiti. Of course, as his government
had done, he expressed his regrets and his sympathy. He
further pointed out that certain liberalization movements have
been at work for some years in Haiti. He added that some
political prisoners had been released. Furthermore, during the
last election, a member of the opposition ran in Port-au-Prince
and defeated the then prime minister.
So I think that individual freedoms are more respected than
they used to be in Haiti. I urged on the ambassador, of course,
the necessity of pursuing the liberalization of human liberties
and individual rights in Haiti.

ORDERS AND DECORATIONS
CHANGE IN WORDING OF PREAMBLE

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, on November 15,
Senator Lang asked whether the omission of the words:
-with the approval of Her Majesty the QUEEN of
Canada, Sovereign of the Orderwas inadvertent or deliberate in the publication of the list of
those receiving the Order of Canada. The short answer is that
the decision to delete those words was a consequence of the
transfer to the Governor General in 1977 of those functions of
the Sovereign in relation to Canada which had not, thus far,
been discharged by the Governor General. Her Majesty's
approval of this transfer was announced on December 30,
1977, by the then Prime Minister.
I have a further explanation which I would ask to insert at
this point of my answer, if it is agreed.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The answerfollows:
The constitutions of the Order of Canada and the Order of
Military Merit provide that appointments shall be made with

SENATE DEBATESNombr2,97
the approval of the Sovercign by instruments signed by the
Governor General. They also contain provisions stating that
nothing in them limits the right of the Governor General to
exercise ail powers and authorities of the Sovereign in respect
of these two Orders. The regulations govcrning the award of
the Decorations for Bravery contain the same provisions.
Consequently, because of the transfer of funictions approved at
the end of 1977, it was then decided to discontinue the practice
of submitting nominations to Her Majcsty for approval.
This docs not alter the fact, however, that Her Majesty
remains Sovercign of the two Orders and that Decorations for
Bravery continue to flow from the Sovereign in her right as
Qucn of Canada. Therefore. while the Governor General has,
since 1978. made ail the appointmcnts on behaîf of Her
Majesty, the Qucen is informed before appointmcnts arc made
and publicly announced.

-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Doody moved the second reading of Bill C-18, to

The New Zealand Trade Agreement Act, 1932, the Australian
Trade Agreement Act, 1960, and The Union of South Africa
Trade Agreement Act, 1932.
He said: Honourable senatorsHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Doody: 1 thank you for your kind consideration. 1
would ask you to bear with me and be tolerant as 1 walk very
quietly and gingerly through thcse hallowsed halls. 1 have

me a little while to become uscd to the indulgence of this
illustrious chamber. Any flaws or faults you can attribute
completely to my ignorance. In no way do 1 intend to show any
disrespect to His Honour the Speaker or to my honourable
colleagues.
1 have the honour of moving the second rcading of this bill.
which deals with the Canadian tariff sehedule on various items
in the horticultural industry of fruits and vegetables. It is
probably indicative of the efficiency of our great systcm that a
senator from Ncwfoundland. who is famniliar with fruits and
vegetables but not with fish or lumber, should have the privilege of performing this duty. 1 guess it dernonstrates the size
and scope of this great country.
Senator Thompson: The versatility.
Senator Doody: The vcrsatility of some senators as wcll.
This bill will give effect to certain tariff amendments that
wcrc introduced during the last session by the previous government but did not reccive approval before Parliament was
dissolved. 1 understand that at that time the bill was rcceived
with pretty broad support. and 1 hope my introduction and
sponsorship will not change that favourable atmosphcrc.
There arc two gencral matters involved in this bill-the
rcvised tariff schedulc covering fruits and vcgetables; and the
continuation of numerous temporary tariff reductions bcyond
June 30, 1979. In addition there are consequential amcndments to the acts which implemented our Preferential Trade
Agreements with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.
(1520)

1 need not emphasize the importance of the Canadian
horticultural industry to the Canadian economy. The cconomics of this industry. with respect to both growers and processors, were studied in soi-e depth by the Tariff Board in the
pcriod froni 1973 to 1977. The Board found that althoughi

November 22, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

domestic producers supplied the bulk of our fruit and vegetable requirements, they were steadily losing ground to imports
because tariffs were out of date.
This situation arose largely because tariff levels for virtually
ail species of fresh fruits and vegetables, and a large number of
processed products as well, had been specified in cents per
pound, or specific duties, rather than as a percentage of the
value of the product, or an ad valorem duty. As a result, the
real level of tariff protection had subsequently decreased.
This bill will restore some of the lost protection to the fruit
and vegetable growers. There will be higher specific rates
during the Canadian marketing season for fresh produce, and
a "floor" or minimum rate expressed as a percentage of the
value of the product to guard against further possible erosion
of protection from rising prices. For processed products, the
old specific rates are being replaced, as I have said, by ad
valorem rates, and in most cases these are higher than the
percentage rate equivalent of the old rates.
For consumer protection, of course, to benefit consumers
when Canadian produce is not available the bill provides for
the removal of duties on fresh produce at certain times of the
year, when the Canadian produce is not available.
In the case of fresh fruits and vegetables imported for
processing, duties will be applied year round but at lower rates
than for fresh market goods. This will discourage large
volumes of imports at either end of the Canadian marketing
season for the protection of Canadian crops.
There have been some departures from the Tariff Board's
recommendations. For example, reduced duties are proposed
on a number of products not covered by the board's report.
These are listed in the various schedules-for example, raisins,
fruit juices and field peas-and the rates on some products
such as canned fruits are not as high as those recommended by
the Tariff Board. These departures were necessary to obtain
agreement from our trading partners, I would assume, as a
quid pro quo in the bargaining process.
There are, honourable senators, various schedules attached
to the bill which I commend to your earnest attention. The list
of items is legion and I rather suspect that it will rank as one
of the great literary efforts of the drafting fraternity of ail
time.
Senator Marshall: Including baked apples.
Senator Doody: The baked apples which my honourable
friend mentions, and which are a great delicacy in Newfound-

land, need no protection, except perhaps from the Newfoundlanders, and we can look after that down there.
With those few words I commend this bill to your attention,
honourable senators, and ask that it be given second reading.
On motion of Senator McDonald, debate adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, we have come to
Motions, and I think there are none. I should like to remind
you, as there is no further business before the Senate, that no
doubt we will adjourn during pleasure to reassemble at about
twenty minutes to six in order to take part in the ceremony of
royal assent. With that reminder I would ask His Honour if he
would be kind enough to allow us to adjourn during pleasure.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, that the Senate do now adjourn during pleasure to
reassemble at the call of the bell at approximately 5.40 this
afternoon?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

[English]
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
STATEMENT ON SITUATION

IN IRAN

Senator Asselin: With leave of the Senate, I think I should
make a statement on the situation in Iran. I will give a copy of
my statement to the Leader of the Opposition.
Honourable senators, as you know, the situation in Iran
remains very tense and very fluid. In the most recent development, the Secretary-General and the President of the Security
Council today made statements at a special meeting of that
Council. They expressed the concern of all nations for the
safety of the American hostages in Tehran and the hope for a
peaceful resolution of the dispute between the American and
Iranian governments. They also suggested that Iran has a right
to be heard on its charges against the Shah. There will be a
full meeting of the Security Council at 9 a.m. on December I
which will enable the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr. Bani
Sadr, to attend.
1 should also point out that, after a Canadian initiative, all
of the high commissioners of Commonwealth countries with
representatives in London, England, met today, and the overwhelming majority agreed to make a statement on the situation in Iran. I do not yet have the text of this statement, but I
understand that it expressed the concern of their governments
for the unacceptable danger the seizure of the U.S. embassy in
Iran and the violation of U.S. diplomats poses to international
law and accepted standards of international conduct. It urged
the Iranian government to reconcile its differences with the
U.S. peacefully within the framework of international law, and
registered Commonwealth support for the initiatives of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations.
This Commonwealth declaration follows statements already
made by the European Economic Community and the European Parliament. It is encouraging to sec the nations of the
world respond to this situation through such international
organizations, rather than independently.

November 27, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

[Translation]
Honourable senators, I must also point out that the Secretary of State for External Affairs and myself had the opportunity, this afternoon, here in Ottawa, of meeting 15 ambassadors from francophone countries. We mentioned to them that
one of the most important principles to be observed if we are to
achieve peace throughout the world is that of the inviolability
of the embassies and the freedom of movement of its members,
in conformity with the Vienna Convention. We invited them,
as we did our friends of the Commonwealth, to pursue their
efforts with the Iranian authorities and encourage them publicly to free the American hostages.
[English]
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS IN IRAN-ROLE OF CANADA

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I know that ail
honourable senators welcome the statement made by the minister responsible for CIDA. Certainly, there has been rising
concern in Canada about what has appeared to be a lack of
initiative on the part of the Canadian government in this very
vital matter affecting a good friend of the Canadian people,
the United States of America. I know I reflect the views of aIl
senators when I welcome this statement made by the minister
tonight suggesting that we have taken some lead among the
Commonwealth nations and, as well, among the francophone
nations of the world.
I wonder, however, whether the minister can assure us that a
lead role is going to be played by Canada in its relations
relative to the other nations which may not be part of the
francophone community, and which may not be part of our
Commonwealth family. Can the minister tell us whether we
are moving to draw together the seven major industrialized
nations on this crucial issue?
There is an importance, surely, at this point in history for
Canadians to play a lead role in supporting the rule of law and
the long-established right of diplomatic immunity. Canadians,
including honourable senators, recall with pride many occasions when Canada, in a very forthright fashion, took a
high-profile lead role among the nations in defence of the rule
of law and matters allied to that.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, as I have already
said, I think Canada took praiseworthy initiatives. Of course,
for reasons of security that I have explained to the Senate
before, aIl our initiatives in Iran cannot be made public.
In addition, we have publicly invited the Commonwealth
countries to reach decisions with regard to that truly unfortunate conflict. As I said earlier in my statement, we are also
interested in francophone countries. But, with regard to the
European Community, I must remind honourable senators
that their governments and the European Parliament have
already issued a joint communiqué expressing their regrets
about what is going on in Iran, and begging the Iranian
authorities to free their hostages.
I feel that our presence in Iran at the present time is really
essential since we are rendering extremely important services

to the Americans, directly and indirectly-allow me however
not to give you any details-but one thing is sure: I can assure
the Senate that the authorities in Washington are indeed
extremely pleased to see us there as they are very pleased with
the work of the Canadian embassy in Iran.
* (2010)

[English]
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, looking at the current situation with respect to the rule of law and the matter of
diplomatic immunity, totally apart from any differences the
Americans and Iranians may have with respect to the Shah
and other matters-if the Government of Canada backs the
American position in this crisis, and if other member nations
of the Group of Seven, the Commonwealth and la francophonie are in agreement, what is standing in the way of Canada
being the catalyst to unite the leaders of aIl these nations in a
strong statement of support for the United States? Surely
there is a significant difference between individual protestations of support and a strong common front position which
seeks to identify nations of even various political philosophies,
even different economic ways of life, a strong common front
position reflecting the collective will of the heads of state of aIl
nations who support the rule of law and who stand opposed to
the reign of terror against the Americans in Iran. Will that
kind of initiative go forward?
[ Translation]
Senator Asselin: I think the Honourable Leader of the
Opposition has just confirmed our present role, which is one of
leadership, since we have taken the initiative of consulting ail
Commonwealth members to ask for statements in support of
Canada's action. We have also asked francophone countries
which are members of our circle of international relations to
do the same. What more can we do? Should we declare war on
Iran? One thing is for sure: we will not do it. What we are
doing at present, indirectly and in some instances directly, is to
try and help Americans to find solutions to this problem.
I know the Honourable Leader of the Opposition will not
force me tonight to indicate what actions our embassy and our
ambassador in Iran have taken to achieve those objectives. I
think we must congratulate the Secretary of State for External
Affairs for having taken this initiative, especially in view of the
fact that she must display a great amount of tact so as not to
aggravate the situation in Iran and risk making any Canadian
in that country persona non grata.
[English]
Senator Perrault: As I said at the outset, I am sure honourable senators welcome these initiatives. The ones that have
been cited are fully supported by the opposition in this chamber. The situation is so unique and so unprecedented that, of
course, it poses serious problems for the government of this
country and that of many other countries. How does one deal
with such unprecedented action taken by a government, a
government which, apparently in this case, supports the abandonment of the rule of law and flouts every standard we have
previously recognized in matters of diplomatic immunity?

SENATE DEBATES
So we sympathize with the predicament of the government
in attempting to devise positive initiatives in respect of this
international situation. However, I would remind this government that a few months ago there was a strong stand taken by
the Group of Seven at Bonn when the former Canadian Prime
Minister played a real and leading role in another crisis.
Honourable senators will recall that the Prime Minister of
Canada led the crusade to end terror resulting from airlineSenator Flynn: Oh, come on!
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, this is an important
matter. May I ask the Leader of the Government this question:
As the chief law adviser to the Government of Canada, what
kind of advice has he offered in this crisis? What has he
suggested in making certain that Canada stands up for the rule
of law and protects the rights of a gallant ally?
Senator Flynn: I advised that we act responsibly and not act
the way you are.
Senator Perrault: That is an inadequate reply and one
unworthy of the high office held by the Leader of the Government in this place.
Senator Flynn: On the contrary, it is your stand that is
irresponsible.
Senator Perrault: The commitment we seek from the Leader
of the Government tonight is not a commitment that he shake
his head and become impatient every time the matter is raised
in this place. We want a commitment from him that the good
offices of the Prime Minister of Canada are going to be used
to follow the leadership example set by the former Prime
Minister, Prime Minister Trudeau, when he was in office. We
are asking this government to contact other world leaders
during the next 24 hours. And so my question is: Will this be
done and will there be an effort put forth to establish an
international common front against the terror now being
waged against the United States citizens in Iran?
Honourable senators, let me tell the Leader of the Government that unless we take a strong stand in this crisis, tomorrow
it may be Canadian citizens who are held in some country
without the protection that the rule of law demands.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, I did not think that
anyone could speak with such emotion, even in view of a
situation as serious as that in Iran. I must tell the Leader of
the Opposition that no government is trying more than ours to
ensure compliance with the rule of law, especially on the
international scene. I think we should be glad about the
initiative taken by the government to awaken international
opinion about this conflict which concerns the entire world
community.
Moreover, Canadians throughout the country are asking
that this problem be solved as soon as possible. What can we
do that we have not done already? As I explained earlier, we
have asked our friends of the Commonwealth and in Frenchspeaking countries to support our initiatives.
Senator Denis: You are endangering Canadians in Iran.
[Senator Perrault.]

November 27, 1979

Senator Flynn: I have never heard anything as stupid in all
by life.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, as I said a while ago
in my reply to my honourable friend, Senator Denis, Canadian
individuals and the Canadian embassy in Iran are certainly
playing an important and useful role at the present time.
Moreover, it is the duty of Canadians to remain in Iran
because if they were not there now, the consequences for the
Americans might have been much more serious. Allow me not
to say any more on this subject.
Senator Denis: Let us al] go; it is important that we should
be there.
e (2020)

[English)
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, if Senator Denis
wishes to put a question, I shal be happy to sit down and listen
to it.
[ Translation]
Senator Denis: Honourable senators, I would simply like to
add that the behaviour of this government would needlessly
endanger Canadians still in Iran if they are left there and told
to decide for themselves. The American government itself does
not go too far because it is cautious. It watches what it is
doing. There are 49 American citizens held hostage in Iran
while we know-it-alls stick our noses where we have no
business.
Senator Flynn: I would be curious to hear what Mr. Trudeau has to say about these comments.
Senator Denis: We can have different opinions.
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, the government is
asked to take positive action and you say that we have no
business in this matter. You should get your act together if you
want us to reply to your questions.
However, I am convinced that the Leader of the Opposition
does not agree with Senator Denis. This is why I would like to
tell the Leader of the Opposition that all suggestions made by
his party in this assembly for a possible solution to this conflict
will obviously be well received by the Department of External
Affairs. They will consider your suggestions.
Senator Flynn: Perhaps we might send Senator Perrault as
mediator.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION-SECURITY OF LOANS

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of lndustry, Trade and Commerce. I am
wondering whether the federal government has any new policies in respect of the Export Development Corporation, or
intends to change in any way the operations of the Export
Development Corporation, particularly in relation to making
its loans more secure.

November 27, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I am pleased to
have this opportunity of addressing the question of financing
of exports in this country. As I have said on numerous
occasions, this is an area in which Canada has in many ways
lagged behind its major trading competitors. I do not call them
trading partners in this instance.
I am rather dismayed by the fact that in the field of export
financing, the assistance the Canadian government has been
able to provide to Canadian exporters has, in many instances,
lagged far behind that given to exporters in such countries as
West Germany, Italy, France and Japan. Canadian exporters
are facing very aggressive competitors in international markets, and we must ensure, on a government-to-government
basis and in terms of government to business, that we are in a
position to back those Canadian exporters who have products
and technologies that are competitive in world markets to the
same extent as government backing is available to those in
countries which compete directly against us in those international markets.
The report of the Hatch Committee on Export Promotion is
now in the translation stage. I hope to be able to table that
within a week or two. I do have a copy of it, and it does
address many of the questions which arise in relation to export
financing.
The Export Development Corporation has carried out an
internai study in relation to the various forms of financing
against which it must compete and has made certain recommendations as to how best we can place ourselves in a position
to ensure for our exporters the best possible position in international markets. Within the next 10 to 20 days, we will be in a
position to announce a fairly comprehensive package, both in
the field of trade promotion and trade financing. We have to
become more aggressive. There are tremendous opportunities
out there for our exporters, and we intend to pursue this
matter in that light.
EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION-GUARANTEE OF
INVESTMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES

Senator Haidasz: I thank the minister for his explanation. I
do have a supplementary question.
In a news release put out by the Export Development
Corporation, dated November 23, it is stated that the Corporation will guarantee investments totalling $334 million to 21
countries, among which is the United States of America. I am
wondering whether the minister can inform this chamber as to
the nature of the transaction involving the United States.
Senator de Cotret: I do not have the details of the particular
transaction with the United States with me. I shall be happy to
take the question as notice and give the specific details later.
We have in the past, through the Export Development Corporation, given export financing assistance to firms dealing in the
United States. However, I shall be happy to obtain all the
details of this particular transaction.

EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION-IRANIAN POLICY
RESPECTING FOREIGN DEBTS

Senator Haidasz: I should like to ask a supplementary
question. In view of Iran's decision not to repay its foreign
debts, which could leave Canadian financing corporations with
losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, especially the Export
Development Corporation, what is the government's reaction
to this announcement of the Foreign Minister of Iran?
Senator de Cotret: The announcement of the non-payment
of debts by Iran was widely circulated, but it was not confirmed through any official channels as between Iran and
Canada. It is still our belief, and certainly our expectation,
that Iran will see fit to live up to its international obligations,
particularly with a country such as ours.
ENERGY
DISCUSSION BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER AND PREMIER OF
ALBERTA RESPECTING DOMESTIC OIL PRICE

Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Minister of State for Economic Development,
and ask him if he could give us a progress report on oil prices
and related subjects resulting from the meeting between the
Prime Minister and Premier Lougheed this afternoon-in fact,
perhaps I should say "resulting from the meeting that has gone
on all day."
Senator de Cotret: I should be happy to give honourable
senators a progress report.
Discussions are proceeding in a very satisfactory manner,
and, as I have mentioned often, we are still very much
expecting that a negotiated settlement not only on the question
of energy prices but on the whole energy package will be
forthcoming in the very near future.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, there is exactly as
much information in that reply as in the other replies that we
have received over the weeks. It seems to me that the minister
ought to be a little more forthcoming. Even the Prime Minister
said late this afternoon that the price had been agreed to. Can
we get that information from the minister? Can he at least tell
us what issues are still outstanding? And if an agreement has
been reached on the oil price, can he tell us what it is?
Senator de Cotret: I can only say once again that to the best
of my information, up to the time I walked into this chamber
tonight, the discussions that had gone on today had gone on in
a satisfactory manner and progress was made. Obviously, I
was not present. I would hate to try to surmise as to the
specifics of the discussions. But I will be happy to answer any
questions as soon as I have had an opportunity to discuss with
my colleague exactly where the situation stands.
Senator Oison: A supplementary question, although I do not
know how one can have a supplementary question arising out
of a nothing answer. However, I am going to try. I think,
honourable senators, that members of the government really
ought to have a little more respect for Parliament than is being
displayed here.

SENATE DEBATES
I say that because it is now more than two hours since the
Prime Minister-it may be quite a lot more, but it was at least
two hours ago that the Prime Minister, according to news
reports, did, in fact say that the price per barrel had been
agreed upon, but that other matters were still outstanding,
such as distribution of revenue. As I see it at this moment, the
minister is not willing even to acknowledge what the Prime
Minister has announced to the press. I suggest that is rather
more than a little disrespectful to Parliament.
* (2030)

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Olson: Surely we have the right to be informed as
soon as the press, and certainly several hours afterwards.
There are obviously some important outstanding differences,
or they might have announced what ministers referred to as a
package agreement. Surely we have at least some right to
know what the Prime Minister is willing to tell a press
conference.
Senator de Cotret: Had 1 had the same amount of time as
the press to stand outside 24 Sussex Drive to wait until the
Prime Minister came out, I might have had the information at
my fingertips. I chaired a cabinet committee this afternoon,
and I then chaired a meeting for the Prime Minister while
those very important discussions were going on. Unfortunately,
I was not at the door when he came out. I have told you, to the
best of my understanding, what I know of the conversations
today. I shall be more than happy to inquire of the Prime
Minister at the first opportunity and inform honourable senators as to what went on and where the negotiations stand at
present.
To the best of my information, as 1 replied to the honourable
senator's first question-which he referred to as a nonanswer-there were fruitful discussions. Negotiations are
going ahcad, and we are still very hopeful to be able to reach
in the very near future a negotiated settlement not only on the
price but on the total energy package.
Senator Perrault: Read the newspapers in the morning and
get all the news.
Senator Olson: I can sec that it is useless to pursue this
matter, because the minister has now suggested very frankly
and positively that he simply does not know what went on.
Both he and the Prime Minister knew that this chamber was
going to meet at 8 o'clock tonight. Those afternoon meetings
were completed two or three hours ago. Surely there should
have been sufficient respect for the Parliament of Canada that
there could have been some communication with this chamber,
or at least some information given to it-at least as much
information as they are willing to give to the press in the
corridors.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I wonder if I might ask a
question of the same honourable minister. Is he not amazed at
the sudden tenderness of honourable senators opposite for the
rights of Parliament after having belonged for many years to a

government which said that members of Parliament were
nobodies when they got off Parliament Hill?
An Hon. Senator: Right on!
HUMAN RIGHTS
PROTECTION OF HIANDICAPPED PERSONS

Senator Marshall: Honourable senators, I should like to ask
a question of the Leader of the Government. It has to do with
the protection from discrimination of the handicapped in
Canada. Could the leader reaffirm, on behalf of the government, the commitment made by the Prime Minister on May I
that it would provide protection from discriminatory practices
under the Canadian Human Rights Act in a manner consistent
with coverage provided for other protected groups? Would he
also indicate if the government is prepared to amend the act to
provide for this protection?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, last Friday, accompanied by the Honourable Walter Dinsdale, I met with representatives of the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the
Handicapped. I reiterated the commitment of the Prime Minister made on May 1, when he was Leader of the Opposition,
that we were going to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act
in a manner to provide for tlie handicapped the same protection in relation to services as is provided with regard to
employment.
Specifically, the question will be referred to a committee of
the other place. The committee will study the implication of
the broad principle, and we remain committed to amending
the act in this direction.
Senator Guay: Honourable senatorsSenator Perrault: You just happened to have the information. It is fortuitous that the Leader of the Government had
that important information. May I suggestThe Hon. the Speaker: Order. Senator Guay has the floor.
Senator Perrault: i was asked a question.
Senator Flynn: I attended a meeting with COPOH last
Friday. I do not need any other coaching. Of course, the
honourable senator was kind enough to give me notice of his
question.
CRIMINAL CODE
RIGHTS OF ACCUSED PERSONS

Senator Guay: Honourable senators, in view of the fact that
the Minister of Justice will consider the possibility of looking
at the Human Rights Act, I should like to quote to him from
an editorial that appeared in the Winnipeg Tribune yesterday.
Headed, "Accused persons must know rights," it reads:
It is incredible that the top law man in Canada, Justice
Minister Jacques Flynn, is against granting accused persons the right to talk to a lawyer.

November 27, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

The Canadian Bar Association has proposed that the
Criminal Code be amended to require that police inform
an arrested person that he has the right to call a lawyer.
This proposal was prompted by earlier recommendations
from the Manitoba Bar Association and the Manitoba
Trial Lawyers Association.
Mr. Flynn rejects the idea. He says provincial attorneys
general are opposed and they fear it would hamper police
work. Allowing defendants to have lawyers in court also
holds up court work.
The editorial goes on to say that the minister's argument is not
logical. While the minister is looking at the human rights
matter, he might also look at this matter. My question is:
Would it be the minister's intention to follow the recommendation of the Canadian Bar Association in this regard, which I
am sure would benefit a lot of people in Canada?
Senator Flynn: Is that report from a Winnipeg newspaper?
Senator Guay: Yes, a Winnipeg paper.
Senator Flynn: Then it is wrong.
Senator Guay: It is a Conservative paper in Winnipeg.
Senator Flynn: There is no question but that I have been
wrongly reported on that issue.
Senator Guay: Then the Globe and Mail also reported you
incorrectly. They had a similar article.
Senator Flynn: I do not mind how many may have reported
it. In any event, I met with the Canadian Bar Association last
week and it was one of their recommendations that the Criminal Code be amended to compel police officers to advise any
person arrested that he has the right to consult a lawyer before
answering any question. I said that I was in agreement with
that in principle.
However, I have to take into account representations made
by the provincial attorneys general before making a decision
on that issue. I believe I am wise in consulting with the
attorneys general, who are responsible for the administration
of justice, and at least listening to their observations.
The right of an accused to consult a lawyer is in the
Canadian Human Rights Act. It is there. We are not taking
anything away. The press has been reported as saying that I
was against an acquired right. That is false. The right is
statutory. The Canadian Bar Association suggests that we add
to the Criminal Code the obligation for the police officer to
inform, in every case, the person who is under arrest that he
has the right to consult a lawyer before answering any
question.
Some attorneys general have asked me to hear their
representations. I believe that I should not make a decision ex
parte without hearing them in advance. That is aIl there is to
it.

Senator Guay: I appreciate the minister's answer. In the
interim, until he finalizes this particular point, I should point
out that Attorney General Mercier of Manitoba has been
content to let the Chief of Police of Winnipeg decide the rights
80072-30

of citizens. Mr. Mercier accepted the policy statement by the
police chief, which plainly stated that suspects have the right
to legal counsel at any time. But that is no guarantee. It is
possible that in the interim someone may not be given the right
to which he is entitled. Will the minister seriously look into
this matter in the near future so that the problem will be
solved once and for ail?
Senator Flynn: I believe my previous answer indicated that I
am looking at the matter very seriously.
METRIC CONVERSION PROGRAM
GOVERNMENT POLICY

Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I would like to
direct a question to the Minister of State for Economic
Development. I read last week that the minister responsible for
metric conversion in the United Kingdom had called for a full
stop to the process. Is the minister considering a similar policy
with respect to conversion procedures in Canada?
Senator de Cotret: We have certainly no intention of calling
a full stop to metric conversion in Canada. I believe a number
of statements have been made in the recent past indicating the
actions of this government to review the speed of metric
conversion in Canada, particularly in relation to what our
neighbours to the south are doing to ensure that we are
synchronizing.
*

(2040)

The purpose was to ensure also that the process was going
along smoothly more recently. As you know, test markets were
designated for the initial conversion on the consumer side.
These were monitored very closely by a consumer board
appointed by myself and my colleague, the Minister of State
for Small Businesses and Industry. One of the conclusions of
that board was that there should be careful attention given
with particular reference to the conversion of quantities of
fresh fruit and fresh meat measured in the retail outlets
themselves, because there was obviously a problem in that
area. This is something that we are considering in cabinet at
the moment, in order to see what means can best be pursued in
order to ensure a smooth conversion.
Senator Thompson: As I understand it, among the reasons
why the United Kingdom government came to the decision
they did was the fact that they felt that it might have been
wiser to concentrate on interpreting the metric system to the
householder and the housewife, rather than introducing it into
particular segments, such as that of agriculture, and so on. Are
you considering looking at the reasons for the hait called by
the British government, and the reasons why they feel they
have taken the wrong approach?
Senator de Cotret: I would be very happy to ask the
overview committee looking into the process of metric conversion to address themselves particularly to that matter. There is
no question that you can look at the conversion process from
the point of view of both the producers and of the consumers.
There seem to have been certain problems in the approach we

November 27, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
have pursued in the supermarkets, for example, as I have just
indicated, and the focal point of our interest in looking at the
process right now is to ensure that the best information and
the best acceptance of the process is in place before we proceed
with certain items that are difficult to pursue.
INDUSTRY
CANADA-UNITED STATES AGREEMENT ON AUTOMOTIVE
PRODUCTS-STUDY BY GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO
Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Is the minister aware that Mr. Grossman, the Ontario
Minister of Industry and Tourism, made a statement recently
to the effect that Ontario is undertaking a study of the auto
pact? If the minister is aware of that, is his department
participating in the study, and if not, why not?
Senator de Cotret: First of all, let me say that Mr. Grossman makes a great many statements, most of them quite
interesting to us.
Senator Bosa: He is of the same political colour as you.
Senator de Cotret: That is correct. It is difficult to find
anybody of any different colour in the provinces these days.
An Hon. Senator: Not since the by-elections in Quebec.
Senator de Cotret: What was that? The voices seem to
disappear.
I am aware that Mr. Grossman is very interested in the auto
pact situation. I had the pleasure of having a chat with him in
my office last week, in the course of which we talked about the
auto pact. We talked about a number of problems facing the
auto industry in this country.
If Mr. Grossman intends to conduct a study on the auto
pact, that is something we will follow with great interest, and
we will be looking forward to the results. We are, of course,

conducting our own analysis of the situation as it presently
exists in the automobile industry, and I do not feel that it
would be particularly advantageous for us to enter into a joint
study with the Government of Ontario into the auto pact,
should that be the way they choose to go. We will, however, be
looking at the results of their study with keen interest.

EMBARGO ON OIL SHIPMENTS FROM IRAQ
Senator Bosa: I have a question for the Leader of the

imports from Iraq which was imposed by that country last
June?
Senator Flynn: I shall have to take that question as notice. i

TRANSPORT
POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF NORDAIR ITD.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I have a number of
answers to questions previously asked.
The first answer is to a question asked by Senator Adams on
October 30, 1979, reported at page 210 of the Debates of the
Senate. The question had to do with the disposition of Nordair. In response I would like to tell the honourable senator
that 1am informed that the Minister of Transport, in the near
future, will make a proposal to cabinet regarding the disposition of Nordair. It will naturally follow that this will have to
be approved by the CTC in due course.
GRAIN
TRANSPORTATION POLICY

Senator de Cotret: On October 17, 1979, Senator Molgat

The Minister of Agriculture of Manitoba has indeed contacted the Minister of Transport. Currently the provincial

ministers of agriculture are negotiating a meeting date with
the Minister of Transport. It appears the meeting will be
convened in mid-December.

By way of alleviating the concerns of Senator Steuart as to

CUSTOMS AND EXCISE
VALUATION OF GOODS AT CANADA-UNITED STATES BORDER

Senator de Cotret: On November 22 Senator Muir raised a
question as to the exchange on Canadian dollars used to make
purchases in the United States which are declared at the
Canadian border.
I would like to assure Senator Muir that the answer I gave
him at the time he asked the question-and which I qualified
by saying that I was giving the answer only on the basis of my
understanding of the situation-has been confirmed. That
answer was to the effect that any dollar amounts that are
stipulated in customs duty legisiation are in fact denominated
in domestic currency. Should Senator Muir wish to pursue the
precise case he was referring to, I would be very happy if he
communicates to me the particulars of the matter and I will
endeavour to obtain the specifics for him on a personal basis.

CHICKEN IMPORT QUOTAS-RENEGOTIATION OF
CANADA-UNITED STATES AGREEMENT

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, this will be my last
answer. On November 22, Senator Argue asked if I would
discuss and give consideration to the question of renegotiating
the chicken import quota at the meeting with the Ontario and
Quebec chicken industry representatives on November 23.
On November 23, my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, and I had a very useful meeting with the delegation
representing aIl segments of the Ontario and Quebec poultry
industries, and aIl aspects of the chicken import situation were
discussed. At this meeting it was agreed to form an industrygovernment advisory committee, including consumers, to make
recommendations on modifications to the supplementary
import permit guidelines as well as questions having to do with
the allocation of quota and possible renegotiation of the basic
import quota itself. This group has already held one meeting
and will produce its first recommendations in the very near
future. I trust this consultative exercise will produce results
which will allow the Canadian industry to function effectively.

Senator de Cotret: I would also like to clarify statements
made by me in reply to questions by Senator Argue with
respect to the importation of chicken.
Senator Buckwold: The Colonel Sanders question.
Senator de Cotret: Yes. I do not have that one before me,
but I do recall that I verified the specific question about
Colonel Sanders. Colonel Sanders in Canada uses chicken
products purchased from Canadian firms exclusively. Colonel
Sanders in Canada does not import any chicken from the
United States.
e (2050)
I should like to address specifically the question of the
notice to importers which does make provision for the instruments of supplementary import permits to Canadian manufacturers whose domestic product is not available at a price to
allow them to compete with comparable imported products
containing chicken.
This provision was established because the import controls
under item 19 cover only products wholly composed of chicken. Canadian producers of products manufactured in part
from chicken may, therefore, have to compete with imported
products produced from chicken procured at a lower price.
Canadian producers will be given the first opportunity to
supply the chicken required in processor-request imports under
this provision. This provision is available for aIl processors who
transform chicken into the same products ranging from TV
dinners to breaded deep-fried chicken.

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, you may have had
enough, but I also have a few answers.
Senator Thompson asked a question on November 22
regarding transportation of nuclear materials. I should like
him to know that, regardless of provincial jurisdiction for
trucking, the Atomic Energy Control Board regulates and
licences ail carriers of radioactive material. Failure to comply
with regulations as prescribed by the AECB would result in
the loss of a carrier's licence.
That is substantially what I anticipated the reply would be.

HEALTH AND WELFARE
ADOPTION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN-FEDERAL AID

Senator Flynn: A question was posed by Senator Thompson
regarding the cost-sharing of adoption subsidies to parents of
handicapped children. I have been provided with additional
information elaborating and clarifying what 1 said on November 20.
The federal government, through the Canada Assistance
Plan, shares in subsidies paid by the province, on behalf of a
child in need, to prospective adoptive parents until such time
as the adoption is finalized. In fact, prior to the court order
finalizing the adoption, the child is similar to a foster child in

November 27, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
that he is in the control of the provincial child welfare authority and eligible for assistance in his own right.
After the adoption of a child has been finalized, the adopting family may receive assistance if that family is recognized
as being "in need" on the basis of a needs test. Such a needs
test takes into account assets, income, and the budgetary
requirements of an applicant.
Subsidies paid by provinces-for example, Ontario-to
adopting families on the basis of income-testing, are not
shareable under the Canada Assistance Plan legislation.
Under the Income Tax Act, needs-tested benefits are
exempt from taxation. Certain income-tested benefits, such as
the Ontario subsidies, could be taxable unless exempt through
a remission order. Requests for remission orders are initiated
by the province and submitted to the Department of National
Revenue after recommendation by an intergovernmental committee which considers such orders. Adoption subsidies are on
the agenda for the next intergovernmental committee meeting
when the committee will be considering remission orders for
1979.
I hope this will clarify any misunderstanding which may
have occurred as the result of my previous answer to Senator
Thompson.

situation.

MONITORING OF PROFITS RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN

Senator Frith: May I express my lack of appreciationperhaps it is not that serious. However, if we look at the
Debates of the Senate for last Thursday, we see that I asked
Senator de Cotret if he would give us a progress report tonight
on the criteria that the Department of Finance was going to
use to monitor the undueness of bank and oil company profits.
At that time, as I understood it, he undertook to give us a
progress report tonight.
Senator de Cotret: I have certainly endeavoured to obtain a
progress report on the criteria being used, and I am awaiting
an answer. I can only assure the honourable senator that as
soon as I have an answer I will be happy to indicate it to this
chamber.
Senator Frith: Is there any indication as to when that could
be?
Senator de Cotret: No.

SPORTS
WORLD JUNIOR HOCKEY TOURNAMENT

Senator Flynn: Finally, I have a response to Senator Buckwold's question. It is a detailed account of the background
which led to Canada's decision not to participate in the World
Junior Hockey Tournament to be held this year in Finland.
1 am sure that Senator Buckwold, given his great familiarity
with international hockey, is aware of the tradition that in the
winter of an Olympic competition there is a virtual moratorium on other international competitions. This year, however,
the International Ice Hockey Federation decided to proceed
with the Finland tournament nonetheless.
Over a year ago, Canada decided that since, in this Olympie
year, we were participating in the hockey competition for the
first time since 1968, and because the team would likely be
drawn from the age level of those who play junior hockey, we
would not participate in the junior competition. Accordingly,
no provision was made for this expenditure in the budget of
Fitness and Amateur Sport for this year.
I must tell Senator Buckwold that the minister was surprised when he learned in September that Canada had somehow become committed to sending a team, and that a federal
contribution of $65,000 was being solicited.
The decision was confirmed at that time, that since the
government was far into its budget year, and given the cutbacks which took place in the department last year, the
original understanding that Canada would not participate
would not be reversed.
Senator Buckwold: I should just like to express my appreciation to the Leader of the Government for the very prompt

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
SEARCIH OF JOURNALIST'S HOME

Senator Frith: Last Thursday I also asked Senator Flynn,
the Minister of Justice, if he could give us a progress report on
the status of the RCMP six-man raid on the Gosselin home,
and I understood he was going to do so.
Perhaps, like Senator de Cotret, he has been unable to
procure a progress report. I am not asking for an answer, but
only a progress report.
Senator Flynn: I have a reply for Senator Frith, but it
became lost among the other answers that I have on my desk.
The question relates to the execution of a search warrant by
the RCMP on the home of a journalist by the name of JoAnn
Gosselin.
I should like to advise him that the investigation was
requested by the Deputy Minister of National Defence, Mr.
Buz7 Nixon. The raid by the RCMP was authorized by a
judicial officer by way of a search warrant.
I have consulted with the Solicitor General, and he informed
me that the RCMP has assured the Solicitor General that the
seach warrant was validly obtained to undertake the
investigation.
The document that the RCMP were looking for was found
on Mrs. Gosselin's premises.
However, I would like to emphasize that no criminal charges
are to be laid against Mrs. Gosselin. The purpose of the
investigation is to discover the method by which the material
was procured. When and if a decision has to be made in regard

to the laying of charges, it will be made with the authorization

would expedite the business.

SENATE DEBATES

STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF FI RST REPORT OF STANDING
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, November 14, the
debate on the motion of Senator Molson for the adoption of
the first report of the Standing Committee on Standing Rules
and Orders.
Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I want to make three
points on the proposed amendments.
First, I should like to say that I respect Senator Bosa and
Senator Olson, and also their point of view. I understand why
this suggestion has been made, but although I respect their
point of view I just do not happen to share it. I also adopt the
observations of Senator Olson, but I do not share his willingness to go along with this suggested amendment as an
experiment.
The present rule 49(1 )(c) says:
Provided that ...
(c) a senator who declines to vote shall assign his
reasons therefor, following which the Speaker shall
submit to the Senate the question, "Shall the senator,
for the reasons assigned by him, be excused from
voting?", which shall be decided without debate.
I believe there is a principle implicit in the present rule, a
principle that can be translated into the slogan: "Stand up and
be counted."
* (2110)

One of the present practices might be-to paraphrase Harry
Truman-"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."
Of course, while not wanting to suggest that this chamber is
anything like a kitchen, that is, in effect, the present practice if
one does not wish to vote on a question. If one does not wish to
vote on a question, one leaves the chamber and, by doing so,
does what Harry Truman advised-that is, gets out of the
kitchen.
I like the present rule. That is why I am suggesting that we
vote against this proposed amendment. I am proud that we
have a rule that requires us to stand up and be counted. If we
do not wish to vote on a question, we can sneak out of the
chamber, but if we stay we have to explain our reason.
My colleagues who are lawyers will recognize the fact that,
when examining legislation or amendments to legislation-and
this is a form of procedural legislation-one normally asks,
"What is the evil that is to be remedied?" It is a way to
understand why a law is being passed. Many of my colleagues
in this chamber, when proposing a bill or supporting a bill, will
commence their remarks by saying, "Honourable senators, this
bill deals with the following problem," and then they explain
the problem. The same thing is done in court. It is done in
order to understand the motive or purpose of the legislation.
So, this being a rather bold and intrepid sort of rule, why
are we talking about changing it? What is the evil we are
trying to remedy? We can only look at the suggestions that

have been made in this chamber as to why it should be
remedied.
The first we might call the Macquarrie reason. The Macquarrie reason, as the honourable senator explained when
speaking in support of the amendment, is and evidences the
fact that there is more than one side to a question. That, of
course, is true, but as Senator Olson said, perhaps what we are
appointed here to do is take a side on an issue.
Then there is the sub-Macquarrie reason. This would say
that the amendment allows us to escape from the dilemma of
an omnibus bill. I understand what be means when he talks
about the evil of an omnibus bill. The rule puts one in the
position of voting for or against the whole of an omnibus bill
when one is for one part and against another part.
What did the drafters of this present rule have in mind when
they faced the same problem? It was their view that if a
senator finds himself faced with an omnibus bill, in respect of
which he agrees with some parts and disagrees with other
parts, he can simply say, "I decline to vote, honourable
senators, and the reason I decline to vote is because I refuse to
vote on a bill that is an omnibus bill and does not give me a
chance to vote in favour of one part and against another part."
I would be persuaded by that. If His Honour said that
pursuant to rule 49(l)(c) a senator has said that he declines to
vote on a bill because it is an omnibus bill, that he is for one
part and against another part, h think I would support him and
say that he should be excused from voting. He has persuaded
me why he should be excused from voting. That is the first evil
that is supposed to be remedied by the amendment, but I do
not think it is remedied by the amendment because the present
rule gives a perfect answer to that-and an honourable answer
at that. It is not a sneaky answer, but an honourable one.
Senator Macquarrie can say, "I will not vote for this bill for
this reason," and I would respond, "Good for you, Senator
Macquarrie; you have given your reason and I support you."
The second reason for amending this rule, and the second
evil to be remedied, is the current situation in Parliament
where we have a minority government in the House of Commons and a majority opposition in the Senate. So any one of
us, particularly on this side of the house, might be faced with a
measure that we, in our conscience, oppose but which-to give
a perfect example-has been promised by the Conservative
Party. If the Conservative Party had been elected on a promise, and is fulfilling that promise by introducing a bill that
has the support of the House of Commons, then when the
measure comes to this house, where the Liberals are in a
position to defeat it, I would not vote against it. I would not
vote against a bill that was passed by the House of Commons
and was the fulfillment of a mandate given by the electorate
because the Conservative Party had promised that they would
introduce such a bill if elected.
So why does there have to be an amendment of the rule?
Senator Bosa: What would you do?
Senator Frith: hcould not have prompted a better question.
h would stand and say, "Honourable senators, I am not going

SENATE DEBATES
to sneak out of this chamber. i am a Liberal and i am against
this legislation, but it is before us in fulfillment of a mandate
granted by the people. It has been passed by the House of
Commons. Although I am against this bill, i am going to
decline to vote because i do not think it is my place as a
senator to vote against the will of the people, as exemplified by
a vote and by passage in the House of Commons of a bill in
specific fulfillment of a clear mandate."
That would be my explanation. Would anyone not accept
that? Would it be said that under the rule as it now exists my
explanation is not sufficient? I do not think so. Therefore, the
second evil that is supposed to be remedied by the amendment
is perfectly solved by the rule as it stands.
The third reason was given by my esteemed colleague,
Senator Bosa. It was one of his main reasons. i thank him for
the diligent research he did to show that the Senate of Canada
is totally out of step with virtually every other legislature-out
of step with the House of Lords and out of step with al] the
other legislative bodies he mentioned.
Senator Bosa: I should like to correct Senator Frith. i did
not say we were out of step with the House of Lords because
the House of Lords does not have a provision respecting
abstention from voting. The other legislatures have, but not
the House of Lords.
Senator Frith: That intervention does not change my persuasion. The honourable senator has said, as one of the reasons
for amending this rule, that we are an anomaly; the Senate of
Canada is an anomaly and, therefore, not in step with everyone else.
i am glad we are not in step. I am proud of this rule. If a
member of one of the other legislatures asked me why we are
out of step in Canada, why we do not allow people to abstain
from voting without giving a reason, I would tell him that that
is the way we do things in Canada; we feel we are there to vote
on the measures brought before us.
To get back to my theme, we are here to stand and be
counted. If we have good reason not to stand and be counted,
then we stand in our place and explain to our colleagues why it
is we do not wish to vote. Following our explanation, the
Speaker puts the question: Honourable senators, do you accept
this as sufficient reason to allow the senator to decline to vote?
We put the onus on ourselves. We have to persuade our
colleagues as to our reason for declining. The only way we can
decline to vote is if our colleagues accept the reason given as
valid--and there could be any number of reasons. It could be a
conflict of interest, or either one of the points mentioned by

November 27, 1979

Senator Macquarrie. It could be that not having been elected,
a senator chooses to decline to vote because he does not want
to defeat the government. If it is agreed that that is a valid
reason for declining, then that honourable senator need not
vote.
What we are going through now is a classic case, and i will
not decline to vote on this motion. i will vote against it.
However, if I had reason to decline to vote, all i have to do is
to rely on the rule itself and stand in my place and say,
"Honourable senators, this rule, which serves all of the purposes of this Senate, allows me to say why i decline to vote,"
and then ask honourable senators to either support me or not
support me. Under the present rule, i can decline to vote on
this proposed amendment, or i can vote for it or against it. For
the reasons i have explained, i intend to vote against it.
Senator Godfrey: i wonder if i might put a question to the
honourable senator. In the event that 70 Liberal senators
decide to abstain, what advantage is there in having each
senator individually having to get up and explain his reasons
and have His Honour the Speaker take a vote on each one?
What is the advantage in that?
Senator Frith: I sec a terrific advantage. It will not happen,
of course, with 70, because it does not take 70. But there is a
great advantage in that because the people can then say that
senators either vote for or against something, or they stand up
and explain why they decline to vote. i think that is a great
advantage. We are able to say, out of step with everyone else,
that a Canadian senator stands and votes cither for or against
something, or explains why he declines to vote.
On motion of Senator Macdonald, debate adjourned.

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, before questions are

point of privilege.
As a result of an article in this morning's Ottawa Journal
based upon the response i gave to a question posed by Senator
Frith reiating to the execution of a search warrant by the
RCMP on the residence of JoAnn Gosselin, i consulted Han.çard of Tuesday, November 27, 1979. 1 would therefore take
this opportunity to further elaborate upon that response, which
might possibly lead to an incorrect impression.
Last evening i stated:
Howcvcr, i would like to cmphasizc that no criminal
charges are to be laid agalnst Nlrs. Gosselin.
i should have stated that no criminal charges arc being
contemplated against Mrs. Gosselin by rny departmcnt or by
my officiais as a resuit of this investigation. The decision as to
whether charges are warrantcd in this case, as 1 stated yesterday. is a matter for my colleague, the Attorney General of
Ontario. i want the record to make tl clear that 1 arn in no way

program that we were told about recently by the Minister of

ENERGY
MOVFFMENT 0F Oit FROM ALASKA TO LOWER FORTY-EIGHT
STATES

Senator Perrault: Honourabie senators, 1 have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. A few
days ago the Prime Minister held a press conference in Vancouver, a transcript of which was rushed out to us almost
immediately. In responding to a questioner at that press
conference, he said:
i expect to have an opportunity to speak to President
Carter by telephone before the December 6 date which is
set in their legisiation.
And that is the legislation respecting the proposed oil pipeline.
He went on t0 say:
i will naturally be discussing the Foothilîs option anîd if tl
is clear, at that time, that Foothilîs, in fact, is not on, 1
naturally will be indicating Canada's second preferenceAnd so on.
Some confusion arises from the fact that a statement has
been made in Washington, D.C., by President Carter's office
to thc effect that the President has set a deadline of tomorrow,
Thursday, November 29, for informing Congress as to which
of thc several competing routes he favours for the transportation of oil from Alaska. If he is not in a position to advise
Congress by that deadline, he must then ask Congress to
approve a 60-day delay for stating his preference.
What is the reason for this apparent discrepancy between
the deadline which has been set by President Carter and the
apparent belief of the Right Honourable the Prime N4inister
that the deadline is approximateiy one week later on December
6?
Senator de Cotret: 1 do not think there is a discrepancy. The
dcadline of December 6 was the deadline that President Carter
was opcrating under. If the President elects to make his views
known to Congress by November 29, then 1 arn sure that that
date, from bis point of view, is quite appropriate. 1 am sure,
aiso, that the Prime Nlinister is aware of the President's
intention to make bis views known to Congress before the
actual deadline roils around.
Ccrtainly, it is my understanding that the December 6
date-and 1 arn not sure whether it is the subject of legislation

November 28, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

or simply an agreement-was the final date by which the
President was to inform Congress, and everyone was working
under that timetable.
Senator Perrault: In view of the importance of this entire
matter to Canada and, indeed, all of North America, would it
not be in Canada's interests to have the Right Honourable the
Prime Minister do something more than attempt to place a
telephone call to the President of the United States? Certainly,
the importance of this issue warrants a major effort in several
directions-perhaps a personal visit by the Right Honourable
the Prime Minister to the President to make sure that Canada's position is set forth as effectively as possible.
Senator de Cotret: I was under the impression that the
honourable senator had been present at our discussions since
the opening of this Parliament. I have gone to great lengths in
answering, to the best of my ability, questions put to me by
senators opposite with respect to the many initiatives that we
have taken since June 4 last in terms of making Canada's
position known to the United States, and those initiatives have
been taken at the officials' level, the ambassadorial level and
the ministerial level. Also, the aide-mémoire that went between the governments was submitted.
In terms of the personal contact between the Prime Minister
and the President of the United States, I would only remind
the honourable senator that such a visit had been organized,
and the question of an oil line was a topic very high on the
agenda, and I so indicated that to this chamber. Unfortunately, for reasons well known to the honourable senator, the
President, at the last moment, for very legitimate reasons, was
forced to cancel those meetings. Certainly, that was not an
initiative on our part. The Prime Minister indicated in his
news conference, from which the honourable senator has
quoted, his intention to pursue the matter as aggressively as
possible, and we have certainly indicated clearly, in as direct a
manner as possible, our position respecting an oil line.
Senator Perrault: If, as the minister has reassured us, all
possible efforts have been undertaken to protect Canada's
interests in this matter, what good purpose, then, would be
served by the Prime Minister placing a telephone call to the
President before the December 6 deadline? What would be the
nature of additional representations made, assuming all avenues have been exhausted?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, in one breath I am
asked to do more, and in the other to do less.
Senator Perrault: We do not ask you to do less.
*

(1420)

Senator de Cotret: We are doing everything possible not
only to press but to impress our position on the President of the
United States. I can go no further. We have made all the
representations that were necessary to bring this matter to the
attention of the President of the United States.
Senator Perrault: There is no dissatisfaction on this side
with the idea of the Right Honourable the Prime Minister
contacting the President of the United States. But the minister

has just stated to the house that in effect a "broad offensive"
has been launched in order to secure the Canadian position in
this matter, that "all representations necessary" have been
made. The Right Honourable the Prime Minister said in
Vancouver that it is important that he make a telephone call to
President Carter before December 6. What would be the
nature of the further representations in that final call? Has
new evidence come to the fore? The opposition does not oppose
the idea of a further telephone call or a further meeting.
Indeed, we think the Canadian case should be pressed more
vigorously. But what representations remain?
The second question is: Is there any reason for this apparent
change in the presidential deadline? The minister seemed to
suggest to the Senate this afternoon that November 29 was
one deadline and that December 6 was another kind of deadline. Has there been a change in the deadline? Was any
information conveyed from the United States to Canada in the
past two weeks suggesting that the deadline had been
changed? One serious concern is that Canada's position in this
pipeline matter may have been formulated too late to be
considered in this emergency situation.
Senator de Cotret: Once again, honourable senators, t will
refer to a detailed answer that I provided to this chamber
when I outlined the number of times that negotiations between
our two countries on this topic had taken place and t also
identified the names of those who made the representations on
our behalf and the date those representations were made. If
you check the transcript you will find those representations
began in early summer and continued through until early fall,
leading up to the presentation of an aide-mémoire to the
President of the United States in, I believe, early October. I
shall have to check that date.
In terms of the deadline that you have referred to, to my
knowledge there has been no change in deadline. The deadline
of December 6 was set by Congress. Congress wanted to hear
back from the President on December 6, so I presume that
would be on or before December 6. Now, if this chamber were
to instruct me to report back on or before February 15, and if I
were in a position to report back on February 1, I certainly
hope that honourable senators would not hold it against me if I
made my report earlier than the deadline suggested. It is not a
change in deadline.
Again, to the best of my knowledge I have no indication and
t am not aware of any reasons for a possible earlier message
from the President to Congress. I shall be happy to pursue it
further and find out if there is some kind of secret here that
nobody is aware of.
Senator Perrault: I appreciate the minister's commitment to
provide a detailed explanation of what is apparently a contradictory report from Washington. Again, the Washington
report states that the presidential deadline to give Congress his
opinion is tomorrow, and the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister stated in Vancouver that the deadline for the President to give his decision to Congress is December 6. There
could be a critical misunderstanding involved here, and the
opposition would appreciate an explanation.

Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce if he has had any
communication with the Prime Minister today and can therefore give us some indication of where the negotiations between
Canada and Alberta stand on oil prices and energy matters
related thereto.
Senator de Cotret: Yes. i would be happy to give you
further information, i have had the opportunity of discussing
this important matter with the Prime Minister and i am happy
to report to this chamber that significant progress was made
during the meeting held yesterday between the Prime Minister
and the Premier of Alberta. There has been agreement on ail
important principles of the energy package and, for that
matter, there has been general agreement on the details of the
package. There are certain details still to be worked out.

specific details are ongoing at the moment and will be in the
days to come.
We hope to be in a position in the very near future to
announce the details of the agreement, which i should like to
underline is much more all-encompassing than just the question of petroleum prices.
Senator Oison: i should like to ask a supplenentary question. Is it a fact that the price has been agreed to? i am not
asking how much, but i would like to know if that has been
agreed to. i understand that the Prime Minister said yesterday
afternoon that that was no longer outstanding.
i have a second supplementary question. Is it also a fact that
the Minister of Finance now knows that he will be able to take
into account about $5 billion more for budgeting purposes
during the next three or four years?
Senator de Cotret: You will certainly appreciate that the
amount of moneys accruing to the federal government over the
next three or four years will be announced in the budget of
December l1.
To answer the first part of your question, yes, there is a
general agreement on the question of price.
Senator Oison: I have a final supplementary. i sec the
Leader of the Government is smiling. He always smiles when i
say that it is a final supplementary.
Senator Asselin: i am another one who is smiling.
Senator Oison: Well, it is nice to see a number of happy
people on the government side.
i should like to ask the minister if the amount of the
increase in the price of oil as well as the global amount of the
distribution of the increase in the price has been agreed to and
if what is left is simply the mechanics or the methodology of it
being completed by the two levels of government and, indeed,
by the industry.
[Senalor Perrault.]

November 28, 1979

Senator de Cotret: Again, there has been agreement on the
basic principles of the package itself. The outstanding issues
have to deal with the specific mechanics by which these
general principles are put into play.

OIL PRICE NEGOTIATIONS-DIRECTION OF REVENUE FLOW

Senator Everett: i have a supplementary question for the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce dealing with the
question of the oil price negotiations.
To use his term, in his previous incarnation he was, i
believe, the defender of the price mechanism wherein in a
situation such as obtains today in respect of oil supply he
would, i believe, have argued that the price level should be
increased to reduce demand and that the revenues from that
increase in price level should flow to the producer in order to
increase supply. Is he still of that opinion now that he is
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and Minister of
State for Economic Development? Moreover, has he pressed
that view on the Prime Minister and those who are conducting
the negotiations with the Province of Alberta?
* (1430)

Senator de Cotret: I would like to assure my honourable
colleague that i am in full agreement with the overall package
that is being proposed by the federal government in the energy
field to ensure that we becone self-sufficient by the year 1990.
Not only am i in full agreement with the overall package, i am
in full agreement with the various components of the package;
and i believe i can also assure my honourable colleague that
the considerations i would have had in my previous incarnation, and those that he has just mentioned, are very much part
of the package-more specifically the necessity for the
increase in the price of crude to approach world levels, as I
have mentioned a number of times. i do not think I have
changed my position on that for a great number of years.
Honourable senators, i hold the position that we should
maintain a margin with U.S. prices, because obviously with
our major trading partner we certainly cannot go faster. I am
not even sure that we would like to come to exactly the same
price level. I think we should keep a competitive margin there
to help our manufacturing and processing sectors; and that
certainly is an element of the policy, as i have mentioned time
and time again, and the necessity on the producers' side for
sufficient cash flow to bring on stream additional resources
and enhance the supply side. Certainly that has always been
my position. It is certainly part and parcel of the overall
strategy, and the need to provide for adjustment mechanism in
the whole process. So i do not think there is any inconsistency
between my previous position and the package that is now
under discussion. i think they are fully consistent. Certainly,
my views in the past have been communicated and are in
agreement with the views of the present government.

SENATE DEBATES

November 28, 1979

Senator Everett: I am delighted to hear that. Could the
minister give the house a brief explanation of what he has just
termed "the adjustment process"?
Senator Flynn: Do you want a speech?
Senator de Cotret: In terms of the adjustment process, I
think the details of any program that are put in place will be
announced in due course. But certainly with a rapid increase in
the price of petroleum, account has to be taken in terms of
how that impact works itself through the economy. The impact
has to work itself through the economy with the least negative
fallouts and in the most expeditious way.
GRAIN
INTERIM PAYMENTS BY CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ON
CURRENT CROP

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce
concerning an unforeseen injustice that may well take place
and affect a substantial number of wheat producers unless
certain action is taken.
By way of background, I wish to say to the minister that the
Wheat Board announced yesterday that the interim payment,
the adjustment payment, on wheat delivered in this current
crop year is about to be placed in the mail. The minister may
realize that a substantial number of western wheat producers
are delivering wheat this year and have accepted deferred
payment into 1980. The interim payment that is now going to
all wheat producers, as I understand it, will certainly be
considered as 1979 income unless action is taken by the
government.
Since it means that farmers who wish to defer payment for
wheat they delivered this year cannot fully have the matter
deferred because the interim payment of 75 cents on spring
wheat per bushel and $1 on durum per bushel is now being
made, would the minister consult with the Minister of National Revenue to see whether an order may be issued to the effect
that producers who have deferred payment into 1980 may have
this portion of the income they now receive considered as 1980
income?
Another mechanism that could be used would be to say to
the producers, "If you care not to cash those Wheat Board
cheques until January 1980, they will then be considered as
1980 income." The whole general scheme is a device to allow
wheat producers to have some control over their income and
therefore the level of taxes they are paying. I do not think
anyone really foresaw the injustice that is likely to take place,
and some action should be taken. I would ask the minister to
make representations of this kind to his colleague.
0

(1435)

Senator de Cotret: I would first of all like to thank the
honourable senator for bringing this important issue to my
attention. I will take it up with my colleagues, the minister
responsible for the Wheat Board, the Minister of Finance, and
the Minister of National Revenue. I would like to think that

there are mechanisms already in place to deal with the matter,
but certainly I will bring it to their attention and report back.
Senator Argue: I might say that if this action can be taken,
the wheat producers will thank the minister, the government,
and anyone else involved in removing an injustice that must
have been unforeseen.
Senator de Cotret: I certainly appreciate that. I would also
like the honourable senator to appreciate that this payment
was initially designed to facilitate, not complicate, the lives of
wheat producers, so if there are any unforeseen negative
impacts we are certainly going to look into the situation.

QUEBEC WHITE PAPER ON SOVEREIGNTY ASSOCIATION-INTENTION OF FEDERAL GOVERN MENT

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government. The white paper
recently released by the Government of Quebec on the new
Quebec-Canada agreement being a direct and systematic
indictment of federal policies since the beginning of Confederation in 1867, and that indictment being for a very large part
based on lies of commission and omission, does the federal
government intend to stand up and set the facts straight and
publish a rebuttal of the white paper with a view to further
enlightening Quebecers before the referendum?
Senator Flynn: On the last part of the question, namely
whether we intend to publish an official rebuttal of the white
paper, no decision has yet been made in that respect. However,
I can ask my colleagues whether that should be done. However, there is no doubt that publications and studies are
available, and others are being prepared which will certainly
make it possible to point out to Quebecers, and other Canadians alike, the falsehoods that unquestionably exist in the white
paper in that respect. The policy of this government is indeed
to show Quebecers that the federal system still offers the most
guarantees in terms of both individual liberties and cultural,
social as well as economic development.
Senator Lamontagne: A supplementary question, because I
believe the minister did not really answer my question. When
will he be able to say the government has decided to make an
official reply to that paper?
Senator Flynn: I will tell you when the decision is made one
way or the other. The white paper was published recently. I
imagine we can expect rebuttals from the Quebec Liberal
Party headed by Mr. Claude Ryan. I also imagine the paper to
be produced by that party will answer the accusations in the
white paper.
In my humble opinion this job is the immediate responsibility of political parties in Quebec. They are in a better position
than we are, at least if we consider the success of the federal
government policy until now. However, I do not think that the
honourable senator should be concerned that the present government will not take the initiative and do what is required,

November 28, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

useful and wise. Perhaps we could publish a new edition of the
book of the honourable senator on Canadian federalism.
Senator Lamontagne: Do you want a copy?
Senator Flynn: I have read it, but I was wondering whether
you believed yourself that it would bc useful to publish a new
edition, at this time.
Senator Lamontagne: One last supplementary. Am 1 to
understand that this government wants to leave the major
responsibility to members of the opposition in provincial politics to defend the policies of the federal government?
Senator Flynn: Not at all. What we have said is that it is
first and foremost up to Quebecers to determine their own
future.
Senator Lamontagne: In full consideration of the facts?
Senator Flynn: In full consideration of the facts, of course. I
am not as worried as the Honourable Senator Lamontagne
about the good judgment of Quebecers. However, if you are
saying that it would be useful to give them a lot of figures and
to start a new war of numbers, I think you are wrong.
It seens to me that honourable senators, including even our
worried colleague Senator Lamontagne, should realize in view
of all the by-elections held in Quebec in the last few years that
Quebecers do not need a lot of figures to make up their minds,
since these by-elections clearly indicate opposition to the constitutional alternative advocated by the government now in
power in Quebec.
This is, therefore, a very good sign that we can have
confidence in Quebecers for the referendum. Senator Lamontagne will perhaps change his mind and go and help them. I
have no objection to that. He might give them other opinions,
even mine if need be. However, I believe that it is quite clear
that the people of Quebec know where they must go and what
decision they must make for the referendum. As for me, I am
not pessimistic. We will do what is necessary, but not what is
superfluous and especially not what might embitter or irritate
Quebecers by leading them to believe that we are trying to tell
them what to do.

CROWN CORPORATIONS
PETRO-CANADA- DATE OF ANNOUNCEMENT OF
GOVERNMENTS INTENTION

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. As honourable senators are aware, Mr. William Hopper of PetroCanada testified before a committee of the other place yesterday. Deeply disturbing are the suggestions made by Mr.
Hopper when he said, with respect to Petro-Canada, "rapid
government action is required." [He referred to "the damaging
uncertainty surrounding the corporation at the present time"
and he talked in terms of "damaging uncertainty" and "gravely affecting Petro-Canada."
[Senator F-n.]

The other day the minister stated:
We expect to be in the position in a fairly reasonable
period of time to announce exactly how the government
intends to proceed with the matter of Petro-Canada.
My question is this: As a result of Mr. Hopper's testimony
yesterday outlining the serious difficulties now facing PetroCanada because of government inaction and uncertainty, is the
government resolved now to set a specific time when the
decision will be made in respect to Petro-Canada? Surely it is
in the public interest.
Senator de Cotret: As I indicated in the answer that the
honourable senator quoted, we will be in a position in a
"reasonable"-in the full meaning of the word-period of time
to announce specifically what we intend to do in the question
of Petro-Canada.
In terms of Mr. Hopper's testimony, it is obviously an
expression of his own opinion of the situation, and he is fully
entitled to his own opinion.
Senator Perrault: May I ask the minister whether "reasonable" to the Conservative government is five years, two years,
two months or three weeks'?
Senator Flynn: It is more "reasonable" than your side.

[Translation]

NATIONAL UNITY
QU[BEC REFERENDUM

Senator Robichaud: Honourable senators, perhaps I might
speak on the same theme as Senator Lamontagne and ask a
few questions of the government leader. By way of introduction, as far as I know there have been already two referenda in
Canada. The first was held in 1928 on prohibition. The
question was clear, short and straightforward. It was put in
advance before all those who were asked to vote yes or no.
The second was held in 1942, on conscription. Here again,
the question was clear and straightforward and announced
long in advance to give electors time to study the issue and
make their choice.
Now I wonder if the third referendum will allow the people
who will have to make their choice to do so fully aware of the
facts, as the government leader said. Will Quebecers have
enough time to study a clear, short and straightfoward question before the referendum? I put this question as a Canadian,
as someone very concerned about the future. I put it also as a
French-speaking Canadian outside Quebec. I put it as an
Acadian because my future and that of my people is at stake.
Would it not be possible at this time to get from the Quebec
premier or his representative, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Claude Morin, a clear and straightforward question? I

November 28, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

am simply asking for myself and all the people I represent
here.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, of course the question
put by Senator Robichaud depends entirely on the Quebec
government and the National Assembly. Unless I am mistaken, I understand that the question is to be announced before
Christmas and that it should be put to the National Assembly
in January or February. If I am right, there will be at least 60
days between the adoption of the question by the National
Assembly and the date of the referendum which will be set
subsequently.
I am still confident that whatever the question, whatever its
degree of frankness, Quebecers will realize its meaning. It is
the meaning of the question that is important.
Now there is nothing I can extract from Mr. Lévesque at
this point, nothing that can be extracted by Mr. Ryan. And I
shall get still fewer secrets from Mr. Morin than I could from
Mr. Lévesque. Mr. Morin, the father of gradualism, certainly
will want to influence the question so as to make it a less
decisive step, which is the government's true objective. I must
suggest and I repeat that I am quite confident that the
question's true meaning will be understood by Quebecers and
that they will give an enlightened, clear and definite answer
along the lines of their present inclination, which is indicated
by the results of the seven by-elections held to date by the
Quebec government. I emphasize they have been thoroughly
beaten seven times out of seven. Quebecers will want to state
that their future and that of French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec, their brethren with whom they must stick, is
within our Canadian confederation.

I have always enjoyed his occasional remarks. All of a sudden,
he cornes out of his torpor, to use an expression that is correct,
and asks us a question I have already answered. But, once
again, the question put by Senator Denis is that of a pessimist.
Do you really think you would be serving the federalist cause if
you said to those who are against "You do not have the right
to speak"?
Senator Denis: Neither one of them.
Senator Flynn: No, no, just a moment. "You do not have the
right to speak. You will not have the right to discuss. We
simply decide. We simply discuss our view. You, we ignore
entirely." Well, I say this is the worst method you could use. It
is a matter of fair play. There is, unfortunately, a legitimate
government in Quebec, legitimate because the former Canadian Prime Minister helped defeat Mr. Bourassa's regime. In any
case, it is legitimate; it is there.
So you are going to tell people, "we will not discuss your
option on the CBC. We will discuss ours only." I find that
rather unwise. I have faith in Quebecers, a lot more than
Senator Denis does. Of course, he was elected in St. Denis for
nearly 50 years without having to prove anything. Without
having to prove anything, he was always elected. Had he been
anything, he would have been elected. But the time of blind
trust is over. I believe we can now trust Quebecers who will
give the real answer, the right answer even if weSome Hon. Senators: Oh! Oh! Oh!

both speculation and direct quotations from the Minister of
Regional Economic Expansion. The matter is further confused
by some questions asked and answers given in the other place
that appear in yesterday's House of Commons Hansard.
Can he tell us exactly what the status is of the alleged

grants come under the DREE program. What is the situation

DISCUSSION BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER AND PREMIER OF
ALBERTA

BUDGET CUTS-DETERIORATION OF SERVICE TO HOSPITALIZED
WAR VETERANS

Senator Goldenberg: Honourable senators, I would like to
revert, if i may, to a question which i think the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce answered only in part. It was
with reference to what he called the package deal between the
Prime Minister and the Premier of Alberta on oil prices. I
understood the minister to say that all that remained to be
agreed upon was the mechanism or mechanisms. Would the
minister give us a definition of the word "mechanisms" in the
answer to that question? Do the mechanisms include the
proposed self-sufficiency tax, and a decision as to the division
of the revenue from that tax, or the basis on which that tax is
to be imposed?

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, i should like to ask
a question of the government leader. In view of the drastic
budget cuts effected by the Treasury Board which have caused
serious deterioration of service to our hospitalized war veterans, could the government leader assure this chamber that he
will bring this serious matter to the attention of the President
of the Treasury Board?

Senator de Cotret: Once again, honourable senators, i would
like to say that there is agreement on all the important
principles and details, not only in the price area but in the total
energy package. There are certain specific details of a
mechanical nature that still have to be ironed out. They are
being discussed between officiais of the two governments at
the moment, and I would prefer at this time that those
negotiations should go forth before making any announcement
as to the specifics.
Senator Goidenberg: I don't want to pin the minister down,
but the reason I am asking this question is that i watched the
CBC news at i1 o'clock last night, and Mr. Lougheed
appeared to make it clear that there was no agreement on the
so-called self-sufficiency tax or the basis on which it was to be
levied. I suggest that that would indicate that the package is
not an all-inclusive one, and "mechanism" may not be the
appropriate word for what remains to be decided.

* (1510)

Senator Flynn: That is the first time i have heard of any
cuts in this area, and i shall certainly take the question as
notice. This surprises me, because i must say that the Minister
of Veterans Affairs is dedicated to the cause of the welfare of
veterans. i would be surprised that any decision along that line
would have been taken. However, I will inquire.
Senator Haidasz: In view of the many needs of our war
veterans, would the Leader of the Government show his concern for them by supporting the cause for a full-time Minister
of Veterans Affairs?
Senator Flynn: i do not think that is necessary. The present
Minister of National Defence, who is aiso the Minister of
Veterans Affairs, is very concerned with the welfare of veterans, and i do not think the veterans have any complaint about
the way he is behaving.
Senator Haidasz: We have had complaints.

TRANSPORT
DE RAILMENT AT MISSISSAUGA-- ACTION TO AVOID SIMILAR
OCCURRENCE

Senator Flynn: I have a reply to questions asked by Senator
Thompson and Senator Godfrey on the train derailment at
Mississauga. Last week both Senator Thompson and Senator
Godfrey asked questions relating to the government's intended
action subsequent to the Mississauga train accident.
I would like to tell Senator Thompson that the date of the
interim "show cause" order to the railways by the CTC was
November 16. At that time the railways were invited to
respond. There have been subsequent meetings, and an interim
order was issued late yesterday by the CTC governing the
makeup of trains carrying toxie and combustible goods. The
railways are now obliged to comply with a directive that
tankers carrying these two types of material be at least 250
feet apart on any freight train.
I would like to confirm, for Senator Godfrey, that the
Maclean's article regarding directives by British Rail is indeed
accurate. It was felt by the CTC that as an interim order,
pending the findings of the special inquiry into rail safety, this
measure would satisfactorily ensure public safety. It is, of
course, possible that specific recommendations regarding the
spacing of tankers, or indeed, whether or not they should travel
on the same trains, will ensue in the report of that inquiry.
The minister is currently studying proposed terms of reference for the inquiry, and expects to make an announcement
later this week.

OLD AGE SECURITY ACT
BILL TO AMEND -SECOND READING

Senator Marshall moved the second reading of Bill C-6, to
amend the Old Age Security Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have been interested in this
bill since its original inception in 1975. It is pleasing to note
that the government, after only a few months in power, has
overcome a serious inequity in the bill, of which those honourable senators who have been interested in the bill since its
inception are certainly aware.
For the most part, I am both pleased and disappointed. I am
pleased because it will include some 5,200 senior citizens who
were not included before. However, I am a little sorry because
it does not include single people in the same age group,
between 60 and 65, who cannot be included at this time.
The provision will affect all those widowed spouses under
the age of 65 who have not remarried and who are in receipt of
the allowance at the time of their spouse's death. Such persons
will be reinstated for receipt of the allowance as of November
1979. From that time on, of course, the extension will apply
automatically in all cases following the death of the pensioner.
[Senator Flynn.]

November 28, 1979

I should remind honourable senators that in 1975 a similar
bill was introduced in the House of Commons by the then
government, which should be commended for implementing a
new situation regarding senior citizens. Unfortunately, even
though the introduction of that amending bill was commendable, whereby the spouse of an old age pensioner aged 65 was
qualified, and the spouse aged between 60 and 64 qualified
also-that was a breakthrough-they forgot the fact that the
under-65 spouse of an over-65 old age pensioner who died was
eut off from the old age pension and forced to rely on the
welfare of the state, or of the province in which she lived.
In 1978, in order to provide an adjustment period, the
government of the day introduced an amendment whereby the
spouse who fell into that category would qualify for six months
after the death of her husband. That was also commendable,
but it left the inequity with which we are still faced after the
introduction of this bill.
The criterion for eligibility will be entitlement to the
spouse's allowance for the month of the death. If the spouse is
eligible, but has not yet received payment, she will not lose her
eligibility. In other words, the spouse of an old age pensioner,
who is between the ages of 60 and 65, will now qualify
continuously after the death of her husband.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. I hope that honourable
senators will not mind my calling the attention of the Senate to
the fact that as I rose there were six conversations taking place
while Senator Marshall was explaining this bill. We do have a
rule, which I do not intend to enforce. It is rule 16 which
reads:
When the Senate is sitting ...
(c) if senators have occasion to speak together, they
shal go below the bar, otherwiseThis is where an obligation is placed on me.
-the Speaker shall stop the business under discussion.
It is not my intention to stop the business under discussion,
and I hope that no one will think that I intervened on this
occasion mercly because I am envious of those who are able to
talk at will on the floor, as I am not.
* (1520)

Senator Marshall: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am sure your
remarks relate to the excellent speech which I am making at
the present time.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Marshall: I should just like to repeat, since I was
interrupted, that the main purpose of the bill is to provide for
those spouses of old-age pensioners a continuation of the single
rate of pension. This, to my mind, is a good step forward in the
consideration by government for the old-age citizens of our
country.
To continue, honourable senators, for persons not now
receiving the allowance who can be reinstated, an application
will be required along with a statement of income. Appropriate
steps will be taken to ensure that former allowance recipients
are aware of the need to re-apply. For persons currently in

November 28, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

receipt of an allowance, when a report is received of a pensioner's death, the spouse's allowance will be automatically recalculated with effect from the following month, using the statement of income provided by the spouse on the joint application
previously submitted by the couple, and eliminating the
income of the deceased pensioner.
As a result of this, the recalculation of the spouse's allowance will:
(a) continue at the same rate if neither spouse had any
income and the maximum allowance was payable;
(b) increase to a higher rate if the pensioner's income
ceased with the death and the spouse has no income or
only a small amount;
(c) decrease to a lower rate if the spouse had income in a
larger amount-which is natural; and
(d) cease to be payable at ail if the spouse has an income
over the level at which entitlement ceases.
The bill provides for a reduction formula based on the
income of the surviving spouse that is somewhat different from
the reduction formula based on the combined income of the
couple. The maximum allowance will be reduced by $3 for
every $4 of monthly income of the surviving spouse until the
OAS equivalent portion is eliminated; and then by $1 for every
$2 of additional monthly income until the GIS equivalent
portion is also eliminated. For example, honourable senators,
the cut-off amount for a married couple is now $9,204 and, for
the single recipient, the cut-off is $3,527.99.
When the combined income of the couple is used, the GIS
equivalent portion of the spouse's allowance and the GIS of
the pensioner are each reduced by $1 for every $4 of monthly
income. As a result of the change, the income level at which
the surviving spouse will cease to have entitlement will be
lower than where the couple's combined income will be taken
into account. This will ensure greater parity between the
surviving spouse and the single widowed or divorced pensioner
receiving a supplement on the basis of his or her own income.
For each subsequent fiscal year, the surviving spouse will be
required to submit a renewal application giving a statement of
his or her income. Again, this is required under the bill as it
presently exists. Each year the old-age pensioner and his wife,
or singly, have to apply for the benefit.
In the years following the death of the pensioner, fluctuations in the surviving spouse's income may result in a higher or
lower allowance. If, for instance, the spouse receives survivor's
benefits following the death of the pensioner spouse, these
payments will have to be taken into account in determining
entitlement to the allowance in the following fiscal year.
The surviving spouse will be permitted to exercise ail the
options provided by the act whereby an estimate of income in
the current calendar year may be substituted for the actual
income of the preceding calendar year. These apply, as you
know, when the applicant bas retired from employment or has
suffered a loss of or reduction in retirement income, and
provides protection against sudden loss of income.

The normal provisions for escalation of benefits on the basis
of the cost of living will continue to apply to the benefits
payable to the surviving spouse. As you also know, the OAS
pension and the GIS are increased quarterly-in January,
April, July and October--if the consumer price index is
increased, and this added protection will be available to the
surviving spouse as well.
You are no doubt also aware that eligibility for the spouse's
allowance is based in part on the completion of a certain
period of residence in Canada. A person who has not completed sufficient residence to be eligible for the full spouse's
allowance may receive a partial allowance related to the total
number of completed years of residence in Canada after the
eighteenth birthday. As you recognize, a person has to have
lived 40 years in Canada after the eighteenth birthday in order
to qualify. This is another amendment that came into effect a
few years ago in order to give a partial income for periods of
residence below that age.
The usual provisions with regard to payment outside of
Canada will continue to affect the extended spouse's allowance. It will be payable for six months following the month of
departure from Canada, and will then be suspended until the
surviving spouse returns to this country. If the surviving spouse
changes his or her residence to another country, the allowance
will be resumed only if residence in Canada is re-established.
In total, therefore, honourable senators, the bill will establish a continued right for the surviving spouse to receive the
spouse's allowance following the death of the pensioner up to
the month in which he or she reaches 65 and becomes eligible
to apply for the OAS pension under ordinary circumstances.
With some slight adjustments in the calculation of entitlement on the basis of income, which are felt to be necessary for
the purpose of equitable treatment of various classes of OAS
beneficiaries, ail of the provisions that apply before the death
of the pensioner will continue to apply to the surviving spouse.
The continuation of the allowance will ensure that the period
prior to age 65 will not be a period of hardship because of the
loss of the spouse's allowance. This, indeed, is the main
purpose of the bill.
What we have here is a bill that makes the best of a
comparatively poor situation. Under this legislation at least
those persons who have been fortunate enough to be eligible
for income support under the spouse's allowance program, and
who have come to depend on that program, will not have to
face the trauma of losing those benefits because their old age
pensioner spouse has died. The compassion shown in this
amendment is obvious. The priority placed on discontinuing
the suspension of the allowance is evidenced by the fact that
neither the cost involved nor the logistics of legislative drafting
have been permitted to delay this change.
In the next fiscal year some 5,200 near-aged widows and
widowers will have greater financial security and be spared the
upset of benefit suspension because of this legislation.
Honourable senators may ask the question which I have
been asking since 1975: What about the others? You may well

SIENATIE DEBATESNvmbr2,17
ask that question, because therc are many other people aged
60 to 65 who neyer were and probably neyer will bc eligible for
the spousc's allowance. The situation of people in this age
group is one of the key issues being examined by the committee of this house headcd by mny goud friend dnd colleague,
Senator Croîl. The report of that eommittee is being anxiously
awaited in ail corners of this country. We con well expeet that
the report of Senator Croll's committee will have a major
impact on the reviess of the retirement inconie nceds of
Canadians in the 1980s, which was announccd in the Thronc
Speech and which is being undertaken by one of the standing
commiitiees of the other place.
*(1530)

1 might also say to members of the Standing Senate Commilice on Health, Welfare and Science, which 1 have the
honour Io now chair, that this is a topie which will inieresi us,
and into which ssc can delve in trying to impress on those in
the other place the need to overcomne discrimination on the
ground of marital status.
The new goverrnment has indicaîed ihai a great deal of
attention and effort will bc devoted to the position of' older
Canadians. 1 am sure ihat the report of' Senator CrolI's
committee will enlighîen us on the problemns we face in ihai
area. This is a move to be applaudcd and encouraged. but il is
long past the time when wc sliould bc dcaling with this subjeet.
The role of this house is bo underiake this kind of study. and
the resuli will be significani, 1 hope. gîven the inîcrest which
we have tradîîîoîially had in such matters. 1 should also
mention the comimitîce headed by Senator MvcGrand. This will
bring to the fore many matiers which Canadians should have
been dcaling with in years gone by.
Ilowever, in leavîng the hypothcîical future and reiurning to
the realîties of the prescrnt, honourable senators, ihis bill lakes
two smnall but signifîcani sîeps toward improving the scope and
protection offcred by the Old Age Security Act. The first
ensures ihat a spouse's allowance recipient may retain access
îo the programi's protection even if the older spouse dies. As
long as the residence and income requiremenis are mei, a
widowcd allowance recipient miay continue to receive the
benefit until death, remnarriage or reaching the age of 65 when
regular OAS benefits becomne pay able.
The second change permits the conîinued payment of OAS
benefils even if the recipient or the recipicnt's spouse is
sentenced to prison for more than 90 days. The suspension of
OAS benefits in these cireumistances had been one of' those
minor but naggîng remnants of the days when OAS was
considcred a privilege raiher than a right, and persons in
prison were, in addition to their incarceration, subject to the
loss of their benefits.
Ilonourable senators, during the debate on second reading
and the discussion in the Commons commitic both which 1
have read carefully-il was suggested that this bill did not go
far enough and that aIl former spouses allowance beneficiaries
ssho had been eut off due to the deaih of their spouse-and
those ssere the people svho, while under the age of 65 had been
relegaîcd Io the mercy of the stale afier their spouse died[5crndtor Mar%

ill

November 28, 1979

since the beginning of the programi should bc reinstated. The
matter swas considered by the govcrinment and a decision was
taken to reinstate aIl beneficiaries who had been eut off
because of the death of their spouse, and who still met the
eligibility requiremenis for spouse's allowance. A similar
extension provision was also decided upon for prisoners sentenced to more than 90 days.
The cosi of these amendments is reasonable and ihe numbers affected arc relaîively few, but they are in need of
assistance. 1 ask honourable senators, therefore, to carefully
consider ihis bill and to raise the important relaîed issues
which îhcy wish to make publie. 1 should also like to say that il
appears cveryihing has been donc under the limitations of thîs
bill. However, we should like to ensure that those who arc
unmarried and between the ages of 60 and 65 are taken into
consideration at a future time so that they mnay be provîded
with the livelihood they deserve as Canadians. Thev are in jusi
as much need.
Under the original bill, 2,200 people werc included. As a
resuli of represeniations mode by memibers of the other place,
and certainly by mnembers of this house, another 3,000 people
wîll be includcd. This mnakes a total of 5,200 Canadians
eligible for benefits. This corrects the inequity which has
existcd for mnany years.
Today 1 was in contact with officiaIs of the Depariment of
National I]ealth and Wclfarc. 1 asked them for a deternmalion of' the importance of' putîing this bill through ils various
stages so that those 5,200 people mnight gel their cheques at a
reasonable time. 1 was told by the officiaIs that if s',c can get
the bill îhrough this week, it would bc possible to issue cheques
l'or Novemiber and Decemiber by Decemiber 12. Honourable

So, I would recommend, ssiîhout trying to impose mny sxill, in
vicw, of the fact that everything has been thrashed oui in the
commnittee proceedings and in the other place, that we dispense
wîth the committee stage and try to have this bill assented bo
this week. In the administrative process, we would probably be
helpful and ihis would ensure that the people who benefit will

1 can only repeai, honourable senators, that 1 recommend
ihat the bill be put through as quickly as possible so that we

Senator Marshall on his sers' lucîd and comprehensive expia-

November 28, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

nation of this bill, and, in particular, on the compassion and
interest he has shown.
I realize that the bill has limitations and that it is just a
small step toward solving problems which pose many questions. Senator Marshall might have the answer to this question, or it might be something that he wishes to delve into
before responding. The Canadian Human Rights Commission
raised some concern about this bill. Was it the concern of the
Canadian Human Rights Commission that, on the basis of sex,
spouses receiving benefits under the bill are female spouses
rather than male spouses?
Secondly, was it a concern that only those in possession of
valid marriage certificates benefit and not those of a common
law relationship or who are single?
Third, was it their concern that the bill discriminated on the
ground of age? I realize that there are senior citizens facing
the difficulties which arise with age, but whom we feel should
get preferential treatment.
Senator Marshall: I understand the Chief Canadian Human
Rights Commissioner wrote a letter to the minister in this
regard. The letter was written on the basis that the bill
discriminated against single people in a particular age group. I
do not know if I can elaborate, but that is my understanding of
the content of his letter.
* (1540)

But I also wondered why, when the Chief Human Rights
Commissioner should know that the bill would get sympathetic
consideration in this house, he did not have the courtesy of
sending us copies of the letter, which I would like to have seen.
I had to get a copy for myself by asking the Department of
National Health and Welfare. However, I understand his
concern related to discrimination against single people.
Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, I want to ask a question regarding the mechanics involved here. Senator Marshall
expressed the hope that this matter could be dealt with this
week, which means presumably, that it would have to be
passed by tomorrow afternoon, if we adjourn as we normally
do on Thursday afternoon. Would not that also mean that we
would have to complete the debate on second reading this
afternoon?
Senator Marshall: It would mean just that. I understand
that two or three senators would like to speak on the bill,
which they have every right to do, and I would like to hear
them. But if we were to dispense with the committee stage, I
see no reason why we should not go straight into third reading
on which, I am sure, there would not be too much debate, and
we could pass the bill today, If that is agreeable to my deputy
leader-and I spoke to him previously.
[Translation]
Senator Leblanc: Honourable senators, I should like to put a
question to Senator Marshall whom I congratulate on his
presentation of the bill before us.
He mentioned that the bill would affect about 5,200
Canadians, if I understood him correctly. He also told us that

the cost would not be prohibitive; still, could we have an idea
of what it might cost? I suppose Treasury Board, or a department such as the Department of National Health and Welfare,
for instance, has estimated its cost for this year.
At the same time, could we find out whether those additional benefits will be indexed, as are the other benefits of the old
age pension plan?
[English]
Senator Marshall: Honourable senators, I have that answer.
The original bill as presented would have cost $4.6 million,
less, of course, those people who were relegated to welfare
after their spouse died and did not continue to qualify. They
would fall on welfare in some cases, and there was a differentiation of about 15 to 18 per cent. As a result of the amendment introduced at the report stage in the house, which would
take in an additional 3,000, the cost would be approximately
$6 million more.
The second question had to do with the taxable income. The
benefits are not taxable unless the recipient's income is over a
certain amount.
Senator Leblanc: Honourable senators, I think Senator
Marshall may not have understood the translation or perhaps I
did not express myself too well but what I was asking is: Are
those benefits going to be indexed as is the old age pension?
Senator Marshall: Yes, they will be indexed on a quarterly
basis as the old age pensions are.
Senator Rowe: Honourable senators, I had not intended to
speak to this bill this afternoon. I was under the impression
that we might be carrying on the normal course of debate.
Consequently, I shail limit my remarks at this time to enunciating one or two principles, not giving too much attention to
details.
First, I congratulate my colleague from Newfoundland,
Senator Marshall, on the very lucid manner in which he has
presented this bill. It is a reform, a social welfare reform; a
modest one, perhaps, in terms of numbers and a modest one in
terms of the expenditures involved. Nevertheless, it is a
reform, and this rejoices my heart, as I am sure it must rejoice
the hearts of all honourable senators in this time of turmoil
and turbulence that we are passing through-economic turbulence, political turbulence of one kind or another and even
international turbulence which affects Canada-when there is
a danger that we can become absorbed in these other matters
to the detriment of our social welfare program, a program
which has placed Canada in the forefront of the nations of the
world.
As a senator, and as a Canadian, I am very happy that at
this particular time the Senate is concerning itself with such
matters as, for example, are being dealt with by Senator
Croll's committee-the report of which all Canada I am sure
is looking forward to in anticipation-and it is also significant
and symbolic that the government, Senator Marshall and
Parliament are able at this time to devote their considerations
to such a matter as this.
It reminds me of how during World War II, when England,
and indeed the free world, as we knew it, was in jeopardy, at a

SENATE DEB\TlISNoebr2,97
time when our resources and especially the resources of the
British people wcre being devoted t0 a lifc-and-death strugglc
against Hitlerism and ail that it stood for, the British people
were able ta engage in a great debate on the future aI
cducation. Indeed. honourable senators will rernemnber that R.
A. B. Butier, President of the Board of Educatian in Britain
and a senior member of the governient of the day. at a tirne
when perhaps most of the world thoughit that England could
flot survive, was able to introduce a bill in the housc which
revolutionized education in Britain. So il givcs me great
pleasure to see that at this tinie we are nol being diverted 100
much by the other great problerrns conlronting us.
Canada, as 1 say, has hiad a great role Io play in the
development of' social welfare. In sorne respects xwe, along with
New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries and one or two
other eountries, have led the worid in this field. 1 have heard
with some trepidation, especially in the last year or so. the idea
expressed that we shoul.l be miodifying family allowanees and
xxe should be doing t
or that to medicare and t0 old age
securit',. I arn alwa , a little suspielous about these things.
When xve start chîeînamg medicare, what does that really
miean? Does it n-!an that we are going to clip the wings, if I
miay miix my nmctaphors, of this great program, a program
w~hici -and 1i
speaking now specifically of medicare--in
ils overal! i'tXct on the Canadian people, is perhaps the
greatest ý,iglc welfare program ever introduced in the history
of' Canada. I trust that we will nol be doing that. I arn not so
naîve as flot t0 recognize tlie fact that we do have abuses in
soine programis such as unemrployment insurance and mnedicare. Corrccting or removing abuses is one thing, but reducing
ýhat program, and seriously curtaiiing other social welfare
programs, is another malter.
* (I5 (n
I arn happy t0 support this bill 10 amend the existing
legislation. and at the same time I express the hope that we
will continue along the palh of progressive legislation in the
social welfare field.
Senator Bird: Honourable senators, first I wish Io thank
Senator Marshall for his able and understanding presenlation
of this important bill. 1 also wish Io draw attention to the
reason whv it is important. To lose the parîner of a lifetime is
the mosî siressful îhing that can happen to a human being.
There is grief, loneliness, and a sense of desolation. If, on top
of that, one suddenly finds that the old age pension, the
guaranteed income supplement, and one's own small spouse s
allowance have gone, îhaî one's whole way of life mnusl change
and that one musl go on public assistance, one faces a worrying situation. I do nol think any honourabie senator can
conceive of what that really wvould be like. None of us have
had to face a situation quile as terrible as that. Therefore, 1
cannot imagine that any honourable senator on either side of
the house could possibly vote against passing this bill.
At tlie same lime, there are two points of' concern thal have
already been raised in this hiouse. 1 amn conccrned about the
point concerning marital stalus that v.as raised by the Canadian Humnan Rights Commissioner. 1 believe il is possible that
[Scnacor Ro.]

November 28, 1979

this bill is in confliet with the Canadian Human Righîs Act,
because it sems Io me ta discriminate against unattachcd men
and womnen betwcen the ages of 60 and 64. This is a malter for
a judge Io decide, but la my mind il is something we must nol
forge t.
I wish t0 mention the plight of unaîîaehed men and women,
asubjeet that was touched on by Senator Marshall, because I
wish t0 make honourable senators understand why I was
worried about thjs malter long before the Chief Human Rights
Commissioner wrote that cItter.
In 1977 there were 56,500 unattachcd women in Canada
between the ages of' 60 and 64 who were living below the
poverty level, and there wcre 20.600 men in the same categary.
It meant that there were over 77,000 people in that age group
who were living below the poverty level. Those people are, of
course, not eligible for OAS. GIS or any spouse's aiiowance.
They are on publie assistance; they are poor, loneiy and old.
Who are îhese people' Many of them arc widows or widowers whosc spouses dicd cither a few days or a few months, or aI
Icast a vcry short time, before they lhemseives reached the age
of 60, so they arc eligibie for assistance. They arc aiso
prernaturely old women who have been divorccd, separaîcd or
deserted, and who have striven Io support their children,
because the poor do have children ta support when the husband is no longer there. Those womien have worked hard ail
their ]ives. They have had very littie chance 10 earn any money
on the side. and thcy receive no heip.
There are aiso those 20,000 oid men, mnany of whorn have
worked ail] their lives for their families. They have workcd aI
arduous jobs, and so that their healîh is no longer good and
îhev can no longer go on working. They are the working poor,
who are oflen aid before their lime.
In this house, wc have aiways been concernied, quite properly, about poverîy-sîricken wornen, because there arc thrcc
limes as many poar womcn over the age of 65, and twa and a
haif limes as many elderly wornen over the age of 60 who are
living below the poverty fine.
1 wish ta make it cicar that the pavcrîy of aid men is just as
greal as thal of aid women. Thcy 100 grievc, thcy 100 suffer,
and îhey 100 are ionely. Il is perhaps significant that the
suicide rate for men in the 60 ta 64 age brackeî is twice that of
women.
There are aiso, in this unattached group, for whieh we can
evidenîly do noîhing, aid men and worncn who have neyer
married, who have iooked after an aged parent, or a brother
who is nat quite able to look after himself. and who have given
a great deal of support ta this country. Yet noîhing is donc for
theni.
Many of those people, particuiariy the womcn in this case,
are poar because women îradilionaily have been in poarly paid
jobs. 1 do flot want ta go into the reasons for that, but we know
that is truc. They have had no discreîionary incarne. They have
spent every cent they earncd on food, shelter and clothing.

malter about wbicb we are ail concernied, tbe inclusion of ail
single people wbo are between tbe ages of 60 and 64 and
deserving of recognition. I bave tbe information tbat an
income-tested benefit, similar to spouse's allowance, if available to ail persons in tbe 60- 10 64-year-old group, would
resolve a numiber of issues of current concern.
Tbe estimated cost of sucb a benefit would bc in tbe area of
$550 million in tbe first year. It is estimated tbaî tbis would bc
offset by about 15 per cent tbrougb reductions of federal
cost-sbaring paymienîs under tbe Canada Assistance Plan.
Witbout going mbt furtber details, it is estimated tbat tbe
immediate implementation of an SPA type of benefit for 60to 64-year-olds would affect approximately 298,000 persons in
1980. Ibat is nearly one-tbird of tbe Canadian population in
tbc 60- Io 64-year-old age group. Tbis is somietbing tbat we in

CUSTOMS TARIFF
THE NEW ZEALAND TRADE AGREEMENT ACT, 1932
AUSTRALIAN TRADE AGREEMENT ACT, 1960
THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA TRADE
AGREEMENT ACT, 1932
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Doody, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Marshall, for the second reading of the Bill C-18,
intituled: "An Act to amend the Customs Tariff and to
make certain amendments to The New Zealand Trade
Agreement Act, 1932, the Australian Trade Agreement
Act, 1960 and The Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Act, 1932". (HonourableSenator McDonald).
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed
that Senator van Roggen speak instead of Senator McDonald?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator van Roggen: Honourable senators, while I have
been on my feet during Question Period on one or two
occasions and in seeking a reference for my committee, this is
the first occasion I have had to speak formally before you since
the new Parliament convened. So, I wonder whether I might
be permitted one or two minutes to offer my congratulations to
the new Speaker, not only because of the affection I have for
him and the relationship I have developed with him as a
member of the Senate during the seven or eight years I have
been here, but in particular because of my great pleasure of
having him as the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs, a committee I had the honour
to chair, during all the years up to His Honour's appointment.
I would not like to let this moment pass without saying what
unfailing assistance he was in that capacity and how much I
benefited from his wise counsel and advice throughout those
years.
If the Leader of the Government in the Senate were here, I
would tell him that my mind goes back to the many times
when he joshed us from the opposition benches and talked
about when he would be the Leader of the Government in the
Senate. He did not know then-and I am sure he did not
anticipate it-that he would also have to shoulder the burdens
of an important ministry, a ministry which, for a lawyer, must
represent the epitome of his career. I certainly trust that the
Deputy Leader of the Government will extend my congratulations to him on the roles he is now fulfilling. I am sure he will
understand if I say that I hope the burdens he now bears will
be lifted from his shoulders if the universe unfolds as it should,
as it may well do in the next short time.
I should also take this opportunity to welcome the new
senators, and say to them that this is surely one of the most
congenial forums for anyone to engage in the important and
fascinating work of government and political process.
Honourable senators, this bill was lucidly explained by
Senator Doody. I certainly do not wish to take up your time by
repeating the descriDtion he gave of the essence of the legisla80072-31

tion. While it is a rather thick bill, you will note it is almost
totally composed of schedules and tariffs. I might, however,
deal with one of its aspects that might cause you some
concern, and that is, the reference to New Zealand, Australia
and the Union of South Africa in the title. That does not mean
it is a bill dealing only with our trade agreements with those
particular countries. Generally speaking, the bill deals with a
negotiation which Canada has conducted under Article
XXVIII of the GATT. This article is not dissimilar from
Article XXIV 6, which you will recall was in the forefront of
some of our discussions some years ago when Britain joined
the European Community, an article under which Britain had
to negotiate with its trading partners suitable payment, not in
dollars but in kind, for the increased benefits it would get by
the harmonization of its tariff structure to that of the European Community.
Article XXVIII, under which these negotiations took place
by Canada, is a similar article which permits you to go outside
the general tariff of GATT and negotiate special tariff
arrangements with a trading partner, so long as a deal is made
with others. This we have done, and these negotiations have
taken place primarily with the United States and the European
Community which are the principle exporters to Canada of the
goods which will now be subject to higher tariffs, in certain
instances, under these new agreements.
The payment Canada in turn made involved a shorter
seasonal period than we had before. So that, while our producers of certain perishables, such as fruits and vegetables will
be protected during that period when their products are
coming on the market in our northern climate, the consumer in
Canada will benefit from a longer period of freer access to
those goods when they are not in season in Canada.
The reason that specific mention is made in the bill of the
trade agreements between Canada, New Zealand, Australia
and the Union of South Africa, is because those agreements
are of long standing and were, in effect, grandfathered, if I
may use that expression, at the time Canada first participated
in the GATT and became a party to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. These agreements, therefore, have been
ongoing and really have their background and history in the
old Empire or British Preferential Tariff. Negotiations are
continuing with Australia and New Zealand relative to these
new tariffs that have now been negotiated so that those
particular agreements will be amended in due course to conform to the new arrangements we have made in these,
negotiations.
The reason they are specifically referred to in this bill is that
they are enshrined elsewhere in Canadian legislation, and it is
necessary to amend that legislation in order to amend the
agreements themselves.
As far as the Union of South Africa is concerned, my advice
is that the government has taken the occasion recently, to serve
notice on the Union of South Africa of the termination of the
Union of South Africa Agreement, which termination date
will be January 26 next. That, of course, will not mean that
the Union of South Africa goods will be precluded from

SENATE DEBATES
coming into Canada, but that they will no longer be coming in
under the special agreement which was an outgrowth of the
British Preferential Tariff.

I thought I would add that little bit of background to what
Senator Doody has already laid before you in introducing the
bill so that you will have an understanding of why the title
reads as it does.
Honourable senators, I certainly do not intend to take up
your time in dealing with the very long schedules attached to
the bill. If individual members of the Senate have an interest
in specific products of the nature of vegetables or fruit, or
other items for that matter, then that, of course, can be
inquired into during the committee proceedings. I do not think
I would even want to attempt it now. I would be quite
incapable of it as there are many hundreds of items involved.
a (1620)
Unless there are questions, honourable senators, there really
is nothing more that I can add at the moment.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, shall I put the
question?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by
the Honourable Senator Doody, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Marshall, that this bill be now read the second time.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?
Senator Doody moved that the bill be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
Motion agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, perhaps I am jumping
the gun here, but it is my impression that the remainder of the
items on the Order Paper are to stand. If that is correct, then
we might spare His Honour the trouble of going through it
item by item; but if it is not correct, then, of course, we are
willing to go ahead.
Senator Buckwold: It was my intention to speak briefly on
Senator Deschatelets' motion concerning the 1.5 litre bottles,
and it may not be possible to do so tomorrow because I have to
catch a flight at an early hour.
HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE
BANNING OF ].- LITRI SOIT DRINK BOTTLES- MOTION TO
REFER SBIECT MATTER TO COMMITTEE-DEtBATE CONTINED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the
motion of Senator Deschatelets:
[Senator van Rogger

November 28, 1979

That the matter regarding the adverse effects on the
Canadian economy of the banning of 1.5 litre bottles from
the soft drink producers in Canada be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science.
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I am very pleased
to have the opportunity to speak in support of this motion. I
regret very much if I am delaying the adjournment of the
Senate, but I hope I shall be able to restrain my remarks so
that it will not be unduly delayed.
First of all, I want to congratulate Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) for raising this issue in his inquiry of an
earlier date, and also to congratulate Senator Deschatelets for
following up with this motion, because in my opinion this is a
matter that is worthy of some consideration by a Senate
committee.
I shall not go into details because they have been dealt with
very capably by other senators who have already spoken on the
matter, but this ban has created a significant problem for the
bottling industry of Canada. It has had very adverse effects on
many bottlers. Certainly in my own area, bottlers have been in
touch with me about it. I am sure all honourable senators
would be amazed at the hundreds of thousands of dollars
involved in this rather arbitrary decision by the Department of
Consumer and Corporate Affairs to prohibit the use of 1.5
litre bottles in the soft drink industry.
For example, I have in front of me a picture of Coca-Cola
plant, in Uxbridge, which is for sale. "A small business,
Canadian-owned bottling plant in Uxbridge with a 'For Sale'
notice-owner unable to carry on because of the ban on the
1.5 litre bottle-capital tied up in uscless inventory and 10 to
20 jobs gone."
In supporting the motion, I am not in any way suggesting
that the decision taken by the department may not have been a
wise one, but I do feel that the industry is entitled to some
public hearing. They have appeared before the minister who, I
believe, is very fair. The Honourable Allan Lawrence has
always had that reputation. I personally believe he is the
victim, as are so many ministers in so many governments, of a
bureaucracy that has made up its mind. It can become very
difficult for a minister to take a decision which may adversely
affect that first decision. I feel rather sorry for Mr. Lawrence
in this particular position. I suggest that there are ways we can
arneliorate the problem.
For example, it seems to me that it would be reasonable to
allow the industry to use up its inventory of bottles which,
across the nation, would run into millions. We went through
the same exercise, honourable senators, when we had the ban
on saccharin. If you recall, this was also referred to a Senate
committee which reviewed the matter. We did not change the
final outcome, but the government at that time did allow
inventories to be used up. A period of time was allowed to
elapse. It seems to me the same kind of approach might
possibly be taken by the department, if they are convinced that
1.5-litre bottles do represent a danger to health. I think that

November 28, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

would be a reasonable approach, and it would allow the
industry to work its way out of this position.
I might remind honourable senators that these bottles have
been used by the industry to a very large degree for about the
last three years. There may have been some injuries caused,
but there have always been injuries from the explosion of
bottles of carbonated drinks. I do not think that that is any
secret. A bottle could be dropped, and the splintering of glass
could be damaging. As a matter of fact, a letter written by the
Honourable Allan Lawrence contains the following:
There is no comprehensive record anywhere of the
number and severity of injuries and property damage
related to exploding pop bottles. It is apparent that the
incidence of cases reported to CCAC jumped very significantly with the media attention given this subject. However, prior to this wide public knowledge, no hospitals or
provincial authorities retained records which would readily identify injuries related to these bottles.
Honourable senators, this may be a problem, and if it is then
certainly I respond to the action of the minister. On the other
hand, the industry itself says that they would like to know
what the department expects of them. They have brought in
some other types of bottles. They have suggested and shown
samples of a corrugated sleeve that would hold two bottles,
which has been rejected, and they have brought in an impact
ring which has been rejected. According to one of the bottiers,
the problem really is-and 1 refer to a note I took from himthat they really do not know what is acceptable. What is
acceptable to the department by normal procedures and tests'?
They have indicated at the provincial level, where there are
also certain standards, that generally their bottles have met
those standards. They find themselves at a loss to know exactly
just what would be the level of safety the government wants.
There is really just this automatic ban.

•

(1630)

I have pointed out the fact that there is serious hardship to
the industry, and that consumers are paying a substantial
amount more by being forced to buy their carbonated drinks in
small bottles. I believe we ail recognize that the larger the
container the lower the price, and users of soft drinks are
paying perhaps 10 per cent or 15 per cent more for the product
in the smaller bottle. That has an adverse effect on the average
consumer.
I support the motion that the matter be reviewed by the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science.
There was some comment on whether that is the right committee, but I believe it is.
In the other house, subjects of this nature, involving consumer affairs, are dealt with by their Committee on Health,
Welfare and Social Affairs. In fact, the minister appeared
before that committee and answered questions on the 1.5-litre
bottle. I suggest, therefore, that Senator Deschatelets is quite
correct in moving that this subject be referred to the Health,
Welfare and Science Committee.

However, before concluding, I should like to indicate my
concern about the wording of the motion moved by Senator
Deschatelets. The motion at present reads:
That the matter regarding the adverse effects on the
Canadian economy of the banning of 1.5 litre bottles from
the soft drink producers in Canada be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science.
Honourable senators, I personally cannot support the wording
of that motion. I have discussed this matter with Senator
Deschatelets, who has agreed to accept an amendment that I
shall propose.
My reason for amending the motion is because it stresses the
adverse effect on the Canadian economy. In my opinion, the
subject is much wider than that. The committee should be able
to look at the adverse effects on the health of the nation. I am
iooking at the matter from the government's point of view. I
believe there should be an overall discussion and study of this
particular subject, rather than one limited to the adverse
effects on the Canadian economy, which, to my mind, represents selfish interests.
Having said that, I move, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Steuart, that the words "adverse effects on the
Canadian economy of"' be deleted. The motion, as amended,
would then read:
That the matter regarding the banning of 1.5 litre
bottles from the soft drink producers in Canada be
referred to the Standing Senate Committe on Health,
Welfare and Science.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is there any discussion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I take it, from
Senator Buckwold's remarks, that the mover of the motion, the
Honourable Senator Deschatelets, is prepared to accept the
suggested amendment. In that case, may I suggest that it is
your pleasure that the motion be "modified" with leave, rather
than formally amended, by deleting the words "the adverse
effects on the economy of"'.
Is that correct, Senator Buckwold?
Senator Buckwold: Yes.
The Hon. the Speaker: With leave, is it agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Marshall: Honourable senators, I rise on a point of
clarification. Senator Buckwold indicated that the bill should
be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science. Would he confirm that it is also a matter
involving corporate and consumer affairs, a subject which falls
within the responsibility of the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce? As chairman of the Health,
Welfare and Science Committe, I have no objection to the
matter being referred to that committee, since it has some-

SENATE DEBATESNvmbr8,19
thing to do with the health of the nation, but 1 wonder whether
the honourable senator could clarify his view that it should be
referred to the Hcalth, Wclfare and Science Conmmittee rather
than the Banking, Tradc and Commerce Committee?
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, basically the problecm is one of health. The bottles have been banncd as a resuit
of an injurious effect on the health of some individuals. 1 have
rcferred to the fact that the matter was deait with in the other
place by a similar committee. It is really not a question of the
economie effcct, although that is an important part of it. That
s one of the reasons why 1 have eliminated that aspect. The
overali subject is rcally one that involves the wcllbeing of
Canadian consumers, rathcr than the economie resuits. For
that reason, it scems quite logical for Senator Deschatelets to
move that the subject be referred to the committec that is so
ably chaired by the honourable senator.
Senator Oison: That is one you didn't expect!
The Hon. the Speaker: Shall 1 put the question as modificd?
Senator Macdonald: Honourable senaturs, 1 have no objection to the amendmcnt, but 1 wish to movc the adjournmrent of

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have the honour to
present the report of the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on supplementary estimates (B) laid before
Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1980, and I
ask that it be printed as an appendix to the Debates of the
Senate and to the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate of

meet before the time of three o'clock. Perhaps he would tel] us
what that is.
Senator Hayden: Yes. If I might explain, the house leader
has laid down for the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee a pretty tough schedule for performance and delivery of
bills before the anticipated Christmas recess. In connection
with Bill C-17, which is the income tax bill, he has indicated a
time limit for the passage of this bill and its journey through
the House of Commons and its ultimate receipt of royal assent.
In the midst of that we are to hear the Minister of Finance
next Wednesday afternoon at 3.30. In the meantime, and in
anticipation of hearing him, we have to have our report ready.
The report is in draft form now.
On Wednesday morning we start in on getting approval of
the report of the committee, and as fast as the pages are
approved they will be delivered to the translator. The translator will be able on that basis to have this part of what we have
to do completed in time for us to have our discussion with the
Minister of Finance. I feel certain that in those circumstances
neither the government leader in the Senate nor the house
leader could possibly raise any objection.
Senator Flynn: You are always most convincing.

QUESTION PERIOD
[Englishj
ENERGY
SECURITY OF FUEL SUPPLIES--POSSIBLE WINTER SHORTAGE

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question to
direct to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce in
respect of reports over recent hours of possible fuel oil shortages this winter.
Honourable senators will recall that on October 23 last the
minister stated, in his usual eloquent fashion:
First of ail, let me put any doubts aside about our
facing an oil shortage this winter. I can assure the honourable senator that we are not going to face an oil shortage
this winterHe said they were "monitoring the situation very closely."
In response to a question from Senator McElman, he went
on to say at page 133 of Senate Hansard:
However, there is no indication that there is going to be
any kind of shortage of that nature in the maritimes in the
coming months or for the next nine months.
Honourable senators, h ask the minister whether there has
been a change in the situation, because on the CTV news at l1
o'clock last night a report was made by that news agency
indicating that "government officiais concede the possibility of
temporary local oil shortages." Then the Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources, the minister responsible for that area,

November 29, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

the Honourable Ray Hnatyshyn, expressed confidence by
saying, "We can get through." He emphasized, however, it is
reported, that ever increasing consumption would be the major
cause of any shortage.
Implicit in that response is the suggestion that the government is not overly confident that there will or will not be an oil
shortage.
I wonder if the minister can provide assurances-and will
repeat the same kind of earlier eloquent assurances-that
there will be no fuel shortage this winter.
Senator de Cotret: I can certainly provide the assurance. I
will do my best to be as eloquent, honourable senators. I would
refer you to the National Energy Board Report of November 2
on the supply situation. That report suggests that the situation
is a tight situation but a manageable situation. There will be
another National Energy Board Report released in early
December. This will be a further update to the November 2
report. There is no indication at this time that there is any
reason to believe that the November 2 report will in any way
be contradicted. There is certainly no cause for panic.
The report on the CTV mentioning a secret document of
some kind is the figment of somebody's imagination, and
certainly not the view of the government that such a situation
prevails.
Senator Perrault: Is it possible for the minister, however, to
confirm that a document has been prepared by certain officials
which would suggest there could be these temporary shortages? If such a document exists, would the minister commit
himself to tabling it in the Senate?
Senator de Cotret: I have just said that to the best of my
knowledge, and after consulting with my colleague, that document is the figment of somebody's imagination. It is very
difficult to table somebody's imagination.
Senator Perrault: May I ask the minister whether, in view
of the fact that his cabinet colleague, the Honourable Ray
Hnatyshyn emphasized that, "ever increasing consumption
would be the major cause of any shortage," is there any kind
of document in existence that may have led Mr. Hnatyshyn to
make that statement?
Senator de Cotret: I will say for the third time that the
document does not exist. To the best of my knowledge there is
no such document, so I cannot see how that statement you are
referring to would suggest it does exist.
Senator Perrault: Is there not a suggestion, however, that it
is dangerous and unwise for any cabinet minister to indulge in
this kind of random speculation, apparently made on a personal basis without any kind of research or documentation behind
it?
Senator de Cotret: Of course not. I think the statement is a
clear-cut statement. If you are looking at the supply situation
and the depletion of that supply situation over time, the major
threat to the supply position is the very rapid rate of consumption of oil reserves. That is what the minister was referring to.
We are consuming at very high rates.

Senator Perrault: The minister, however, told us that no
document or no study has been prepared, that no study or
report exists which inspired the remarks of the Honourable
Ray Hnatyshyn.
I would remind honourable senators, that the minister stated
a few days ago that the situation was being monitored closely.
What form is the monitoring taking? What kind of material is
being sought and who is the custodian of the monitoring
material?
Senator de Cotret: Again, I have a lot of difficulty keeping
up with these questions. I seem to be repeating myself time
and time again.
In answer to your first question, I referred to the National
Energy Board Report of November 2. I told you that there was
going to be a follow-up report in the early days of December.
The monitoring is obviously being done by the National
Energy Board, and it is being done on an ongoing basis. The
government is being apprised of the findings of that board.
Senator Olson: Honourable senators, there has been a shift
in the position of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources
which would indicate at least the possibility of spot shortages
or temporary shortages since the same statements were made
three or four weeks ago which were echoed or repeated by the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Can the minister tell us what basis the Minister of Energy,
Mines and Resources has for making that shift in his position?
Senator de Cotret: I do not accept the basic premise of the
question. There is no shift.
*

(1420)

Senator Perrault: Obviously this is a sensitive point with the
ministry, the government and supporters of the government. I
can understand that, because they have made a commitment
that there would be no shortage of oil supplies. Yet one of the
responsible Conservative ministers in the Province of New
Brunswick stated recently, to use his words, "the supply is very
fragile." We on this side are concerned about the people in the
maritime provinces, the Atlantic provinces, and other parts of
Canada, who are concerned about a cold, hard winter without
adequate fuel supplies. If the honourable senator can be so
blasé about the plight of his fellow maritimers, then I am
surprised and shocked.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Smith (Colchester): The Honourable Leader of the
Opposition has the greatest capacity to shock himself with
straw men that I have yet observed. He has raised as a strawSenator Perrault: Is that a point of order?
Hon. Senators: Order, Order!
Senator Smith (Colchester): Just a moment, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition was completely out of order. I
did not hear my honourable friend opposite complain about
that.
Senator Olson: Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise a point of
order-

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I was
about to raise a point of order, which is that when an honourable senator is on his feet to ask a question of a minister, that
is what he should do. If he so far departs from the rules of
order to attack another honourable senator, in a vigorous and
unjustified assault, then that other senator surely has the right
to reply. That is what I was exercising.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Any time that an honourable
senator attacks me, he might expect me to reply, if the rules
permit me.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I appeal to the
essentially fair-minded nature of this assembly. I had made a
statement in defence of the people of this country who are
concerned about fuel ail supply, particularly those Canadians
in the maritime provinces. Senator Smith intervened in an
almost uncouth manner to attack what I said. I appeal to
honourable senators: surely we have the right to defend ourselves in this chamber!
Senator Smith (Colchester): That is exactly what I was
asserting, and what I continue to assert.
I was also interested in bringing to the attention of the
Leader of the Opposition the fact that he was manufacturing
an attack upon the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources
when he said that there had been a shift in the minister's
intentions or beliefs, and the Leader of the Opposition quoted
an alleged assertion as evidence of a shift in his belief. It is
perfectly obvious, to anyone who thinks about it, that the
minister's comment was in reply to a question. Anyone would
answer a question as to what would be the most likely cause of
a shortage by explaining that the use of oil, which was
increasing at a very rapid rate, was likely to be such a cause, if
it did exist.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, may I direct a
question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate? Has
the Honourable Senator Smith been engaged on a full-time
basis to act as a defence man for the ministry, answering on
behalf of the government in this chamber? Secondly, can the
Leader of the Government in the Senate tell us what valid
point of order was raised by his honourable friend and colleague in the chamber a few moments ago?
Senator Flynn: The Honourable Leader of the Opposition
should realize that he is making a circus of this place in the
way he proceeds with his question. This is sheer provocation.
The Leader of the Opposition gets only what he deserves.
Senator Perrault: At this point I think we had better cease
trying to impress upon the government how they seem to have
disregarded their professed concern for free speech and parliamentary rights.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
STATEMENT ON SITUATION IN IRAN

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I wonder if I might
ask the Minister of State for CIDA whether there is any
[Senator Oison.]

November 29, 1979

updated information available with respect to the situation in
Iran, particularly as it relates to the status of Canadians in
that country, and any Canadian initiatives leading to further
successes in the resolution of that difficult situation.
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: I would say in summary that the Canadian
government, through the Secretary of State for External
Affairs, has succeeded in obtaining a response to its appeal for
solidarity from at least 45 countries as concerns the situation
in Iran.
In fact, all members of the Commonwealth met in London
and passed a joint resolution in support of the Canadian
government initiative. Miss MacDonald has also met the
ambassadors of French-speaking countries. They have given
her the assurance that they will report to their respective
government. Moreover, some of them have already notified
Miss MacDonald that they have made representations to the
Iranian authorities to put an end to this extremely difficult
situation.
We know that the safety of our embassy staff is not in
jeopardy and that the Canadian ambassador insists on remaining in Iran. He sends us reports about new developments
nearly every hour. However, we were told this morning that
the situation seems to be getting more tense, but the Canadian
ambassador is taking all possible steps. He is meeting every
day with the ambassadors of other countries to make the
representations required so that we may finally have every
confidence that this conflict will be settled as soon as possible.

NATIONAL DEFENCE
PURCHASE OF NEW FIGHTER AIRCRAFT

Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Minister of National Defence, and I
shall do so through the Minister of State for CIDA.
I should like to have the costs to date with respect to the
selection and procurement of a new combat aircraft for
Canada, and I should like to have that answer in two parts. I
would like the first part to concern itself with the cost up until
the so-called production of the short list, and the second part
to relate to the cost since that short list was produced.
I should also like to know whether it is the intention of the
Canadian government to change the role that has been
assigned to the Canadian Wing stationed in Baden-Solingen,
West Germany, in order that the role wili meet the capabilities
of the new aircraft.
Finally, I should like to know at what date we can expect
delivery of the first new combat aircraft.
Senator Asselin: As honourable senators will appreciate, I
am not an expert in this area. and for that reason I shall take
the question as notice. I shall inquire of the Minister of
National Defence in this regard, and provide honourable senators with a statement at a later date.

November 29, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator McDonald: May I ask a further supplementary? Is
it the intention of the government to bring about a new review
of defence policy before that purchase takes place?
[Translation]
Senator Asselin: Honourable senators, it was suggested
recently that the Minister of National Defence might make
such proposals to the Committee on External Affairs, but no
final decision has been made.

MULTICULTURALISM
AWARD OF RESEARCH CONTRACTS

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Mr. Orest
Kruhlak, director of multiculturalism programs for the government, is reported in today's Globe and Mail as having said
that he awarded a contract without tender to Decima
Research Ltd., which is owned by a prominent Conservative.
e (1430)
My question is: Was Mr. Kruhlak's statement an act of
chivalry on his part to shield the Minister of State for Multiculturalism from an embarrassing situation, or has the minister relinquished responsibility for the administration of such
important contracts to civil servants?
Senator Flynn: I shall have to take this question as notice.
Senator Bosa: Will the Leader of the Government also
inquire as to why these contracts were let without tender, and
whether Decima Research has been in existence long enough
to warrant the confidence of the department in awarding such
a large contract.
Senator Guay: In view of the fact there have been two
contracts given to that same firm, would the Leader of the
Government look into the situation surrounding the previous
contract while seeking an answer to the question that Senator
Bosa asked?
Senator Flynn: I will.
Senator Haidasz: As a supplementary, would the Leader of
the Government clarify for honourable senators whether it is
now a regulation that no contract over and above $20,000 can
be approved by any public servant, but that it must be
approved by the Treasury Board and the minister involved?
Senator Flynn: I shall take that as notice. I am not aware of
that.
[Translation]
SUPPLY AND SERVICES
CONSTRUCTION OF ICEBREAKER-AWARD OF CONTRACT

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, may I put a question to the government leader?
Senator Flynn: Yes.
Senator Marchand: I know the government has just awarded a contract for the construction of an icebreaker, and that

80072-32

the contract was awarded to someone outside Quebec at a time
when there is a lot of unemployment at the Lauzon shipyard.
This shipyard is the one which has the most expertise in the
construction of icebreakers.
I can understand that reasons of economics can be invoked
but, on the other hand, I know that one of the first goals of the
federal government is to try to alleviate regional disparities.
So, to achieve that goal, it often has to act in a way which,
strictly from an economic standpoint is more or less justifiable
while being very much so socially.
I therefore ask the Leader of the Government whether he is
aware of how this contract was awarded, and if consideration
was given to the fact that, in the Lauzon region, unemployment is excessively high at this time.
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, in order to give a more
detailed answer, I shall enquire from my colleague, the Minister of Supply and Services. However, for the benefit of the
honourable senator, I can say that I have had the opportunity
of discussing the problem of the Lauzon shipyards with my
colleague. So, if to date some of the contracts have been
awarded elsewhere, it was basically because there was a
substantial difference in the cost.
I recognize, on the other hand, that in certain cases allowances have to be made for special circumstances such as
unemployment. I can assure you, honourable senators, that I
shall make representations to the Minister of Supply and
Services with a view to finding work for the Lauzon shipyards.
Senator Marchand: On a supplementary. I can understand
that economic or financial reasons can be given but, if we stick
to that principle, then we should have all the shipyards in
Canada disappear. Everyone knows that ships can be built at a
much lower cost in Sweden, in Germany and even in Japan.
So, if we maintain a few shipyards, it is for some reason other
than economic. I therefore feel that, at this time, it would have
been highly desirable for that contract to have been awarded
to Lauzon.
Senator Flynn: I would point out to the honourable senator
that the margin was not very wide. The reasons he put forth in
favour of awarding a contract to a shipyard where there is a
lack of orders, with the result that many persons are unemployed, are legitimate. However, when there is a substantial
margin between two Canadian shipyards, I suggest it is not
difficult to justify the contract being given to the much lower
bidding shipyard.
Senator Marchand: Could you inquire as to the margin
between the two bids?
Senator Flynn: Yes, certainly. I understand you are talking
particularly of icebreakers?
Senator Marchand: Yes.
Senator Flynn: I know for sure that in another contract, the
margin was several million dollars. However, you should know
the policies of this government are quite different from those
of the former government.

SENA TE DEBATES

[En glish]
Senator McElman: I have a further supplementary. The
Leader of the Government appears to be familiar, in general
terms, with the spread as between the Ontario firm that was
awarded the contract and the shipbuilding yard in Quebec. Is
he equally aware of what the spread may have been between
the successful firm and Saint John Shipbuilding which is one
of the foremost shipyards in the nation in building this type of
vessel, and one that has proved its competence over the last
few years to the degree that it has been admired by all parts of
the nation? Is he familiar with what the general spread might
have been there?
Senator Flynn: No, I am not familiar with the exact spread
concerning the ice breaker. As far as the ice breaker is
concerned, I was mentioning another contract. I am aware of
the spread between the different bidders, but I will inquire and
let my honourable colleague know the exact situation. I do
agree that the Saint John Drydock has a good reputation, as
has also Davie Shipbuilding in Lauzon.
Senator Macdonald: And Halifax Shipyards.
Senator Flynn: My colleague mentions Halifax Shipyards
also.
Senator McElman: It is not in the same league with New
Brunswick. I just wanted to ensure that while the Leader of
the Government is making these inquiries, he will include the
reference with respect to the Saint John Shipbuilding and Dry
Dock Company.
Senator Flynn: What about Vancouver?
PENITENTIARIES
MEDICAL RESFARCH RESPECTING INMATFS

Senator Thompson: I should like to ask the Leader of the
Government whether, in the past 10 years, there has been any
research organization or individual, funded by Canadian or
foreign sources, which or who is carrying out medical research
within federal penitentiaries concerning the behavioural
changes caused by giving drugs to prisoners while in custody. I
should also like to know whether electric shock treatment has
been given to any inmate of a federal penitentiary over the
past 10 years. If so, by what doctor was it administered, in
what institution, and when?
Senator Flynn: Obviously I shall have to take that question
as notice.
SPORTS
WORLD JUNIOR HOCKEY TOURNAMENT

Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, on November 27,
the Leader of the Government in the Senate was courteous
enough to respond quickly to my question concerning the
withdrawal of the Canadian hockey team from the World
Junior Hockey Championship to be held in Finland, and I
expressed my appreciation for his prompt reply. You can
understand my astonishment when, the very next day, it was
[Senator Flynn.]

November 29, 1979

announced that the Peterborough Petes, a team from the
Ontario Major Junior Hockey AssociationSenator Asselin: And a good team.
Senator Buckwold: Yes, a very good team, and I understand
that it will be supplemented by some excellent players from
Ottawa. The team has now announced to the CAHA that it
will be going. It was really a derogatory position for our
hockey people to be in, and so I was delighted to hear that the
team will be going.
Senator Asselin: Because of the intervention of the Senate?
Senator Buckwold: I would like to think that had something
to do with it. I might comment that we heard from the
distinguished minister that the managing director of the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation had criticized Canada's withdrawal from the tournament. He is reported to have said:
a (1440)
It is incredible that Canada says it doesn't have enough
money to send a team to the Junior World Hockey
ChampionshipsThere was a difference of just a few hours between the reply
and this new announcement. Was the Minister of State for
Fitness and Amateur Sport aware of what was going on? Was
his office involved in this new decision, or was he ignored?
Would the government now consider making at least some
contribution in order to relieve the load on the Canadian
Amateur Hockey Association and others who will be contributing financially, bearing in mind that when the CAHA
contributes from its own funds it is really taking funds from
the minor leagues, who in turn get help from their financial
sponsors?
If I may repeat my question: Would the Leader of the
Government again use his good offices to implore the Minister
of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport to make some contribution and get the federal government department involved in
this important tournament?
Senator Flynn: I will be pleased to communicate the honourable senator's comments to the minister. I have here a reportI doubt that you are aware of it-that the team's transportation costs will be borne by the Canadian Amateur Hockey
Association and the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League. I
don't know if there is a possibility of a contribution being
made by the Canadian government, but I would remind Senator Buckwold that the decision not to include any amount in
this year's budget was a decision of the former government.
Senator Buckwold: I am not debating that point. I am
simply asking, in view of the fact that the Peterborough Petes
will be going to the tournament, and the trip will be difficult to
finance, whether the federal government might give some
support, as it has in the past?
AGRICULTURE
POTATO CROP IN EASTERN CANADA

Senator Argue: Honourable senators, I should like to direct
a question to the Secretary of State for Economic Develop-

November 29, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

ment. This arises out of a visit I had the honour to make on
Monday and Tuesday of this week to the province of New
Brunswick. There I learned at first hand of the disastrous
conditions affecting the potato industry of that province and of
eastern Canada generally. I refer to a very severely depressed
market-some quote as little as 2 cents a pound for potatoesand a disastrous year generally, following a previous year of
disaster.
My question is: Can an announcement be made soon that
stabilization payments for the 1978 crop will be forthcoming,
and that stabilization payments for the 1979 crop will be
forthcoming? Further, will the government look at the fact
that many producers have potatoes rotting in storage because,
as I understand it, of the particular climatic conditions being
experienced this year.
It is a much greater disaster for those farmers who face the
possibility of losing their entire crop than it is for those who
are suffering from a depressed market. This is an important
matter. I have the information at first hand. I would appreciate anything the minister might do, including taking the issue
up with his colleagues.
Senator de Cotret: I appreciate the question, honourable
senator, and I will take it up with my colleague, the Minister
of Agriculture. I hope to be able to respond in the very near
future to the three questions you have raised.
INCOME TAX
MORTGAGE INTEREST AND PROPERTY TAX CREDIT

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
Time and time again this government has pledged its enduring respect for parliamentary traditions. There was a report in
the media yesterday-I presume it must have been incorrectwhich stated that the government house leader in the other
place said:
-property tax deduction forms will be mailed out to 15
million Canadians next week with 1979 income tax packages even though the tax credit bill has not yet cleared
Parliament.
Surely, honourable senators, this cannot be true. This measure
has not been before the Senate in any formal way, and surely
the government does not intend to distribute these forms with
this deduction clearly set out in them. Can the government
deny these reports?
Senator Flynn: Actually, I will confirm the statement made
by the government house leader in the House of Commons to
the effect that forms by which the proposed tax credit may be
claimed have been printed. That has been done for the very
reason that it is the custom to send out these forms at this time
of the year. If they are not sent out it will be impossible to
make refunds in the proper and ordinary way.
The simple fact is that if Parliament does not approve this
legislation, the part concerning this deduction will not be
applicable, and an information program will have to be

launched for the purpose of informing Canadian citizens that
Parliament has not accepted this legislation. If it is adopted,
however, some time in January or February, and the deduction
then becomes available to taxpayers, the machinery will be in
place. It would have been impossible simply to wait and not
make these arrangements. This is nothing new, and I do not
think the Leader of the Opposition would suggest any other
procedure.
Senator Perrault: May I suggest to the honourable leader,
however, that the government, had they been concerned about
producing sound legislation in this area, might have considered
giving this measure the very highest priority when it first
called Parliament together in October, and accorded it the
attention it obviously deserves and should be given by both
houses of Parliament.
Honourable senators, I want to ask the Leader of the
Government another question. The government house leader in
the other place is reported to have stated also that no amendments to this measure will be tolerated. Surely it is not the
attitude of the Leader of the Government in this house that the
Senate shall be debarred from attempting to amend this
measure, or that the Senate shall be encouraged to leave this
measure absolutely intact under some sort of pressure from the
other side?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, in the first place I
should like to remind Senator Perrault that first reading of Bill
C-20 took place on October 29. That is close to a month ago.
The bill has been debated on several occasions-I think on at
least five days-up to now. The responsibility for the delay,
therefore, is certainly not that of the government.
The second thing I should like to point out is that what the
government house leader in the other place said with regard to
amendments was that minor amendments would possibly be
accepted, but that major amendments would create a terrible
problem with particular regard to the question of income tax
forms. That is all he said.
Amendments might be made next year, but this legislation
is intended to be applicable in the current calendar year as far
as taxpayers are concerned.

e

(1450)

Senator Perrault: Has the Leader of the Government urged
his colleagues in the other place to get this bill to the Senate as
quickly as possible? I ask that question because last night in
the other place the opposition parties urged an immediate vote,
and members of the government stated that they had speeches
they wanted to make before the measure was passed. Certainly
the Leader of the Government cannot now suggest that there
has been a hold-up by the opposition in the other place.
Senator Flynn: I did not suggest that there was a hold-up. I
said that it has taken time up to now. I would refer to the fact
that it has been debated for five days, mostly by members of
the official opposition in the other place. As far as the Senate
is concerned, my understanding is that there was a study of the
subject matter of this bill in the committee this morning. Am I
correct in that?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Hayden: That is right.
Senator Flynn: If I am correctly informed, an agreement has
been reached that a vote will be taken on this bill next
Tuesday, and if it reaches us next week it will be possible to
deal with it promptly, especially since it has been pre-studied
here.
Senator Oison: I should like to ask the government leader if
he subscribes to the statement made by the house leader in the
other place, or the Minister of Finance, that no amendments
will be tolerated. If that is so, I don't quite sec the point of
having any study.
Senator Flynn: Again I say that was not the statement of
the government house leader in the other place. He did not say
amendments would not be tolerated. He said that the government would accept minor amendments, but that major amendments would create a very difficult problem as far as the
income tax forms are concerned. That is what he said. If the
other place wants to defeat the bill, that is up to them. If the
Senate wants to reject the bill, there will be an opportunity to
do so. Nobody is preventing it. We simply say that it would be
difficult to change the bill substantially at this time. But if you
want to do it, do it. If you want to create chaos, do so. There is
nothing preventing you from acting in any way, shape or form
that you think you should. You are entirely free to do so.
Senator Oison: We know that, but it seems to me that
introducing a bill, and even having the subject matter of the
bill referred to a committec--which is really the place to
examine a bill and make suggestions for amendment-and
then coming along and saying that no amendment of any
substance will be tolerated because of these other reasons, is a
bad way to proceed.

Senator Flynn: No, no. Again

I deny that this was said.

NATIONAL UNITY
QUEBEC WHITE PAPER ON SOVERLIGNTY ASSOCIATION REFERFNDUM-CONSTITUTIONAI
OPTIONS

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Minister of Justice.
Since Quebecers have a recognized right to know what will
happen before and after the referendum in Quebec, and since
the Quebec government white paper states, and I quote:
... a positive answer, democratically expressed under the
eyes of the international community, would force Ottawa
and the rest of Canada to react in the same democratic
way ...
I should add that logic would have it that the Canadian
government also hold its own referendum, and I ask why this
government decided not to consult the people, why it is denying the rest of Canada the right given Quebecers by their
provincial government.
Senator Flynn: The government's decision not to put forward again the legislation that died on the order paper at the
end of last session has been explained a number of times. We
[Senator Flynn.]

November 29, 1979

feel that this kind of situation, before a Quebec referendum,
would be sheer provocation. It would be an insult to the
intelligence of Quebecers because they are quite capable of
deciding for themselves.
There is no need to consult the rest of the country at this
point if Quebecers, as I am confident they will do, reject the
constitutional proposai of the current Quebec government. But
if unfortunately-and this is purely hypothetical-if unfortunately they were to approve that proposai, it would then be
very easy to consult the people, as it would be for provincial
governments to do so.
I have the conviction that, in the case where it might be
beneficial to hold a federal referendum, and also provincial
ones, we would have the support of the official opposition to
put the system in place without delay.
As I said, we are confident that Quebecers will know how to
answer the question, they will understand it whatever formulation Mr. Claude Morin deems fit to bring out.
Senator Lamontagne: If my understanding is right, the
Minister of Justice in no way precludes the possibility of
holding a referendum in the rest of Canada?
Senator Flynn: If you wish. This is purely hypothetical. I am
telling you at this point I am convinced this will not be needed.
We shall decide in due time. If this came to be needed, it
would be considered.

QUEBC WHITE PAPER ON SOVEREIGNTY ASSOCIATIONCANADA-UJNITI STATES AUTO PACT

Senator Lamontagne: Again about the white paper, I now
wish to ask a question to the Minister of State for Economic
Development.
Is it truc, as stated in this white paper, that, I quote:
The auto pact between Canada and the United States
made it possible to concentrate nearly 90 per cent of
automobile production in Ontario, with ail the advantages
of subcontracting.
Senator de Cotret: This assertion was made not only in the
white paper but in several other studies concerning the auto
pact. If my memory serves me well, I think that the Reisman
report on the auto pact underlined that this pact had a certain
influence in that field but that it did not connect the geographic distribution of the automobile industry. However, it is just
one of many factors.
Senator Lamontagne: Is it not true that way over 90 per
cent of the automobile industry has been located in Ontario
since the advent of the automobile?
Senator de Cotret: Way under 90 per cent?
Senator Lamontagne: Over.
Senator de Cotret: Way over 90 per cent, I shall have to
check, I do not know.

CRIMINAL CODE
ABORTIONS-REPORT OF STATISTICS CANADA

Senator Haidasz: I should like to direct a question to the
Minister of Justice, who is responsible for the administration
of the Criminal Code.
In view of the recent report of Statistics Canada that in
1978 there were performed in Canadian hospitals 62,290
therapeutic abortions, which means a rise of 8.2 per cent in
one year alone, would the Minister of Justice investigate this
appalling upward trend, as it is unbelievable that the health of
Canadian women has deteriorated so much at this time of
good health conditions in our country?
Senator Flynn: I will certainly look into those figures. I was
not aware of them.
ABORTIONS--BRIEF OF CAMPAIGN LIFE CANADA

Senator Haidasz: May I ask the minister a supplementary
question? Has he received a brief from the Campaign Life
Canada, a national anti-abortion group which visited Parliament Hill last Thursday? If so, what is his reaction to it?
Senator Flynn: I do not specifically remember that brief. I
know that I have received much correspondence on that isshe,
but, as you know, in practice the administration of this provision of the Criminal Code is a provincial responsibility because
hospitals are under provincial jurisdiction.
However, I have received briefs and, although I cannot
identify the one to which the honourable senator refers, if he
wishes me to I will look into the matter.

I had an opportunity, honourable senators, to check the
figures. Of course, the federal government spent $129.1 million during fiscal year 1978-79 on the Canadian forest industry. Those funds came from nine departments, including
DREE, Environment Canada, Indian Affairs and Northern
Development, and Energy, Mines and Resources. I was also
told that estimated expenditures for fiscal 1979-80 totalled
$196.1 million.
I hope to be able to give Senator Robichaud more information but, if he likes, he might want to meet with a CIDA
officiai who could give him more details.
As to the CIDA program in Honduras, that program
includes a credit line of $12 million to be made available
interest free to the Honduran government organization, the
Honduran Forest Development Corporation, to enable it to
purchase Canadian equipment. That corporation also gets a
$2.9 million grant from CIDA under a technical and training
assistance program. Other projects in the forest industry in
Honduras include a $1.2 million grant for an inventory of
hardwood resources in Honduras and a $1.2 million grant for
financing a fire protection program, in co-operation with the
Government of New Brunswick.

Honourable senators, I should like to give notice to my good
friend the Leader of the Opposition that because of officiai
business I will be obliged to be away from the Senate for two

SENATE DEBATES

the Senate that we could not, within our present terms of
reference, really go very far into that, because the terms of
reference now are confined to the Northern Gas Pipeline.
I should like to say a few words regarding the other matter-that is, that the committee be authorized to examine and
report upon the enhanced recovery technology of petroleum
and natural gas. I was going to make a speech regarding this
enhanced recovery technology in the debate initiated by Senator Manning when he spoke about a national energy policy for
Canada. It seems to me that in the four main considerations he
outlined there is one, on the supply side at least, that in my
view stands out as holding the greatest potential for Canada's
becoming self-sufficient quickly. That is in this technique of
enhanced recovery from existing oil fields. This should not, in
my view, in any way diminish the exploration activities that
are going on, whether they are in the great Canadian sedimentary basin, western Canada, the North, or offshore in eastern
Canada.
I believe that insufficient attention has been paid to these
enhanced recovery techniques. Therefore, it would be useful
for a public forum to be set up to pull together the experts and
have them state their opinion on what the potential is under
the enhanced recovery techniques, and also to give us some
indication of the cost of the secondary recoveries. I do not wish
to go into the detailed figures, because I think that ought to be
left to the committee.
I should like to elaborate on this. Our average recoverability
of light crude oil in western Canada from known fields at the
present time is approximately 30 per cent, or perhaps slightly
more than 30 per cent. We also know that that has increased
significantly during the past 10 years, perhaps by as much as
10 per cent. That would mean that recoverability has grown
from slightly over 20 per cent of the oil known to be there to
slightly over 30 per cent of the oil known to be there.
This has many facets. First of all, there are some enhanced
technologies that have been applied, such as water flooding,
injections of heat, injections of other gases-CO, is one-but
there are other materials and gases that can be injected into
these formations to enhance what we call the enhanced recovery amounts.
It seems to me that we ought to hear from some of the
people who have made these highly technical studies, not only
those from Canada but those who have conducted such studies
in other places around the world. We should obtain their
opinion as to what can be done.
I can give you some figures today from bodies such as the
National Energy Board and the Canadian Petroleum Association, and from several of the larger companies that are
involved in enhanced recovery technology but you will see
from the figures that they are very far apart in their estimates.
Indeed, the technology or the state of the art is changing so
rapidly that we really have to have an update on it.
* (1520)

I also believe it is fair to say that we really need to have, or
at least be part of, an information service, or an educational
service-whatever you wish to call it-so that Canadians will

better understand how much crude oil and natural gas Canada
does have. I refer to known discoveries. It is not a matter of
doing a lot of high risk exploratory work looking for new oil or
gas fields. This is gas and oil already known to exist. It is a
matter of how much we can get to the surface and can use.
To get back to the figures, and to put the matter in
perspective, according to the Canadian Petroleum Association
the estimated established remaining and recoverable reserves
from conventional oil fields, as of January 1, 1978, was 5.970
billion barrels. Estimates from the provinces put the amount at
something like 6.116 billion barrels; and the National Energy
Board puts the amount at 5.782 billion barrels. So they are not
very far apart. The known amount of oil that can be recovered
under presently applied technology is around six billion
barrels.
In addition, one large company, Amoco-a company known
to senators-believes that there is an additional amount of oil
in those fields of 3.75 billion barrels. Gulf Oil estimates the
figure at 2.8 billion barrels; Imperial Oil at 1.5 billion barrels;
and the Canadian Petroleum Association at 2.5 billion barrels.
The National Energy Board puts the amount of light crude oil
at anywhere between 300 million and 1.6 billion barrels. With
regard to heavy crude oil, the estimates go all the way from
820 million additional barrels to two billion barrels.
There is an interesting field in the Lloydminster, Saskatchewan and Alberta, area where, according to the National
Energy Board, the amount varies from 580 million barrels to
2.24 billion barrels, all of which can be brought into production and used with some enhanced recovery techniques.
Much of the technology for bringing this oil to the surface
for use is already known. Therefore, it is not a case of being
totally reliant on research people coming up with new technology. One problem is that each time some new technology is
applied to increase the recoverability of this oil, costs go up. So
it seems to me that we first have to advise ourselves and then
the Canadian people that there is a price which has to be paid
for bringing this oil onstream, and that the more we take out
of any field, the more expensive it becomes, because of the cost
of using that technology.
I shall not try to discuss today the point about who gets a
share of any increased oil prices. I had considered discussing it,
but possibly earlier in the session I did make a speech along
that line. We need to assure Canadians that we have sufficient
oil and gas in this country, excluding oil from the tar sands. If
we include oil from the tar sands, then we have enough oil for
400 or 500 years. But that is not the kind of recovery about
which I am speaking, but, rather, what we can get as a
reasonable price for oil recovered from the tar sands, plus all
the rest of the oil that is known and already in place. We are
not likely to run out of oil in Canada either in this or the next
generation.
We have to inform ourselves, and the Canadian people as a
whole, that the additional amounts of recovery from those oil
fields will mean increasingly higher prices. We should get
ourselves into a position where we can make use of that oil.

SENATE DEBATES
The day has gone when we could rely only on the so-called
cheap portion of the light crude oil to which we had become,
and still are, accustomed. I refer not only to the light crude oil
from Canadian production, but also the same kind of light
crude oil and relatively low cost production which we bring in
from the Middle East and Venezuela.
1do not wish honourable senators to get the idea that we are
going to become technical experts on enhanced recovery methods. It is a highly technical field and, indeed, the technique is
different for almost every oil field in North America. Some oil
formations respond to water flooding. Others respond well to
an injection of steam or heat to loosen the oil and bring it to
the surface in a liquefied condition. There are other techniques, such as the injection of CO, or other gas, which
encourage production.
I do not pretend to be an expert, and I do not believe we
shall have become experts after we have completed the proposed study. We would bring before the committee experts
who would be asked for their opinion on how soon the secondary recovery techniques could be applied. We could also
inquire as to the cost, because the cost per barrel of bringing
this oil to the stage of consumer use varies just as widely from
one company to another as the estimate of the amount
available.
In my view, it would be a useful exercise to have the
committee study this matter. I would not be impressed by
anyone suggesting that the Senate should not do this because
the matter is already being considered by the Department of
Energy, Mines and Resources and by the National Energy
Board, or that the Energy Conservation Board of Alberta is
doing a great deal of work on this. Certainly those bodies are
making those studies, I do not question that fact for one
moment. However, I do sec a serious lack of understanding, on
the part of Canadians, of the amount of oil we have and the
potential cost of bringing it to the surface so that it can be
used by consumers.

e

(1530)

I do not want to say very much about natural gas, because
there are no up-to-date figures. The National Energy Board
has been taking evidence on this for several months now, and a
report is due within the next few weeks. From my observations, and discussions with people in Alberta who do understand these reserves calculations, I believe there will be a
significant increase in the estimated amount of accessible
reserves. We will have additional gas to supply many of the
users who have been using imported crude, and probably a
great deal for export besides.
The gas industry in Alberta has been shutting down or going
into a state of dormancy as far as new exploration and
development is concerned simply because of a lack of markets.
Honourable senators will understand that it is difficult, to say
the least, for the independent and smaller gas companies to
continue adding natural gas to their inventories of reserves
when they do not have a cash flow from some market to take
care of the costs.
[Senator Olson.]

November 29, 1979

On the oil side, it seems to me there is so much more in the
known oil fields that we need only find a way of extracting it.
Certainly it is there, and we know now that if we spend enough
money, we can get at it. We need to readjust some of our tax
incentives to encourage companies to invest in enhanced recovery. If we can do that, we will have supplies of oil for a long
time to come.
The bringing together of the various experts would be of use
in putting into perspective what our reserves are, and how we
can convert those reserves into useable reserves to supply
Canadians. We have enough oil in this country, and there are
ways of getting it into the hands of consumers, so we do not
have to face the uncertainty that we have faced in the past.
I am not making a pitch in any way, shape or form for some
further tax concessions or tax incentives for the industry. I
believe we should carry out this inquiry with a view to making
some recommendations to the government for changing or
altering the manner in which tax incentives are offered so that
we take full advantage of those incentives in increasing our
reserves.
It should be noted that the entire delivery system for
bringing these enhanced recoveries to the user is already in
place. The known oil fields are already hooked up to a
distribution system that runs all the way from Alberta to
Montreal, and that system can be extended. Given that the
transportation system is in place, enhanced recoveries are even
more attractive than new discoveries. If, for example, a significant discovery is found in a place far removed from a pipeline,
the building of a transportation system capable of carrying
that oil to market can be a greater problem than developing oil
wells in the new fields. It seems to me, therefore, obvious that
further production from known fields, given the transportation
system already in place, would be far more beneficial during
the next few years.
Senator Deschatelets: In relation to this matter of tax
incentives, what authority determines whether or not these
large amounts of money flowing back to these companies as a
result of tax incentives are being used for further exploration
and development? What body or authority is charged with the
responsibility of checking that?
Senator Olson: I suppose there are several ways of checking
it. I am sure the Department of National Revenue verifies that
deductions in respect of production costs, write-offs, depletion
allowances, and so forth, are in fact warranted. The Alberta
government claims that the record of reinvestment of company
earnings stands at about 84 per cent. In other words 84 per
cent of the earnings are reinvested in the exploration for, and
development of, more supplies.
I might say, since you have raised this subject, I for one
would be in favour of amending the laws so as to ensure that
any additional moneys that would be accruing to the industry
over and above a reasonable return are reinvested in this way.
Senator Deschatelets: Would it be possible for your committee to look into this? The fear in the minds of the public, of
course. is that these large amounts of money which flow back

November 29, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

to the companies are not totally reinvested. We hear about
these tax concessions or incentives from time to time, but i
certainly have not seen any report which shows the percentage
which is being reinvested.
Senator Oison: No doubt there is a way of checking that,
but I am certainly not asking that the committee be given the
job of auditing the books of the companies. I am sure we have
the means by which to find out just how much is being
reinvested. The Alberta government has said that approximately 84 per cent of the earnings of these companies is
reinvested. That is a figure that has been used in the last few
days.
Personally, I am in favour of amending the laws in whatever
way is necessary to ensure that these funds are reinvested for
the purpose of increasing reserves. If they are not used for that
purpose, then these extra profits should be taxed away in sorne
form. Perhaps that will be part of the energy package which is
to be brought down within the next few days.

e

(1540)

Honourable senators, I would conclude by asking the Senate
to adopt the report. I feel that we can perform a useful service
to Canada by assessing these enhanced recovery techniques
and studying the other matters contained in the extended
terms of reference. I cannot give an indication now as to when
we shall begin the study, but i can say on behalf of the
committee that there was almost unanimous agreement that
we should get down to these subjects.
On motion of Senator Macdonald, debate adjourned.

i must say that i have a number of weaknesses which i am
not prepared to list here in detail, but one of them is that I am
very often persuaded by the last person who makes an argument in favour of any particular matter. At the time that
Senator Molson spoke, I thought that the reasons he gave for
changing the rule were excellent. Again, when Senator Macquarrie spoke, i agreed with him that there are times when it is
very difficult for a conscientious senator or, indeed, a member
of the other place, to have to vote on a particular measure.
i think anyone who has been in this chamber for any length
of time knows that senators on both sides have had difficulties
over the years with omnibus bills. None of us has been happy
with this and, in previous years, many of us have urged our
respective governments not to bring forward this type of bill.
Such bills create all sorts of difficulties because there are
times, in fact, when we would be happy to support certain
portions of them and reluctant to support others. As has been
said, our only recourse is to go along with it, or to refrain from
voting by leaving the chamber.
When Senator Olson spoke the other day, i had to agree
entirely with the arguments that he put forward. i am convinced, as he is, that it is our own responsibility and, indeed,
our duty under the Constitution, to pass upon legislation. We
can vote for it, we can vote against it, or we can refrain from
voting, but i hope we would be afforded the opportunity of
giving our reasons. Above all, i think we have, in some way, to
stand and be counted.

Senator Frith spoke in this debate the other night, and he
too was firmly opposed to any change in the present rule. He
argued rather forcefully in favour of simply being able to stand
up and give reasons, and said that that should be sufficient. i
do not know whether Senator Frith was carried away by his
own rhetoric, but I found one small flaw in his argument when
STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
it was all over, and that is that he seemed so convinced that if
FIRST REPORT REFERRED BACK TO STANDING COMMITTEE
he stood up and gave his reasons for not voting on a particular
measure, the rest of us, in the spirit of camaraderie that is
On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of Senator Molson usually exhibited in the Senate, would automatically accept
for the adoption of the first report of the Standing Com- them. There is the possibility that one of these days the
mittee on Standing Rules and Orders-(Honourable majority of us would be in a churlish or dyspeptic mood, and
would simply not accept his reasons.
Senator Macdonald)

Senator Macdonald: If honourable senators are agreeable, I
should like to yield to Senator Neiman.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Neiman: Honourable senators, I am sure we are all
grateful to Senator Bosa for bringing the provisions of rule 49
to our attention and giving his reasons why he felt changes
should be made. I am not sure at this point, after some
reflection, that i entirely agree with the reasons put forward
by Senator Olson, after a very careful study in the Standing
Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, for the changes
that are being advocated. At this point I feel that, while the
rule does require some improvement, it requires it more in its
drafting than in its spirit or the procedures involved.

What happens then? Our respected Speaker has to stand
and ask him to give his reasons-and I am not clear if the
question is put before the vote is taken or after-or we all have
to wait while the senator in question retreats from the room,
perhaps to the slow beat on our desk tops, so that he does not
have to register his vote. This conjures up a rather doleful
picture, and I do not think His Honour should ever be put in
that position.
For that reason, i think the latter provision in rule 49(1) (c)
should be dispensed with.
Apart from that, i have difficulty with the word "assign",
which is used in rule 49. I have looked up the definition of the
word in the latest edition of Funk and Wagnall's Dictionary,
and i find that "assign" means "to set apart, to allot, to

SENATE DFBATES

that a senator would be required to give his reasons.

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL FINANCE
ON SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B)

November 29, 1979
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to
which the Supplementary Estimates (B) laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1980, were referred,
has in obedience to the order of reference of Thursday,
November 8, 1979, examined the said Supplementary Estimates (B) and reports as follows:
(1) The Committee was authorized by the Senate as recorded in the Minutes and Proceedings of the Senate of November
8, 1979 to examine and report upon the expenditures proposed
by the Supplementary Estimates (B) laid before Parliament
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1980.
(2) In obedience to the foregoing, your Committee examined the Supplementary Estimates (B) and heard evidence
from the following officials of the Treasury Board: Mr. J. L.
Manion, Secretary; Miss Denise Moncion, Assistant Secretary, Program Branch; Mr. E. A. Radburn, Director, Estimates Division, Program Branch; Mr. E. R. Stimpson, Director, Expenditure Analysis Division, Program Branch; and from
the Department of Communications: Mr. John C. Smirle,
Manager, Applications and Standards.
(3) These Supplementary Estimates (B) total $1,031 millon.
The budgetary expenditures total $992 million of which $600
million are statutory items and $392 million represent funds
for which Parliament is being asked to provide new authority.
The non-budgetary expenses, that is to say, loans, investments,
and advances include $39 million to be voted. The total
Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1980 are now
increased to $54,946 million. This exceeds by $680 million the
total estimates anticipated in the federal expenditure plan for
the year.
(4) Of the $431 million in these Supplementary Estimates
(B) which are to be voted by Parliament some of the major
items are:
-$120 million for additional home insulation
-$63 million for the Department of National Defence to
cover increased contributions to NATO
-$20 million for additional assistance to the ship building
industry
-$30 million to increase the limit in the petroleum compensation revolving fund
-$21 million to the Cape Breton Development Corporation
for capital expenditures and rehabilitation and development of its coal and railway operations.

(5) Of the $600 million representing statutory items in these
Supplementary Estimates the major items are:
-$297 million for additional payments to provinces
-$100 million for additional costs of servicing the public
debt
-$53 million for income security programs such as old age
security
-$60 million for additional election expenses.
(6) Treasury Board supplied the Committee with a list
explaining the $1 items for Supplementary Estimates (B)
which is attached as an Appendix to this Report.
(7) ProgramAuthorization By AppropriationAct
In its report on the Supplementary Estimates (A) for 197980 the Committee drew attention to the practice of giving
programs their original base in legislation in an appropriation
act. Three instances of this practice and its ramifications were
noted during examination of these Supplementary Estimates.
Salmonid Enhancement. The Salmonid Enhancement program
of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, funded at a level
in excess of $20 million per annum for a period of three to four
years was authorized in an appropriation act. Treasury Board
officials maintained that this type of program falls within the
general mandate of the department and therefore no authorizing legislation was required, even though the cost was "fairly
substantial". The Committee disagrees with the position
articulated by the Treasury Board for reasons to be set out
after discussion of two other examples.
Our concern with Salmonid Enhancement was further
heightened when a review of the Department's statement of
objectives, as contained in the Main Estimates for 1979-80 and
the act creating the Department indicated that "community
development", an objective of the Salmonid Enhancement
Program, does not appear to be specifically within the Department's mandate.
VIA Rail. VIA Rail is another example of a program whose
original legislation is based upon an appropriation act, No. 1,
1977. In this instance the technique used was a dollar vote. At
the time the related Estimates were being reviewed, Senator
Manning objected to this use of appropriation acts, wherein an
annual expenditure of up to $240 million was to be permitted
in the absence of Parliamentary scrutiny, other than that
allowed in the estimates-appropriation act process. Two years
later in the Supplementary Estimates (B) Parliamentary

472

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

approval is being sought to remove that annual expenditure
restriction, again without any provision for fundamental
debate on the merits of the case.

Treasury Board officials stated that the Department of
Transport is preparing a report to identify means of achieving
a reduction of the cost of VIA Rail but that insofar as they
were aware the option of discontinuing service, as was done in
Newfoundland, is not under consideration. Your Committee is
sufficiently concerned with this escalating expenditure that it
will give serious consideration to requesting the President of
VIA Rail to appear.

The Canadian Home Insulation Program (CHIP). This
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation program is
another example of program authorization by an appropriation
act. Its predecessor the Home Insulation Plan which operates
in the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia
where most heating is related to oil or oil generated electricity,
was authorized by Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977. The Main
Estimates for fiscal year 1978-79 estimated the program cost
at $69.2 million dollars.

The Canadian Home Insulation Program operates in all
other provinces and was first estimated to cost some $47
million, in the Main Estimates of the fiscal year 1979-80. This
figure was subsequently revised to $167.3 million in these
Supplementary Estimates, as a result of changes to the program design, effective April 1979. A rudimentary calculation
based upon figures given by Treasury Board officials during
the hearing suggest that the cost of the program for this fiscal
year alone could amount to $250 million. It appears that the
full cost of this home insulation program has not yet been
made clear to Parliament.

The absence of any Parliamentary review of the program
distresses your Committee in light of questions raised during
our hearings. The continued need for such a program was
questioned in view of anticipated changes in the price of oil
which will provide added, perhaps sufficient, incentives to
home owners to insulate. The adequacy of the design of the
Canadian Home Insulation Program was also questioned,
specifically the absence of targetting of incentives to reduce oil
consumption in parts of the country where gas is available or
where oil generated electricity used for heating purposes is a
small portion of the total power generated.

Basic Concern. The concern of the Conimittee with the practice of program authorization by appropriation act was

expressed by Senator Balfour. " ...

November 29, 1979
November 29, 1979
The fundamental point ...

is that here we have another program involving substantial
expenditures of public monies, $167 million which has, in
effect, been put in place by an estimate rather than by
legislation . .. What I am attempting to expose is the weakness
of going about putting large programs of this kind in place in
this way.

"It would seem to me that the program could have been
improved upon had it been legislated into existence, been
exposed to debate, and an opportunity been given to the
legislators to scrutinize the detail of the program and possibly
improve it."

The Committee strongly suggests that Treasury Board develop a set of guidelines which state the conditions under
which program authorization by appropriation act should
occur and submit a draft statement to this Committee in
conjunction with the tabling of Supplementary Estimates (C)
for this year or the Main Estimates for fiscal year 1980-81.

(8) Concern was expressed about the compensation allowed
to institutions for the sale of Federal Government bonds.
Treasury Board officials agreed to provide the Committee with
a comparison of the commissions paid by the federal government, provincial governments and industrial organizations.
Because many millions of dollars are involved your Committee
will report further if the compensation paid does not appear to
represent economic purchase of these services.

(9) The Committee was concerned when it learned of the
possibility that the Treasury Board may not have the tools to
discharge its responsibility to ensure that departments do not
commence activities prior to receipt of the necessary Parliamentary authority. Officials informed the Committee that the
Auditor General is looking into the matter.

(10) Currently federal government departments are
required to pay normal duty and taxes on the entry of scientific equipment and apparatus into Canada. The intent is to show
Parliament the full costs of government programs. Officials
stated that a review of this policy was underway because of the
costs involved. Your Committee expects to be informed by the
Treasury Board of the findings of that review.

(1l) The display of information in these Supplementary
Estimates with respect to the Fiscal Transfer Payments Program, Department of Finance, could be improved by clearly
indicating that the amount of $157 million, ("Adjustments for

November 29, 1979
November 29, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Prior Years") in fact represents an estimate as of a specific
date not the final amount for adjustments. Treasury Board
officials agreed to improve the description.

(12) The total cost of the Department of National Defence's
contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
infrastructure program for the period 1980-84 will be $495
million, a figure which does not appear in the estimates. When
authorized by Cabinet, 1 December 1978, the funding for
1979-80 was directed to be provided by a re-allocation within
the DND budget by means of an administrative review. When
conducted it failed to find the necessary resources and thus the
full amount was requested via supplementary estimates. The
Committee is concerned about the weaknesses thus displayed
in expenditure management and will seek to inform itself
about the new expenditure management system, the resource
envelopes, to determine whether or not it will rectify such
weaknesses.

(13) The Committee was pleased to obtain the explanation
of the rationale and objectives for the Department of Communication's participation in the Telidon Project. Statements
by Mr. Smirle, which included indications of satisfactory
progress to date toward attainment of the economic objectives,
were helpful to the Committee in assessing the merits of the
request for this $9 million item.

(14) The Canadian Grain Commission's explanation of
requirement given for the additional costs of operating grain
elevators pending privatization did not indicate the fact that
there are also revenues associated with the operation. Where
there are revenues and expenditures associated with an activity
the display of both would assist the Committee in its review of
the estimates by increasing its understanding of the nature of
the activity.

(15) The display of program costs could be improved by
indicating in cases such as CHIP, Telidon and Salmonid
Enhancement the expected costs for the life of the program at
the time they are introduced. This is already done for new
capital projects where the estimated total cost and the amount
to be expended for the fiscal year are shown by the Department of National Defence and in the Energy, Mines and
Resources' Earth Science Program where previously estimated
total cost and currently estimated total cost are given.

birds while the Department of Agriculture operates a program
to compensate farmers for this type of crop damage. It would
help the Committee to do its work if these complementary
physical and financial linkages were made clear in the
Estimates.
Respectfully submitted,
D. D. EVERETT,
Chairman.

VANCOUVER HARBOUR- GRAIN SHIPMENTS -RESTORATION
RAIL SERVICE TO NORTH SHORE

OF

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, my question is for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It relates to
the movement of grain and other commodities through the
great port of Vancouver.
As we all know, port activity at Vancouver has been hampered by a marine accident which occurred carlier this fall.
The Second Narrows Bridges industrial span was struck by a
ship, and this accident cut off rail access to the north shore of
Vancouver harbour.
I wonder whether the minister can report on the status of
the bridge repair work at the present moment, and say when
we can expect to sec a restoration of the full, normal rail
service in the area?
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to take that question as
notice. I should be happy to report back on the exact progress
of the repair work. However, I just do not have the information at hand.
VANCOUVER HARBOUR -- ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF MOVING
GRAIN TO NORTII SHORE

Senator Perrault: The minister may have this information
available at his desk, but may I ask in a supplementary way
what arrangements have been made to be certain that a vital
product such as grain has been receiving its fair share of the
traffic space made available by alternative means, such as via
British Columbia Rail to the north shore, or by barge movenient across the harbour, while the repair work is going on?
Can the minister provide us with specific figures to show the
respective volumes of commodity traffic going across to the
north shore during the period that this bridge has been out of
operation?
Senator de Cotret: I should be happy to obtain the information for Senator Perrault. Of course, I do not have it at my

multimillion dollar program, the minister was not aware of tl.
He did say he would look into it, and he was kind enough to

My final question is Ibis: In view of« the facî he did state
several wecks ago that he recognized that the movement of
grain was one of the major keys 10 the economie performance
of Ibis nation, would the minister please make himself a litîle
more familiar wiîh the wbole question of the movement and
sale of grain so that he can answer questions in the house wben
îbey are put 10 him. Tonigbî we have bad three or four
questions and be bas not been able 10 answer any one of îbem.
1 do not nced a debate on economie questions. Ali we want is
îhaî the minister should answer the questions for wbich be and
bis deparîment are responsible.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Wby don't you îry asking one?ý
Senator de Cotret: 1 arn more than happy 10 answer questions. As one who bas always soughî knowledge, 1 shaîl make a
commitment, bonourable senators, 10 learn as much as possible
about ail areas of concern 10 Ibis bouse, I bave always îried 10
do so.
But when in your preamble you raise a long and gusty
allegation about positions back in the early seventies, I arn
willing 10 talk about those to0. I would be happy 10 discuss the
record of the last six monîbs and compare il to the record of
tbe previous six monîbs. It might be quite cnligbtening.
I shaîl be happy 10 answer ail the questions put by the
honourable senator, and 10 do s0 witb the shortest delay
possible. I svould lîke 10 reaffirmi tbe commilment of our
government 10 move tbat grain 10 market. Il is a major

Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, I sbould like 10
direct a question 10 the Nlinister of Indusîry, Trade and
Commerce on the same subjeet malter, It relates 10 the
iiovement of one of Canada's major exporîs, namely, western
Canadian grain. Earlier this year, bonourable senators will
recaîl, the prescrnt administration made mucb of the negotialions witb respect to the building of a new terminal aI Prince
Rupert. There bad been some criticismi of the previous
administration because of delays in the construction of Ibis
t erminal. The previous administration bad been insisting that a
location could bc found on Rîdley Island in Prince Rupert
Harbour. A moment ago the minister said that bis governimenî
would not negleet any moves 10 spced up the export of
Canadian grains. But what happened when the new administration came mbt office-and 1 say Ibis wiîbouî any rancourSenator Flynn: Ask the question.
Senator McDonald: Just bc patient.
Senator Flynn: Yes, but you are making a speech.

SENATE DEBATES

December 4, 1979

Senator McDonald: The first thing that happened was that
they set up a study group to examineSenator Perrault: To monitor.
Senator McDonald: -to examine whether the location on
Ridley Island was the proper location. After several monthsSenator Flynn: Question!
Senator McDonald: After several months the study group
came back-and this was just a few days ago-recommending
that the terminal should be built exactly where the previous
government had contemplated building it.
I should like to ask the minister what steps the government
is planning to take to expedite the work with respect to the
construction of that new terminal elevator in Prince Rupert.
Senator de Cotret: As the honourable senator knows, we are
committed to the elevator. I do not think that it was at ail
improper of the government to have put in question the site
selection. In fact, I think it was responsible on the part of the
new government to do so. There were a number of issues at
that time that we felt required clarification. We have that
clarification and I can assure the honourable senator that we
will move expeditiously in the fulfilment of our commitment to
that particular facility.
Senator McDonald: I have a supplementary. As I am sure
the minister is aware, one of the problems with respect to
Prince Rupert is the fact that the Canadian Pacific does not
have access over its own rail lines to that port. What action is
the present administration taking with respect to bringing
Canadian Pacific and Canadian National together to work out
an agreement by which those areas of the prairies that are
served only by CP Rail will have access to the new port?
As a second supplementary: Are discussions now taking
place with respect to the possibility of moving prairie grain
over present CPR lines and CN lines into the old facilities,
quite apart from the new facilities?
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to take both questions as
notice and provide the answers as soon as possible.
THE CABINET
MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SENATE

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, in connection with
the willingness on the part of the Minister of State for
Economic Development to answer questions promptly, may I
point out that I asked him a question on October 10 regarding
the cabinet committee on economic development. At that time
he said, and I quote:
-1 will be happy to give a more detailed description, in
writing, of the role of the committee, the role of the
chairman, and the role of the Minister of State, and I
shall endeavour to do that in the very near future.
My question for the minister is: What is his definition of "the
very near future"?

Senator de Cotret: "The very near future" I would define as
being "as soon as possible."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator de Cotret: No, no. I will make a further commitment, because I think that is a fair question on the part of the
honourable senator. I will endeavour to provide that information before the end of the week.
Senator Perrault: Pretty soon it will be in the realm of
historical data.

SUPPLY AND SERVICES
CONSTRUCTION OF ICEBREAKER-AWARD OF CONTRACT

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, a few weeks ago I
asked the Honourable Leader of the Government what were
the reasons behind the fact that the building contract for an
icebreaker had been awarded to someone other than the
Lauzon shipyard. He had promised at that time to try and get
additional information to justify the government's decision. I
do not know whether the honourable minister has had time to
get the information I had requested at that time.
Senator Flynn: Yes, I did get some. However I would say
that time really flies for the Honourable Senator Marchand.
He said that was a few weeks ago. He put his question on
November 29 last week. So I believe this is the first opportunity I have had to inform him. I must say to him that I had
mentioned at that time I did not know anything about the
icebreaker, as such. I was thinking about other contracts.
So, about the icebreaker, I inquired and was told that the
contract for the building of an icebreaker to replace the
d'Iberville has not yet been awarded, but the process of
approval is in motion.
However, I would like to say to him that applications and
tenders were received from six shipbuilding yards in Canada,
including the Davie shipyard in Lauzon, Port Weller in
Ontario, and Saint John. Four tenders qualified. Now, because
the contract has not been awarded, I cannot disclose the
amount of every tender because that is competitive information. When the contract is awarded, of course, aIl those figures
will be known.
I note, after reading Hansardof last Thursday, that Senator
Marchand asked his question that day. It is true that weekends
can seem longer in certain cases than others.
Senator Lamontagne: We are kept waiting.
Senator Flynn: You are not kept waiting. That was the last
time we sat and I am giving you my answer tonight. You
cannot ask for much better than that!
Senator Marchand: You are in a hurry to answer.
Senator Flynn: Yes, I know. But I mentioned in that answer
that the spread between the prices tendered was not very great.
I believe I meant to say the opposite as it was quite obvious I
was not talking about the icebreaker, but another contract.

SENATE DEBATES
In any case. 1 might add that 1 arn discussing ail possibilities
with the nmister dcpcnding on the decision that will be madc
about the icebreaker. Once again, it bas flot yet been made. 1
believe tl is the policy of' the government-it is similar to the
policy of the former governmrent. even if 1 arn rcported as
saying the contrary at page 46 1 -- I take economie factors into
consideration, like the fact that there is unemployment in some
places. This spreads as much as possible the contracts to
ensure the viability of shipbuilding yards in Canada which is
very important.
Senator Marchand: 1 have a supplernentary. 1 am happy to
hear the Honourable Leader of the Opposition say that he
made a mistake. In that case, perhaps 1 made a mnistake also.
Senator Flynn: If you are talking about mistakes, you are
obviously talking about the Leader of the Opposition and that
does not concern me!
Senator Marchand: No. 1 was simply talking about a mistake. 1 arn quite moved by your attitude. You will therefore
excuse a mistake of a few days in the date of my last question.
1 would Jike the iiinister to tell us whether. in addition to
considering the financial and the social factors, the government will also take mbt account thec factor of expertise in the
building of' the icebreaker.
Senator Flynn: Undoubtedlv. 1 believe that aIl the shipyards
who have submiitted tenders for the icebreaker have a lot ol'
expertise. The question is rather difficult because 1 would not
want to say. for instance, that the Davie shipyard is better
than that of' Saint John or any other one. Somie are more
specializcd in certain types of shipbuilding than others.
Howcver, it is rather difficult to say that the Davie shipyard.
for instance, is the best in the country for any type of'
shipbuilding.
On the other band, according to certain unconfirnmed reports
that 1 received today, 1 believe that the shipyard will bc able to
provide jobs for a good number of emiployees this winter.

violenîly by Qucbec Economnie Development Minister Landry

Senator Marchand: This lime 1 hope I will not mnake a
mistake on the number of days, but a few weeks ago 1 put a
question to the Honourable Leader of the Governmcnt about
fishing boats 100 feet and over which last August had been
given authorization to enter the Golf of'St. [Lawrence. Coming
here tonight, I was listening to a radio open fine prograin
where a fisherman from the Gaspé area was talking ssith the
Honourable Mr. La Salle. Mr. La Salle said he was surprised
to learn there was a problem. He promised t0 take it up
scriously with his colîcague, the Honourable Mir. McGrath. So
1 assumcd he had not beard about it in cabinet. Perhaps the
ILeader of the Opposition has received additional information.
Could he give us that additional information?.
Senator Flynn: Once again Senator Marchand cannot forget-he keeps calling me the Leader of the Opposition. In f'act,
thiat was flot a bad role-perhaps it suited mie better than that
of' Leader of the Government.
ln any case, 1 do not know, perhaps Senator Marchand was
flot here whcn I answered bis question about the 100-foot
trawlers which were aîlowed to fish in the Golf of St. Lawrence. but only for this year. 1 do flot know wbether other
decisions have been made about that. Possibly the Minister of
Supply and Services was flot aware of it because nobody is
aware of everything, flot even Senator Denis, who is one of the
deans of Parliament. 0f course. there are a lot of things he
does flot know--he often talks through his hat.
Senator Denis: Particularly you.

December 4, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Flynn: In any case, the problem raised by Senator
Marchand is one I had already dealt with. There is nothing
new in that respect. The complaints are continuing. They are
the same as before about that situation. It is a temporary
problem. The authorization has not been renewed as far as I
know.
However, I will enquire in case there are new developments.
I am sure the question to which Senator Marchand is making
reference includes the situation about which I already
informed him.
Senator Denis: As I said earlier, it is mainly you because
you talk more often than I do.
Senator Marchand: I have a supplementary for the Leader
of the Government. When you say that authorization has not
been renewed, do you mean that it no longer exists?

Senator Denis: You have forgotten to speak about me. You
always do so when you make speeches. In this case, you have
forgotten.

Senator Flynn: The authorization was for fishing during this
year's season. Perhaps Senator Denis could consult his neighbour, Senator Langlois, since Senator Denis knows much more
about fishing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence than he does. In any
event, it was for this season. I do not really have any more
information.
Senator Marchand: You also know about this subject.
Senator Flynn: Of course. However, there are subjects that I
do not know, but not in the same area, thank goodness!

ATLANTIC SALMON FISH ERY-TER MINATION OF
COMPENSATION

Senator Denis: That is a sign of a good Minister of Justice.
Senator Flynn: Senator Denis speaks so well when he is
sitting down! However, he speaks nonsense when he rises.
Senator Denis: I can rise if you like.
Senator Flynn: You always speak nonsense when you do so.
Senator Denis: You, on the other hand, laugh at your own
jokes.
Senator Flynn: I much prefer to laugh at my own jokes than
at yours because they are much funnier.
Senator Denis: No, no.
Senator Flynn: In that case, you should simply laugh and
keep quiet!
Senator Denis: You are very funny!
Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In
view of the question asked by Senator Marchand, would he
enquire when trawlers over 100 feet were allowed to fish in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence because the Minister of Fisheries and
Oceans, Mr. McGrath, announced at the time that catches
would be limited to 6,000 metric tons. According to the reports
sent to us from the St. Lawrence River, these quotas have
already been exceeded and fishing is still going on. Will the
Leader of the Government enquire from his colleague whether
the quotas have been reached?
Senator Flynn: I shall certainly ask him. I shall also ask him
whether they have been exceeded. In that case, sanctions
should probably be imposed.

Senator Flynn: But I am not forgetting anything when 1
forget to talk about you.
Senator Denis: You had better be careful.
a (2040)
[English]
Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question on the subject of fisheries. I wonder if the
Leader of the Government is aware that a decision to allow
trawlers to fish in the Gulf was cancelled three years ago, and
that now that decision has been reversed.

Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, I feel that my next
question should be directed to the Minister of Fisheries and
Oceans. It pertains to a statement made by him last Thursday-not in the House of Commons-regarding the Atlantic
salmon fishery. He made a statement, of which I have a copy
here-I will not bother anyone by quoting it in full-in the
course of which he stated that he had no policy in this regard.
However, I feel that one line of the statement is perhaps worth
quoting, and it is:
compensation payments to fishermen will be terminated
in the current fiscal year.
To a large number of fishermen the right to fish for salmon,
which had existed for 100 years or more, was taken away by
the institution of a program in 1972. At that time the minister
responsible for Fisheries met with the fishermen and told them
that as long as this policy prevented them from fishing, the
Government of Canada would compensate them.
Senator Donahoe: For how long?
Senator Thériault: New Brunswick is still a part of Canada.
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear.
Senator Thériault: We know that we cannot build cars or
ships; nonetheless, New Brunswick fishermen are still Canadians, and yet without discussion with the fishermen the minister
made this statement.
Senator Muir: Question!
Senator Macquarrie: Question!
Senator Thériault: Will the Leader of the Government
please ask his colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans
if, in fact, his decision is final, or if this matter is still open for
discussion'?
Senator Flynn: After this long speech by the honourable
senator, perhaps I should ask for leave to adjourn the debate.
An Hon. Senator: I second the motion.
Senator Flynn: The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stated
on Friday that, as far as the compensation program was

Senator Flynn: I was trying to explain that a task force of
officiais fromn four departmnents-External Affairs, National
Defence, Employmnent and Immigration and Industry, Trade
and Commerce -has met regularly since November 22 to keep
Canadian policy on the Iranian situation under review. Its
work has focused on two aspects of this erisis, namely, planning and co-ordinating our diplomatie efforts, and, of course,
our own contingency planning with regard 10 the safety of
Canadians in Iran. The governmnent as a whole, and the task
force in particular, are looking at ail aspects of Canada's
relations with Iran, and I ami sure that many other countries
are doing likewise.
The Prime Ninister has indicated that Canada is concentrating on the mecans to bring the force of international opinion
to bear even more strongly on Iran with a vîew to securing the
earliest possible release of the hostages. We have donc so
through the Uited Nations, the Commonwealth, and francophione nations. When we act in thts situation we act in a way
that is designed t0 have influence on the authorities in Iran. As
the Prime Minister clearly said yesterday, this is flot a malter
where the desire for domestie publicity should be allowed to
interfere with the elfectivcness of international action.
Furtherinore, I have here the text of the speech of our
amnbassador t0 the United Nations in the Seeurity Council,
sohich I would gladly table f'or the information of honourable

IRAN-STATUS OF CANADIAN AID

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I have a question
that is supplementary to one that I asked on Canada-Iran
relations. Two weeks ago I asked the Minister of State responsible for CIDA to give us an up-to-date report of the status of
Canada's loans and aid to Iran. Is the government leader
prepared to give this answer today or some time later this
week?
Senator de Cotret: If I may, honourable senator, I can give
the following status report on the Export Development Corporation's exposure in Iran as of October 31 of this year. At that
time the corporation had loans outstanding of $127,585,000. It
had, in terms of insurance liability, first whole turn-over
policies of $2,124,000, specific policies of $15,332,000, surety
policies of $3,5 17,000, and four investment guarantees of
$2,610,000. The total exposure at that time was $151,168,000.
There is an additional $119 million in loan commitments not
disbursed, and for which there is no requirement to disburse. I
am also happy to say that all payments due to the date I
referred to earlier-and I have no knowledge of any further
developments in this respect-from Iranian borrowers have
been paid, except for approximately $300,000, and I am
informed by the agency that that does not represent any
abnormal delay in loan repayments.
THE CONSTITUTION
RECONSTITUTION OF SPECIAL SENATE COMMITTEE

Senator Bosa: I have a question for the deputy leader. On
October 23 I asked the honourable senator if it was his
intention to reconstitute the Special Senate Committee on the
Constitution of Canada. He replied that he had had some

Senator de Cotret: I have no specific information to give you
respecting private sector exposure in Iran. I have been
informed that many private sector institutions, over quite a
period of time, have been reducing their loan exposure in Iran,
but it is difficult to obtain any specific numbers in that field. I
have no such numbers at my disposal, nor have I received any
communications regarding defaults. I can only point to the
government's exposure in Iran, and say that in the last two
weeks of October, for example, $9 million in payments were
due from Iran, and were made by Iran. As of October 31, the
only unresolved payment was one of $300,000, and that has to
be compared to the $9 million of repayments that were made
in the ordinary manner. So, generally I think the situation,
from a financial point of view, is evolving without any recent
disturbing developments.
IRAN-ASSETS IN CANADA

Senator Haidasz: May I ask a supplementary question to
clarify this point? Could the minister tell us the total of
Iranian assets presently in Canada?
Senator de Cotret: I am even hesitant to make a commitment to Senator Haidasz that I will obtain that information. I
am not sure that this is something one could get a firm fix on.
We might be able to obtain a broad estimate or a range, but I
think it would be extremely difficult to obtain a specific
number, in terms of assets that Iranians might be holding in
Canada at the moment.
Senator Haidasz: Since the Government of the United
States was able to announce what the total assets of Iran in
that country was, can the minister not determine what Iran's
assets in Canada are?
Senator de Cotret: If Senator Haidasz had cared to follow
the United States situation closely, he would no doubt be

SENATE DEBATES
aware that, first of ail, they werc only referring tu financial
assets and flot real assets. 1 do flot think Senator Haidasz, in
the question I rcplied to a few minutes ago. made any distinction betwccn the Iwo.
Secondly, the range that has been advanced in the United
States on financial assets alone is a vcry broad range indeed.
There is no firm fix on the exact amounit of Iranian financial
assets.
There is no question that il is casier to obtain a fix on
financiai assets, because when funds arc deposited in banks,
addresses are normaily given. Howcver, on non-financiai
assets, or reai assets, it is much more difficult, because they
can be held in a number of ways. 1 wouid be very surprised if
the American authorities had any better fix on that type of
asset than we couid possibiy obtain.
As 1 said, if you wish a range such as that which the United
States autiiorities seem to bc comfortabic with in ternis of
financiai assets, 1 might be able to provide one. However, the
range wouid be very broad. The range in the United States, to

anvmore because it does not comne in metrie swcight and docs

Ireland, and the same problemns arise. If that business is

no intention of' doing anything but furthering the interests of
small businesses, and furthering more research and dcvelopment so that more jobs may be created.

SENATE DEBATES

December 4, 1979

news release put out by the Export Development Corporation,
particularly the inclusion therein of a reference to guarantees
of investments in the United States.
The press release in question referred to all of the approvals
given by the board of directors of the Export Development
Corporation on November 21, 1979. The great bulk of the
business involved transactions with loans and related insurance. The United States business referred to in the press
release arose from a case where no loan is involved. It was a
credits insurance only transaction in which the exporter is
covered by a "whole turnover" policy.
Under that type of policy, the exporter insures all of his
sales for a year. These sales usually consist of commodities and
consumer goods sold on 180-day terms or less, and the policy is
renewed annually. In cases such as that, it is the policy of EDC
to require that the exporter insure his sales to all buyers in all
countries, thus allowing EDC to spread the risk over a much
greater range.
In this particular case, the U.S.A. was one of 42 countries
named in that exporter's particular policy. The matter came
before the board because the exporter expects to increase its
sales in the next year beyond the maximum liability previously
fixed for that exporter's policy. In fact, a five-fold increase in
the liability was considered necessary in this case.
When preparing the press release on such an approval, the
EDC does not list all of the 42 countries. It mentions only the
major markets. In this case besides the U.S.A., the other
major markets for this exporter are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, all of which
were mentioned in the press release.
AGRICULTURE
POTATO CROP IN EASTERN CANADA

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I have a reply to
the question raised by Senator Argue relating to the potato
crop in eastern Canada. Senator Argue's question was in three
parts, the first being whether or not an announcement would
be made soon that stabilization payments for the 1978 crop
would be forthcoming.
With regard to the potato crop in eastern Canada, stabilization payments in 1978 are under consideration, and a decision
is expected before Christmas.
He then asked whether stabilization payments for the 1979
crop would be forthcoming, and the answer to that is that not
all of the required information is available, and it is, therefore,
not possible to say at this time what action will be taken.
Finally, he asked whether the government will look at the
fact that many producers have potatoes rotting in storage
because of the particular climatic conditions being experienced
this year, and the answer to that is that the situation regarding
potatoes rotting in warehouses is under review at the moment
as per the request of Senator Argue.
The honourable senator may wish to know that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be meeting next week

80072-33

with his counterpart for Prince Edward Island at the Agriculture Outlook Conference, at which time he will be discussing
the potato situation.
Senator Argue: Did I hear correctly that the federal Minister of Agriculture will be meeting with the Minister of
Agriculture for Prince Edward Island?
Senator de Cotret: Yes.
Senator Argue: This situation is also prevalent in New
Brunswick, and I would hope that discussions would also be
held with the Honourable Malcolm MacLeod, Minister of
Agriculture of New Brunswick.
Senator de Cotret: Assuming the New Brunswick minister is
present at that conference, I am sure that will be the case. If
not, I shall bring to the attention of my colleague that he
should also talk to the Minister of Agriculture of New
Brunswick.
YUKON TERRITORY
GOVERNMENT POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have been carrying
about with me for some time now the response to a question
put to me by Senator Lucier on November 22. I have been
holding off, waiting until he was in the house before replying.
Before I am told I delayed too long, I had better put the reply
on the record.
On November 22 last, in response to a question of which
Senator Lucier had kindly given me notice, I provided the
chamber with some facts concerning Dawson City, Yukon
Territory, and its current municipal government situation. I
outlined at that time that, at the request of the deputy mayor
and on the advice of a previous administrator of the Yukon,
after it had become impossible to achieve a quorum at council
meetings given the resignation of the mayor, the death of one
alderman and the illness of another, an administrator had been
appointed for the city. A quorum of three out of the five
Dawson City aldermen is required before a meeting can be
held.
Senator Lucier challenged that information, suggesting that
the action was taken in consultation only with the deputy
mayor and not the council and that, in any case, another
council meeting was due to have taken place in November at
which the alderman who was ill was prepared to be present, if
necessary.
I have verified the accuracy of the information which I
originally conveyed to the Senate. It is true that the council
did meet early in November and agreed to have another
meeting. However, there was no quorum at the second meeting, and no hope of achieving a quorum for a meeting held
before the end of the year. The alderman who was ill requested
that an administrator be appointed, and he was supported in
that request by two of the three remaining aldermen and the
deputy mayor.
I would once again suggest to Senator Lucier that the
Government of the Yukon Territory has acted in the only

SENATE DEBATES

fashion possible. It would surely be irresponsible for that
government not to have acted, given both the situation in
Dawson City at the present time, its historical experience, and
the request of four of the five members of the Dawson City
Council for such an administrator.
SAFE CONTAINERS CONVENTION BILL
THIRD READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Macdonald moved the third reading of Bill S-5, to
implement the International Convention for Safe Containers.
Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I should like to
make an intervention before third reading is given to this bill.
In doing so, I want to draw to the attention of honourable
senators the testimony given before the Transport and Communications Committee by the officials of the Canadian
Transport Commission to the effect that the freeze and cuts
imposed on the Commission respecting the hiring of future
personnel and the reduction in person-years by 100 requested
by the President of the Treasury Board are causing havoc for
the Commission in carrying out its mandate, especially as it
relates to the inspection of railway services in Canada.
In view of that testimony, I would hope that there would be
unanimous consent to the attaching of a recommendation to
Bill S-5 requesting that the House of Commons impress upon
the President of the Treasury Board the need to review the
freeze and cuts that he has imposed on the Canadian Transport Commission, especially in view of the details given to our
committee by CTC officials.
e

(2120)

Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, I must say that with
some considerable experience in dealing with third readings of
bills, this is the first occasion on which I have ever heard it
proposed that-copying what I think is the procedure in the
American Senate-we should attach a rider of the sort proposed by my friend who has just spoken. I for one would
maintain it is out of order, and, if it were seriously advanced, I
would probably ask the Speaker to decide the matter for us.
But I think I can probably suggest a way in which my
honourable friend, Senator Haidasz, could make his point
without necessitating any research of the rules of this house.
We have heard what he has to say. I for one would not be
willing to give unanimous consent to his proposal, but if he
wishes to have the matter reviewed further by the Senate, he
can simply present an inquiry to us, at which time there can be
full expression of anyone's point of view on the particular
point.
I am nerely intervening in this debate to say that I have
some reservations about the propriety of what he has suggested. I have no reservations about his right to speak his mind on
the subject, and I suggest that if he wishes to do so in a formal
way, then it could be dealt with by way of an inquiry.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, as I did not
have any "suggestion" in writing from Senator Haidasz, I am
[Senator Flynn.]

December 4, 1979

not quite sure just what is before the Senate at the moment.
My understanding was that Senator Haidasz said that he
would like to "suggest" that the Commons be advised of a
certain attitude of the Senate. Am I correct in that?
Then, perhaps I should read rule 36.(1) which says:
36.( 1) When a question is under debateWhich is the situation at the moment, honourable senators.
-a motion shall not be received unless it is a motion to
amend the question, to refer the question to a committec,
to adjourn the debate, to postpone the debate to a certain
day, for the previous question, or for the adjournment of
the Senate.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that none of the
conditions described in rule 36 under which a motion can be
received is fulfilled by the suggestion made by Senator Haidasz. Therefore, I hope he will understand if I say that I
cannot, as I understand it, entertain a motion to that effect on
third reading. The suggestion has been made as to how he
might accomplish the objective he has in mind. Honourable
senators, I hope you will agree that there is no way that I
could at the moment entertain a suggestion or a motion as one
that I could put properly from the Chair as a question to the
Senate.
Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: If Senator Haidasz would like to
speak to that, I would, of course, bc quite happy to hear him.
Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I think that in the
previous session there was, if not a motion, at least an appeal
made to honourable senators by the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that we should send along with a bill, after
third reading, a recommendation that the House of Commons
pay attention to a certain point of view expressed in the
Senate. I did not want during the study of Bill S-5 in committee to propose a formal motion, but this was discussed with the
chairman of the committee and it was suggested that I should
raise the matter again on third reading. I have done this, and if
it is the ruling of the Speaker that I present a formal motion,
then I would withhold third reading of the bill until tomorrow
to give me an opportunity to submit a formal motion to that
effect.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, there is a
motion at the moment, moved by the Honourable Senator
Macdonald, seconded by the Honourable Senator Roblin,
P.C., that this bill be now read a third time. It is a motion, and
I have not at the moment put the question.
Senator Roblin: Question!
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators,
that the debate on this motion be now adjourned.

As a result of that discussion the matter was referred to our
Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. The committee
reported briefly and very much to the point on November 22.
After referring to the rule and the provision of it to which I
have just referred, the committee made the following brief

first report of the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and

SENATE DEBATES

Orders by Senator Molson, and I find that Senator Neiman
proposed an amendment at the end of her remarks, which is
highly contradictory according to my interpretation. i just
wonder whether the Senate was not too hasty in adopting that
amendment which has now put us into a dilemma. Here is
what has happened, and i am quoting from Senator Neiman's
remarks:
I am not sure at this point, after some reflection, that I
entirely agree with the reasons put forward by Senator
Molson, after a very careful study in the Standing Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, for the changes
that are being advocated.
Senator McDonald: Order!
Senator Roblin: What page are you quoting from?
Senator Bosa: Page 469 of November 29, 1979.
Senator McDonald: That matter has already been passed.
Senator Bosa: She said:
At this point I feel that, while the rule does require some
improvement, it requires it more in its drafting than in its
spirit or the procedures involved.
Senator Roblin: I hesitate to interrupt my friendSenator McDonald: I think the honourable senator is on the
wrong subject matter.
Senator Roblin: I hesitateThe Hon. the Speaker: Senator McDonald has the floor.
Senator McDonald: I gather from Senator Bosa's remarks
that he is referring to a motion that we have already passed.
Therefore, I think he is out of order.
Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I thought I had made
my intervention clear. I thought I had made it clear that I was
speaking on a point of clarification of something that the
Senate adopted last Thursday, which to me scemed to be
improper and inconsistent with what the Senate ought to have
donc at that time.
Senator Roblin: I have listened carefully to my honourable
friend and I agree with him that he attempted to bring in a
matter which was not germane to the subject before us. I did
not like to interrupt him in full flight here, because I thought
probably there would be a suitable occasion to deal with the
point he is raising. But it is obviously a point of order.
The fact is that the Senate has disposed of that matter and
there really is no way that i know of by which the matter can
be reconsidered at this stage.
If my honourable friend, Senator Bosa, has a problem with
what the Senate did, he has an easy solution. He can attend
the meeting of the committee which is going to reconsider this
matter, and where there will be a full opportunity for him, i
am sure, whether he is a member of the committee or not, to
discuss all aspects of the matter with Senator Neiman or
anyone else who wants to talk about it there. I submit that if
he has a problem that requires clarification, it should be taken
up at the committee meeting when the matter to which he
[Senator Bosa.]

December 4, 1979

refers is being discussed. I suggest that any attempt to discuss
clarification at this stage is clearly improper.
Senator Neiman: Honourable senators, on a point of clarification, may i say that we deait with this matter as the last
item of business last Thursday afternoon, and I did not then
have an oppportunity to look at my "blues" or at any part of
the debate before leaving for the weekend. Just now, while
Senator Bosa has been speaking, I have done so and I realize
that there was an error in the report of proceedings. I am
quoted as having referred to Senator Molson when in fact I
was referring to Senator Olson. I would ask that the record be
corrected to that extent.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, on occasions
such as this the Chair finds itself in difficulty. Our first rule
here is that the Senate is the master of its own proceedings.
When Senator Bosa rose, he did not ask for leave. He simply
proceeded. No senator rose to object at that time. Eventually
Senator McDonald rose on a point of order, which he directed
to the Senate, not to the Chair. Senator Roblin, P.C., rose on a
point of order which he directed to the Senate, not to the
Chair. Therefore, the custom of this chamber being that such
points of order shall be decided by the Senate unless they are
referred specifically to the Chair for a ruling, I did not
intervene. I noticed honourable senators looking at me wondering why I was not intervening at that point. Perhaps I should
make it clear at this particular point that that is the custom of
the Senate. We had it the other day, when senators were
objecting to one senator speaking and it was feit that that
senator was out of order. A number of senators, a substantial
number, were calling "Order, order, order." assuming that
they were addressing the Chair on a point of order.
I should like to make it clear that the position of the Chair is
that at the moment, under our custom, I do not intervene
unless a point of order is referred directly to me. The assumption is that senators will decide these points of order between
themselves unless the point is directed to the Chair, at which
time the Chair will then have an obligation to rise and make
the best ruling possible or to refer the matter for decision later.
* (2140)

I say that in explanation of what has just happened. i leave
it now in the hands of honourable senators. We have now
developed a debate, apparently, on a question of clarification,
which under our custom can carry on forever unless some
senator rises to object, gets the objection sustained by the
Senate, or refers it to the Chair. i hope that explanation of the
situation meets the approval of honourable senators.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I am not sure how one deals
with the words of address when one wishes to refer a matter to
the Chair, but perhaps one might assume that it might be to
Mr. Speaker. I do, Mr. Speaker, with whatever words are
necessary, refer this question of order to the Chair. The
question which i raise is that the matter spoken to by Senator
Bosa is one which, according to the Hansard report to which
he referred, has been disposed of by the Senate. Consequently,

December 4, 1979

DEBATES

1 believe that it would be out of order to discuss it further at
this point.

vote on a suggestion of rescission of that decision of tbe
Senate.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, 1 was just
Iooking through our rules. 1 think I know tbem fairly weIl, but
1 could flot find this specific rule. However, 1 arn quite sure
there is a rule that makes it completely out of order to attempt
to reverse a decision in any way that has already been made by
the Senate. Whether this actually would rule out of order a
comment on a matter that bas already been decided by the
Senate, I ar nfot quite sure.

Senator Bosa: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Before 1 put the
motion, perbaps 1 should say that 1 arn not dealing witb the
subject matter. 1 believe that I sbould just point out the
anomaly of the amendment that was put hast Thursday.

Senator McDonald: He could ask leave to revert.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable senator suggests
that he might ask leave to revert. Again, with leave of the
Senate, bonourable senators can do almost anything. With
leave of the Senate, honourable senators could pass a resolution that henceforth black shall be white. Under our rules, 1
would have no option but to put the question in that form.
1 would suggest, then, in order to resolve this situation, that
1 reserve my decision on this and perhaps Senator Bosa wilI
reserve bis comments until such time as 1 arn able to make a
ruling, because 1 have been asked for a ruIing. Is that
satisfactory?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator McElman: H-onourable senators, if I-is Honour the
Speaker would permit, 1 would say that both May and Beauchesne are exceedingly clear, that one cannot reflect upon a
decision taken by the house. That means conclusively that
there can be no further debate upon a decision taken by the
bouse. But, as tbe Honourable Senator McDonald bas properly stated, one can revert to rescind, and, as the Speaker bas
properly stated, tbe Senate can change anytbing, but one
cannot reflect upon a decision already taken.
The Hon. the Speaker: 1 tbank the Honourable Senator
McElman for a very interesting comment. 1 remember tbat
rule. 1 have read it many times, and I bave often wondered
wbat "reflect upon" means. Sometimes we tbink of "reflect
upon" in the pejorative sense. Does it mean that one cannot
think about it? Does "reflect" mean that you cannot say
sometbing nice about it, or does "reflect upon it" mean that
you cannot pass aspersions upon it? 1 bave neyer been quite
sure wbat the meaning of that rule is.
Perhaps for the benefit of bonourable senators I can read
rule 47(2), wbich says:
An order, resolution, or other decision of the Senate
may be rescinded on five days' notice if at Ieast two-tbirds
of tbe senators presenit vote in favour of its rescission.
I am not sure wbether Senator Bosa's suggestion was that
there should be a rescission of that vote. But 1 arn able to say
to him now that if he cares to give five days' notice, we can

Hon. Senators: Order.
Senator Roblin: 1 must say, honourable senators, tbat 1 find
this disagreeable. After ail, His Honour bas reserved the
matter. My bonourable friend shouhd not attempt to reopen it
until His Honour has given bis decision on the matter; otherwise we wiIh be bere forever, reopening matters tbat are now in
the bands of the Speaker for decision. So 1 appeal to my
honourable friend to keep bis seat on tbe subject until he bears
wbat the decision of the Speaker is. Tbere rnay then be an
opportunîty for hirn to say more, but not now.
Senator Bosa: h apohogize, honourable senators. I was under
the impression that His Honour the Speaker had just asked me
to go abead and express my opinion on tbe motion. Did I
misunderstand Ris Honour?
Senator McDonald: Yes.
The Hou. the Speaker: Honourable senators, 1 suggest we
leave tbe matter overnight and 1 will discuss it witb honourable
senators to the best of my ability at the next sitting. 1 believe
that Senator Bosa, when he rose, did say "witb heave," or
"witb permission," there was not a dissenting voice. Therefore
Senator Bosa was perfectly entitled, as 1 understand our ruhes,
to go ahead. 1 draw tbat to the attention of bonourable
senators.
An honourable senator may rise and say "with heave," wbich
is a motion, in effect, to suspend our rules. 1 couhd go tbrough
a long rigmarole of saying, "Is heave granted, bonourable
senators?", every time. The tradition of tbis bouse is tbat if a
senator rises and says "with heave," it is assumed tbat be is
moving to suspend any ruhe that might prevent bis going abead
as he wisbes. 1 bave no autbority wbatsoever under our ruhes
but to alhow an bonourahie senator, as I understand it, to
proceed if he asks for heave and no honourable senator objects.
Senator Roblin: Honourabie senators, I agree witb what His
Honour the Speaker says, but when a senator asks for heave,
tben tbe house is asked wbetber leave is granted. I heard no
sucb request made to us. In fact, 1 heard no request for leave
made by the senator who spoke, but 1 may bave rnissed it. 1
want to make it clear that bad 1 been asked for heave, 1 wouhd
have declined to give my voice to it.
The Hon. the Speaker: I do not want to enter into a debate,
but 1 arn most interested in the comment made by the Deputy

APPENDIX "A"
(See p. 483.)
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
INTERNATIONAL

CRISIS

IN

AMBASSADOR TO

Mr. President, I am grateful to you and the Council for
making it possible for me to make a statement on behalf of the
Canadian Government concerning this vitally important issue
which we are now discussing.
My message reflects the same concerns as have been voiced
by many others in the course of this debate. They have already
been strongly expressed by my Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for External Affairs. In addition, the Canadian
House of Commons has unanimously adopted resolutions
indicating the seriousness with which Canadians view the
present situation in Iran. Together with other governments
represented by diplomatie missions in Tehran, Canada has
joined in direct representations to the Government of Iran, and
we have associated ourselves with the statement of Commonwealth representatives made on November 27. But it needs to
be said again in this chamber to make crystal-clear that
Canada, as the next-door neighbour of the United States,
shares completely the American sense of outrage at the abandonment by Iran of its solemn obligations under international
law to maintain and protect the immunity of accredited
diplomats and diplomatie premises.
Canadians recognize, as do al] others, that Iran in the past
year bas been undergoing a particularly difficult political
evolutionary process and that there is a strong sentiment that
the previous administration should be held accountable for
past injustices. But in no way does this give licence for the
present government to follow the course of action it is now
pursuing.

IRAN-SPEECH
UNITED

OF CANADIAN

NATIONS

Iran is a member of the United Nations. Its future welfare is
bound up with other members of the international community.
It could not live as an island unto itself, even if it wanted to.
But if it is to play its proper role as a respected member of this
organization, it must adhere to the conventions and obligations
which are essential to the conduct for them from Iran. Once
the threat to diplomatie personnel and premises has been
removed, the international community will be in a position to
give consideration to the concerns of the Government of Iran.
Mr. President, it has rightly been pointed out that in this
highly dangerous situation it is vital to keep cool heads and not
to lose sight of our goal to achieve a peaceful settlement of the
dispute. We believe that the United Nations has been contributing to this end through the statements issued by your
predecessor as President of the Council and by the President of
the General Assembly. We also commend the action of the
Secretary General in bringing the matter before the Council in
exercise of his responsibilities under Article 99 of the Charter.
The wisdom of this action has been demonstrated by the
measured and constructive tone of the debate in the Council.
We have seen statements in the press that the U.N. is on
trial over its ability to solve this dispute. Of course, that is
nonsense. No inter-governmental institution can take on the
obligation of individual nations to behave responsibly. But my
delegation is convinced that when this crisis is finally resolved,
the record will show that the United Nations, through the
good offices of the Secretary General and the many mechanisms it offers for the airing of differences, will have made a
substantial contribution to peace and to the harmonization of
relations between states.

Wednesday, December 5, 1979

The Senate met at 2 p.m, the Speaker in the Chair.

THE SENATE
POINTS OF ORDER-SPEAKER'S RULING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, at last night's
sitting of the Senate two points of order were referred to me. I
undertook to take them under consideration and to report to
the Senate in due course. Unfortunately, I have not had a
great deal of time to consider the important matters raised in
those two points of order, largely because, as honourable
senators may be aware, the printed Debates of the Senate were
not available until well into the lunch hour today. I am told the
reason for that is that one of the printing machines was
occupied printing the budget papers.
The two points of order were raised in connection with
suggestions made by Senator Haidasz and Senator Bosa, and I
will deal briefly with each of them only to indicate the general
purport of the decisions that I have reached, although I may,
because of the importance of the matters raised, deal with
them at length later on. The point that was raised by Senator
Haidasz's intervention, as honourable senators may remember,
was whether the Chair would entertain with leave a suggestion
on third reading that a recommendation be added to a message
on a bill originating in the Senate and in the course of being
sent back to the House of Commons.
Senator Haidasz indicated that there was a precedent,
which I have examined very carefully. It is rather interesting
that it concerns two of the most distinguished of our senators,
namely, Senator Flynn, P.C. and Senator Lapointe-I am glad
to say, P.C.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am sure we are all honoured, as she
is, by this distinguished honour that has come to her.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am glad to see that Senator
Haidasz is in the chamber. The precedent referred to was
November 21, 1978, when Senator Flynn rose on a point of
order and said:
When the Senate passes a bill in the form in which it
comes to us from the other place but with a recommendation that something be done in respect of that measure,
the other place should be so informed. Hansard of the
other place does not show that they were informed of the
Senate's recommendation in respect of Bill C-5. Also, I
have been told that they did not hear that part of the

report of the committee. That is a question of fact which
Your Honour may verify.
Her Honour took the matter into consideration, and after
pointing out that it had not been normal procedure to attach
such recommendation on third reading, she reached this conclusion, which was the ruling given to the Senate:
In conclusion, it seems to me that whenever a Commons bill is reported without amendment but with recommendations and/or observations, the Speaker, after third
reading, might seek the approval of the Senate to have the
recommendations and/or observations included in the
message to the Commons. The Senate would then decide
and it could be so ordered by the Speaker.
a

(1410)

In the course of the discussion on the point of order,
objection was taken to the suggestion made by Senator Haidasz by Senator Roblin, P.C. for various reasons; but it would
appear on the surface that Senator Haidasz was on very firm
ground-indeed, I once thought he was-with one reservation,
and that is that in this particular case and in one other (the
only other time when this has been done in the recent history
of the Senate) those recommendations were made by the
committee, and were not individual recommendations being
attached at the time of third reading. I would think, therefore,
that that should be an essential condition for the attachment of
any recommendation; otherwise, of course, a situation would
arise in which any senator could rise on third reading and
again raise the whole debate that went on in the committee.
That would hardly seem to be in keeping with normal practice.
The second ground on which I find the precedents are not
fully applicable is that in both cases the bills in question were
Commons bills. There appears to me to be a distinction here
between the attaching of a recommendation to a bill sent back
to the Commons, and to one originating in the Senate, since it
would seem to me, if I may short-cut my reasoning, that there
is an obligation on the Senate to send a bill originating in the
Senate to the Commons whole and entire, and not truncated or
qualified.
That is my ruling. I must compliment Senator Haidasz on
bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, because I
think it is a very important point, and I trust that he and
honourable senators will accept the ruling that I am now
bringing before the Senate.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I wonder, honourable senators,
if I might have leave, without entering into any controversy at
all on this matter, to read some of the proceedings at the end
of the committee meeting in question, which would perhaps
make clear to the Senate that Senator Haidasz did in fact raise

SENATE DEBATES
this point ai the committee, and that 1, as chairmnan, did make
some comment on il ai the lime. Il bears out his suggestion as
t0 what happcned there.
The I-on. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
sena tors?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable scnators, 1 have
before me the unrevised transeript of the meeting of the
Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communiealions held on Thursday, November 29, 1979. 10 consider Bill
S-5, whieh is the bill we are now considering. Towards the end
of the meeting, after the evidenee was eompleted, Senator
Haidasz said, as reporîed in the unrevised transeript:
Si NATOIR I-AIDASZ: 1 am wondering whether il is
advisable for us to send this bill 10 the flouse of Commons
xwith a message, as has bccn donc with previous bis. 1
think we should ask the House of Commons to prevail
upon the President of the Treasury Board to ensure that
enough pcrson-year resources are made available to the
various government agencies, including the Canadian
Transport Commission and Transport Canada, s0 that
they will be able 10 carry oui adequately the provisions of
this bill for the good of the publie and the safe transport
of goods.
To that, according to the transcript, 1, as ehairman, said:
Ti CIIAIRMAN: I think perhaps we should consider
whether or not the contents of the bill require amendmnent
or whether we arc preparcd to report the bill without
amendment. Following that, we can then consider whether or not somiething further should be added to our report.
So far as the content of the bill is concerncd, is the
comimittee prepared to authorize nie 10 report the bill
without amendmenî?
The transcript then reads:
HON. S N ATORS:

Ti-

CHAIRMAN:

Agreed.
If you wish now 10 suggcsl that

someîhing bc added 10 our report. Senator Haidasz, il is
open to discussion. 1 am not asking you 10 repeat what
you have already said.
SI-NATOR HAIDASZ: Mr. Chairman, 1 think 10 include
such a recommendation to the flouse of Commons would
be of somne value. Without repeaîing what 1 have already
said, 1 feel wc should send a message to the House of
Commons requesting that they prevail upon the President
of the Treasury Board 10 allocate sufficient person-year
resources 10 the bodies charged with carrying ouI the
provisions of this bill.
LIEF CHAIRMAN: My recolleclion of such reports does
not go back very many years. 1 do not recaîl having seen
such a report, but that does not mean il is not appropriate.
1 am in the hands of the commilîce as to whether or nol
such a recommendation should form part of our report.
We have the right 10 include in our report anything
which is relevant 10 the subjeet malter of the bill which
[Senator Smith (Colchester).]

we w -h 10 draw 10 the attention of the Senate. 1 should
perhaps say 10 Senator Haidasz that our report is 10 the
Senate, not 10 anyone else.
Meaning the report of the commitîce. of course.
The transeripl then goes on:
Whaî is the view of the commitîc?
SENATOR HAIDASZ: Perhaps il couîd be donc aI the
third reading stage, M4r. Chairman.
Ti CIIAIRMAN: Any individual senator, or number of
senators, are free 10 make any commenîs îhcy want aI
that stage on the basis of the evidence they have heard.
SI-NATOR MARCHANtD: Since îhis has to do with the
adnministration of the bill as opposcd 10 the content, 1 do
not know how far we can go in our report. There are
perhaps other means of discussing our opinion in that
regard.
TOI- CIIAIRMAN: There are a number of alternatives
open 10 any senator. whcîher a member of the commitîce
or not.
SENATOIR DENIS: M4r. Chairman, cither we report the
bill without amendmcent or with amiendimcnî. If an honourable senator wishes 10 make a recommendation in
conneclion wiîh the administration of the legislation, then
that can bc donc aI the third rcading stage.
SENATOR M -EL MAN: There is precedent, M4r. Chairman, in reports of commitîcs 10 the Senate for comment.
TOii CHAIRMAN: Comment on the content of the bill,
you mean?
4cEiMAN: Comment that gocs beyond the

content of the bill. If il werc the wish of the commilîce Io
express the conccrns îhaî have been put forward by
Senator Haidasz, there would bc nolhing wrong in the
committee sîaîîng, in ils report, that on the basis of'
îesîimony rcceived from wiîncsses representing the
Canadian Transport Commission. the commiîîee feels
conccrned that. in staff terms. that Commission may not
be able 10 carry ouI efficienîhy in the public inlerest the
provisions of this bill.
That then puis the concern of the commitîce before the
Senate for discussion.
THE CIIAIRMAN: I do nol sec what that adds. The
evidcncc is available for any action on the part of any
member of the Senate. I am aI the direction of the
commitîce. If the commiîîee insîructs me 10 rcport in that
fashion, I shaîl do so. Il is a question of whethcr or not the
commitîc wishcs to include such a recommendation.
SFNATOR MARCHAND: I have no objection 10 the
recommendation. If there is precedent. I have no objection to doing il in îhaî way.
THE- CHAIRMAN: I repeat. 1 am ai the direction of the
commitîce in this regard.

be an unfair action against the whcat farmers of this country.
So I ask the Leader of the Governmcnt whether he can give us
any reassurance on the points which have been raised in recent
days by the Honourable Senator Argue and others.
Senator Flynn: The obvious reply is that it depends on the
interpretation of the legislation. Yesterday, Senator de Cotret
in his reply seemed to indicate that the law as it stands would
not provide the relief that is sought; but, as I also understood
his reply, we will be looking into this and wc wilI find out if
there is a way of interpreting the legislation in the direction

problcms- I do not know how many of the same kind that
arise in aIl areas of taxation. I do not think it is easy. but I do
not say that there is no solution. In any event, first we shaîl
look into the possibility of having a favourable interpretation
of the law as it stands; secondly, we shaîl find out if by meians
of' legislation we could provide some relief. 1 cannot promise
more than that.

December 5, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Can the leader tell us why the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister has stated that he thinks it highly unlikely he will do
anything more than telephone the President of Imperial Oil,
but that probably a roll-back of prices will not be suggested or
requested? Why does Imperial Oil feel that it must charge an
additional 1.4 cents per gallon, especially in view of its massive
increase in profits in the past 12 months?

Senator Perrault: I am not suggesting to the Leader of the
Government that he or his government should offer an instant
solution to the problem of higher gasoline prices. But there is,
at the very minimum and immediately, a force of moral
suasion, that could be exercised, if warranted, in massive
quantities by the Government of Canada today under these
circumstances. For the Leader of the Government to infer to

Senator Perrault: This is a question, Mr. Leader.
Senator Flynn: It is a very long-winded one.
Senator Perrault: Obviously, there is some discomnfort on
the other side with respect to this question, as there should be.
Can the minister say what steps are being contemplated now
to provide the peuple of Canada with at least the same amnount
of information about the oil industry as is available at the
moment through an agency like Petro-Canada, if PetroCanada is going to be dismantled'?
Senator Flynn: 1 do not understand the reasoning of the
Leader of the Opposition. He says the information is available
through Petro-Canada, but if it is generally available, and if he
is aware of it, why is he asking? If Petro-Canada had indeed
provided him with aIl the answers, then why would he be
looking for more'? This is completely contradictory-but it is
not the first time.
Senator Perrault: We are having a difficult time obtaining
information from the Leader of the Governmnent.
Senator Flynn: No, not at aIl.
Senator Perrault: 1 think it would be better for the Leader
of the Government to say, -I am going to take this question as
notice." and immediately huddle with the Minister of Energy
to get soîne of the answers. I asked the question: Has any
contact been cstablished with Petro-Canada to determine their
attitude with respect tu the Imperia] Oil hike?

Senator Flynn: What has this got to do with Esso?
Senator Perrault: It happens to be a governiment entity
which knows something about the oil industry. Perhaps an
opinion should be sought from Petro-Canada and from other
areas with respect to this price increase.
Senator Flynn: If you believe that Petro-Canada knows
everything, then surely you would have that information ai
hand-since you apparently know everything there is to know
about Petro-Canada. 1 do not mind replying to questions that
areSenator Muir: Sensible?
Senator Flynn: Weil, yes; but that would be perhaps tou
much to expeet. 1 do not mind answering questions that are up
Io an acceptable level.
Senator Lamnontagne: Let us get sensible answers.
Senator Flynn: How can you give a sensible answer tu a
nonsensical question'?
The Leader of the Opposition has been charging the government this afternioont with responsibility for everything that is
going on in the area of oil reserves, and su on and su forth, but
after ail, there is nu new legislation in this respect. There will
bc an announcement of the government's cnergy policy in due
course. You needn't wait long. 1 simply ask the Leader of the
Opposition to be patient, and 1 would point out that every
problemn that we have today stems frum the position that we
inherited when we formed the government.
Senator Oison: Oh, nu.
Senator Flynn: 0f course, it ducs. Senator OIson says, "Oh,
nu," but how can he prove otherwise? Really, 1 am just asking
you: What can the guverniment do at this timne before the
energy pulicy is announced? If you wanî me to telephone the
President of Imperial Ou, of course, I can do su, but I am
reasonably sure that that has been dune, I have been busy with
other matters this morning. I would like to check, however,
and if the Leader of the Opposition has only this question to
ask me, 1 will answer, -Yes, I will check and report tumurruw;" but this was not the intention of his question. IHe wanted
to debate the matter, and criticize and argue and create fears
in the population instead of trying tu help tu suIve the problems that face us. That is the only attitude that I can discern
in the remnarks of the Leader of the Opposition.
Senator Perrault: Weil, honourable senators, the Leader of
the Government is obviously in a bad mioud today, and nut as
forthcoming as usual.
The question is utterly simple. We are asking the Leader of
the Guvernment tu ensure that this guvernment monitors
properly the cost side and the profit side, and ail other aspects,
of the oul industry, and tu reassure the hard-pressed Canadian
peuple that they are nut paying inurdinate amounts for gas and
oil produets. Today's muve by Imperial Oil a price leader in
the industry-is enough to warrant a special meeting of cabinet tu consider the situation and possible courses of action.
This is what we are suggesting.

December 5, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

We are suggesting that information be sought with respect
to the Imperial Oil situation, and that officials be dispatched
to Imperial Oil to discuss with them the figures that have
inspired this increase. We suggest also that perhaps PetroCanada's expertise be employed by the government to analyze
the need for an increase by Imperial Oil. This is what we are
asking on behalf of the Canadian people.
Senator Flynn: It is obvious that the government would be
monitoring the situation, and is doing everything within its
power to try to find a solution to the problem. You did not
need to ask, to be reassured on that matter.
Senator Olson: May i ask a supplementary question? I hope
i can put it in such a way that it will not annoy the Leader of
the Government.
Senator Flynn: Well, you may possibly be more successful
than your leader.
Senator Olson: i am going to try very hard, anyway.
First of all, we know that the price of crude oil in Canada is
fixed by the federal government, in agreement with the provincial governments, particularly the producing provinces, all
across the country, and that subsidies are paid by the federal
government to those refiners bringing in offshore oil so that
the price is uniform across the country. As far as we know that
price has not changed.
Senator Flynn: Which price?
Senator Olson: It might change, but it has not changed in
the last few days, since Imperial Oil have increased their prices
from 1.4 cents, for some products, to 2.6 cents for other
products. In view of the fact that their increase in profits for
the last year that they reported were very substantial, we
would just like the government to make some inquiries.
When the Leader of the Government says he has no legislative tools to deal with this situation, he must have forgotten the
Energy Supplies Emergency Act which was passed in the last
session and which gives the federal government power to do all
of these things if it chooses to do so. This increase on the part
of Imperial Oil appears to be unjustifiable since there has been
no increase in the price of the feedstocks-that is, the crude oil
going into any refinery anywhere in Canada-since last July.
What is the reason for a 2.6 cent increase now?
Senator Flynn: Senator Olson may think be has refined the
question put by his leader, but, in fact, it is the same question
and I do not see that I can add anything to what I have
already said. The government is monitoring the situation and
is looking at the steps that can be taken. In any event the
government has no interest in not doing what is required to
protect the Canadian public. I can assure the honourable
senator that the government will not hesitate to do anything
within its power to solve this problem.
PROFITS OF OIL COMPANIES FROM CANADIAN OPERATIONS

Senator Croli: Honourable senators, i have a question which
i think is related to the subject under discussion. The question

is directed to the minister who is not here, and i therefore ask
the Leader of the Government to take it as notice.
There is a report in the Globe and Mail of today to the
following effect:
Gulf Canada Ltd. of Toronto now is estimating that its
1979 profit will be close to 50 per cent higher than in
1978, John Stoik, president and chief executive, says.
My question is a very simple one. All i want to know is how
much profit from Canadian operations did Gulf, Amoco,
Texaco, Shell, Mobil and Imperial make in Canada in the last
two years?
Senator Flynn: You are asking what the profits of these
companies have been over the last two years?
Senator Croll: Yes, in Canada, from Canadian operations.
Senator Flynn: Well, that is a question that could be put on
the Order Paper, but i will take it as notice.
ATLANTIC PROVINCES-SECURITY OF FUEL OIL SUPPLIES

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, i have a question
with respect to energy and oil supplies as well, which I would
ask the Leader of the Government to take as notice.
*

(1450)

Within the last 24 hours it has been reported that supplies of
crude oil for the Gulf Oil refinery at Port Hawkesbury, Nova
Scotia, have been cut off. That, i believe, is the only oil
refinery in the Atlantic provinces which obtains its supply
from Iran.
In this case, the report states, because Gulf Canada obtains
its supplies through arrangements made by its principal, U.S.
Gulf, that it has been affected by the policy of Iranians to eut
off supplies to the United States, so it is reflected in the
Canadian supply picture.
Therefore, i would ask the Leader of the Government to
determine and advise the Senate what action is being taken, or
will be taken, by the government through Petro-Canada, or
whatever other means, to ensure that supplies of heating oil
this winter will be made available to the customers of Gulf,
because the report states that their supply will run out in
February 1980, which is the depth of winter in the Atlantic
provinces.
Senator Flynn: I will endeavour to obtain a detailed answer
to the honourable senator's question, but I can assure him that
the government is looking into this situation, and it will take
whatever measures are appropriate and feasible to face the
situation.
Senator McElman: I thank the leader.
ATLANTIC PROVINCES AND QUEBEC-STORAGE CAPACITY FOR
CRUDE AND REFINED OIL

Senator McElman: I have a further question to pose to the
Leader of the Government with respect to energy in the
Atlantic area. During the period when feedstock supplies of
crude oil for the refineries of the Atlantic coast and Quebec

SENATE DEBATES
east were readily available-before the OPEC nations created
the difficulties that we have experienced since the Yom Kippur
war-it was understandable that the storage facilities both for
crude as feedstock and for the refined product could be kept
at, if I might use the term, a hand-to-mouth level because
supplies in those days were assured. However, since the Yom
Kippur war, obviously there could not be assurances of supply.
My question is-and I realize this will have to be taken as
notice as well-will the Leader of the Government obtain from
his colleague in the cabinet details of what increases in storage
capacity, both for feedstock crude and for refined product,
have been put in place by those companies in the Atlantic
provinces in particular, and perhaps Quebec as well, to give
them greater capacity so that they will have supply for a
longer period of time to offset interruptions in regular supply
during that period?
I ask the question, quite obviously, because many of us have
doubts as to the sincerity of some of the major oil companies in
meeting the needs of Canadians. I think that their capital
investment in this area is a good measure of the sincerity of
their contribution to the Canadian energy situation.
Senator Flynn: I shall take that question as notice, of course.
At the same time, I can find out what encouragement was
given to these companies by the previous administration to do
what the honourable senator suggests they should have donc.
Senator McElman: Honourable senators, I appreciate the
answer given by the Leader of the Government up to a point. I
was very careful to avoid any political reference to this
administration or any previous administration. I assure him
that my interest is for the Atlantic provinces and their citizens
who must have heating oil this winter, and I could not give one
tinker's dam what goveriment might be responsible.
Senator Flynn: I agree. I did not mean to disagree with what
the honourable senator himself was saying. I am just indicating that some of these situations can hardly be remedied in a
few months, and that sometimes actions that could have been
taken some years ago were not taken and have to be considered
at this time when we are trying to solve situations such as the
one described by the honourable senator.
Senator McElman: I will check the Debates of the Senate
very carefully to sec if there was anything in my question that
could have elicited such a response.
Senator Flynn: I think I made it clear, that I was not hitting
back at the honourable senator himself. I believe that what I
was proposing should certainly be part of the response 1 give, if
he wants a complete answer. If he only wants a partial answer,
of course, I will avoid referring to that other part of the
problem.

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED-ANNOUNCED INCREASE

IN

PRICE OF

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question for the Leader of the Government. Why did
the government abolish the price review agency which,
[Senator MIcElian.]

Decemnber 5, 1979

immediately after the announcement by Imperial Oi, could
have looked into this problem objectively to determine whether
or not the price increase was justified, and then informed the
public immediately rather than force the Prime Minister to
phone Imperial Oil management to get details?
Senator Flynn: I am not certain whether this government or
the former government abolished that agency. I do not think
the absence of that agency would prevent the government-I
mean the government in general, not the Prime Minister in
particular-from making all those checks the honourable senator suggests. I am sure they have been made and a report will
be filed in due course in the same way as if the agency had
continued to exist.
[English]
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, before the Orders of
the Day are called, I wonder if I might have permission to give
some information about the intention of the government with
respect to tomorrow's proceedings. I refer particularly to Bill
C-17, the subject matter of which has been before the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce for
some time. The committee is expected to report to the Senate
tomorrow afternoon.
It is the hope of the government that we can dispose of
second reading of that bill tomorrow, and then, with leave of
the Senate, proceed directly to third reading on the saine day.
I thought it advisable to give notice of this intention so that
honourable senators can reflect upon it when the time comes.
NATIONAL UNITY
QUEBEC WHITE PAPER ON SOVEREIGNTY ASSOCIATION
REFERENDUM-CONSTITUTIONAL OPTIONS

The Hon. the Speaker: Are there any delayed answers?
[Translation]
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I refer to a question
Senator Lamontagne asked me, I think it was last week, about
the intentions of the government at this time to publish an
answer to the Quebec white paper.
I believe the government clearly indicated that, as far as it is
concerned, the white paper or the proposal contained in the
white paper is totally unacceptable because it is totally incompatible with our concept of federalism. As government ministers, as members of the Progressive Conservative Party, we
will join with all other federalists in Quebec to make our views
clearly known to our fellow citizens.
I know the government does not intend to release a paper,
but it will continue to make the decisions that will show
Quebecers once again we are not captive of the status quo and
whenever appropriate we will provide all information useful to
the debates that will be taking place in this house.
Senator Lamontagne: If I understand correctly, the government, as the federal government, does not intend to answer the

December 5, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

false accusations contained in the white paper about federal
policies with respect to Quebec?
Senator Flynn: No, that is not what I said. We do not intend
to issue an answer, word for word, to the white paper. We are
going to make our position known. We will provide proponents
of the federalist cause with all useful information. We do not
believe it is necessary to use the policy of an official reply by
the federal government to the white paper because, in the final
analysis, there are all sorts of points of view. Some people see
the problem in one way, others see it in another way. I believe
it would be unwise for us federalists to lock ourselves into a
single answer which could bring a lot of discussions. Suppose,
for example, that if the response were written by Senator
Lamontagne, it might not meet my views. I would prefer to
have a more flexible formula to meet the white paper
proposals.

MULTICULTURALISM
CANADIAN CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL ON MULTICULTURALISM
AS SOURCE OF ADVICE

Senator Flynn: I should like to reply to a question Senator
Bosa asked last week in which he referred to a statement on
multiculturalism issued by the Progressive Conservative Party
on May 3, 1979, expressing faith in the Canadian Consultative
Council on Multiculturalism.
The Minister of State for Multiculturalism has advised me
that the May 3 statement has been carefully reviewed. It has
been decided that the Council shall function as a policy
management group providing advice to the minister on matters
pertaining to Canada's ethnocultural minorities, rather than as
a body with financial responsibility.
That is the reply I obtained from the minister.
Senator Bosa: I wonder if I could put a supplementary
question to the minister.
Senator Flynn: Certainly.
Senator Bosa: First, I should like to praise some initiatives
that this government has taken concerning the whole question
of multiculturalism. I should like to point out that in that same
statement on multiculturalism there is this sentence:
We recognize that providing our ethnic communities
with the authority to monitor and give advice is no
guarantee that their advice will be followed.
It goes on to say that a Progressive Conservative government will therefore give the CCCM additional authority to
report directly to the Parliament of Canada, and I should like
to ask the Leader of the Government what mechanism the
Consultative Council will employ in order to report directly to
Parliament when the Council perceives that the government is
not following the advice it bas been given.
Senator Flynn: I will obtain a reply from the minister.

HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE

BANNING OF .5 LITRE SOFT DRINK BOTTLES-SUBJECT MATTER
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, November 28, the
debate on the motion of Senator Deschatelets:
That the matter regarding the banning of 1.5-litre
bottles from the soft drink producers in Canada be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science.
Senator Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to speak at any length on this motion. Certainly, the
last speaker, Senator Buckwold, overcame some of the concerns I had regarding the matter.
I would remind you that both the inquiry and the motion
dealt with the adverse effects on the Canadian economy of the
banning of these 1.5-litre bottles from the soft drink industry.
Senator Buckwold's amendment changed that and in so doing
shifted the emphasis from the adverse effects on the industry
to the adverse effects on the public. His motion reads:
That the matter regarding the banning of 1.5-litre
boules from the soft drink producers in Canada be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
Welfare and Science.
I was glad of that amendment because up to then the
emphasis, to my way of thinking, had been in the wrong
direction. It was on the injury which might be done to the
bottlers, to the industry, while at the same time nothing was
being said about the injuries which might occur to the consuming public if those bottles were retained by the industry.
Some people have said, "Well, perhaps the minister overreacted. Perhaps there wasn't that much danger." "After all,"
some said, "there have only been about 50 people injured in
the last while back." Indeed, some went so far as to suggest
that if the newspapers had not made so much of it, there would
have been no fuss about it, and these poor people who were
injured would not have said anything about it. Others suggested that it was just one of the normal dangers that people are
exposed to. In fact, one spokesman for the soft drink producers
said, "Well, nothing is perfect."
It must be small consolation to the person who has lost an
eye through the explosion of one of these bottles to know that,
after all, it happened only to him and was not something that
was happening to everybody who had in his possession one of
these 1.5-litre bottles.
I certainly think that our first priority should be to consider
the danger to the public. If the danger to the public is there,
then it is the duty of the minister to do what he can to
overcome such danger, regardless of what adverse effect that
might have on those in the bottling industry. It then seems to
me that the question is whether the minister did over-react.
Was there a danger? Perhaps I could make one or two
observations on that point.
You will remember that first the minister asked the industry
to take those bottles off the shelves of the stores. That request
was not complied with. He then felt he had to enforce a ban.

SENATE DEBATES

December 5, 1979

Let me read to you what the Globe and Mail of August 11,
1979, had to say on this matter:
The 50 Canadians injured by glass fragments from
exploding 1.5-litre pop bottles will probably be unimpressed by the argument that they were oddities in sales
that run to 350 million a year. It is not easy, while
changing the dressing on the wound, to regard oneself as
part of an acceptable casualty margin to be sacrificed
philosophically on the altar of national thirst.
The federal government, fortunately, does not look at
the matter in this light; nor does it apparently consider
the hazard to be something fanned into flame by an
irresponsible press. Accordingly, Consumer and Corporate Affairs Minister Allan Lawrence has taken the sensible course of ordering a ban on the sales of soft drink
bottles of this size until they can meet new safety
standards.
There are other quotations along the same lines, but I will not
bother to read them into the record.
Having said that, may I say that I will be pleased to support
the motion to refer this matter to committee. Indeed, let us get
it before the committee so both sides can be heard. Let us
know just what the danger was. Let us know if the minister
over-reacted or if, on the contrary, he waited too long to act.
I say that the soft drink industry must be prepared to
answer some pretty pertinent questions. For example, what
research did the soft drink industry do on these bottles before
using them? Did they know that under certain circumstances
the bottles would explode? If they knew that, did they then,
knowingly, put those dangerous bottles before the public?
Those are questions that need to be answered.
It has been suggested that the ban on those bottles was put
into effect as a result of the chain stores and supermarkets
putting pressure on the minister. Well, let us bring that out in
the open also. If it was not a danger, but merely pressure
which brought about the ban, then we had all better know
that. If they can make the bottles safe, then why did they not
make them safe from the start? Within two weeks, the CocaCola Company came up with a method whereby the bottles
could be made safer. Research of that kind cannot be completed within two weeks. The company must have known in the
first instance that the bottles were unsafe and were just
preparing themselves for the time when public opinion
impressed upon the minister the need to ban them.

Welfare and Science, of which I have the honour of being the
chairman. The motion emphasizes an ambiguity which, in my
opinion, exists in the structure of our committees. The effect
on the economy of the banning of 1.5-litre bottles was mentioned in the original motion, which was then changed by
Senator Buckwold to have reference to the health hazard. Both
aspects are correct.

e

Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, is this not a question
of balancing one matter against another-that is, the health of
the population against the commercial effects? One could not
find a more obvious instance than the automobile industry.
Thousands of people are killed every year by automobiles, yet
no one is proposing that they be banned.

(1510)

There are a number of questions that we could ask the
manufacturers of soft drinks when their representatives come
before the committee. For those reasons, let us have them
appear before the committee. Let us have the answers. In the
case of those people who have been adversely affected-and
they have been, because it was inevitable-it is a question of
"too bad"; concern for the people who use these bottles must
come first.
Senator Marshall: Honourable senators, this matter has
been referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health,
[Senator Macdonald.]

The matter of the 1.5-litre bottles comes under the responsibility of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.
Consumer and Corporate Affairs, in the structure of our
committees, comes under Banking, Trade and Commerce.
I point that out to emphasize the ambiguity which exists in
the structure of our committees. In my opinion, the consumer
aspect should come under Health, Welfare and Science. I
would point out to honourable senators that because of changing conditions, and the realities of today in the parliamentary
process, it might be wise to consider having a review of our
committees as presently structured, with a view to changing
them to suit the conditions of the day and to meet our
responsibility to the Canadian public.
Senator Deschatelets: May I ask the honourable senator a
question? In view of the fact that the banning of the bottles is
based on the security of the public, does the honourable
senator not consider that the matter comes within the jurisdiction of his committee? It was originally thought that the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee should be concerned with this matter, but because the motion involved
public safety it was agreed that the honourable senator's
committee should investigate it.
Senator Marshall: The honourable senator is perfectly correct, and I have no objection to this matter being referred to
my committee. I was merely trying to point out the ambiguity
which exists in our committee structure. It was emphasized
that Senator Deschatelets' motion was appropriate, as also was
Senator Buckwold's. I can only repeat that the motion is to
refer the matter to the Health, Welfare and Science Committee when Consumer and Corporate Affairs falls within the
confines of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee. I
accept the decision of the house. I will be pleased to chair the
committee and we shall try to determine where the fault lies. I
believe the honourable senator is perfectly correct.

Senator Marshall: Honourable senators, I can only repeat
that there is an ambiguity in the way our committees are
structured, and I think the situation should be reviewed.
Motion agreed to.

Wednesday, December 5, 1979
General Introduction
On October 23, 1979, the Minister of Finance, the Honourable John Crosbie, presented to the House of Commons for
first reading Bill C-14, "An Act to revise the Bank Act, to
amend the Quebec Savings Banks Act, to establish the Canadian Payments Association and to amend other Acts in consequence thereof." This Act is cited as the "Bank and Banking
Law Revision Act, 1979". On November 1, 1979 the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce was
authorized by the Senate to examine and consider the subject
matter of Bill C-14 in advance of the said Bill coming before
the Senate, or any matter relating thereto.
In accordance with the Order of Reference, your Committee
gave careful consideration to Bill C-14 and in connection
therewith had the benefit of the services and expert assistance
of Mr. John F. Lewis, C.A., financial consultant, retired
partner of Thorne, Riddell, Chartered Accountants as advisor
to the Committee and retained its legal Counsel, Mr. David
W. Scott, Q.C., of Scott & Aylen.
It will be remembered that the history of this decennial
revision of banking legislation included a White Paper on the
Revision of Canadian Banking Legislation which was issued in
August, 1976. Your Committee examined that document,
heard witnesses, and submitted its report to the Senate in
June, 1977. Many of the recommendations of your Committee
on that document were implemented in the banking legislation
of Bill C-15 of the Fourth Session of Parliament which was
introduced by the Honourable Jean Chrétien, Minister of
Finance on November 2, 1978.
Your Committee, assisted by the same advisers, John F.
Lewis and David W. Scott, studied Bill C-15, heard witnesses
and reported to the Senate on March 7, 1979.
In the course of its study on Bill C-15 your Committee held
seventeen meetings during which witnesses were heard, and
also received and studied a number of briefs from organizations which did not appear before the Committee. Bill C-15
reflected twenty-four amendments proposed by your Committee as a result of its study and recommendations on the White
Paper, of which five represented instances where your Committee's opinion did not agree with the White Paper proposals.
In approximately five additional instances your Committee's
recommendations on the White Paper proposals were partly
implemented in Bill C- 15. Approximately fifteen of your Committee's recommendations made in its report on the White
Paper were not incorporated in Bill C- 15.
As part of its study of Bill C-14 your Committee held ten
meetings, of which five were devoted to study of the Bill and
review of this report. Mr. W. A. Kennett, Inspector General of
Banks, together with members of his staff, appeared as witnesses before the Committee at three of the sessions.
In its report of March 8, 1979, on the subject-matter of Bill
C- 15, your Committee made forty-two recommendations for
amendments to the banking legislation as proposed in that Bill.

Of these, approximately twenty-five of your Committee's
recommendations have been accepted in full in Bill C-14,
approximately ten have been accepted in part, and seven have
not been accepted.
In addition, the recommendations with respect to the proposed legislation included approximately ten recommendations
for changes in the draft proposed regulations which were
issued by the Minister of Finance in conjunction with Bill
C-15. Because all of these regulations in their amended form
have not been reissued at this date, your Committee does not
consider it advisable to comment in detail at this time on the
few amended redrafts of regulations which have been issued so
far.

Summary of Legislation
Because the process of this decennial revision of the Bank
Act has been spread over a period of a few years including the
publication of a White Paper and separate bills to three
sessions of Parliament, it might be of some assistance to
summarize for the reader the content of the legislation culminating in Bill C-14.
Bill C-14 contains not only an amended Bank Act and the
new Canadian Payments Association Act, but also important
amendments to other related acts, as follows:
PART I The Bank Act, (pages 1 to 343 of Bill C-14)
PART II Amendments to the Quebec Savings Banks Act
(pages 344-414 of Bill C-14)
PART III Amendments to the Bank of Canada Acts
(pages 415-421 of Bill C-14)
PART IV An Act to establish the Canadian Payments
Association (pages 422-439 of Bill C-14)
Related and Consequential Amendments to
other legislation (pages 440-457 of Bill C-14)
It should also be noted that Part I of Bill C-14, being the
new Bank Act contains approximately four hundred provisions
which are based on equivalent provisions of the Canadian
Business CorporationsAct.
The main changes contemplated in this decennial review of
the banking system might be summarized as follows:
(1) changes in primary cash reserves required to be provided
by Canadian banks;
(2) entry to new banks into the banking system in Canada
either by Special Act of Parliament or Letters Patent;
(3) entry and control of and conditions for the operation in
Canada of foreign bank subsidiaries incorporated under
the new Bank Act;

In its report on Bill C- 15, your Committee summarized the
manner in which Bill C- 15, in its various aspects, implemented
the White Paper proposals and the extent to which the recommendations of your Committee had been effected. This report
will not repeat those observations nor deal with many of the
new amendments proposed in Bill C-14 which reflect your
Committee's recommendations in a general or reasonable
manner, nor comment on the many technical and editing
changes arising from the recommendations of this Committee
and other interested parties.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE:
The Committee's main recommendations with respect to
Bill C-14 concern the following subjects.
1. A FORM OF PUBLIC REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS
FOR INCORPORATION
2.

EXTENSION OF SECTION 88 SECURITY (SECTION 177 OF THE BILL) TO INCLUDE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL INVENTORIES

1. Method of Incorporation of New Banks and Form of
Review
Bill C-14 contemplates the same basic process for incorporation of new banks as was contained in the predecessor Bill.
Letters Patent of Incorporation will be granted upon the
exercise of discretion of the Minister through the Governor-inCouncil. The Bill does not contemplate any form of public
review.
Your Committee in response to both the White Paper and
the predecessor Bill (Bill C-15) expressed its deep concern that
new banks would hereafter be incorporated without the protection afforded by public scrutiny. In its report with respect to
Bill C-15 it urged that a form of public review either through
the office of the Inspector General or by Parliamentary Committee be incorporated into the proposed legislation. This
recommendation has to date not been implemented in the new
Bill.
During its hearings with respect to the subject matter of Bill
C-14, your Committee has again reviewed this matter in detail
and debated it from a variety of points of view. Your Committee remains more convinced than ever that some form of public
review prior to the incorporation of a new bank is essential.
The legislative leap from the present situation, which involves
a detailed public scrutiny through the process of passage of an
Act of Parliament, to the proposed system which would involve
no public scrutiny whatever is, in the opinion of your Committee, undesirable and represents the assumption of a calculated
risk as to the prospective dilatorious side effects of administra-

December 5, 1979
December 5, 1979

tive decision making which the exemplary Canadian banking
system should not be required to assume.
In the circumstances, your Committee once again recommends the adoption of a system of public review of applications for Letters Patent of Incorporation whether for the
incorporation of a new bank made up entirely of domestic
applicants, or for the incorporation of a foreign bank subsidiary as contemplated by the terms of the Bill. In its report with
respect to Bill C-15, your Committee recommended a review
by either the Inspector General of Banks or some other
appropriate Commission, Commissioner or Parliamentary
Committee. As a result of its extensive deliberations in
response to the present Bill your Committee has settled on the
desirability of the Inspector General conducting the public
hearing in question.
(a) The Inspector General as the Reviewing Agency
After deliberation your Committee has concluded that a
Parliamentary form of review would be inappropriate in the
context of the present Bill. It is anticipated that there will be a
great number of applications to incorporate new banks, particularly foreign bank subsidiaries, in accordance with the
terms of the Bill. This has not been the case heretofore in that
applications by way of incorporation by Act of Parliament
have been limited in number. In the circumstances, until now,
Parliament has been quite able to cope with the burden of
public review of Bills to incorporate new Banks. It is your
Committee's opinion that Parliament would not be able to
cope with such a system of review, even if the occasion for
review was selective, in the light of the anticipated numbers of
such applications in the future. The result, if parliamentary
review were implemented would be, in the view of your
Committee, a serious impediment to the orderly discharge of
other equally important parliamentary business.
In the circumstances, and in accordance with the scheme set
out hereunder, your Committee recommends that the public
review in question be conducted by the Inspector General of
Banks or such alternative person or body of persons as may be
designated by Regulation.
(b) Publication of the Application
The publication of the application for incorporation by
Letters Patent as contemplated by the present Bill should be
continued, that is to say there should be appropriate publication in the Canada Gazette at regular intervals. In addition
consideration should be given to publication in other periodicals having a more practical circulation, i.e. daily newspapers
with an appropriate geographical spread. The publication of
the application should contemplate intervention in the application by interested members of the public which intervention, as
hereinafter set out, may trigger the convening of a public
hearing.
(c) Factors Dictating a Public Hearing
Your Committee considered whether or not there should be
a hearing in every case of an application for incorporation, or

December 5, 1979
December 5, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

whether hearings should be limited to those, either sought by
the public, or determined to be required in the discretion of the
Minister. Your Committee bas concluded that the circumstances require an amalgam of several concepts. In the first
place where responsible, legitimately interested members of
the public seek a hearing, a hearing should be granted. By the
same token the reaction of a given member of the public ought
not to trigger the requirement for a hearing where that
member of the public does not represent in a reasonably
practical way a legitimate interest of the public. By the same
token leaving the matter entirely to an unfettered ministerial
discretion is likely to put undue pressure on the Minister and
give rise to undesirable litigation. In the circumstances your
Committee recommends that a public hearing should be held
in all cases where, in the exercise of his discretion, the Minister regards it as being in the public interest that such a hearing
be held or, alternatively where he is satisfied that a member or
members of the public, who represent a legitimate public
interest, have sought such a hearing.
(d)

Form of the Hearing

Obviously the hearing should be in public and there should
be an opportunity for representation by the applicant, or
applicants, for Letters Patent of Incorporation, and for interested intervenants. Once an occasion for a public hearing has
been established participation should not be limited to the
interested group or groups whose demonstration of interest
triggered the exercise of Ministerial discretion. The process
should be one of a hearing designed to elicit information and
should not be unduly adversarial in nature. There should be an
opportunity to tender evidence, cross-examine witnesses and to
make appropriate submissions.
(e)

Scope of the Hearing
In the view of your Committee it will be important to
establish, with some reasonably precise definition, the scope of
the hearing. Obviously the intention is that the hearing will
provide the Minister with sufficient information to enable him
to properly exercise his discretion, in the public interest, as to
whether or not Letters Patent of Incorporation should issue.
The basic question in the case of all applications should be one
of whether or not it has been made to appear that the
applicants have the potential to make a contribution to banking in Canada, and that it is in the public interest that Letters
Patent of Incorporation be granted to them. This would probably be sufficiently broad to enable the tribunal to explore not
only the applicant's banking strategy and the climate, but also
the underlying capitalization and the financial and personal
integrity of the promoters.
(f)

Foreign Bank Subsidiaries

It is important, in accordance with the spirit of reciprocity,
not to impede the incorporation of foreign bank subsidiaries by
substantive requirements that exceed those for domestic applicants, and which are not to be found in the home territory of
the Applicant. Your Committee is of the view that the require-

ment of a public hearing does not amount to such an impediment particularly where the same requirement is imposed on
domestic applicants. On the other hand in accordance with the
scheme of Bill C-14, there are two features which make the
situation for applicants for incorporation of foreign bank subsidiaries unique. In the first place Clause 8 of the Bill contemplates that the Minister will exercise his discretion upon
criteria, of competitive potential, and whether or not reasonable reciprocity exists with respect to the applicant's home
territory. In the circumstances, in the case of foreign bank
subsidiaries, the scope of the hearing would have to be widened
to include an inquiry as to competitive potential and whether
or not reasonable reciprocity exists as between Canada and the
jurisdiction in which the parent of a foreign bank subsidiary
carries on its principal banking operation.
Secondly, the limitations on growth and size for foreign
bank subsidiaries, as set out in the Bill, have at least the
potential for defining, in finite terms, the field which may be
occupied by such institutions in the Canadian banking system.
This will require the Minister to exercise his discretion in an
enlightened and fair manner in order to ensure that there is an
even distribution of opportunity for foreign bank subsidiaries.
The segment of the available market which will be accorded to
any one applicant will have to be the subject of careful
scrutiny. In the circumstances, the subject of the authorized
capital which will be accorded initially to any single foreign
bank subsidiary will, necessarily, have to be explored in the
public review process.
(g)

Jurisdiction of the Inspector General
Your Committee recommends that the Inspector General's
jurisdiction in the hearing process be confined to a power to
recommend to the Minister whether or not Letters Patent
ought to issue, together with recommending any conditions
which ought to be imposed in the terms of such Letters Patent.
Your Committee does not consider it desirable to replace the
exercise of ministerial discretion with a binding decision of an
administrative tribunal. Its purpose in recommending public
review is two-fold, namely to ensure that all relevant considerations are clearly and squarely before the Minister, and
secondly to ensure that the public has a detailed understanding
of the basis upon which an application has been approved or
rejected.
(h)

Appeals from the Decision of the Inspector General

In view of the fact that the Inspector General would have
power to recommend only in accordance with the scheme
contemplated by your Committee, a substantive right of
appeal from his recommendation would be procedurally inappropriate. On the other hand, and apart altogether from
statutory judicial review under the Federal Court Act, there
should probably be an opportunity for reconsideration of the
matter subsequent to the exercise of ministerial discretion.
Accordingly your Committee recommends that there be provision for an appeal to the Cabinet from the decision of the
Minister as is provided in other similar Federal legislation.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
(i)

Licensing Review
Your Committee considered at length the question of whether or not the public review should take place as part of the
process of the grant of Letters Patent of Incorporation or as
part of the licensing process. Your Committee is of the opinion
that the public hearing should be associated with the grant of
Letters Patent initially. Only foreign bank subsidiaries are
required to be licensed and thus if the public hearing was
limited to the licensing process there would be no public
hearing associated with the incorporation of domestic institutions. Secondly, in the public interest it may be desirable for
the Inspector General to make representations as to the form
and content of Letters Patent of Incorporation, consequent
upon the public review, and this opportunity would be lost if
the public review was limited to the licensing process only.

the requirements of the large majority of wholesalers and
retailers of manufactured goods.
In this connection the Canadian Banker's Association stated
in their report "Where the Bank Act Revision Stands", page
16, "The Association is taking the view that there does not
seem to be a real need for bringing wholesale and retail
inventories under the section. Suppliers' trade credit together
with some bank financing fills this need now, and duplication
is unnecessary."
Your Committee believes that this extension of the availability of "Section 88" security for loans by banks to wholesalers and retailers would, in the long run, tend to reduce their
lines of credit rather than enlarge them. In the first place, if
such security is available to a bank for existing loans there
could be a tendency on the bank's part to urge the borrower to

one can conceive of the system becoming, to say the least,
cluttered.
It would appear to your Committee that the opening up of
Section 177 security to wholesalers and retailers would greatly
enlarge the area opportunity for conflicting jurisdiction and
would result in a significant amount of confusion. Your Committee did not receive any briefs or testimony during its study
of Bill C-14 which were favourable to the enlargement of the
security presently offered by Section 88 of the Bank Act.
Whatever research, if any, has been undertaken into the need
for this amendment or into its possible negative and damaging
effects bas not been made available to your Committee.
RECOMMENDATION
Your Committee recommends that the amendment to Section 177 proposed in Bill C-14 which would extend the
security for loans by a bank to any wholesale or retail
purchaser or shipper of or dealers in "goods, wares and
merchandise, manufacturer or otherwise, on the security of
such goods, wares and merchandise" requires further consideration and that accordingly it should not be approved in
its presentform.
I THE BANK ACT
REVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES TO
LEGISLATION PROPOSED IN BILL C-14
The following summary notes a number of amendments to
the proposed legislation most of which give effect to the
recommendations of your Committee in Bill C- 15.
1. Reserves
(i) Reduction in Primary Reserve Requirement
Your Committee's report on the White Paper recommended
that the mandatory primary cash reserves required of Chartered Banks be reduced from 12% of demand deposits and 4%
of notice deposits payable in Canadian currency to 10% and
3% respectively. This recommendation has been accepted in
the proposed legislation. However, the legislation proposed in
Bill C- 15 called for a phasing-in of the reductions in rates over
a four and one-half year period. In its report on Bill C-15, your
Committee recommended that this phasing-in period be
reduced to twelve months. Bill C-14 has been amended by
reducing this period from four and one-half years to three and
one-half years. This reduction partly meets your Committee's
views that the phasing-in period was longer than necessary
from the point of view of the ability of the banking system to
absorb its effects without any undue disturbance. Your Committee, however, bas no further recommendations to make in
this regard.
(ii) Reserves on Foreign Currency Deposits
Both the White Paper and Bill C-15 proposed that banks be
required to maintain primary and secondary reserves of three
percent of its foreign currency deposits used domestically. As a
result of its study and hearings on Bill C-15, your Committee
concluded that the imposition of this 3% reserve would place

Canadian banks at a competitive disadvantage when competing with foreign banks for foreign currency loans to borrowers
in Canada. Your Committee recommended therefore that Bill
C- 15 be amended in such a manner as to remove this competitive disadvantage.
Your Committee is pleased to see that proposed subsection
204(1)(g) now bas been amended so as to have the 3% reserve
requirement apply to "foreign currency deposit liabilities of
residents of Canada with branches of the bank in Canada or
with offices in Canada of subsidiaries of the bank." The
proposed secondary reserve requirement also bas been amended accordingly. Subsection 204(8)(e) bas been added so as to
exempt "Canadian currency deposits of non-residents with
branches of the bank outside Canada or with offices outside
Canada of subsidiaries of the bank." As a result of its studies
your Committee has concluded that these proposed amendments included in Bill C-14 with respect to reserves on foreign
currency deposits should overcome effectively the perceived
difficulties presented by the previously proposed legislation of
Bill C-15.
(iii)

Exemption of Term Deposits from Reserve Requirement
(Subsection 204(8)(d))
Bill C-14 continues the proposed exemption from reserve
requirements of Canadian currency deposits from Residents of
Canada with an original term to maturity of one year or more
if such deposits are not encashable; also exempted should be
encashable Canadian currency deposits from residents of
Canada that are not encashable until one year from date of
issue.
In its reports on the White Paper and on Bill C-15 your
Committee recommended that the exemption for these term
deposits from reserve requirements be removed from the proposed legislation. Your Committee has not received any
representations from representatives of the trust companies
with reference to Bill C-14. Your Committee continues to
perceive that the elimination of this reserve requirement will
narrow the competitive edge on interest rates which trust
companies may offer for term deposits, with possible resultant
disturbance of cash flows for the trust companies.
2.

Limit on Mortgage Lending by Banks
Your Committee notes that the present limitation on mortgage loans by banks of ten percent of the aggregate of
Canadian currency deposits and debentures bas been reinstated in Bill C-14. The legislation proposed by Bill C-15 would
have removed any limit on mortgage loans.
Your Committee recommended in response to Bill C-15 that
the ceiling be increased to 15%. While Bill C-14 retains the
existing limit at 10%, it also permits banks to conduct mortgage lending through subsidiaries and the evidence given by
the Inspector General of Banks makes it clear that the intention is that such mortgage lending through the subsidiary not
be included in the 10% limitation. Effectively, this constrains
the bank for direct mortgage lending but imposes no limit for
indirect lending through subsidiaries, however, such mortgage

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

December 5, 1979
December 5, 1979

lending through subsidiaries must be conducted in accordance
with the requirements of the federal Loans Companies Act.
Apart altogether from the desirability of the dichotomy of
direct and indirect mortgage lending, if such is the Governments intentions, it is far from clear that it has been effectively
incorporated in clear unambiguous language in the Bill. A
review of Clauses 175b, 192 and 212 of Bill C-14 leave some
doubt, in the face of the detail required in the consolidated
statement of assets and liabilities required by Schedule J, as to
whether the 10% limit would indeed not apply to the continued
mortgage lending of both. Reassessment and possible amendment to these clauses and the related Schedule in the Bill
appears to be required.

Your Committee approves the proposed changes in the
legislation referred to above, and has no further recommendations to make on this aspect of Bill C-14.

Financial Leasing and Factoring through Subsidiaries
Bill C-15 had proposed that banks be permitted to conduct
financial leasing and factoring operations, but that such activities must be carried only as part of the banks' regular operations and not through affiliated or subsidiary companies. Your
Committee in its report on Bill C-15 recommended that banks
be allowed to carry on financial leasing and factoring operations either through separate wholly-owned subsidiaries or as
part of the bank's operations. Bill C-14 now proposes that
banks be required to conduct such operations through partlyowned controlled or wholly-owned subsidiary corporations. For
control purposes, financial and statistical reports will be made
to the Inspector General of Banks on both a consolidated and
individual basis.
Your Committee believes that the conducting of these operations through separate subsidiaries will place the banks on a
reasonably competitive basis with other companies engaged in
financial leasing or factoring, and should tend to diminish the
fears expressed by some interested parties that Bill C-15 would
place the banks in a position to direct or influence its customers to do their financial leasing or factoring business also
through that bank.
It is also noted, in conjunction with the changes which
would permit banks to have subsidiaries engaged in financial
leasing that further proposed amendments have been made in
Bill C-14 which circumscribe to some extent the method by
which a financial subsidiary may operate.
Subsection 172(1)(j) indicates that a bank subsidiary
engaged in financial leasing may hold a lease property only "at
the request of a specific lessee for leasing by him". In addition,
the interpretation in subsection 192(a) further prevents a
bank's leasing subsidiary from directing its customers or
potential customers to particular dealers. The above provisions, together with the draft proposed regulations, which
require individual financial leases of a bank's subsidiary to be
non-operating and on full pay-out basis with a twenty percent
residual value, should go a long way to alleviating the concerns
of the automobile dealers.
In its report on Bill C-15 your Committee made a number of
recommendations concerning the provisions in the Bill and in
the related Financial Leasing Regulations.

(i)

3.

Foreign Banks
Your Committee made several recommendations in its
report on Bill C-15 with regard to the entry of foreign banks
into the Canadian banking system, including the establishing
of a system of licensing, as recorded earlier in this report.
For purposes of record it may be useful to comment on
further proposed amendments in Bill C-15 which now meet
some of your Committee's concerns which were expressed in
its report on Bill C-15.

4.

Limit on Growth of Foreign Bank Subsidiaries
Bill C-15 had proposed that fifteen percent of total commercial financing in Canada by all banks be the limit for the
aggregate of the assets of all foreign bank subsidiaries.
This concept now has been amended in Bill C-14 whereby
the total domestic assets of all foreign bank subsidiaries will be
limited to eight percent of the total domestic assets of all
banks in Canada, including in such latter total the domestic
assets of the foreign bank subsidiaries. (Subsection 294(5)).
When the Inspector General of Banks and his representatives appeared before your Committee it was indicated that the
limit of eight percent of total domestic assets was fairly
comparable with the previous proposal of fifteen percent of
total commercial financing, although the total limit had grown
from the previous estimate of approximately $7 billion in 1977
to almost $12 billion in 1979. This dollar asset limit on the
growth of domestic assets of foreign bank subsidiaries in
Canada would continue to grow, of course, in line with the
growth of the total assets of the domestic assets of all banks in
Canada. Foreign international assets of foreign bank subsidiaries and Canadian banks would be excluded from the above
calculations. Subsection 173(2)(e) consequently has been
amended in Bill C-14 so that the limit of twenty times
authorized capital for individual foreign bank subsidiaires
would apply only to their domestic assets.
The above changes in the proposed legislation appear to be
reasonable to your Committee as they would simplify control,
and will provide automatic indexing of the limit based on the
growth of all banks within the banking system in Canada.
(ii) Number of Branches
A foreign bank subsidiary from time to time may open such
additional branches in Canada, as are approved by the Minister, in addition to its head office and its first branch. This
permits flexibility and reciprocity within the context of making
a contribution to competitive banking in Canada. Previously,
in Bill C-15 the proposed limit on branches, was, with the
approval of the Minister, four additional branches.
(iii) Grandfathering
The amendments proposed in Bill C-14 involve the concept
of grandfathering, under certain conditions, holdings of a

December 5, 1979
December 5, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

variety of items including branches, assets, non-banking related investments and banking-related investments.
(iii)(a) Grandfathering of Branches
Bill C-14 provides for the grandfathering of the branches
which replace those of an affiliate of a foreign bank subsidiary
if such branches existed at the time of application for letters
patent incorporating the foreign bank subsidiary. The grandfathering appears to be limited to a period of ten years by
subsection 28(9). However, in practice, it would be expected
that the approval of the Minister for the additional number of
exiting branches would be obtained at the time of application
for incorporation of the foreign bank subsidiary under section
172(2).
(iii)(b)

Grandfathering of Investments in Canadian Corporations
Your Committee, in its report on Bill C-15 recommended
that there should be some type of grandfathering of investments in Canada presently held by foreign banks who wish to
incorporate a foreign bank subsidiary.
Some of the changes in Bill C-14 which give effect to this
concept of grandfathering are summarized as follows:
(1) A foreign bank parent of a foreign bank subsidiary may
continue to hold directly or indirectly an investment in a
non-bank affiliate which is engaged in non-banking related
activities (1) provided that it has the permission of the Minister and (2) provided such non-bank affiliate does not use the
banking services of the related foreign bank subsidiary. (Subsection 297(3)).
(2) A foreign bank owning a foreign bank subsidiary may,
for a period of two years, own in excess of ten percent of a
non-bank affiliate which is engaged in banking related activities. However, such investments may be held for a further
eight years if they are transferred to an affiliate of the foreign
bank. (Subsections 28(8) and 28(9)).
(3) If a foreign bank owns a foreign bank subsidiary and
subsequently an affiliate of the foreign bank acquires more
than ten percent of a non-bank affiliate which engages in
non-banking related activities, the Minister may approve the
holding of such shares by the affiliate of the foreign bank
provided the Minister is satisfied that the foreign bank is not
in a position to avoid such acquisition. (Subsections 297(3)
and 297(3.1)).
5. Ownership of Bank Shares by Provincial Governments
Under the present legislation governments are prohibited
from owning capital stock in chartered banks. The White
Paper proposed that this prohibition be removed and that
provincial governments be allowed to hold and vote capital
stock of chartered banks up to 25% of the shares of a new bank
with such shareholdings being reduced to 10% within ten
years. Bill C-15 contained a provision in line with the White
Paper proposal and Bill C-14 carries the same provision forward into the proposed new law. In your Committee's report
on Bill C-15 (as in its report on the White Paper) criticism of

this proposal was outlined. In response to Bill C-14, your
Committee repeats essentially what was said on these earlier
occasions, namely that ownership of significant interests by
provincial governments in chartered banks is not in the public
interest because interests varying from 25% to 10% might well
give provincial governments effective control of the bank and
would bring conventional banking objectives into conflict with
the political interests of major government shareholders. Your
Committee on earlier occasions recognized the fact that in the
case of the Northland Bank shares are presently being held in
trust for the governments of the provinces of Manitoba and
Saskatchewan in anticipation of the passage of favourable
legislation. Notwithstanding, your Committee is of the view
that the problem of potential conflicts of interest outweigh the
requirements of any individual bank in particular and the
participation of provincial governments in the financing of new
banks in general.
6.

Technical Amendments
Your Committee has noted some sections in the Bill which,
in its opinion, require some redrafting in order to improve the
clarity of the intended meaning.
While the items mentioned below are not substantive in
nature, your Committee records them with a view to being of
possible assistance in the finalizing of this important legislative
document.
Shares in a Factoring or Leasing Subsidiary
It is evident from various sections of Bill C-14 taken in
aggregate and in the context of the evidence presented by the
Inspector General of Banks that it is intended that banks may
only carry on the business of factoring or financial leasing
through a subsidiary; i.e. a corporation that is controlled by
the bank. (Interpretation of subsidiary corporation, subsection
2(2)(i)). This is reinforced in the interpretation in subsection
192(1), pages 207 and 208. However subsection 192(6)(c)
refers to "all or any number of the issued outstanding shares of
a factoring corporation or a leasing corporation." It appears to
your Committee that there is lack of consistency between the
drafting of the "controlled subsidiary" requirements in subsection 192(a)(i)-mortgage lending corporation, subsection
192(6)(a)(ii)-venture capital corporation, and subsection
192(6)(c)-factoring corporation or financial leasing corporation.
(i)

(ii) Appropriations for Contingencies
Bill C-14 proposes changing the name of the account entitled "Accumulated Appropriations for Losses" in the present
Bank Act to "Appropriations for Contingencies". Your Committee is in agreement with this change as it reflects more
clearly the nature and purpose of this reserve. However,
subsection 211(3)(c) page 235 continues to refer to a "statement of accumulated appropriations for contingencies" as
specified in Schedule M, whereas Schedule M on page 337 as
well as Schedule K on page 334 refer to "Appropriations for
Contingencies". No doubt this small matter of editing will be
taken care of in the final drafting to remove this inconsistency.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
(iii) Reporting of Mortgage Loans of Subsidiaries
As mentioned earlier under "Limit on Mortgage Lending by
Banks", the intention of the Bill is to exclude the mortgage
loans of a bank's subsidiary mortgage loan corporation from
the ten per cent limit imposed on a bank by subsection 175(2).
In order to clarify that the mortgage loans of subsidiaries
are not to be included with those of the parent bank and to
provide the separate information on the bank's mortgage loans,
Schedule J should be amended so as to show the conventional
residential mortgage loans of the subsidiary separate from
those of the bank.
7.

Regulations
Earlier in this report in the General Introduction your
Committee has commented on the fact that all of the Minister's draft proposed regulations have not been reissued in
amended form at the same time that Bill C-14 was tabled in
the House of Commons.
The following new proposed draft regulations have been
issued as of the date of this report:
"Guarantee Regulations" (Section 172(1)(i))
"Reserves Regulations" (Section 204(10))
The only redraft of the proposed regulations which has been
issued is that of the proposed "Financial Leasing Regulations"
(Section 172(1)(j)).
The following draft proposed regulations were issued by the
Minister in conjunction with Bill C-15, but further redrafts,
based on recommendations made by your Committee, have not
been issued at this date.
-Data Processing Regulations (S. 172(l)(k))
-Options Regulations (S. 123(3))
-Proxy Regulations (S. 161(1) and 162(1))
-Insider Reports Regulations (S. 168)
-Registration
of Security Fees Regulations (S.
177(f)(g))
-Venture Capital Corporation Regulations (S. 192(6))
-Real Estate Investment Trust and Mortgage Investment Company Regulations (S. 192(6)(b))
-Financial Corporations Regulations (S. 193(1))
-Form of Notes to Annual Statement Regulations (S.
214(1) of Part I and S. 53(4) of Part II)
-Foreign Bank Representative Offices Regulations (S.
294(2)(a))
-Circulation
and Disclosure of Cost of Borrowing
Regulations (S. 198(4) of Part I and S. 80 of Part II)
-Preliminary
Prospectus and Prospectus Regulations
(Sec. 307)
For our views on the above draft regulations which were
issued with Bill C-15, see the report of your Committee on
that Bill, where some of these regulations were discussed more
fully.
Because of the absence of the reissurance of amended
proposed regulations, your Committee is aware that this report

December 5, 1979
December 5, 1979

is not as complete as we would prefer it to be. With regard to
the three draft regulations issued in October, 1979, as noted
above, your Committee has concluded that they are acceptable
and has no further recommendations to make. It might be
noted that most of your Committee's recommendations with
regard to the Financial Leasing Regulations have been given
effect to in the recent reissue of these regulations.
It might be noted also that in accordance with your Committee's recommendation, banks may now engage in financial
leasing through a separate subsidiary corporation. While your
Committee had recommended in its report on Bill C-15 that
banks not be permitted to enter the automobile leasing field
except for leasing of fleets of automobiles, the amendments in
Bill C-14 together with the new proposed regulations, appear
to your Committee to provide adequate control to prevent the
banks from dominating the automobile leasing field as was
feared by some of the witnesses who appeared before your
Committee during its hearings on Bill C-15.
It is hoped by your Committee that the complete set of
revised regulations will be issued before the banking legislation
is adopted. In any event, your Committee will maintain a
watching brief in this matter and will be pleased to study, with
the authorization of the Senate, the subject matter and to
report thereon in due course when the redrafted regulations
are issued by the Minister.
If additional regulations are issued as they should be, before
the Bill receives second reading, this will provide the Committee with an opportunity to consider them when the Bill is
referred to the Committee for study.
Il THE QUEBEC SAVINGS BANKS ACT
Your Committee made eight main recommendations for
amendments to the legislation proposed by Bill C-15; some of
these main recommendations, such as those which would
increase the business powers of a savings bank and the scope of
its lending powers were put forward in considerable detail.
It is gratifying to your Committee that Bill C-14 implements in principle all of its substantive recommendations. A
number of amendments are designed to make the legislation in
the Quebec Savings Banks Act consistent with the parallel
sections in the Bank Act.
Technical Amendment
It is noted by your Committee that Part 11, which is
applicable to the Quebec Savings Banks Act, refers in Section
53(2) (c) and Schedule C on page 410 of Bill C-14 to
"Accumulated Appropriations for Contingencies". It would
appear to your Committee that, to be consistent with the
amendments made to the Bank Act (Subsection 21(3)(c) and
Schedule M, page 337), the intention of the drafters was to
shorten the name in both the Bank Act and the Quebec
Savings Banks Act to "appropriations for Contingencies". As
noted in the comments above concerning the Bank Act, subsection 211(3)(c) page 235, the word "accumulated" would also
require similar editing.

during which the old and new systems are running parallel in
order to insure that the new system, including administrative
control policies and procedures and the new electronic funds
transfer system, are running effectively and efficiently.
Part V of the Bill contains "Related and Consequential
Amendments and Coming into Force". Clause 90 of Bill C-14
would amend the Act to Incorporate the Canadian Bankers'
Association. It is noted that Clause 90(3) would repeal Section
7 of the CBA Act and would effectively take away from the
CBA the right to operate a clearing house for banks. In the
opinion of your Committee the date of proclamation of the
coming into force of this amendment should flot be proclaimed
until after both the CBA system and the new system are
operating efficiently under the mantde of the Canadian Payments Association.
Your Committee therefore repeats the above recommendation made in its report on Bill C-i15 that the regulations
provide for a two-year transitional period for the phasing-in of
the operations of the clearing and seutlement system from the
present system conducted by the CBA over to the proposed
new system of the CPA.
Technical Amendment (CPA Act)
Your Committee notes that, in order to give effect to the
intention, the wording in clause 57(2) of the Canadian Payments Association Act should be changed so that it reads "A
Central, a trust company, a loan company and any other
person, other than a local that is a member of a central",
rather than "that is not a member of a local."

IV BANK 0F CANADA ACT
The only changes in the proposed amendments to the Bank
of Canada Act which were not included in Bill C- 15 appear to
be with reference to the appointment of firms of accountants
as auditors of the Bank of Canada, rather than individual
accountants. These amendments would conform with the proposed changes of similar nature in the Bank Act, and the
Quebec Savings Banks Act. Your Committee approves of these
proposed amendments.
Conclusion
Your Committee is concerned by the fact that, though the
Statute contemplates a decennial review of the legîslation,
circumstances have resulted in at least the last two of such
reviews being long delayed in implementation resulting in the
necessity of life-sustaining interim legislation and general
uncertainty. Your Committee feels strongly that at the next
"decennial" review every effort be brought to bear to insure
speedy consideration and implementation of those changes
considered to be desirable as being in the public interest.
Your Committee wishes to express its appreciation for the
services rendered in the revîew of BibI C-14 by Mssrs. John F.
Lewis and David W. Scott.
Your Committee has examined and considered the subjeet
matter of Bill C-14 in accordance with its terms of reference
and, except as noted above, has no comments to make on the
Bill.
Respectfubly submitted,

ACCOMMODATION FOR SENATORS IN SENATE GALLERY OF

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators will be aware,
of course, that the Minister of Finance will deliver his budget
speech in the other place on Tuesday next, December I1, 1979,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
May I be permitted to remind honourable senators that,
according to a long-established rule running back to 1931, only
senators themselves will be admitted to the Senate Gallery of
the House of Commons on that occasion. This step is taken to
make sure that senators who wish to be in the gallery at that
time will be able to find accommodation.
The question as to the accommodation provided for senators
in that gallery in the House of Commons has been before us
for some time. I have had discussions with His Honour Speaker Jerome of the House of Commons, and he has authorized
me to say, first of all, that the whole matter is under sympathetic review in terms of the former commitments given to the
Senate and, secondly, on this occasion the "usual"-and that
is the word used-accommodation will be available to honourable senators.

POINT OF ORDER

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I undertook to
respond today to a reference to me of two points of order in a
matter raised by Senator Bosa and others. Because we have
somewhat of a time limit in the early part of our proceedings, I
should inform honourable senators that in order to expedite
some other matters that are before the Senate I will discuss
that matter further just before the Orders of the Day.

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Hayden: Honourable senators, it is almost trite to

another one this time that certainly does not break that track
record. This one is complex and confusing. But, as usual in all
these tax bills, you find a few goodies, as I describe them. I am
saved the problem of enumerating them, unless honourable
senators want to have them enumerated again, because the

on second reading, listed what these goodies are. They are set

should bc put to this kind of financing. But this kind of
transactioni was rcahly a boan. and it was masquerading under
the description of a preferred share when il had aIl the

conditions as 10 what would make that preferred share a terni

usually happens in taxing legislation. une nîay cure somne
îhings but unleash many more. 1 would say that Bihl C-37, if
anything, did flot go far enough. There were many loophohes
that financial institutions were quick 10 discover.
To illusîrate: Bill C-37 defined a termn prefcrred share to
include a share redeemnable at the option of the holder within
10 years. What Bih! C-37 did not foresce, though, was that
financial institutions could acquire shares with sufficient
amount of voting power to give them the opporîunity 10 force a
redemption al any time.
Then the presenit govcrnment, recognizing that this provision
did not go far cnough. included clauses 36, 66 and 67 in Bill
G- 17, the bihl which we now have before us. The difficulîy wiîh
thiose clauses is that they go 100 far. In other words, in
attempting to correct Bih! C-37, îhey went too far and involved
mîore problenîis-problcms w~hich should not have been
involved-in an attemipt t0 correct the situation regarding
preferred shares.
Then complaints and submîissîons wenî to the Minîster of
Finance. As a result of those complaints and subnîissions, the
Minister of Finance made a statemient in which hie indicated il
swould be necessary to make certain technical aiiendnents t0
the bihl, and in particuhar to the clauses 1 mentioned.
At the sanie limîe, coiiphaints and submissions came before
the Standing Senate Conîmiîtee on Banking, Trade and Comnierce. Those conîphaints and submissions were ahong the sanie

appear before our committee to give the necessary undertakings that this would be done, and that these amendments
would be implemented when he delivered his budget.
The minister appeared in due course after the committee
had heard from departmental officials regarding the problems.
The minister made a statement, and in that statement he made
certain undertakings. I call them undertakings, and I think you
will agree that that is what they are. He not only dealt with
that, but also with the recommendations that this committee
had made regarding Bill C-37. He gave certain indications in
that connection as to the review of these recommendations and
as to what the policy of the department at the moment was.
He further indicated that if on review there was any change,
amendments would be introduced in the near future to correct
those situations.

regard while I read what the minister said. I am reading from
a transcript of the proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce of yesterday. My
first reference is on page AA-3, where he said:
It is apparent to me, both from your proceedings and
from the representation that we have received directly,
that it is desirable that certain technical amendments be
made with respect to term preferred share measures in
Bill C-17. I intend at the earliest possible opportunity to
amend the measures in Bill C-17 to make clear that the
provisions of Bill C-37 will apply for the period from
November 16, 1978, to October 23, 1979. As a result, any
changes to the legislation, other than relieving amendments, appearing in Bill C-17, will have effect only from
October 23, 1979. This will be done in the coming-intoforce part of the future bill.
The next statement by the minister I want to refer to on this
point is on page AA-5. I should first tell you that in the full
statement he listed the different problems that were identified
by his department as causing trouble in the interpretation of
sections 36, 66 and 67. When he got to the third item, he said:
Thirdly, subparagraph (h)(iv) [clause 66(7) of the bill]
will be modified to clarify that those "grandfathered"
shares or income debentures that have been issued to and
owned by a financial institution, which have been sold to a
non-financial institution, will not cease to be grandfathered only because, at a later time, they are sold back to
a financial institution other than in the case of a sale by a
financial institution after October 23, 1979, with a commitment to repurchase.
Because some of the conditions in these so-called term
preferred shares provided for a plan of repurchase there is a
general provision found mainly in clause 66, though possibly it
occurs also in some respects in 36, under which the method to
be followed in correcting many of the difficulties is that of
grandfathering the transactions between the critical period in

Bill C-37, which was November 16, 1978, and the critical
period in Bill C-17, which was October 23, 1979.
"Grandfathering" is just a technical term. Once upon a time
I tried to find out the origin of this expression, but I did not
get too satisfactory an answer. I think it conveys the idea that,
notwithstanding the fact that the time limits seem to proscribe
a given transaction, that proscription is relieved by certain
words. At least one identifiable transaction was missed, and
that was the matter of preferred shares issued prior to November 16, 1978. While the bill talked about grandfathering from
November 16, 1978, to October 23, 1979, here was something
sitting outside the period of grandfathering. The minister has
undertaken to look into that transaction.
The object of the provisions I have referred to is to recognize
a preferred share, which is now to be called a term preferred
share, in its true light; namely, that it is a loan. If that
situation is repeated at a future time, any payment made will
be treated not as a dividend but as interest and will therefore
be taxable. Of course, in the preferred shares that were issued
there was a provision guaranteeing or ensuring against any
adverse change in the tax laws.
If you read the provisions of the bill, you will no doubt find
them difficult to follow and understand. I would like to feel
that if you read our report, the bill might become somewhat
more intelligible, and if you read the transcript of the evidence
that was taken, you might ultimately find yourself well educated in the law respecting term preferred shares and the applications that can be made of existing provisions of the Income
Tax Act many years after their having been put into the act. It
apparently takes a while for things to churn and before light
comes to even the most intelligent of tax lawyers and they sec
what opportunities are afforded.
We cannot be critical of the department for not detecting
this situation sooner. When section 112 was first incorporated
into the law it was hailed as a great advance in our tax laws,
with dividends passing free of tax from one Canadian company
to another. However, the extensions began to cost the government tremendous amounts of money, with the result that a
stop had to be put to it.

That is the main purpose of the bill. The other clauses of the
bill deal with a variety of subjects and are, for the most part,
carried through from Bill C-37, on which your committee
made a report. That report is a matter of record in the Senate,
so I shall not weary you with that. In the minister's appearance before the committee, he also dealt with those subject
matters. I will take the time to illustrate but one of them, that
being the case of interest. When an individual borrows money
against a life insurance policy and pays interest thereon, Bill
C-37 provided that that interest, if paid prior to 1978, would
not be an addition to the adjusted cost basis of the policy in
order to determine what amount in the policy was return of
capital and what amount was income and, as such, taxable.
The explanation given for that course of action was that some
insurance companies did not have the necessary records back
beyond 1978. Your committee took the position that if insurance companies did not have that information, but the taxpay-

SENATE DEBATES
er did have a receipt or a cancelled cheque, he should not be
deprived of the opportunity of establishing his entitlement to
add to the adjusted cost basis the interest that he paid.
0

(1430)

When the departmental representatives appeared before us
on this occasion, they had donc some more research. Their
explanation was that if the policy loan was for business
purposes, it should be deductible as monies laid out in order to
earn interest. Therefore, if the department gave the right to
the policyholder to deduct the interest from his income and
also to add the interest to his adjusted cost basis, he would, in
fact, be receiving a double benefit. The answer to that was that
it should simply be divided into two, and if it were a commercial or a business loan it should carry that benefit, and there
should be a definition of what type of interest can be added to
the cost basis.
The minister bas made certain undertakings in relation to
all the items listed in our report which I tabled today, and
which are also contained in the report we made a year ago
with reference to Bill C-37. There is no need for me to run
through that list of items and perhaps run the risk of boring
you and seeing a general exodus from the chamber for a
breather while I continue to speak. Nevertheless, I feel I
should tell you what conclusion the committee came to and
what recommendations it has made.
What the committee has said in conclusion is:
Your committee has examined and considered the subject
matter of Bill C-17 in accordance with its terms of
reference. Its concerns are noted above but in view of the
statements given by the minister to the committee and
given the minister's desire to complete passage of the bill
before his forthcoming budget, the committee recommends to the Senate that the bill be favourably considered
without amendment. Due to the circumstances related
above, we do not recommend any amendments to the bill.
We feel that, in due course, time will take care of this matter.
The minister is bound to present us with another tax bill
within a year. They say that you can count on death and taxes,
but I would say that taxes, of course, presuppose a bill from
the minister. Next year there may be something in a bill that
the minister would like to have dealt with in a particular way
before our committee. If be lives up to the undertakings be bas
given, there will be no problem; however, frankly speaking, if
be does not live up to the undertakings, we will have a chance
to make amendments to next year's tax bill.
I should like to point out that since at least 1969, when we
started this procedure, there bas never been an occasion when
a minister bas given an undertaking, or what is tantamount to
an undertaking, which bas not been implemented in due
course-perhaps not within the next day or the next month,
but certainly within the next fiscal year.
In that connection I can remember when the great tax
reform bill came to us in 1971. We must have made about 200
amendments to that bill, most of them being really substantial.
Many of them were delivered in time to the House of Com[Senator Hayden.]

December 6,

1979

mons committee that was then sitting, and they were dealt
with by that committee. However, some were not dealt with,
and the minister appeared before our committee and agreed
that the amendments were necessary and he undertook that
they would be implemented as quickly as possible.
I remember when John Turner appeared before us as Minister of Finance and explained certain amendments. He stated
that that concluded the sum total of the amendments the
respective Ministers of Finance undertook to make when considering the basic income tax bill.
Therefore, we have no reason to believe, and we do not
believe, that the minister will not implement whatever be bas
undertaken to implement, and that be will not study and
review whatever be bas undertaken to study and review.
We have not given up our hold on this, because the Senate
can always refer any subject matter to a committee for study.
We can also depend on the force of public opinion and the fact
that there will be another occasion when the minister will
place a bill before a committee of the Senate.
I hope I have not wearied you. I have tried to be clear in my
explanation of this somewhat complex matter.
I have not yet referred to the "income debentures" which
are mentioned in the minister's statement. Income debentures
go back to the mid-1950s. Income debenture is defined in
section 15(3) of the Income Tax Act. Income debenture simply
means that the payments made on account of the use of the
proceeds of the debenture will be treated as dividends. Therefore, if income debentures are exchanged between two corporations, being a dividend they will, of course, move tax-free.
The income debenture was a vehicle that was used very much,
as I understand, in the period of the great depression of the
early thirties as a method of financing worthwhile enterprises
at a lower cost than that of trying to borrow money in the
ordinary way and without that beneficial attraction.
That is the report with our recommendations. We have
completed our work, unless the Senate, in its wisdom, tells us
to go back and do something more.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE SERVICES

Senator Smith (Colchester), with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1)(e), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and
Communications have power to engage the services of
such counsel and technical, clerical and other personnel as
may be necessary for the purposes of its examination and
consideration of such legislation and other matters as may
be referred to it.

Motion agreed to.

Senator Perrault: -and to assure Canadians in aIl of the
provinces that there will be adequate heating oil supplies this
winter. I asked why the Energy Supplies Allocation Board was
not brought into operational existence sooner and ail I have
received in return is political invective. I do not believe that is
good enough.
Senator Flynn: Speech!

QUESTION PERIOD

Senator Perrault: I have a supplementary.
Senator Flynn: Come on, give it.

ENERGY
ATLANTIC PROVINCES AND QUEBEC-PREDICTED
SHORTAGES

FUEL OIL

The Hon. the Speaker: Order! Order!

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce who, I am
pleased to see, is back in his place this afernoon.

Senator Smith (Colchester): I rise to a point of order, Mr.
Speaker.

Senator de Cotret: Thank you.
Senator Perrault: The question relates to the seemingly very
tight oil supply situation which may face Canadians this
winter. The minister and the Leader of the Government, as
well as other government representatives, no doubt recall that
members on this side, and in the other place, have been
warning the government about this potential problem for
several months now. We have sought assurances on the matter
of energy supply on several occasions. We are pleased to see
the government finally moving to appoint the Energy Supplies
Allocation Board which was authorized by legislation introduced by the previous government in the last Parliament some
time ago, but we are concerned that the government has left it
to this late date to put that board in place. It could take
something like 60 days to make it functional.
The question is: Can the minister explain why it has taken
the government so long to appoint this board, especially in
view of the more than ample warnings that have been given
that the board could well be needed this winter, a possibility
foreseen by the previous government?

Senator Smith (Colchester): Better than what? Better than
you heard from over there? Yes, a lot better.

Senator de Cotret: Well, honourable senators, what amazes
me the most about the question from the Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate is why the previous government, if it
foresaw so far in advance the need for such a board, did
nothing to enhance supply in this country and move us toward
self-sufficiency.
Senator Perrault: I regret very much that the minister has
felt it necessary to become partisan on an occasion of this kind.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Perrault: Surely, what we are concerned about,
honourable senators, is the possibility of cold homes in the
Atlantic provinces, the province of Quebec and other provinces
this winter. This is not the time for the minister to drag into
this chamber political red herrings. This is the timeSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Perrault: This is the time for this government to
assume its responsibility of leadershipSenator Flynn: Yes.
80072-35

Senator Lamontagne: That is better.

Senator Lamontagne: Better than you did the other day.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Oh, I see. Well, I am glad the
honourable gentleman thinks I am capable of reform.
Senator Lamontagne: You are improving.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I just want to draw attention to
the fact, Mr. Speaker, that the rules specifically provide that
questions may be preceded by brief explanations, but it is not
in order to attempt to engage in debate, either in asking the
question or in replying to it.
Senator Perrault: Or in speaking on spurious points of
order.
Senator Smith (Colchester): This is a point of order. While
I have no objection at aIl to the Leader of the Opposition
breaching this rule and provoking a debate, I think it is
perfectly in order, then, that someone on this side should be
accorded the privilege of replying to him in the same sort of
terms, if necessary. I am sure that we on this side would be
delighted to engage in the kind of debate the honourable
gentleman wants to provoke in asking this question, and we
will feel it necessary, desirable, and just as much in order as
his provocative remarks to do so.
The Hon. the Speaker: I take it that Senator Smith was
addressing his point of order to the Chair.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I was, sir.
The Hon. the Speaker: In that case, perhaps I might point
out that it is a point of order which I think we would aIl agree
has been in recent years more honoured in the breach than in
the observance by honourable senators on both sides. It is
therefore difficult for me to make a ruling because my
memory is not that short that I do not remember when I may
have been offending in much the same way.
Therefore, I would merely read two rules to honourable
senators, leaving it to the good judgment of the Senate as to
the degree of preciseness with which these rules should be
observed. The revised rule 20(4) reads:

SENATE DEBATES
A debate is out of order on an oral question, but brief
explanatory remarks may be made by the senator who
asks the question and by the senator who answers it.
Rule 32 reinforces that:
A debate shall not be in order on an oral question, but
brief explanatory remarks may be made by the senator
making the interrogation and by the senator answering
the same. Observations upon any such answer shall not be
allowed.
I think honourable senators would ail agree that we have not
in any way in this chamber in the last few years, so far as I can
recall, attempted to enforce those rules strictly. I must, therefore, leave it to honourable senators to decide. The Senate is
master of its own rules. I appreciate the fact that Senator
Smith (Colchester) raised the point, because it does give me
the opportunity to say that this is the position that the Chair
must take, the custom of this chamber being what it is.
I would add one further remark on our rules. We do have a
rule which forbids personal or taxing comments. There is
another adjective which I have forgotten, but it means nasty.
Senator Roblin: Liberal.
The Hon. the Speaker: Personal comments or personal
remarks about other senators are forbidden. I think at times
the remarks of honourable senators do get personal, but I
hasten to say that, from my observation, that applies to both
sides of the chamber as I hear them.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I want to say that
aIl of us appreciate the opinion given by our distinguished
Speaker. We appreciate it very much. I recall very well the
robust questioning which was engaged in by the Leader of the
Government in the Senate when he was on this side of the
chamber, and at no time did we oppose it or have to retain
defence counsel, such as Senator Smith, in order to protect the
leader and his ministers. However, I am sure that the government leader must be very heartened to have that kind of
support.
May I ask another question, however?
Senator Flynn: You are commenting on the ruling of Mr.
Speaker now.
Senator Perrault: That would be the last thing I would ever
intend to do.
Senator Flynn: Regardless of your intention, you have donc

December 6, 1979

Senator Flynn: I thought I heard Senator Haidasz. If he has
something to say, will he not rise and say it clearly?
Senator Guay: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
Senator Perrault: The Leader of the Government is out of
order by asking questions of the opposition.
Senator Flynn: On the contrary, you are out of order by
discussing the ruling of the Speaker.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, again I express my
appreciation of His Honour the Speaker for delivering his
opinion on this matter, but I would say that in almost ail cases
the replies of government spokesmen are longer than any
questions put from this side.
* (1450)

Senator Flynn: Oh, no. I challenge you.
The Hon. the Speaker: Perhaps I could suggest to honourable senators that we revert to the Question Period.
Senator Perrault: I heartily support that initiative.

INCREASED OIL CONSUMPTION

Senator Perrault: I have a supplementary question for the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. As the Prime
Minister has suggested a major reason for the threat of
shortages in oil supply this winter is an increase in Canadian
consumption, will the minister give us some details of this
increased consumption? Where is it occurring, by how much is
that consumption increasing, and docs this mean that aIl of the
efforts aimed at conservation have failed?
Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator is no doubt
aware there is no question that one of the biggest problems we
face in terms of oil supply and oil demand is the very rapid
increase in this country of our per capita consumption of oil.
There is no question that if we could appreciably reduce the
annual rate of growth of the per capita consumption of crude
we would be a long way towards achieving our stated goal of
self-sufficiency. I shall be happy to document, with statistics,
the precise rate of growth of per capita consumption, how
much that means in barrels per day and how that relates to the
supply situation as we sec it now. I shall have to obtain the
specific statistics, and I shall be very happy to bring them
forward.
POSSIBLE SUBSIDY TO OFFSET HIGHER COST OF IMPORTED OIL

it.

Senator Haidasz: That is a personal remark.
Senator Flynn: Perhaps you did not realize what you were
doing, but that is something else. Let me simply tell the
Honourable Leader of the Opposition, since he refers to the
time when I was in his place, that I never made a speech
before putting a question. The questions were robust, but I was
not going ail over the place as he does every day.
Senator Haidasz: Stop being personal.
[1he Hon. the Speaker.]

Senator Perrault: Finally, with respect to the possibility that
Canada may have to go to the world spot market in order to
obtain adequate supplies for the needs of the country, in view
of the fact that spot market prices could be two or three times
higher than the domestic price, does the government anticipate
the need to subsidize this higher cost foreign oil from the spot
market to reduce its cost to Canadians down to the level of the
established Canadian price?
Senator de Cotret: We are not at the moment considering
going to the spot market. The Minister of Energy has taken a

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

number of steps to ensure that we will be able to overcome the
potentially difficult situation that was outlined in the most
recent report from the National Energy Board, and we will
certainly be in a position in the very near future to make a
further and more detailed statement on the supply situation as
it may evolve over the winter months.

put that proviso on its accuracy. There was a statement,
through its chargé d'affaires, that Iran would not have any
objection to dealing directly with Canadian oil corporations
such as Gulf.
Senator Lamontagne: That is not what they said.
Senator Oison: I have a supplementary question, if I maySeveral honourable senators having risen:

IMPORTATION OF OIL BY PETRO-CANADA

Senator Oison: In view of a number of developments that
have taken place, such as the suspension of shipments from
Iran through the Gulf Oil Company, and also announcements
made by Venezuela and Saudi Arabia as to their cut-backs in
overall production early in 1980, has the government taken
initiatives to procure substitute supplies by activating
Petro-Canada?
Senator de Cotret: No. We have been following a responsible course of action, and one that can yield positive results.
We have, for example, written to all the major oil companies
in this country to obtain from them a positive statement in
terms of the potential diversion of crude that might adversely
affect our situation. I am happy to report that the Minister of
Energy has received assurances from the oil companies that no
such diversions will take place.
We have been having extensive meetings with people from
Gulf Oil, and at the moment I can report that Gulf is
confident that it can replace the Iranian oil by other resources
to meet the level of supply that it would otherwise have had.
The Minister of Energy has also been in direct contact with
the provinces to see to what extent we can increase our own
domestic supply over this critical period.
Senator Oison: Has the Gulf Oil Company given any indications as to which oil they are going to be able to divert? The
reason I ask that is this: Assuming every country now buying
oil under agreement is in a tight supply situation, did Gulf give
the government any realistic hopes that some diversion of oil
can be obtained at the agreed price-not the spot price; that is
a different market-whatever it is-$23.75?
Senator de Cotret: Yes, Gulf has given us a reasonable
assurance that oil can be obtained by them at a price that is
equivalent to the world price today.
Senator Oison: By world price you mean the agreed price of
something like $23.75?
Senator de Cotret: We do not mean the spot market price.
Senator Oison: I have one other supplementary question. In
view of the statement of the new Minister of Energy in the
Iranian Revolutionary Council-I think that is what it is
called-that while Iran objects to dealing with Gulf it does not
object to dealing with Canada, have any attempts been made
by our government or by Petro-Canada, the agency that was
set up for this purpose, to re-activate those oil flows?
Senator de Cotret: There was a statement made. Here I
have to refer to a newspaper account of the statement made. I

The Hon. the Speaker: Order. Senator Everett has a special
reason for wishing to rise at this time before the supplementary. I therefore cal] on him.
Senator Everett: Mr. Speaker, if the
Opposition has a supplementary I would
flow, if he wants to ask it. My question
and I should like to ask it after
supplementary.

Deputy Leader of the
be interfering with his
is not on this subject,
he has finished his

NEGOTIATIONS RI IMPORTATION OF OIL FROM MEXICO

Senator Oison: I think I have asked this supplementary
question twice, and i hope we can get an answer. Are there
any serious negotiations going on between a Canadian company and Mexico? The last time the President of PetroCanada was here he said that, because of the uncertainty of
that company, their activity in attempting negotiations with
Mexico have really been reduced to zero.
Senator de Cotret: I would have to take that question as
notice. You are asking me if there are any specific negotiations
currently going on between a Canadian firm and Mexico.
Senator Oison: Yes.
Senator de Cotret: I would have to take that question as
notice.
Senator Lamontagne: You took it as notice a month ago.
Senator de Cotret: Was that one of your questions, Senator
Lamontagne? I checked yesterday, and every question you
asked has been answered. If you have a further question on
this I would be very happy to give you an answer. Just rise and
ask it.
Senator Perrault: Senator Lamontagne is right.
Senator de Cotret: I will check to make sure what companies are dealing on the Mexican front at this moment. As you
know, I tabled, at the request of Senator Lamontagne, the
energy agreement as well as the industrial co-operation agreement between Canada and Mexico that is supposed to be
signed in the near future by the President and the Prime
Minister. The Secretary of State for External Affairs, the
Minister of Energy and I will be visiting Mexico in January to
further discuss the implementation of these agreements. That
is well under way, and preparations for that visit are well
under way. I am not sure whether or not a specific oil company
in Canada is dealing with a specific oil company in Mexico at
this specific time. I shall be happy to inquire and give you a
specific answer.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Oison: I have a final supplementary question. In
view of all these agreements that are going to be signed some
time later this winter with Mexico, I find it almost incredible
that the minister is unable to tell us whether a commercial oil
package deal is not part of those agreements-something that
turns into an actual commercial delivery of oil to Canada.
Senator de Cotret: I am the one who is astounded. I have to
be really astounded, after the answer I gave the honourable
senator and tabling the document. The document is very clear
in terms of the implementation of the agreement, in terms of
when we can expect to have deliveries of Mexican oil.
*

(1500)

I am also astounded that the honourable senator is suggesting that we, as a government, should negotiate through PetroCan an oil contract with Iran when only last week the members of the opposition were suggesting that we boycott Iran.
We are dealing with a very difficult situation, one which we
have been addressing since the day we took power, to ensure
that we would no longer be at the mercy of international
sources of energy supply. We will have an energy package that
will make us self-sufficient; not an ad hoc package of illthought-out measures such as that of the former government,
which is leading us directly into the situation in which we find
ourselves today.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, that is the problem
that we face on this floor, with that kind of answer.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, this question
of multiple supplementaries is getting very difficult. It is a fact
that we do not have a rule in this chamber or in our rule book
that limits supplementaries. On the other hand, we do have a
rule which says that the oral question period shall not develop
into a debate.
This is exactly what is happening. It is not for me to say
whether or not there should be a debate, but it is my responsibility to recognize other senators who wish to rise. This raises
the problem of unlimited supplementaries. In one case we had
one honourable senator asking nine successive supplementaries-not today-and carrying on the proceedings for 15
minutes, while other honourable senators were becoming impatient seeking the floor.
I have said before that I am not under any obligation, as I
understand it, to permit unlimited consecutive supplementaries
by any one honourable senator. Obviously, as far as possible I
will not interfere, but when other senators are seeking the
floor-in this case for 15 minutes-I really feel it is my
responsibility to intervene and offer the floor to another
senator.
The supplementaries can continue afterwards, of course. I
am not trying to define a supplementary. I am only trying to
protect the interest of senators who may wish to rise and enter
a discussion.
Senator Oison: I am not getting any answers, anyway.
[Senator de Cotret.]

December 6, 1979
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS

DIVIDENDS PAID BY CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES TO FOREIGN
PARENTS

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of State for Economic Development. I have been
concerned about the magnitude of dividends paid by Canadian
subsidiaries to foreign parents, and am wondering whether the
pay-out ratio is seen to be increasing. I wonder if the minister
could tell me whether there is any monitoring of those dividends and pay-out ratios.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, there certainly is
monitoring through Statistics Canada of the inflows and outflows on both interest and dividends. I would have to look into
the most recent statistics to try to determine whether or not
there has been an appreciable increase in the dividend flow
from Canada to foreign countries. I do not have the information at my fingertips.
The last time that I looked at the statistics, to try to get a
better fix on the development in our interest and dividends
account for the balance of payments, the ratio between interest
and dividends had not increased. It may even have decreased.
In absolute terms I have not looked at the rate of increase in
dividend payments abroad, but I shall be happy to provide the
details.
Senator Everett: As a supplementary, the ratio I am speaking of is, of course, the ratio of dividends to net profit-what is
termed the pay-out ratio. I was wondering whether there was
any monitoring of individual Canadian subsidiaries of foreign
companies with a magnitude of sales in excess of, say, $250
million-have you actually monitored companies whose sales
were above that amount?-as to the amount of dividends they
would pay, and their pay-out ratio.
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to take that question as
notice. I do not have the answer at present.
ENERGY
REDUCTION OF HIGHWAY SPEED LIMIT AS CONSERVATION
MEASURE

Senator Molson: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Leader of the Government regarding the possibility of oil
shortages. Have there been any conversations with the provinces, with any hope of success, concerning the possibility that
the overall highway speed limit in Canada might be reduced to
conserve our fuel supplies?
Senator Flynn: I know that discussions have taken place,
and the question of having a speed limit, with a view to
reducing consumption, is certainly one of the options.
YUKON TERRITORY
RESIGNATION OF COMMISSIONER-REQUEST OF COUNCIL OF
YUKON INDIANS FOR REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT OF
CANADA

Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Justice. Has the minister received a telegram

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

and a letter from legal counsel for the Council of Yukon
Indians asking for references to the Supreme Court of Canada
regarding a letter of instruction issued by the Minister of
Indian Affairs and Northern Development on October 9, 1979
which led to the immediate resignation of the commissioner?
The position taken by the Council for Yukon Indians is that
the actions of the minister were both unconstitutional and in
violation of the Yukon Act. I believe they have obtained a
legal opinion on that. I would like to know if the minister has
received that letter.
Senator Flynn: The honourable senator was kind enough to
show me the news release to which he is referring, in which it
is mentioned that they had sent me a telegram. However, I
have not seen that telegram. I will certainly look into that
matter. They may have received a legal opinion, but I do not
think it was from my department. In any event, I will look into
the matter and, if it will serve any purpose, also the reference
to the Supreme Court of Canada.

AUTHORITY OF COMMISSIONER TO SIGN ORDERS IN COUNCIL

Senator Lucier: As a supplementary, on December 4, Senator Flynn, in reply to a question I had asked earlier, stated:
-I have been carrying about with me for some time now
the response to a question put to me by Senator Lucier on
November 22. I have been holding off, waiting until he
was in the house before replying.
I know that it was not the intention of the minister to give the
impression that I was not in the house. I would point out that I
have attended the house every day since I asked the question. I
realize that I was not here at the time the minister answered
the question. I do not want to have the impression left that I
was not in attendance.
When I asked that question, one of the points I raised was
that the minister might look into the legality of what had
taken place concerning Dawson City. I have before me an
order in council that was signed by the commissioner authorizing the appointment of an administrator for Dawson City.
I should like the minister to look into the legality of an order
in council being signed by a commissioner. It has always been
my impression-I could be wrong on this-that a commissioner signs commissioner's orders as authorized by the Yukon
Act. I would like to know under what authority the commissioner has been permitted to sign an order in council.
Senator Flynn: I shall certainly look into that matter. I do
not know whether the Government of the Yukon can pass an
order in council as can the provincial governments.
In mentioning the fact that Senator Lucier was not in the
house, I was indicating that he was not in the house at that
time. The problem is that the question period, or discussion
period-whatever one might wish to call it-sometimes takes
so long that when we present delayed answers, those honourable senators to whom they are directed have lost patience.

CUSTOMS TARIFF
INTRODUCTION OF AMENDING LEGISLATION

Senator Haidasz: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the government leader. In view of the fact
that we have approximately only seven sitting days left before
the end of this year, and in view of the fact that the first phase
of the GATT tariff reductions are to begin on January 1,
1980, can the government leader tell us when a new customs
tariff bill will be presented to Parliament, and by what date we
shall have to deal with it?
e (1510)
Senator Flynn: Senator Roblin seems to be able to give that
reply.
Senator Roblin: Perhaps I might respond to that question,
honourable senators. I presume my honourable colleague is
talking about Bill C-18, which is the latest set of amendments
to the Customs Tariff. This measure is before the House of
Commons for third reading today. If Bill C-17 receives third
reading in this house today, it is intended to have royal assent.
So if that happens, I think that will take care of the matter.
GATT-NON-TARIFF MEASURES TO OFFSET LOSS IN TRADE

Senator Haidasz: I have a supplementary question to put to
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. When can we
expect new non-tariff measures on technical barriers to trade
which, I believe, the government has in mind to offset any loss
in trade that will come about from the new tariff reductions
agreed to by Canada at GATT?
Senator de Cotret: I take it you are referring to the industriai and labour adjustment packages. Those packages have been
under review by officiais since the finalization of the round.
They are before cabinet at the moment. They will be
announced, as promised, before January 1.

SUPPLY AND SERVICES
ROLE OF MINISTER IN QUEBEC

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I would like to put
a question to the Leader of the Government-not the Leader
of the Opposition. I have it right this time!
Senator Flynn: A man gets used to it.
Senator Marchand: I would like this question to be as non
partisan as possible. Following the visit of the Prime Minister
to Quebec City, I noted that there was a great feeling of
optimism and joy and I tried to understand. I found the answer
in the Globe and Mail this morning. It shows that our two
cultures do complement one another very well. I read the
speech made by the Right Honourable Joe Clark, who said the
following:
[English]
Roch (La Salle) is responsible for our purchasing ...
(which) surpasses $2.5 billion ... Roch, you know, is also
our political manager here and that, too, is important.

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
[Translation]
Now I understand why they were so happy. Could the
Leader of the Government tell us if that optimism must be
restrained or moderated?
Senator Flynn: Where?
Senator Marchand: Considering the budget of Mr. La Salle
and his position as political manager in Quebec, we can
understand the phenomenon which I described a few moments
ago.
Senator Flynn: I was there when the Prime Minister made
his speech and that part was in French. I understood what he
said. And when he pointed out the importance of the department given to Mr. La Salle, he did not use the word "manager" but he said: "He is the political minister of Quebec." I
think it is much better that he should be instead of me or
Senator Asselin. Anyhow, the fact that there is new or
renewed optimism in Quebec is not necessarily due to Mr. La
Salle. It is mostly because the government shows that even if
there is no Liberal government in Quebec, the sun still shines
and it is not a disaster for Quebec.
Senator Marchand: Of course, with $2.5 billion there is
much hope. No answer to the white paper is necessary.
Senator Flynn: That budget was probably drawn up by the
former government.

TRANSPORT
CROWSNEST RATES FOR MOVING GRAIN

Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, I should like to
pose a question to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It concerns the so-called Crow rate for moving prairie
grain to market.
Last April 18 when the now Prime Minister of Canada was
speaking in the city of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, he stated that
the Crow rates would stay, period. Since that time the Minister of Transport, on several occasions-and especially on one
occasion in Calgary this fall-talked about preserving the
benefits of the Crow rates without talking about preserving the
rates themselves.
I am wondering whether the minister can now, or after
conversation with the Minister of Transport, assure this house
that the Crow rates for moving grain from the prairies to the
export markets will remain, and that there will be no increase
in freight charges to the producers of those grains.
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to discuss the matter with
the Minister of Transport, who is also the minister responsible
for the Wheat Board, and then report back to the Senate.
Senator McDonald: May I ask a supplementary question? It
is my understanding that the minister will be speaking to, I
believe, the Palliser Wheat Growers Association in Calgary
early in the new year. It is also my understanding that some
announcements in this regard will be made then. I sincerely
hope that the reply to my previous question will not be
[Senator Marchand.]

following that meeting but prior to it, as I think we ought to be
aware of what commitments are going to be made prior to that
speech being made in Calgary.
Senator Flynn: You do not want him to make a speech?
Senator McDonald: He can make ail the speeches he likes,
but he should tell us first.
Senator Flynn: Why?
Senator Steuart: Why not?
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to take that matter up
with the minister and report back to the chamber.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ZIMBABWE-RHODESIA-CANADIAN ROLE IN CONSTITUTIONAL
CRISIS

Senator Macquarrie: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to my long-time, learned and usually genial
friend, the Leader of the Government. It does not concern the
situation in Iran where, in my opinion, the Secretary of State
for External Affairs is demonstrating the strength, wisdom,
restraint and consistency of which we are aIl very proud. My
question deals with something much more positive on the
international scene, namely, the situation in ZimbabweRhodesia, where it looks as if a united Commonwealth initiative could be very helpful to the people of that area. I am sure
that he, like myself, welcomes the Commonwealth initiative
and believes that it should not be left to Britain alone to
develop policies which could be helpful.
Could I ask the Leader of the Government to tell us of the
consultations between the British and Canadian governments
as to the part Canada might play in placating the serious
difficulties which have been prevailing for far too long in the
area?
Senator Flynn: I may say that the compliments the honourable senator has paid to me are not sufficient to make me
obtain an answer for him today. I will take the question as
notice.

ENERGY
POSSIBILITY OF DESIGNATING CANADIAN COMPANY TO
NEGOTIATE PURCHASE OF FOREIGN OIL

Senator Lamontagne: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct two supplementary questions to the Minister of State for
Economic Development. Since our oil supplies from Iran have
been cut off, because Gulf Canada is nothing more than a
subsidiary of an American corporation, could the government
ask a truly Canadian corporation to negotiate our oil supplies
with foreign countries?
Senator de Cotret: The answer is no.
Senator Lamontagne: I beg your pardon?
Senator de Cotret: The answer is no.

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Lamontagne: That is why Canadian sovereignty
over oil imports from foreign countries no longer exists. So,
how can the Canadian government hope to negotiate a new
deal?
A supplementary question.
Senator de Cotret: I thought that was your question.
Senator Lamontagne: It was a comment.
Senator de Cotret: I would perhaps rather answer the
comment, if I may.
Once again I should like to stress one point with regard to
our foreign supplies. First of all, concerning Gulf, as I said a
moment ago it assured us that, to the best of its knowledge, it
could obtain supplies elsewhere. It would find supplies equal to
those coming from Iran.
However, in the case of Iran, I fail to see why I should be
told today that we need a crown company to ensure our
sovereignty in connection with supplies coming from Iran
when last week your party told us, even before Iran cut off
anything, that we should stop trading with that country. So I
fail to see the point of it all. Something is illogical somewhere.
Senator Lamontagne: My question is in no way limited to
Iran because we know full well that the same problem exists
with Venezuela, and as of now with Mexico. In any event, I
am not speaking on behalf of the other Liberals. Different
views can exist in our ranks as they do in yours. But, answer
my question.
Senator Flynn: There are more differences of opinion now
than before!
Senator de Cotret: I think I have answered your question.
You asked me if I foresaw a role for a crown company, a state
company in this field, and I answered no, I did not see one.
Senator Lamontagne: In other words, you would rather
Canada continued to depend on American multinationals to
negotiate the purchase of supplies from abroad?
Senator de Cotret: No, not at all. I said no to a public
agency in that area. We said many, many times that we
wished a corporation such as Petro-Canada belonged to
Canadians, which would have an important role in the energy
field in Canada. We also talked about an increased contribution by Canadians in the development of energy resources
during the next decade. We talked of the fundamental need,
not to establish a corporation that will guarantee foreign
supply, but the fundamental need for Canada to become
self-sufficient in energy supply by 1990. That is what we aim
at in our policies.
Senator Lamontagne: I am willing to wait patiently until
1990 to see the results, but there is no doubt supply shortages
will occur at the end of 1979 or the beginning of 1980.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE OIL FROM MEXICO

Senator Lamontagne: I should like to put a last supplementary to the Minister of State for Economic Development.

Last November 6 I asked him if oil deliveries to Canada
from Mexico would begin at the end of 1979, as indicated in
the protocol agreed to several months ago by the two
governments.
The minister said then that he would answer later. Could he
now say what progress has been made in the negotiations
between the two countries, negotiations which he said last
October 30 were not necessary and which, according to the
Canadian ambassador to Mexico, had not begun on October
30? However, they have been intensive since the Conservative
Party came to power, according to the statements the Right
Honourable Prime Minister made, in the other place yesterday
afternoon.
Senator de Cotret: I will certainly give you a full report on
the progress of the negotiations, how matters stand and which
corporations and agencies are involved. I will give you every
possible detail.
Senator Lamontagne: Dates also, if possible.
Senator de Cotret: Dates also, yes, with pleasure. I should
like to make just a small correction. In your preamble you said
there is no doubt there will be supply shortages before the end
of 1979. I can say this: without doubt there will be no supply
shortages in 1979, none.
Senator Lamontagne: At the beginning of 1980.

ENERGY
CAPE BRETON ISLAND-FINANCING OF DONKIN COAL MINE

Senator Muir: Honourable senators, my question is for the
Minister of Economic Development. Let me assure honourable
senators that my question is entirely non-political.
Senator Perrault: That's a change.
Senator Muir: Having read Debates of the Senate for many
years before I came here, I was utterly shocked today to think
that someone on the other side might suggest that there should
not be anything about politics mentioned in this chamber.
My question, however, is with regard to future energy
potential. It specifically concerns a commitment made by both
the previous government and the present government about the
opening of a new coal mine, the Donkin coal mine on Cape
Breton Island. May I ask the honourable minister how soon we
may be in a position to hear some news from the present
government-the other government promised it for years and
years, although I suppose if I say that I am being political; I
am sorry-or an announcement with regard to the finances
that are required and a possible date for a start to be made?
I realize that the honourable minister, as brilliant as he is,
and as well as he does in this chamber, does not carry
everything in his head. If he can take this question as notice,
however, and let us know something about the matter at the
next sitting, I shall be grateful.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Thériault: Seeing where the question comes from, I
wouldn't be surprised if the minister has the answer in his back
pocket.

An Hon. Senator: Proceed.
Senator de Cotret: No, but if anybody would like to add

An Hon. Senator: Touché.
Senator Thériault: I was simply saying that the minister
probably has the answer in his back pocket; that's all.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I will be very
happy to answer Senator Muir's question right now. As a
matter of fact, I had discussions only last evening with the
minister responsible for regional economic expansion, and
somewhat less recently with the provincial government, on the
Donkin mine situation. I am happy to report that the matter is
now before cabinet. I expect a very early decision by my
cabinet colleagues on the committee on economic development.
It will be discussed in the very near future-within the next
few days-and I believe we will be in a position to make an
announcement on that question in a matter of weeks, certainly
not in a matter of years,

EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION
REFUGEES FROM INDOCHINA-REDUCTION
SPONSORSHIP

IN GOVERNMENT

Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, I have a question
for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. My question
is about an article in today's Le Devoir entitled "Ottawa
abandons refugee sponsorship". I would simply like to ask him
whether there is a new policy with respect to sponsoring, in
addition to the one announced a few months ago under which
50,000 refugees would be admitted into Canada provided half
of them, or 50 per cent, be by private institutions. The article
says the government seems to have changed its mind.
So could the Leader of the Government tell us or take my
question as notice and inform this house as soon as possible?
Senator Flynn: The maximum number of 50,000 refugees
still remains our objective. The response of the private sector,
that is sponsoring by the private sector, has been so extraordinarily enthusiastic that it no longer seems necessary for the
government to continue to sponsor half of the expected 50,000
refugees. But the saving of $1,300 the government will be able
to make on every refugee it does not have to sponsor will be
diverted toward help for the Cambodian refugees.
Senator Thériault: Did the Leader of the Government say
$1,300 or $13 million?
Senator Flynn: Thirteen hundred dollars per refugee. That is
what it is costing the government, $1,300 per refugee. The
[Senator Muir.]

December 6, 1979

amount that could be saved on the Vietnam refugee program
will be used to help the people in Cambodian refugee camps.
Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, a supplementary
because the article in Le Devoir said in part, as mentioned by
the ministers, Mr. Atkey and Miss MacDonald, and I quote:
One of the reasons behind the decision was that too many
letters from voters to politicians expressed some dissatisfaction with the admission of refugees.
Could the leader inform us and report to this house whether
that is the main reason behind the change in the government's
policy?
Senator Flynn: I am not personally aware of that kind of
letter. I did not receive any. I heard that many people had
written about that, perhaps to other ministers. But whether it
was a factor, that is possible. In any case, I will ask the
Minister of Employment and Immigration.

GRAIN
TRANSPORTATION POLICY

Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. The minister
replied last week to a question I asked previously about a
proposed meeting in Winnipeg on grain transportation. His
reply then was that a meeting would be held in mid-December.
I understand there is a meeting of some kind called for
Monday next, and I am wondering whether that is the meeting
he was referring to, and, if so, whether it includes the same
participants who were at the meeting held in early January of
this year, again a meeting that had been requested by the
Manitoba government.
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to take the question as
notice. I shall check the list of participants to determine who
exactly will be in attendance and whether or not they are the
same as those at the meeting in early January.

INVESTIGATIVE STUDY OF CANADIAN EGG MARKETING

Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, some time ago the
Minister of Agriculture indicated that he had asked the National Farm Products Marketing Council to conduct an investigation into CEMA. Can the Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce indicate now whether that study has been
completed?
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge, that study
has not yet been completed. I will make inquiries and, if it is in
fact completed, I shall inform the honourable senator when it
was completed and, if not, the stage it is at. As far as I know
at this time, it has not been completed.

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED-ANNOUNCED INCREASE IN PRICE OF

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I undertook yesterday
to determine whether or not a meeting had been arranged with
the President of Imperial Oil for the purpose of discussing the
proposed price increase for gasoline in this country.
I am happy to be able to tell the Leader of the Opposition
that the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources will be
meeting with the President of Imperial Oil tomorrow, Friday,
at which meeting he will request, on behalf of the government,
that Imperial Oil present full details to justify the proposed
price increase. If those representations do not justify the
increase, the government will suggest to Imperial Oil that any
increases be reconsidered.
CRIMINAL CODE
ABORTIONS-REPORT OF STATISTICS CANADA

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have a response to
Senator Haidasz' question respecting abortions in Canada.
Senator Haidasz, on November 29 last, expressed his concern
on this issue, as I do, and I have inquired of officials of my
department and of the Department of National Health and
Welfare as to the validity of statistics published last week on
therapeutic abortions.
Senator Haidasz is correct in his statement that the latest
report from Statistics Canada shows that the total number of
therapeutic abortions performed on residents of Canada
increased by 8.2 per cent in 1978 over 1977. However, this
figure is still less than the 10.5 per cent increase recorded in
1976.
When one looks at the trend over the past several years,
both the annual increase in the total number of abortions and
the abortion rate appear to be levelling off. It is true, as well,
that in the United States and the United Kingdom, where
more liberal abortion legislation was enacted in 1967, the
figures show almost no change in the abortion rate over the
last few years.
The lower increase in the absolute number of abortions
performed on Canadian residents in Canada and the decrease
in the number of therapeutic abortions performed on Canadian
residents in the United States, both suggest a levelling off in
the number of abortions obtained by Canadians.
I also wish to inform the honourable senator that I have not
yet received a brief from the Campaign Life Canada group.
However, I have contacted that organization and they have
agreed to forward me a copy of their brief, which I shall be
interested in reading.
FISHERIES
RESTRICTION ON TRAWLER FISHING IN GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE

Senator Flynn: Finally, honourable senators, I have a
response to a question put by Senator Marchand and Senator
Thériault-

80072-36

[ Translation]
-regarding trawlers of 100 feet or more in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.
In answer to Senator Marchand on November 8, I stated
that permits of this kind would apply only for the year 1980
and that according to experts from the department there was
no danger with respect to stock levels by granting this permit.
As to the 1980 season, no decision bas yet been taken. An
announcement to that effect will soon be made.
When that decision was taken observers were placed aboard
these trawlers to make regular reports on the situation.
According to the reports of these observers there have been no
problems, no irregularities, no complaints. Senator Thériault
said that the 6,000 metric tons quota may have been exceeded.
The information I have is that so far the catch has reached a
level of only 3,000 metric tons.
Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, may I ask for
some clarification?
You talked about the 1980 season. Do you actually mean
this fall-obviously the season is almost over-or next spring
and next fall?
Senator Flynn: I meant 1979, so I should have said the fall
of 1979. My mistake. I apologize.
1 think that closes the matter.

STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
FIRST REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE-POINT OF ORDER

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, at the outset of
this afternoon's sitting I undertook to discuss at this time the
matter raised in connection with certain comments made by
Senator Bosa at our sitting of December 4. I shall not dignify
what I have to say with the title of a ruling. As honourable
senators will see as I proceed, it is, rather, a non-ruling.
Honourable senators will recall that at the conclusion of the
debate on the Second Report of the Committee on Standing
Rules and Orders, Senator Bosa rose and said:
-1 wonder if I may have your permissionHe was addressing honourable senators.
-to raise a matter on a point of clarification.
I took it, and I take it now, that the word "permission"
would generally be interpreted as asking for leave, and that
leave was granted. Therefore I find that Senator Bosa was at
that point in order, with the possible exception of an interpretation of the rule which states that one day's notice is required
for a statement, although that rule, I must say, is not all that
clear. In any event, I took it then, and take it now, that he was
in order at that time.
Then certain honourable senators rose to suggest that Senator Bosa was out of order because, in the words of Senator
McDonald, his remarks were in reference to a motion already
passed. Senator Roblin then said:

SENATE DEBATES
The fact is that the Senate bas disposed of that matterAnd later on Senator Smith (Colchester) made the same point,
that being that the matter had been disposed of by the Senate.
The matter referred to, of course, was a motion by Senator
Neiman, properly seconded, that the report be referred back to
the committee which had made that report to the Senate.
The difficulty arose because Senator Bosa, in his opening
remarks, said:
*

(1540)

Senator Neiman proposed an amendment at the end of
her remarks, which is highly contradictory according to
my interpretation. I just wonder whether the Senate was
not too hasty in adopting that amendment which has now
put us into a dilemma.
1 take it, therefore, the point of order is whether Senator
Bosa was, at that point, entitled to make a comment on a
matter which had been disposed of by the Senate or, alternatively, a comment on the way in which it had been disposed of
by the Senate.
I find there is nothing in our rules to cover this matter other
than the possibility of notice, which 1 think would not be
applicable because, I take it, Senator Bosa sought leave. The
only rule that I can find that would seem to be applicable is
rule 47(1) which, I imagine, is the one that honourable
senators were relying upon when they objected to the comments made by Senator Bosa.
Rule 47(l) reads:
A motion shall not be made which is the same in
substance as any question which, during the same session,
has been resolved in the affirmative or negative, unless the
order, resolution, or other decision on such question has
been rescinded as hereinafter provided.
I would say that that rule is not applicable because there
was no motion before the Senate at that time. Senator Bosa
merely rose and said he was going to make some comments.
Some honourable senators may not have liked the comments
but, so far as I can find, there is nothing in our rules that
would prevent his making that comment.
Having said that, I would have to add-as some honourable
senators will immediately remind me-that there is a general
practice that, if it does not prohibit, it at least discourages,
comments, particularly adverse comments, in a chamber such
as this concerning an action taken by the chamber.
This is a non-ruling because I can find no rule which would
prohibit an honourable senator rising, with leave, and, having
the leave of the Senate, saying almost anything he wishes as
long as it is not personal, taxing or sharp. I thought honourable senators might be interested to note that our rule prohibits them, in theory at least, from being "sharp" in their
questioning.
This is the general situation. Therefore, if honourable senators will accept it, this is a non-ruling and merely an explanation of the situation as I see it.
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

December 6,

1979

Senator Donahoe: Most of the questions from the other side
are not very sharp.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think it all comes down to this: We
do have rules which call for notice of actions taken by honourable senators. It bas not been the custom here to pay very
much attention to those rules. Over and over again honourable
senators ask for leave, which is granted without honourable
senators even knowing what they are granting leave for.
To perhaps avoid a recurrence of this situation, I would
suggest to honourable senators that they carefully consider
whether they need to ask leave when, obviously, notice would
be required under our rules. The reason for this, of course, is
so that senators can determine whether the matter, as raised, is
in order.

Trade Agreement Act, 1960 and The Union of South Africa
Trade Agreement Act, 1932.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
INCOME TAX ACT
CANADA PENSION PLAN
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

Leave having been given to proceed to Order No. 5:
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, November 7, the
debate on the motion for the second reading of Bill C-17, to
amend the statute law relating to income tax and to amend the
Canada Pension Plan.
Senator Lang: Honourable senators, I do not wish to detain
you long on this this afternoon, particularly as we had the
benefit of an explanation of Bill C-17 from Senator Hayden
when be presented the report of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce on the subject matter of
the bill.
This is the first time I have addressed a bill in this house as
a member of the opposition. I find it rather interesting that it
should be a bill that originated in the House of Commons
when I was a senator on the government side. This presents
somewhat of a conundrum so far as taking an opposition
stance is concerned.
I do think, however, it is important for us to briefly review
the history of this legislation and note how it does reflect on
the workings of our parliamentary system.
A ways and means motion was introduced in the other place
by the Honourable Mr. Chrétien, the Minister of Finance, on
November 16, 1978; a further ways and means motion was

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

introduced by him in the House of Commons on January 25,
1979; and then Bill C-37, the antecedent legislation of the bill
we have before us today, came to first reading in the House of
Commons on January 29 of this year.
Fortunately, at that time, the Senate authorized the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee to pre-study this bill.
That authorization was given to the committee on January 30,
1979. The committee proceeded to study the bill in accordance
with its mandate and, on March 8 of this year, made a report
to this house.
Bill C-37 then died on the order paper at the dissolution of
Parliament, and its successor comes before us now having had
first reading on October 25 last and having been pre-studied
again by the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce in accordance with an authorization given by
the Senate on November 1.
Honourable senators, to judge the merit of this legislation, I
think a good yardstick to use is the extent to which it represents the recommendations of the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce in its March 1979 report.
First, with respect to the small business deduction sections, I
would note the following: This bill implements the committee's
recommendations with regard to an objection it laid out at that
time, that the definition to be accorded to "qualifying businesses" and to "non-qualifying businesses" was to be spelled
out by regulation rather than incorporated in the bill. This has
been a tendency in recent years, and one which the Senate has
always strongly opposed.
*

(1550)

Fortunately, that recommendation and criticism has been
met by incorporating those definitions in the legislation-and
very important they are, too, to maintain parliamentary
supremacy in this area.
Following Bill C-37 much concern was expressed in respect
of the exclusion, from the small business tax rate, of professional people, and certainly the service industries and particularly services with regard to the provision of management. As
a consequence, the government revised its position and created
a new tax rate covering those categories of people. The new
rate was 33½ per cent compared to 48 per cent, which is what
it would otherwise have been.
That is basically in conformity with the comments made by
your committee, and it does do away with the discriminatory
nature inherent in the original proposal. As a matter of fact,
several of your committee's recommendations were not met,
specifically those with respect to the number of employees
required to qualify a business for the small business tax rate,
and those with respect to corporations having capital invested
at risk or in intangible assets, and which your committee
thought should also be recognized for small business tax
deductions. However, on balance, this bill is a significant
improvement over the bill that we had before dissolution, and
its main thrust is in line with the committee's recommendations.

I should like just briefly to mention the matter of term
preferred shares. The difficulties encountered after Bill C-37
was introduced in the House of Commons were recognized by
the previous government and they have been recognized by this
government. Basically, as Senator Hayden has said, it was a
question of definition-definition that would be accurate but
would avoid, particularly, retroactivity affecting business
structures that had been put in place under the old act and had
been continued under the new bill. At that stage the Minister
of Finance came before us and gave nine specific undertakings
with respect to the bill we have today in order to meet the
objections that your committee had to the definition of "term
preferred shares", and to meet the objections that witnesses
had raised during the hearings before your committee.
This bill is not perfect. I would certainly like to see improvements to it. Quite a few of your committee's recommendations,
which were not of major significance, were not dealt with in
this bill. In other words, they are not recommendations that go
to the root of the legislation in such a way as to warrant in any
fashion attempting to amend or to delay the passage of the
bill.
It is important that this legislation pass this chamber and
become law before the Minister of Finance delivers his budget
next Tuesday. I assume, although I am not certain of it, that
unless that is the case the new ways and means motion will
supersede this piece of legislation. For that reason, and also
because your committee has been seized of this bill for a
lengthy period of time in one form or another and on two
references from this chamber, I recommend its passage.
Please bear in mind, honourable senators, that the Minister
of Finance made commitments before the committee, and I am
sure some of those will be incorporated in his budget next
Tuesday night. In view, therefore, of the lengthy history of
prestudy and the reports flowing from that, I hope no one will
require this bill to go back to committee for further study after
second reading. I hope also, honourable senators, that the bill
receives quick passage here. If it is the wish of the Senate, it is
my hope that the bill will receive third reading today.
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is my duty to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Roblin
speaks now, be will close the debate on the motion.
Senator Roblin: Honourable senators, as no one else wishes
to speak now, I will take advantage of the opportunity to close
the debate with a brief word or two on this subject.
It is a little bit like a work of supererogation for me to
attempt to add much to what we have heard today in connection with the bill that is before us, because, when Senator
Hayden made his comments on the tabling of the report, we
had the advantage of his detailed and technical survey of the
matters that are in the bill. Further to that, we have just heard
from Senator Lang an equally well-qualified and balanced
description of the bill and the background that preceded its
discussion here today.

SENATE DEBATES
1 really do flot know how 1 could improve on the information
placed before us by these two gentlemen. It would perhaps be
suitable for me to say that if ever one wanted a working mode!
of the advantages of the prestudy system on the subject matter
of a bill-in this case the type of hill that Senator Hayden has
pionecred over several years-one could scarccly do better
than to look at the history of this piece of legisiation, because,
as Senator Lang said, it has been studied by the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce on two
occasions on the basis of a prestudy reference. As a consequence, the committee has been able to go into the details of
the bill without feeling that it was being crowded in respect of
its cons ideration of the matter.
1, for one, appreciate very much the way in which this
system works to the general advantage of the Senate, and 1 amn
pleased to be able to say so. 1 also want to add a note of thanks
to the chairman and the members of the committee. In the last
few weeks, flot only in connection with this hi!! but in connection with Bill C-14 and others that have been before the
committee, they have been the absolute sou! of diligence. 1
could flot expect any group of men to have worked at their task
more conscientiously nor more steadily than this committee
has donc. Although I arn a member of it myscîf, 1 would like
to say that the glory does flot belong to me; it belongs to the
other members of the committee and the chairman who Ieads
it. I should like to say to them that their co-operation and
diligence in discharging their function wou!d be hard to beat.
*

(1600)

Hon. Senators: H-ear, hear.
Senator Roblin: 1 think this says something about the spirit
in which we try to discharge our duties here in the Senate.
I must say that the hi!! is much better than the first mode!
we saw, namely, Bill C-37 of the last session. It was agreed at
the first round !ast year, particuîarly in connection with the
small-business-deduction prob!em and the delegation-of-legislation-to-regulation problem, that the Senate committee was
flot pleased, and it presented some very firm recommendations
about that. Some people wiIl think perhaps that it goes a bit
far to have to have a dissolution and a new government in
order to get the changes made, although 1 expect some would
say that the o!d government would have made them anyway,
and I arn quite wiîling to say that might weIl have been the
case.
In any event, the hi!! is much better than it was, and 1 think
it is due in large measure to the efforts of the Senate that it is
a better bill, because to a great extent it is the measures that
have been proposed by the Senate and its committee that have
been adopted and that have resulted in a better piece of
legislation.
Even so, as Senator Lang fairly and accurately said, there
are stil! some things to be done before the Senate committee is
going to be completely satisfied. I cannot say whether we wil!
reach the happy stage of complete satisfaction, but 1 do know
that we had some pretty substantial uridertakings from the
minister with respect to matters that were important to us. and
I think we mnay confidently cxpect to sec those dealt with in
[Senator Roblin.]

Dcme 6, 1979

the legisiation that will be forthcoming after the budget. There
were other matters on which he did not give us quite so firm a
feeling of his intention, but 1 arn confident that, since he told
us that he wiIl give serious consideration to these other matters
for which he could not give a firm undertaking at the moment.
we may expect him to respond in the spirit in which the
proposaIs were put forward by the members of the committee
and their adoption by members of this house. 1 mere!y say that
this represents, 1 think, a good piece of work on the part of this
body.
1 thank Senator Lang very much for the suggestion that, in
view of the committee's work, it is not necessary to refer the
bil! back to the committee. That is my feeling too. In fact, 1
would go so far as to suggest that if the bil! receives second
reading in a few minutes, as 1 hope it will, we go to third
reading right away, with leave of the Senate, so that we may
have royal assent to this bill and to Bil! C-l18 this evening.
Motion agreed to and hi!! read second time.

SAFE CONTAINERS CONVENTION ACT
BILL REFERRED BACK TO THE STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE
ON TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Macdonald, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Roblin, P.C., for the third reading of the Bill S-5,
intituled: "An Act to implement the International Convention for Safe Containers".-(Honourable Senator
Smith (Colchester)).
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I understand from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there
may be some desire on his part or that of some of his
colleagues to make some comments on this bill. If so, I would
ask the Senate for permission to yield to him or his colleagues,
reserving my right to enter the debate later on if that should be
appropriate and agreeable.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators,
that Senator Smith (Colchester) yield to Senator Olson?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, if I may rise on a point
of order it will probably simplify the matter of the participation of Senator Smith (Colchester) in the debate on the motion
before us for third reading of Bill S-5.
I have searched the Rules of the Senate, I think rather
thoroughly, and they do not give an indication of the precise
nature by which the third reading of a bill must take place. Let
me explain. They do not say, for example, as some of the
authorities do, that on the third reading of a bill it may not be
amended. What they do say is that it may be amended in any
manner that it is capable of being amended on second reading.
However, if you search those authorities still deeper you will
find that, by and large, in most legislative assemblies the
purpose of third reading is either to vote in favour of the bill or
to reject it, or to send it back to the committee for further
consideration.
The fifth edition of Beauchesne makes some prohibition
against such things as attaching instructions to the committee
when an amendment is moved on third reading, or when there
is a motion to refer the bill back to the committee. I say that
because I am not trying to make the argument that an
amendment could not have been moved by Senator Haidasz, if

rstifl

rrC'

it was, in fact, an amendment, a clause, or some clauses, in the
bill. My understanding, however, is that what he was seeking
to do was to add a condition to the bill when it was sent to the
other place, without changing or amending the substance of
the bill in the committee.
I have some problems with this as well, because if the bill is
referred back to the committee for further consideration, it
seems to me that Senator Haidasz, or any other senator, would
have some difficulty in moving an amendment that would
achieve what he explained to this chamber he wanted to do,
namely, to amend it in such a way that some additional
inspectors are made available to the Canadian Transport
Commission, I believe, to make sure that the administrative
effect of this bill is indeed carried out. As he explained, he was
impressed by their argument that there was an insufficient
number of person-years to do that.
* (1610)

From my reading of our rules, it is not within the competence of the Senate to move an amendment to a bill that would
result in an increased charge on the treasury.
It was generous of Senator Smith (Colchester) to read the
unrevised or unedited transcript of the committee meeting
because it explained the context in which Senator Haidasz was
under the impression that what he had in mind could be done
on third reading.
I support unreservedly the ruling of His Honour the Speaker
that these riders or conditions, or whatever we might wish to
call them, cannot be included or attached to a bill when sent to
the Commons. His Honour indicated that the practice had
been tried in the past, and it appeared that the message had
not been communicated to the members of the other place. I
am not arguing that point. We now have a ruling that will be
used as a precedent, and it seems to me that in fairness to the
position taken in committee the bill should be referred back
for further consideration.
Senator Haidasz is now aware of the Speaker's ruling and
will know that what he had in mind simply cannot be achieved
on third reading. By returning the bill to committee for further
consideration it would remove-I do not wish to use too strong
a word-the somewhat misguided advice that the senator
received in committee, because it is now clear that what he
was attempting to do cannot be done on third reading. The
matter can be discussed further in committee.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I take it
that we are not engaged in a debate at the moment, but rather
in a discussion of the point of order. I have no objection, as
chairman of the committee, to having the bill referred back for
further consideration, if that is the wish of the Senate. I am
sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when he cast
some doubt on the accuracy of the advice given to Senator
Haidasz, did not mean to infer that the chairman had given
that advice.
Senator Oison: Certainly not.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I had felt that Senator Haidasz, when he rose on third reading, was under a misapprehension. I believe it would be in the interests of treating the

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
senator fairly if the matter were referred back to committee. I
should not like anyone to have any misunderstanding of what
might happen in committee. I do not know what other position
I can take except the one that I have taken. That would be the
position I would expect to take, unless someone could convince
me that I should alter it. Nevertheless, it is only fair and
reasonable that Senator Haidasz should have the opportunity
to do what he can before the committee.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I do not have the
precise wording before me, but I would like to move, seconded
by Senator Perrault:
That the bill be not now read the third time but that it
be referred back to the Standing Senate Committee on
Transport and Communications for further consideration.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Roblin, P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator
Macdonald, that this bill be now read the third time.
In amendment, it is moved by the Honourable Senator
Oison, P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator Perrault,
P.C., that this bill be not now read the third time but that it be
referred back to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport
and Communications for further consideration.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion
in amendment?
Motion in amendment agreed to.

CANADA
PROPOSED CHANGE OF GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES TO REFLECT
ITALIAN ORIGIN OF EARLY EXPLORER

Senator Bosa rose pursuant to notice of Thursday, October
25, 1979:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
desirability of recommending to the government that
efforts be made, in consultation with the provinces concerned, to have the name of Giovanni Caboto restored as
the place name for the geographical areas in Canada that
have been named after John Cabot in order to make the
ethnic origin of this early Italian explorer more apparent
and better known throughout Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I am pleased to have the
opportunity to bring to the attention of Canadians the importance of restoring the name of Giovanni Caboto, the discoverer
of Canada, to those geographical areas which are now known
by the anglicized version of his name, John Cabot. Some of
those geographical areas so named are: Cabot Lake, in Labrador North District, Newfoundland; Cabot Strait, connecting
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean; Cabot Trail,
a loop road on the northern part of Cape Breton Island, Nova
Scotia; Cabot, a railway point west of Winnipeg, Manitoba;
Cabot Head, on Georgian Bay, Ontario; and Cabot Lake in
New Quebec Territory, Quebec. There may be other such
places, but i do not think it is necessary that I name them ail
in order to make my point.
I am sure honourable senators share the view that it is
important that names be recorded properly and accurately in
our history books. It is not suggested that the name of Giovanni Caboto was deliberately anglicized for devious reasons.
A quick glance at the Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery
under Henry VIII, works issued by the Hakluyt Society,
second series No. CXX, 1961, will reveal that they contain a
number of documents relating to Caboto, one of which, No.
17, is a petition on behalf of "John Caboto, citizen of Venice,
Lewes, Sebastyan and Sancio, his sonnys" for letters patent,
and so forth. This document strongly suggests that, just before

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

his presumed death in 1498 during his second voyage, John
Caboto was the version of his name preferred by the navigator
himself. For some time the career of Giovanni Caboto and that
of his son Sebastian were confused by historians. It is true that
Sebastian himself claimed to have been born in England rather
than Venice, because in 1548 he fled the service of Spain and
returned to England. Charles V of Spain sought his extradition, and Sebastian adopted English nationality to avoid being
returned to Spain against his will. This fact, together with a
lack of stringent rules for accuracy, has definitely led to this
confusion, a confusion that persists to this day.
Considerable research has been done in this area by Mr.
Samuel Eliot Morison, as illustrated in his recent work The
European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages A.D.
500-1600, (New York, Oxford University Press, 1971). Mr.
Morison also contends that the navigator wanted to be known
by his name, Giovanni Caboto. Aside from other considerations, which I will explain in a moment, this fact alone
warrants changing his name.
Let me say that, by restoring his name to the original
spelling of Giovanni Caboto, we are not changing history, nor
are we taking credit away from anyone. Caboto's first voyage
might not have taken place in 1497 had it not been for the
wisdom of King Henry VII. The king saw the merits of
Giovanni's plan and he recognized his ability and talent to
search for a new route to the Indies. The king put at Giovanni's disposal a ship called The Matthews, with a crew of 22, so
that he could accomplish his mission. Giovanni landed, according to some historians, on what is now known as Cape Breton
Island. He took possession of the land in the name of King
Henry VII. This is history, and these are the facts, and no one
can change them.
Let us now look at the question of accurately spelling the
navigator's name from a different perspective. In Canada there
are approximately one million Canadians of Italian origin, a
great many of whom go back one or more generations. Many
others came to Canada during the past 30 years. I arrived in
Toronto on April 28, 1948, having been sponsored by my
father, who had already been a 20-year resident of Canada.
He left Italy when I was six months old; that was in 1927. I
met him for the first time when I arrived here.
The knowledge that one's predecessors have played a significant role in the discovery of this country instills in one a
feeling of pride. Others have participated in different areas
and at different times in the history of Canada. Some of those
would be: The navigator and explorer, Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524; De Lasalle's assistant, Enrico Tonti, in 1678;
The Governor of Trois-Rivières, Captain Grisafi, in 1703;
Brigadier General Carlo Burlamacchi, third in command to
General Montcalm; Joseph Marini, a high-ranking officer
wounded in the battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759. I
could go on, but for the purpose of making my point I need go
no further.
Canada is a nation of immigrants or descendants of immigrants. There are many other members of minority groups who
were present in Canada from the early stages of its history.

During the period of the French regime, a small number of
blacks, Germans, Irish, Portuguese, Italians, Scots and Spaniards, to mention a few, had settled in Canada. At the time of
Confederation, non-French and non-British Canadians constituted about 8 per cent of the total population of Canada. By
1911 that proportion had risen to 15 per cent. It is known in
the 1970s that they constitute approximately 30 per cent of the
total population.
There are several examples of communities and geographical areas that have been named after members of minority
groups. Some of these are:
Alberni, British Columbia: the city, port and canal were
named in 1971 after Don Petro Alberni, a captain in the
Spanish army, who commanded the Spanish soldiers sent to
occupy Nootka in 1790.
Almonte, Ontario, situated just outside of Ottawa, is named
after General Juan Almonte, a Mexican military and political
figure who was Mexican Ambassador to Washington.
Amundsen Gulf, in the Beaufort Sea area, is named after
the great Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who commanded the first Atlantic passage of the Northwest in
1903-1906.
Bering Strait is named after the Danish navigator Vitus
Bering, who in 1725 was assigned by the Czar, Peter the
Great, the task of determining whether Asia and North
America were joined land.

e

(1630)

Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, is named after Count Esterhazy,
an Hungarian nobleman who settled some of his countrymen
in the district.
Hanover, Ontario, is named after the many German pioneers from the German principality of that name who settled in
the vicinity.
Juan de Fuca Strait is named after its discoverer, Apostolos
Valerianos, a Greek pilot in the service of Spain under the
name of Juan de Fuca.
Labrador, Newfoundland was discovered by the English of
the town of Bristol on the directions they received from John
Fernandes, a Portuguese from the Azores, nicknamed
"Labrador".
In St. John's, Newfoundland, there is a monument to
honour Gaspar Corte-Real, a Portuguese explorer who reached
Placentia Bay in 1501.
Sir Casimir Gzowski, a Polish nobleman, was knighted in
1890 for his valuable services to Canada.
The Dutch gave us Cornelius Krieghoff, whose famous
paintings depict life among Indians and Quebec farmers.
These are just a few of the examples which signify involvement of members of minority groups in the history of Canada.
These historical facts should be taught at the elementary
school level, alongside the history of the French, the British
and the Indians.
Just think of the feeling of commonality that it would instill
in our children at a very early age. It would strengthen

SENATE DEBATES
national unity and would give our children a better perspective
of what Canada is. They would be better prepared to overcome
racial barriers.
Private enterprise should also be encouraged to play a part
in this important and sensitive area. I was pleased to be invited
to a meeting last Monday by Mr. Garrick and Mr. Delabarre,
the general manager of the C.N. tower, in Toronto, and
general manager of the C.N. tower restaurant, respectively, at
which they announced they are planning a month-long "Salute
to Italy" from April 3 to May 4, 1980. A "Salute to France"
took place during the month of May 1979, and a "Salute to
Japan" one year earlier. These salutes are a wonderful way of
proroting the tower. They also have some very beneficial
effects.
It has been the practice of the management of the tower
hitherto to make space available, free of charge, to interested
parties for exhibitions pertaining to products, art, travel, customs, et cetera. Mr. Garrick was receptive to the idea I
advanced, that on this occasion it would be desirable to focus
attention also on the involvement of Canadians of Italian
origin in the history of Canada. He thought he might interest
some corporations in financing the necessary research and
preparation for such a project. We should encourage initiatives
of this kind, because they focus attention on the positive
aspects of our society.
I am not saying that changing a name or giving a higher
profile to certain aspects of history are going to eliminate all
our problems. This approach would be simply an initial but
positive endeavour in the long process of coming to grips with
the various aspects of the problems that confront a complex
society, and it would show the sensitivity that Canadians feel
towards their fellow Canadians by recognizing each other's
roots in this land.
There are some people who have difficulty in understanding
a simple concept. They make the mistake of considering pride
in one's own cultural heritage as being un-Canadian. They
associate it with political affiliation with the country of origin.
To disprove this notion, I draw the attention of honourable
senators to the classic example of the Canadian-Ukrainian
community. Canadians of Ukrainian origin have shown their
determination to maintain their culture. It was the weight of
their intervention that changed the concept of a bicultural
society, advocated by the Pearson government in the mid-sixties, to the concept of a multicultural one. Can anyone dispute
their loyalty to this land and their genuine feeling of patriotism for Canada'? Look at how well they have integrated in
Canadian society. There are at this time two prominent cabinet ministers of Ukrainian origin in the Canadian government,
and even our Governor General has some Ukrainian blood in
his veins.
It is not a question of one-upmanship, nor is it a question of
changing history to suit the needs of the moment. It is a
question of recognizing that the texture of Canadian society

December 6, 1979

has changed dramatically in the recent past, and our history
books should reflect that change by recognizing the legitimate
contributions made to Canada's history by anyone, regardless
of ethnic background. The teaching of history should
endeavour, wherever possible, to give us a greater sense of
awareness of each other's contribution.
To that end, I urge honourable senators to support a recommendation to the government that efforts be made to have the
name of John Cabot restored to its original spelling, Giovanni
Caboto, for the reasons I have stated.
On motion of Senator Macquarrie, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE
REPORT ON THE SUBJECT MATTER 0F BILL C-17, "AN ACT TO AMEND THE STATUTE
LAW RELATING TO INCOME TAX AND TO AMEND THE CANADA PENSION PLAN"

December 5, 1979
On Thursday, October 25, 1979, Bill C-17, intituled "An
Act ta amend tbe statute law relating to income tax and ta
amend the Canada Pension Plan" received first reading in the
House of Commons. This Bill is intended to implement the
Ways and Means Motion relating to the Income Tax Act
tabled by the Minister of Finance on October 23, 1979.
By resolution of the Senate on November 1, 1979, the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce was autborized to examine and consider the subjectmatter of the Bill in advance of the Bill caming before the
Senate, or any matter relating thereto.
In accardance witb the Order of Reference, your Committee
has received and cons idered the said Bill C- 17 arising fromn the
Ways and Means Motion and in connection witb such consideration bas engaged the services of Mr. Charles Albert
Poissant, C.A. of Thorne Riddell & Ca., Chartered Accountants, and retained as its counsel, Mr. Thomas S. Gillespie of

Subject to certain exceptions, Bill C- 17 repraduces the
clauses of Bill C-37 wbicb received first reading an January
29, 1979 and which subsequently died on the order paper.
Your Committee's report on Bill C-37, tabled in the Senate on
Thursday, Marcb 8, 1979, contained a number of recommendations. Several of the recommendations related ta the small
business deduction and your Committee is pleased ta note that
substantial changes are proposed by Bill C- 17 in this area,
whicb changes reflect several of your Committee's recommendations. Your Committee is also pleased ta note tbat Bill C- 17
proposes ta eliminate the retroactive application of Clause 50
of Bill C-37 wbich proposed to tax lump sumn dispositions
arising an the termination of life annuity contracts issued
between January 1, 1978 and November 16, 1978-tbereby
adopting another recammendation of your Committee. Other

recommendations of your Committee in its report on Bill C- 17
are reviewed below. The Bill also introduces a number of
technical amendments ta tbe provisions of Bill C-37 relating ta
incarne bonds and term preferred shares. Tbese amendments
are alsa reviewed in detail later in this report.
The repart is divided into two parts: Part One deals with
Income Bonds and Term Preferred Shares and the intention of
the Minister of Finance ta introduce amendments relating
thereto with bis December 11, 1979 budget; Part Two deals
with the small business deduction and tbe recommendations
made by your Committee with respect ta Bill C-37 and whicb
are not reflected in Bill C- 17 and wbicb tbe Minister bas
indicated be will give consideration.
PART ONE
Incarne Bonds and Terrm Preferred Shares
Bill C-37 proposed substantial changes in the income tax
treatment of interest paid on incarne bonds and dividends paid
on term preferred sbares. Tbe general thrust of tbese changes
was ta tax interest paid on income bonds as interest (nat as
dividends as was tbe case heretofore) and ta deny any deduction ta specîfied financial institutions witb respect ta dîvidends
received on shares with terms of less than 10 years. Tbese
types of securities had been considered for tax purposes as
equity investments, altbougb they were essentially debt obligations. As a result, incarne earned by financial institutions on
such securities was being received as tax-free dividends rather
than as fully taxable interest.
The experience of National Revenue since November 16,
1978 concerning incarne bonds and term preferred shares
indicated amendments were necessary and sucb amendments
are reflected in Clauses 36, 66 and 67 of the Bill. Many of the
amendments cantained in Bill C- 17 bave retroactive effect or
cause unnecessary bardship and will bave ta be amended
furtber. The necessity for furtber amendment bas been discussed at Iengtb witb officials of the Department of Finance
and the Minister. The Minister bas undertaken before the
Committee ta intraduce amendments witb bis forthcoming
budget and bas indicated ta the Cornmittee the general nature
of these amendments.
The following is a review of tbose amendments your Committee feels necessary as they relate ta term preferred shares.
In some instances, corresponding amendments will bave ta be
made respecting income bonds.

SENATE DEBATES
(1) Clause 36 proposes to add subsection 112(2.2) to the
Act which would deny any deduction in respect of dividends on
shares acquired after October 23, 1979 if a financial institution is or may be required to acquire the shares at any time or
provide any form of guarantee, security or covenant providing
protection with respect to such shares.
Your Committee is aware of several instances where banks,
in anticipation of amendments to the Bank Act, have caused
their subsidiaries to issue preferred shares to the public. In the
event the Bank Act is amended to allow banks to issue
preferred shares, such banks will exchange their preferred
shares for the preferred shares of their subsidiaries. Pending
such exchange, the banks have given certain protective covenants with respect to the preferred shares of their subsidiaries.
The effect of the amendments proposed by Clause 36 would be
to deny any deduction to taxpayers acquiring shares with such
protective covenants after October 23, 1979 with respect to
dividends received thereon.
(2) Subelause 66(7) of the Bill defines a term preferred
share. Subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition defines a term
preferred share to include those shares that may be redeemed,
acquired or cancelled or their paid-up capital reduced within
10 years of the date of their issue.
The effect of this provision would be to include financial
institutions from investing in the "put" market. That is to say,
they could not acquire options which give the holder thereof
the right to oblige a third party to acquire shares from them at
a determined price. Your Committee secs no reason why
financial institutions should be precluded from investing in the
put market for shares listed on prescribed stock exchanges.
(3) Subparagraph (a)(iii) of the definition defines a term
preferred share to include any share whereby the issuing
corporation or any other person may be required to redeem,
cancel or acquire the share within 10 years of issue, unless it is
pursuant to a requirement of the corporation to redeem,
acquire or cancel annually not more than 5% of the shares of
the class. Your Committee is aware that many such requirements incorporate a cumulative feature. That is to say, if a
corporation is unable to acquire any shares in any year, it may
cumulate its right to acquire the shares in succeeding years. It
is understood that the Department of National Revenue takes
the position that this subparagraph, as drafted, provides for
cumulative purchases. Your Committee is not confident that
this is the better interpretation. It is recommended that the
word "annually" on line 50 of page 96 of the Bill be replaced
with the phrase "in respect of any year" in order to provide
more clearly for a cumulative feature.
(4) Your Committee can envision an anomalous situation
arising from the drafting of subparagraphs (i) and (ii). That is
to say, should a share redeemable within 10 years of its issue
remain outstanding after 10 years from its issue, it will still
qualify as a term preferred share. It is recommended these
subparagraphs be amended to limit the application of the
definition to the first 10 years from the date of a share's issue.

(5) Subparagraph (a)(iii) includes in the definition of a
term preferred share shares issued after November 16, 1978 if
the issuing corporation or any other person provides or may be
required to provide any form of covenant "providing protection
with respect to the share". Such expression is clearly too
broad. If a financial institution were to acquire a share issued
after November 16, 1978 with one or more of the usual
covenants attaching to preferred shares, it would not be permitted a deduction for dividends received on the share. The
following are examples of standard covenants applying to
preferred shares:
(a) the corporation will not issue shares ranking in priority to or pari passu with the share without the holder's
consent;
(b) no dividends will be paid on common shares unless all
arrears of dividends on preferred shares have been paid;
(c) holders of preferred shares may vote in the event of
arrears of dividends.
Such covenants provide protection with respect to preferred
shares but should not disqualify financial institutions from
being entitled to deduct dividends from their income.
(6) Financial institutions owning shares acquired in the
ordinary course of business and giving them control or the
contingent right to acquire control of the issuing corporation
will not be entitled to deduct dividends received on such shares
(subsection 112(2.1) as proposed by Clause 36 and paragraph
(b) of the definition of a term preferred share as proposed by
subclause 66). Your Committee has several concerns with
respect to these provisions. Firstly, it is concerned with the use
of the expression "ordinary course of business". It is difficult
to define what constitutes "ordinary course of business" for
financial institutions. Banks and other financial institutions
regularly invest their surplus funds and such activity could
well be considered to be "in the ordinary course of business".
Similarly, shares acquired by a venture capital division or
subsidiary of a financial institution could be considered to be
"acquired in the ordinary course of business" of that division
or subsidiary. Such activities should not disallow the dividend
deduction available to a financial institution. Secondly, your
Committee can conceive of instances where financial institutions might invest either alone or together with one or more
other financial institutions in shares which might, inadvertently or not, give them a contingent right to acquire control, such
as in the case of failure to pay dividends for a specified period.
(7) Your Committee feels that paragraph (g) and subparagraph (h)(i) are too broad as drafted. As presented in the Bill,
any minor amendment to an "established agreement" (defined
to mean an agreement made before November 17, 1978 to
issue a share) or any agreement relating to such share might
change the share's status to a term preferred share.
(8) Subparagraph (h)(ii) of the definition provides that if
the owner of a share could at any time after November 16,
1978 require, either alone or together with others, the redemption, acquisition, cancellation, conversion or reduction of the
paid-up capital of the share (except on a default) unless the

December 6, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

share was listed on a prescribed stock exchange, the share
would be deemed to have been issued after November 16, 1978
other than pursuant to an established agreement. Thus, shares
issued prior to November 17, 1978 which were retractable (i.e,
redeemable at any time at the option of the holder) would be
considered to be term preferred shares. This is legislation of a
retroactive nature which adversely affects the taxpayer and is
the kind of legislation which the Committee has consistently
opposed.
(9) The effect of subparagraph (h)(iv) is to deem a share
issued before November 17, 1978 or pursuant to an established
agreement to have been issued after November 16, 1978 other
than pursuant to an established agreement if after October 23,
1979 the share is acquired from a non-financial institution by
a financial institution. In other words, financial institutions
would be prevented from acquiring certain shares from nonfinancial institutions (unless they are prepared to accept the
undesirable tax consequences). This provision would adversely
and retroactively affect certain transactions which took place
prior to October 23, 1979.
It is evident that much in the way of remedial amendment is
necessary to cure the defects noted above. Bill C-17 bas been
passed by the House of Commons and the Minister has
requested that it be passed by the Senate prior to the delivering of his budget on December 11, 1979. There is clearly
insufficient time to amend the Bill in time for passage prior to
December 11, 1979.
As a result, the Minister bas come before the Committee
and has given the following statements:
1. Amendments will be introduced with the Bill giving effect
to the December 11, 1979 budget to ensure that the provisions
of C-37, as drafted, will apply for the period between November 16, 1978 and October 23, 1979 and the provisions of Bill
C-17 will apply after October 23, 1979. The net effect will be
to remove any element of retroactivity in the application of the
proposed amending provisions of Bill C-17.
2. Subparagraph 7(a)(iii) of Clause 66 defining a "term
preferred share" will be amended to clarify what kinds of
covenants will be acceptable.
3. Subparagraph (h)(iv) will be amended so as to make it
clear that those shares that have been owned by financial
institutions and are sold to non-financial institutions will not
cease to be grandfathered when they are sold back to financial
institutions, other than in the case of a sale by a financial
institution after October 23, 1979 with a commitment to
repurchase. Shares sold before October 23, 1979 or shares
reacquired other than pursuant to a buy back arrangement will
still be subject to the grandfathering protection.
4. The definition of term preferred shares will be amended
to exclude common shares from its application.
5. Subsection 112(2.2), as proposed by Clause 36, will be
amended to exclude from its application shares issued by
financial institutions or their subsidiaries.

6. Consideration will be given to excluding shares listed on
prescribed stock exchanges from the definition of term preferred shares. This would be done by regulation pursuant to
paragraph (f).
7. The Committee has been informed that the 5% redemption feature in subparagraph 7(a)(ii) is being interpreted by
Revenue Canada to apply in a cumulative manner and that
they will administer the Act accordingly. The Committee has
also been informed that Revenue Canada will administer
paragraph (g) and subparagraph (h)(i) of subclause 66(7) to
apply only to those kinds of changes contemplated by subparagraphs (h)(ii) to (h)(iv) inclusive. Should it become apparent
to your Committee that Revenue Canada is not administering
these provisions in the manner indicated, they will introduce
amendments accordingly and with retroactive effect.
8. A review will be made of the grandfathering measures
contained in subparagraph (h)(ii) to determine whether
changes to this provision would be justified.
9. Similar amendments will be introduced to the definition
of income bonds, where applicable.
Recognizing that the Committee has not had the opportunity of reviewing and commenting on any of the proposed
amendments, the Minister has given the following additional
undertaking:
10. Should it be apparent that the legislation to be introduced with the December 11, 1979 budget, giving effect to the
foregoing undertakings, is incomplete or should subsequent
interpretation thereof by the Department of National Revenue, Tax Review Board or the courts not be in accordance with
the intent as expressed by these undertakings, further amendments will be introduced with subsequent bills to amend the
Income Tax Act.
PART TWO
Small Business Deduction
The former Minister of Finance indicated when tabling his
Bill C-37 that the small business deduction was an incentive
granted for the expansion of small businesses which were
carrying on an "active business". The small business deduction
was meant to apply only to those businesses meeting this
objective and amendments were necessary to prevent further
abuses. More particularly, some professionals, artists and athletes were arranging their affairs solely to take advantage of
the lower rate of tax. Others were diverting their investment
income through corporations to obtain a similar benefit.
Under the proposals introduced by Bill C-37 in the November 1978 budget the benefits of the special corporate tax rate
for small businesses would have been denied to three categories of business income: professional income, the income from
certain personal services and income from the provision of
certain management and other administrative services.

SENATE DEBATES
These types of business income would have been taxed at
rates of approximately 48% rather than at the special rate of
approximately 25% for small businesses.
A new business tax rate of 33½% bas been introduced by
Bill C-17 for any Canadian-controlled private company
engaged in any of the three categories of businesses described
above and which are defined in the Bill to be "non-qualifying
businesses". For this purpose, the professional group, which
originally included doctors, dentists, lawyers and accountants,
will be expanded to include veterinarians and chiropractors.
The approach adopted by Bill C-17 will generally ensure
that when the corporation pays a dividend the amount of tax
for which a shareholder will receive credit will approximate
the amount of tax actually paid by the corporation. As a
result, a shareholder will be in approximately the same position if he draws the corporation's income as salary or as
dividends.
Corporations retaining earnings in the business will enjoy a
tax deferral since the tax rate of 331/3% is lower than the
personal income tax rate on taxable income in excess of
$15,000.
It was envisaged in Bill C-37 that the low rate of tax was to
be restricted to "qualified business" to be defined by regulation. Draft regulations were made available for study. Your
Committee was strongly opposed to the definition of "qualifying business" and "non-qualifying business" being included in
the regulations rather than in the Act. In this respect your
report said:
"First and foremost, the Committee strongly objects to
definition of "qualifying business" and "non-qualifying
business" being included in the regulations. While the
inclusion of such definitions in the regulations has the
advantage of providing a more flexible definition of what
constitutes active business, it confers upon the government
the power to tax in an arbitrary (and clearly indirect)
manner. It is a fundamental principle that the power to
tax should be reserved to Parliament alone. Your Committee feels that the definition of what constitutes an
active business should be confined to the Act."
Bill C-17 now under study reflects this recommendation by
proposing to insert in the Act itself the definition of "active
business" and "non-qualifying business" (subclause 38(6)).
The new rate will be applicable immediately for newly
formed corporations (subclause 38(8)). Corporations in existence on October 23, 1979 will be subject to the new rules for
years commencing after 1979. This will permit corporations in
existence on October 23, 1979 to arrange their affairs so that
they may benefit from the new reduced rate of 33 3%instead
of being subjected to the high rate of 48%. It is understood the
Minister of National Revenue will be prepared to allow corporations that wish to reorganize in the light of these amendments to change their fiscal year-ends in 1980.
The new reduced rate of tax of 33/3% will not be accorded
to "specified investment businesses". "Specified investment

business" is defined in subclause 38(6) to mean a business the
principal purpose of which is to derive income from property
(including income from rental of real property), unless the
corporation employs in that business throughout the year more
than five full-time employees excluding (a) shareholders that
own 10% or more of the shares and (b) persons related thereto.
Several recommendations made by your Committee relating
to the small business deduction have not been reflected in Bill
C-17. Your Committee's report on Bill C-37 stressed the fact
that the requirement of five full-time employees for service
corporations was too broad and might cause unnecessary
hardship in some instances. For example, firms engaged in the
research and consulting fields often have less than five fulltime employees but are required to hire a considerable number
of employees for specific projects and on a part-time basis.
Such firms should but would not qualify for the small business
deduction. Furthermore, the inability to consider a specified
shareholder or related persons as full-time employees would be
inequitable in the case of closely held family run corporations.
There might be situations where a corporation had more than
five full-time employees but because some of them were
children of the principal shareholders, the corporation would
be taxable at the full rate.
Your Committee also suggested that corporations having
capital invested or at risk in tangible assets which generate
business income should be entitled to the small business
deduction.
The Committee feels the Bill C-17 proposals to be a significant improvement. However, the Committee considers the
proposals contained in Bill C-17 relating to the small business
deduction to be arbitrary and discriminatory (Why should
"non-qualifying businesses" include doctors but not engineers?) and add to the complexity of our income tax system.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE
RESPECTING BILL C-37
Reference was made earlier in this report to those recommendations of the Committee which have been accepted and
reflected in Bill C-17. The following recommendations made
with respect to your Committee's study of the subject-matter
of Bill C-37 are not reflected in Bill C-17. Several of these
recommendations were also made in your Committee's report
on Bill C-56 dated June 27, 1978.
1. The investment tax credit should be extended to used
aircraft.
The officials from the Department of Finance have indicated that they do not wish to so extend the investment tax credit
as it would be too selective and discriminatory. To extend the
credit to all used equipment would be too costly and inconsistent with the objectives of the investment tax credit, namely to
increase employment in the equipment manufacturing sector
and to provide a stimulus for transportation companies to
upgrade their assets.

2. Interest on money borrowed to purchase annuities shouid
be deductible.
The Minister has indicated that bie is concerned that to
aiiow a current deduction for interest incurred on borrowings
to acquire deferred annuities wouid greatiy expand the
amounts taxpayers could contribute, witbout regulated limits,
to deferred incomne schemes. Tbis wouid be very costiy in terms
of iost revenues and wouid be viewed by many as an unjustified tax sheiter. This continues to be bis view by many as an
unjustified tax shelter. This continues to be his view even in
recognition of tbe Committee's recommendation that sucb
annuity payments would be required to commence no later
than the date on whicb the annuitant becomes 75 years of age.
There are means available to taxpayers witb security portfolios to obtain a deduction in an indirect manner. Taxpayers
without security portfolios wili be disadvantaged and in almost
ail cases they wilI be taxpayers in the iower income brackets.
3. Interest paid before 1978 on policy loans sbouid increase
the adjusted cost basis of a poiicyholder's interest in a poiicy.
Tbe officiais from. the Department of Finance have argued
that interest was deductible in cases wbere boans were taken
for business purposes and to permit tbe addition of interest to
the adjusted cost basis of a policybolder's înterest in a policy
would amount to a double benefit. Tbey asserted there would
be a double benefit in respect of interest paid on non-commercial loans if tbe interest were added to the adjusted cost basis
of the policy. The Committee poînted out that it was seeking
to have the same treatment given to interest payments made
before 1978 as after 1977. Tbat is to say, interest payments
made on non-commercial boans sbould be added to a taxpayer's adjusted cost basis if he or the insurance company can
establisb proof of payment.
The Committee bas beard no satisfactory expianation wby
taxpayers should not be entitied to increase the adjusted cost
basis of tbeir policies if either tbey or the insurance companies
bave records available.
Tbe Minister bas asked bis officiais to reexamine tbis
matter to determine wbetber interest sbould or sbouid flot be
added to a taxpayer's adjusted cost basis.
4. Tbere sbould be no commutation of RRSP benefits at
deatb if tbe beneficiaries are tbe children of the deceased;
ratber, tbe cbildren sbould be taxed on tbe benefits with tbe
option of deferring tax througb tbe purchase of income averaging annuity contracts.
The Bili (subclause 46(3)) provides limited relief. If there is
no surviving spouse, tbe portion of a plan passing to a cbild or
dependant grandchîld equal to $5,000 multiplied by the
number of years until the cbild reaches 26 years of age wili be
included in the child's income. Dependants dependent on the
deceaseci by reason of physical or mental inirmity will bave
tbe full amount included in tbeir income. The Committee feels
thîs relief is not sufficient as in most cases large portions of tbe

RRSP benefits wiil be taxable in tbe bands of the deceased at
prohibitive rates.
5. Persons receiving any form of disability pension sbouid be
entitled to mature their RRSP's before age 60.
The Committee bas been advised tbat consideration is being
given to amending tbe definition of disability in the Canada
Pension Plan. The Committee wili review carefuliy these
amendments wben presented as it bas found tbat tbe present
definition of disability is too restrictive. The Committee feels
tbat a person receiving any form of disability pension should
be entitled to mature bis RRSP before reacbing age 60.
Sbould tbey not qualify for a disability pension, tbey sbould be
entitied to mature tbeir RRSP if tbeir disability "is total and
permanent, sucb as to prevent an employee from continuing
active employment, and is so certified by a medical practitioner" (Information Circular 72-1 3R5 reiating to employee's
pension plans).
6. Termination payments sbould qualify for RRSP rollover
treatment.
It is often difficuit to cbaracterize amounts received by an
employee on termination of employment. The amounts may be
considered for tax purposes to be retiring allowances or termination payments. It is feit tbat tbe same rollover options
sbould be available in respect of botb otherwise an employe
may find bimself subject to unforeseen tax penalties if bie
makes the wrong determination. The Committee feels tbat an
employee sbouid be entitied to "rolbover" a termination payment into an RRSP as well as an IAAC.
7. The recommendations of the Trust Companies Association respectîng options available at tbe maturity of an RRSP
should be considered furtber by the Minister.
Tbe Minister bas indicated that ail the foregoîng recommendations wiiI be carefuliy considered in the process of developing future tax policy and, wbere considered appropriate,
included in future budgets.
Conclusion
The Committee wisbes to express its appreciation for the
services rendered by Messrs. Charles Albert Poissant and
Tbomas S. Gillespie.
Your Committee bas examined and considered the subjectmatter of Bibi C- 17 in accordance witb its terms of reference.
Its concerns are noted above but in vîew of the statements
given by the Minister to tbe Committee and given tbe Minister's desire to complete passage of tbe Bibi before bis fortbcoming budget, the Committee recommends to the Senate tbat tbe
Bibi be favourably considered witbout amendment.
Due to the circumstances rebated above, we do not recommend any amendments to tbe Bibi.
Respectfulby submitted,

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, I have a question
f'or the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. A report
on the front pages of a number of Canadian journais today is
cause for a good deal of concern. May I quote [rom this report,
which I understand is now on the wîrc services:
Despite record-breaking profits this year. Gulf and
other oil giants are refusing to import costly crude which
could offset any home heating ail and gas shortages this
wînter.
The report goes on F0 say:
A top federal encrgy adviser, who asked not to bc
identified, said Monday the refusais are ail part of a plot

December 11, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

by multinationals to force the government into handing
out more compensation for such costly purchases.
The report continues:
The extra crude would have to be purchased on the
"spot market," where a barrel of oil costs about $50,
compared to the $23 paid when deals are negotiated in
advance.
Today, companies such as Gulf receive $3 in compensation from the government for every barrel bought on the
spot market. The federal official said the multinationals
have joined together and started lobbying for an $11
subsidy for every barrel purchased.
While Gulf spokesman ...

would not say Gulf was

demanding $1 1 a barrel in compensation, he did admit his
company "is asking the government to look at the compensation program to ensure that we can get through the
difficult periods."
"But they (the government) are crazy to think that
we'd even consider buying on the spot market today"The federal official is quoted in the article as saying, "the fact
that Gulf, for one, is going to double its profits at the expense
of the Canadian public this year just doesn't seem to enter into
their decisions." The article says that the spokesman "agreed
his company is expecting record profits of more than $300
million this year, up from last year's $171 million."
My question is: Is it true that certain multinational oil
companies, some of them bloated with profits, are so insulated
from the needs of Canadians, especially those living on the east
coast of Canada, that they would even contemplate this kind of
reported blackmail?
Senator de Cotret: The answer, honourable senators, is:
Certainly not to my knowledge. You have talked at great
length about an unidentified spokesman and an unidentified
official.
Senator Perrault: I am only quoting the report.
Senator de Cotret: That would certainly seem to indicate
that they are quite a bit in the dark as to what is happening at
the moment.
We have been in touch with the oil companies; we have been
in touch with the provinces. The Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources has spoken about the question of energy diversion. He has talked about the question of supply. We have had,
to date, very good co-operation from all those concerned.
You have also mentioned the petroleum supply position in
eastern Canada. Obviously, we have been monitoring that very
closely. Although there has been a significant stock buildup
throughout 1979 inventories of main products in the Atlantic
provinces, as of the beginning of October that still had not
reached desired levels. The overall stocks of gasoline, heating
oil, diesel fuel and heavy oil were about 4.5 per cent below last
year's level. However, in the fourth quarter refineries in the
Atlantic provinces are planning on importing and running over
330,000 barrels a day of crude oil. That is well above last
year's imports for the same quarter, as well as the average

crude imports in the Atlantic provinces in 1979. According to
refiners' programs, imports at this rate should bring product
stocks to the desired level by year-end.
Just to complete the answer, I should like to read briefly
from a statement made by the energy minister of Nova Scotia.
The Honourable Ron Barkhouse said yesterday that figures
compiled by his department indicate that the Atlantic provinces have enough heating oil in storage and in transit to
prevent shortages this winter. He said:
There is only a very remote possibility that shortages
could arise should some of the crude in transit be diverted.
We are monitoring the situation closely, and i would deny,
to the extent of my knowledge, the reports that were quoted by
the honourable senator.
Senator Perrault: I thank the minister for bringing this
information to the notice of the Senate.
LABOUR DISPUTES AT OIL REFINERIES

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, another report over
the weekend suggested that a lockout in Montreal's Petrofina
refinery could lead to a lockout of workers at other Montreal
refineries and to serious oil shortages in Quebec. i take it that
there is no governmental concern that this will measurably
affect the oil supply situation?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, there is concern;
there is aways concern about reported disruptions or potential
disruptions either in our supply of imported crude oil or in the
refinery activity in Atlantic Canada or in Quebec. That concern has given rise to a careful monitoring of the situation in
Quebec.
We have been in touch with the officials of Petrofina,
Texaco, and Shell in order to ascertain the exact situation as it
now exists in Montreal. In the Petrofina situation where there
is, to my understanding, a lockout, we are assured that
managerial personnel can maintain the output of the refinery
at normal levels. We are also assured that in other situations
with other refineries around the city the situation is calm, and
that there is no immediate threat of either a lockout or a
strike.
There is also a technical problem in the Shell refinery with
one of their major pieces of equipment. I can't remember the
exact name of it, but it was mentioned in the press this
morning. We checked on that, and we expect it to be back to
full capacity by this Thursday. We are following the situation
closely and, for the moment, there is no reason for alarm.
Senator Perrault: While I think many honourable senators
are gratified with the view of the minister that the report that
I read at the outset of the question period may not be accurate,
I know that all of us would appreciate any further information
the minister may be able to bring to the Senate regarding an
"unidentified spokesman" described in the article. I should like
to say to the minister, that there is no suggestion by the
opposition that there has been wrongdoing by the government
with respect to the matter. However, when unidentified
spokesmen, identified only as "top federal energy advisers,"

SENATE DEBATES
purport to speak to the press on behalf of the government, it is
a matter which should be taken up by the government to
determine whether there are leaks from the department and
whether there is any validity to the reported accusations.
I would therefore ask the minister to bring further information to the chamber when he is able to ascertain all the facts.
Senator de Cotret: I can assure the honourable senator that
his concern over this type of leak is surpassed only by my own
concern, and I will certainly endeavour to look into this
matter.
THE ECONOMY
MONITORING OF PROFITS RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN
INTEREST RATES AND OIL PRICES

Senator Frith: Honourable senators, I should like to ask a
question arising out of the first question posed by the Leader
of the Opposition. Part of his question dealt with the matter of
what appear to the Canadian people to be undue profits reaped
by the oil companies. Some weeks ago I asked the minister
what criteria were being applied in the government's monitoring of those profits. I wonder if he could tell us when we might
expect to find out what criteria the Department of Finance
uses in deciding whether oil company profits are undue.
Senator de Cotret: I undertook, honourable senator, to
obtain an answer to that question. I have not received the
answer in my office as yet, but as soon as I do I shal be more
than happy to provide the details of the monitoring process.
*

(1420)

Senator Frith: Would the minister also at the same time ask
the Department of Finance when they might be expected to
produce that answer to him, so that he in turn can produce it
for us and for the Canadian people?
Senator de Cotret: Yes.
ENERGY
ATLANTIC PROVINCES -GULF CANADA LIMITED- EFFECT OF
DIVERSION OF OIL SHIPMENTS

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, my question also
relates to the undue profits and practices of some of the oil
companies, and 1 direct it to the same minister.
Two weeks ago it was reported that Gulf Canada had
diverted some 400,000 barrels of crude, destined for its refinery at Point Tupper in Nova Scotia and the east coast market,
to the European Community spot market. As the minister is
well aware, Gulf Canada is the company that has now been
cut off from Iranian supplies, and could thereby reflect a
shortage, particularly of heating fuel, for the Atlantic provinces this winter.
My question is: As the government calculates the subsidies
to be paid out of the Canadian treasury to east coast refineries,
would it take into account the spot market profit that obvious]y must have been made on this shipment, which at a conserva[Senator Perrault.]

December 11, 1979

tive estimate would have been, on 400,000 barrels-since the
spot market would be at least $10 higher-in the area of $4
million; and in the light of the undue profit effected in such an
irresponsible fashion by this particular firm by means of this
diversion from the Atlantic provinces, which face the prospect
of being short of oil, including heating oil, this winter, would
the government consider making some appropriate deduction
from its subsidies?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senator, I would first of all
like to verify the allegations that Gulf did divert that amount,
and that the diversion was no more than a pre-arranged swap
of one nature or another. I will endeavour to ascertain the
facts of the matter and give you the appropriate answer.

been received from his colleague, the energy minister, Mr.
Hnatyshyn, with respect to his meeting with the President of
Imperial Oil, Jack Armstrong, to find out why Imperial raised
its prices nationwide by 1.4 cents to 3.4 cents a gallon?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, the answer to the
question is no. As you are no doubt aware, the minister was off
to Paris shortly after his meeting with the President of Imperial Oil to attend the meeting of the International Energy
Association there. He is expected back this afternoon. We
have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to cover a
fairly wide range of topics related to energy, and presumably
we will be able to discuss the matter you raise in your question
at that time.
GRAIN
INTERIM PAYMFNTS BY CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ON
CURRENT CROP-INCOME TAX BURDEN ON PRAIRIE WHEAT
FARMERS

Senator Steuart: Honourable senators, my question is
directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It
relates to the issue raised in this chamber several times by
Senator Argue with regard to the income tax problem being
created by the government for many western farmers.
Quite simply, the problem is the adjustment payment presently being made by the Canadian Wheat Board on grain
delivered by the farmers from the beginning of this crop year
up until October before the initial price was raised. This
applies to all deliveries, both those made on a straight cash
basis and those made on a deferred income basis.
I ask the indulgence of the Senate while I give a brief
outline of how this situation developed. For many years farmers would refuse to deliver grain in the latter part of the
calendar year if they felt they had had a good year, and it
would increase their income tax problem. They acted no
differently in this regard from any other businessmen all
across the country. The Wheat Board, and the government

Decernber 11, 1979

DeceberIl, 979SENATE
DEBATES

through the Wheat Board, asked them many years ago to
cease this practice and to deliver the grain whenever the
quotas were open so that the Wheat Board and the government could fulfil their international sales commitments. So the
farmers ceased this practice, delivered the grain whenever it
was appropriate from the point of view of the Wheat Board to
do so, and took a cash deferral into the next income tax year.
This year they received an initial payment of about $350.
Then out of the blue the government decided to pay an extra
$1 approximately on the initial payment. This trapped a great
many farmers who had deferred their payment into 1980, and
they will now receive a total of about $50 million, over hait' of
which will be paid to the government in income tax. We think
that they could be given relief by a diffèrent interpretation of
the regulations.

Senator Steuart: I have a final supplementary. Is the minister aware that the Honourable Walter Baker, Leader of the
House of Commons, suggested on Friday tbat a preliminary
review indicated that such a deferral would not be allowed? If
the minister is aware of that, would he consider asking the
Minister of Finance to include what would probably be about
one line in the budget to treat this as income in 1980 rather
than income in 1979? If a bill were required, it would be a
very small one and I am sure it would receive full support of
the opposition, since they, wben they were the government, are
the ones who put this whole program into place.

Senator de Cotret: What 1 am saying is that I brought this
matter to the attention of my colleagues; 1 got an early and
prompt answer in terms of the interpretation of the tax
regulations as they are now; and I shall bc happy to inquire
from them as to what progress, if any, tbey have made in
looking at wbether it would be desirable, equitable and feasible
to change the regulations.

said at that time that I would not be prepared to give my leave
for the continuation of that discussion.
I think Senator McElman's exposition of the rules of the
House of Commons is correct, and I agree heartily with what
he had to say, but my point is that the issue that was before us
then, and to which I think the Speaker's comments were
directed, is not that issue, on which there may be no disagreement, but the issue as to whether leave was granted to
circumvent the rules altogether.
So, honourable senators, I accept my responsibility for the
difficulty that arose, and I want to make that clear to the
Senate, but I also want to say that I think we could with good
conscience let the matter rest where it now stands, and be
better advised on another occasion.
Senator McDonald: Honourable senators, I too, like Senator
Roblin, was under the impression that no leave had been asked
for, and I refer you to the Debates of the Senate of December
4, and to Senator Bosa's remarks on page 487:
Honourable senators, I would ask that Order No. 10 be
allowed to stand, but I wonder if I may have your
permission to raise a matter on a point of clarification.
So, in point of fact, leave was not asked for and leave was not
granted. This is the reason why, as recorded on the next page,
I asked for order. It was my understanding that no leave had
been asked for and no leave had been granted. I still stand by
the conclusion I came to in view of the evidence before us.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your wish, honourable senators,
that the Chair take into consideration the points made by
Senator McElman, and treat the matter as a point of order or
a request for action by the Chair? I am in the hands of the
Senate.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Roblin: I think we should proceed to the next order
of business, Mr. Speaker.
Senator McElman: Excuse me, honourable senators, but I
do not believe that an item put before the Senate as a point of
order can be dispensed with quite that readily.
Senator Flynn: But the ruling was that it was not a point of
order.
Senator McElman: His Honour the Speaker can do so, but
not the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
* (1500)
Senator Flynn: I said that you did not understand what His
Honour said. He said that it was not a point of order.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I waited for
Senator McElman to state it as a point of order. My recollection is that he did not. He merely rose to say that a matter had
arisen on which he wished to comment. Therefore, it would be
my ruling at the moment that a point of order has not been
directed to the Chair.
Senator McElman: Honourable senators, I was most specific
in stating that I was referring it as a point of order to the
Chair for a ruling, because I believe it extremely important to
the good order of the proceedings of this house that this matter
not be left hanging and that it be made clear what the decision
of the Chair is. Again, I do so refer it.
Senator Flynn: You cannot raise a point of order three or
four days after the event.
Senator Perrault: You can raise a point of order any time
you want.
Senator McElman: I am sorry, Senator Flynn, but you are
confusing a point of order with a matter of privilege. A point
of order can be raised at any time; a matter of privilege must
be raised at the earliest opportunity.
Senator Perrault: Right!
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I will take the
discussion into consideration and report in due course to the
Senate.
Senator McElman: Thank you very much, Your Honour.
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PRIVILEGES AND
IMMUNITIES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Macquarrie moved the second reading of Bill S-11,
to amend the Diplomatic and Consular Privileges and Immunities Act.
He said: Honourable senators, there is an old saying that I
am sure is familiar to all of us: "Some are born great; some
achieve greatness (or attain it, depending upon which version
you use); some have greatness thrust upon them." This afternoon I am very much in that third category. Here am 1, a
freshman senator, a veritable babe among you, and I have
been given the great honour and privilege of being asked to
usher, escort, launch and pilotSenator Perrault: And defend.
Senator Macquarrie: -a piece of legislation in this house.
Many years ago in this chamber Senator Dandurand, as
reported by MacGregor Dawson, said that ministers were
always very anxious to bring their legislative offspring to the
baptismal font themselves. But here am I in the role, perhaps,
of political godfather-as one might have said before that
word became rather nasty. In the Anglican sense, the godfather was really supposed to be a pretty good person, and I will
try to stick to that.
Bill S-11, honourable senators, is brief. It is clear. I would
say it is non-controversial. The sponsor will try to emulate the

SENATE DEBATES

bill in ail particulars. I must aver that, when 1 say it is clear, I
do recall, as one of my old professors used to say-and I do not
want to offend a great multitude of people in this chamberthat the difference between good English and legal English is
substantial. But I do think this is a pretty precise and clear
bill.
Some of the matters are corrections in terminology. The
expression "post", in "diplomatie post," has been replaced by
"mission." Even a consultation with Webster's would indicate
that that change is an improvement. There are some spent
clauses which are properly dropped.
The main aspect of the bill is to provide for a certain
contingency under which a country, or perhaps even a part of a
country, would establish in Canada something purporting to be
an embassy or a mission. Before the passage of this bill, and
indeed at the present time, the Government of Canada would
have no legal avenue or vehicle to deal with such a transgression of the Vienna conventions.
As aIl senators know, I am sure, the bill which we are
amending today is a short bill, but its schedule is quite long
and quite impressive, because the schedule is in fact a restatement of the 50 some clauses of the Vienna conventions.
This bill. honourable senators, deals with a delicate problem
which niay occur at any given time and create for Canada
some embarrassment on the international scene. Furthermore,
such a situation, should it arise, would most likely create
tension in Canada's bilateral relations with the country
concerned.
The problem could be summarized as follows: At present
there is no basis in Canadian law for the federal government to
prevent the opening or to bring about the closure of an entity
which purports to be an embassy or a consulate representing a
country or a government which Canada does not recognize. In
both cases, such a situation would cause a serious embarrassment to Canada. In a few minutes I will discuss a situation
which embarrassed another country greatly.
I should point out that the Vienna Conventions on
Diplomatic and Consular Relations annexed to the Diplomatie
and Consular Privileges and Immunities Act are declaratory of
customary international law and have the force of law in
Canada. Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatie
Relations clearly states that "the establishment of diplomatie
relations between States, and of permanent diplomatie missions, takes place by mutual consent," while article 4(1) of the
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations states that "a consular post may be established in the territory of the recciving
State only with that State's consent."
In that respect, it would certainly be consistent with the
spirit of Canada's obligations under the Vienna conventions to
take the necessary measures to prevent the opening of such
so-called "embassies" or "consulates" when they are opened
without Canada's consent, and when they purport to represent
a country or a government not recognized by Canada.
This bill, honourable senators, is to amend the Diplomatie
and Consular Privileges and Immunities Act, and it deals with
iSenator Macquarried

December

I1, 1979

this particular problem that may result from the establishment
or the operation of purported embassies or consulates in
Canada by persons not representing a sovereign state or a
government recognized by Canada. The new legislation would
thus make it an offence to engage in such conduct, enabling
our courts to prohibit the representation of such premises as a
diplomatie mission or consular post.
The act which we are amending-and I believe it, too,
originated in the Senate-was the act of 1977. It was given
royal assent on June 10 of that year. It was, as I have said in
my brief preamble, an incorporation into the law of our
country of the provisions of the Vienna conventions.
It will be recalled that the reason for the reference in
Section 2 of the act to only certain articles of the two
conventions-those dealing with the privileges and immunities
of diplomatie and consular missions in Canada and affecting
the rights of private persons in Canada-is that these articles
specifically require the force of law to be implemented in
Canada. The other articles of the Vienna conventions not
mentioned in Section 2 of the act deal with rights and obligations between governments and do not need to be given
statutory basis to be implemented in Canada, as they reflect
principles of customary international law governing diplomatie
and consular relations between sovereign states and, as such,
are part of the Canadian law via the common law.
The existing act, however, docs not deal with ail situations.
In particular, the question to which the present amendment is
addressing itself was not covered. At present there is no basis
in Canadian law to deal adequately with an entity which
purports to represent a country or a government which Canada
does not recognize. This is not in line with the relevant articles
of the two Vienna conventions which specifically state that the
establishment of diplomatie and consular relations takes place
by mutual consent.
*

11510)

The example to which I referred a few minutes ago occurred
in Australia, and caused that country and its government
considerable embarrassment. A so-called "Croatian embassy"
was opened in Canberra in November 1977. Croatia is one of
the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia which is a federal
state. The Australian government had no legal means, at that
time, to close the so-called embassy. Proper legislation was
finally adopted in August 1978, and the Federal Court of
Australia granted an injunction, requested by the Department
of the Attorney General, to close the Croatian embassy in
accordance with the provisions of the new legislation. The
Croatian chargé d'affaires stated in Canberra in April 1979
that similar Croatian embassies would be established in several
other countries, including Canada.
The events in Australia brought to the Canadian government's attention that if Canada were to be faced with a similar
situation now, it would not have the proper legislation to deal
with it. That is precisely the purpose of this bill.
Furthermore, without addressing ourselves to a specific case
or group of people, it is clearly important that the necessary

December 11, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

legislation be adopted in order to prevent such developments,
especially at a time when diplomatic personnel and missions
are being used, if not abused, to promote particular political
objectives-and Heaven knows this is true.
Honourable senators, I think that we should congratulate
the government for introducing legislation that could be before
its time. Quite often, legislation comes after a considerable
time-lag to remedy a situation. I believe that this-and I hope
it will never happen-would anticipate the kind of situation
which our Australian friends went through some months ago.
I think honourable senators will agree that today is an
appropriate day for us to be seized of this type of legislation.
As we walked into the chamber, we see, on the courtesy
flagstaff, a Union Jack. This reminded us of what a very
important day this is-the anniversary of the day the Statute
of Westminster was proclaimed. My stern mentor, Professor
Lower, wrote that if Canada had an independence day, it
would be December l 1-a day in 1931 on which we could
clearly proclaim for the world to hear and agree that we and
our fellow members of the Commonwealth were autonomous
states, in no way subordinate one to another. R. B. Bennett,
often considered an imperialist and a colonial-minded man,
said that the old political empire has disappeared. It was a
great day.
We know, of course, that Canada obtained its independence
a good while before that. Canada became an independent state
in 1917 when Sir Robert Borden led us into the League of
Nations and to participation in the Treaty of Versailles.
However, as is the custom in the British parliamentary system,
it sometimes takes a while for the official statutory declaration
to catch up with the actual situation. The gap between 1917
and 1931 I think is indicative of that custom.
Another reason, honourable senators, why I feel it is suitable, fitting and proper that we give our attention to amendment of this important act, which deals with diplomatic privileges and immunities, is the terrible situation which has for so
long continued in Iran. At the meeting of the United Nations
Security Council last week, in the preamble to the resolution
which was adopted unanimously, they invoked the reaffirmation of the Vienna convention. I think it is important that we
focus on this tremendously important statutory convention on
relationship between states, and keep it in focus. I believe the
government has done well in that regard. I also think the
President of the United States has done extremely well. This is
not the time to enter into a dialogue on whether the shah is
worse than the ayatollah.
The Vienna convention is a great habeas corpus which
governs nations. It is the vehicle upon which is carried the
whole comity between and among nations. I believe it is
extremely important that in viewing this terrible crisis in Iran
that we keep in mind the fundamental rule that states cannot
break the Vienna convention. They cannot foreswear their
commitment to deal properly with the representatives of other
countries. One hundred and twenty-nine countries have subscribed to the Vienna convention, and it is illegal, improper,
and I might also say indecent, to mete out to the mission

people in Tehran the kind of treatment they received. It is not
a matter of custom or tradition, as the press sometimes say; it
is much more than that. It is international law and for that
reason I commend this amendment to you.
The bill is a piece of legislation which is truly worthwhile.
Anything we do to sustain our belief in the Vienna convention
is a further hallmark of our country's status as a respected,
strong, honourable member of the diplomatic international
community.
Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, I congratulate
Senator Macquarrie on his lucid and comprehensive explanation of the bill. Indeed, I commend him on his description of
the Vienna convention as the habeas corpus which governs
nations, and I thank him for reaching out also to indicate the
importance of the Vienna convention and the role of Canada
as an independent nation.
I should like to ask the honourable senator a question before
I move the adjournment of the debate. The question stems
from a lack of knowledge, but my understanding is that an
ambassador has to bring his credentials to the Governor
General and seek his approval before an embassy is accredited.
Is that the situation or not?
Senator Macquarrie: Honourable senators, in reply to my
colleague, the problem is not with those embassies which are
accredited, but with those self-styled "embassies". They are
bogus in that they purport to be embassies.
The Croatians, I presume, purchased a building in Canberra
and said that it was the Croatian embassy, and endeavoured to
suggest that they were, in fact, a presence representing a part
of Yugoslavia. They had no credentials and they had no legal
status, but the Australian government had great difficulty in
preventing them from purporting and seeming to be a
diplomatic entity. I hope this explanation is helpful.
On motion of Senator Thompson, debate adjourned.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2, 1979-80
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Senator Doody moved the second reading of Bill C-29, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending March 31, 1980.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill before us, which I
have the honour of sponsoring in the Senate, deals with
supplementary estimates (B) for 1979-80. 1 do this with a
great deal of hesitation today. I moved a bill a few days ago
without realizing how new and raw I was in the Senate. I guess
I listened to my friend Senator Macquarrie say how humble he
was as a junior member of this house, how he feared he might
go astray, and how he had greatness thrust upon him. I
suppose I should think of some other old saw, such as "Fools
rush in where angels fear to tread," because I went through
this on the second day I was here. I feel, therefore, that I
should thank honourable senators for being so patient and

SENATE DEBATES
tolerant, especially since I must now impose on their patience
once again.
The bill that I have the honour to introduce today, honourable senators, provides the full supply of supplementary estimates (B) for 1979-80. The estimates were tabled in the
Senate on November 8, and were immediately referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. They were
discussed in committee on November 20 and 22 with Treasury
Board and other government officials. These supplementaries
total $1,031 million, and bring the total estimates to date to
$54,946 million. If you say the numbers very quickly, I do not
think they will sound so horrendous.
The latter amount represents not only the spending authority, but the forecast expenditures. After allowing for repayments on loans and the normal lapsing of expenditure authority, total spending will be considerably lower. However, as
stated previously by the President of the Treasury Board,
during his appearance before the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance to discuss the main estimates, the actual
expenditures will exceed the ceiling announced last February
of $52,600 million.
A major portion of the supplementary estimates, $600 million, represents adjustments on statutory payments, and $297
million is for increased equalization payments to the provinces
under the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Established Programs Financing Act. This includes $157 million for
adjustments in respect of the fiscal years 1977-78 and 197879. There is an amount of $100 million for public debt costs
such as additional payments of interest, discounts, premiums,
commissions, servicing costs and costs of issuing new loans,
and an amount of $112 million in old age security payments
which reflect revised forecasts of indexation factors and eligible population, which is partially offset by a reduction of $43
million in guaranteed income supplement payments. There is
an amount of $60 million to cover expenses of candidates and
returning officers, the cost of enumeration and polling operations, and advertising expenses incurred by political parties in
accordance with the Canada Elections Act.
The largest single item included in the $431 million of
supplementary estimates requiring parliamentary authoritythe main amount involved is statutory-is $120 million for the
Canadian home insulation program. This brings the total
amount of funds available for the CHIP program, in the
current fiscal year, to $182.3 million.
Some of the other major vote items requested include $63
million for an increased contribution to NATO to cover the
effects of inflation and devaluation, as well as the airborne
early warning system; $43 million to cover the increased
operating costs of VIA Rail; $36 million for the air transporta-

December 11, 1979

tion program of the Department of Transport for loss of
revenues due to the modification of planned increases in the
airport tax; $30 million to increase the ceiling on cash
advances out of the petroleum compensation revolving fund;
and $20 million for additional assistance to the shipbuilding
industry arising from increased activity, and the extension of
the 20 per cent subsidy program.
These estimates contain some 21 $1 votes, which are
described in the explanatory sections of the supplementary
blue book, which I am sure all honourable senators have copies
of. These items can be grouped as follows: There are four votes
which authorize the transfer of funds from one vote to another;
three which authorize the payment of grants; seven which
authorize the deletion of debts and reimbursement of accounts
for obsolete stores; four which amend provisions of previous
appropriations acts; and two other votes which authorize the
payment of commissions and guarantees of loans. Additional
explanations for these items, as well as the other items I
referred to, were provided to the National Finance Committee
during its review of the estimates. As I said, those committee
meetings were held on November 20 and 22, and reports of the
proceedings of those meetings are to be found in issues 3 and 4
of the Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance.
Honourable senators, I think I have touched on the major
items of the bill, and if you wish further explanation I shall do
my best to provide it.
On motion of Senator Petten, debate adjourned.

STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE
REPORT ON THE SUBJECT MATTER 0F BILL C-20, "AN ACT
TO AMEND THE INCOME TAX ACT TO PROVIDE A TAX CREDIT INRESPECT
0F MORTGAGE INTERFST AND HOMEOWNER PROPERTY TAX"
DECEMBER 6, 1979
On Wednesday, October 29, 1979, Bill C-20, intituled "An
Act to amend the Income Tax Act to provide a tax credit in
respect of mortgage interest and bomeowner property taXI,
received first reading in the 1-buse of Commons. This Bill is
intended to implement the Ways and Means Motion relating
to the Income Tax Act tabled by the Minister of Finance on
October 25, 1979.
By resolution of the Senate on November 1, 1979, the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce was authorized to examine and consider the subject
matter of the Bill in advance of the Bill coming before the
Senate or any matter relating thereto.
In accordance with the Order of Reference, your Committee
has received and considered the said Bill C-20 arising from the
Ways and Means Motion and in connection with such consideration bas engaged the services of Mr. Charles Albert
Poissant, C.A. of Thorne Riddell & Co., Chartered Accountants, and retained as its counsel, Mr. Thomas S. Gillespie of
Ogilvy, Renault. The committee has discussed the Bill with
officiais from tbe Departmnent of Finance, Mr. R. Alan Short,
Director, Tax Policy Legisiation and Mr. Vern Krishna, Chief,
Tax Policy and Legisiation Branch.
The committee bas made a detailed examination of the
provisions of the Bill and their application. The committee has
not deait witb nor does it intend to report on the principle of
the Bill.
GENERAL
This Bill introduces two tax credits for Canadian resident
homeowners. According to the officiais of the Department of
Finance, 1.5 million Canadians wilI benefit fromn the property
tax credit. Furthermore, 2.3 million wîll benefit from the
mortgage interest tax credit.
In summary, Bill C-20 will operate as follows:
Every Canadian resident owning a qualified home will be
entitled to a tax credit of $250 a year to assist bim in paying
bis property taxes and will obtain a tax credit equivalent to
25% of mortgage interest paid during the year Up to a maximum of $1,250. Tax credits aggregating $1,500 will be available when the plan is in full operation, that is in 1982.
One-quarter of the annual amount of such tax credits may
be claimed by those entitled thereto in 1979, one-baîf in 1980,
80072-37

three-quarters in 1981, and the full amount of the said credits
wilI be available in 1982 and tbereafter.
PROPERTY TAX CREDIT
The property tax credit will not be related to the amount of
property taxes payable by a taxpayer on a qualified home.
Rather, it will take the form of a credit of $250 (when the
credit is fully matured) regardless of the amount of property
taxes paid or not.
MORTGAGE INTEREST CREDIT
Interest on the following types of debt obligations will be
eligible:
(a) Loans, whether secured by the home of the taxpayer or
not, outstanding on or before September 18, 1979, to the
extent that tbey were used to finance the acquisition of,
or a major alteration or addition to, a qualified home.
(b) New loans taken out after September 17, 1979, that are
in the form of a mortgage or similar debt obligation
secured by the qualified home. These boans will qualify
to the extent that they are used to finance the acquisition
of, or a major alteration or addition to, such home.
Loans to renew or refinance boans described above that were
originally taken out for acquisition of, or a major alteration or
addition to, the home will also be eligible. Sucb boans taken
out after September 17, 1979, would have to be in tbe form of
a mortgage or similar debt obligation secured by tbe home, in
order to qualify. However, the principal amount of the new
boan cannot be greater than the principal amount of the
replaced indebtedness on the samne qualified home.
Alternations or additions costing less than $5,000, bouse
furnishing and normal repair and maintenance expenditures,
sucb as those for painting and redecorating, will not be elîgible
for the purposes of this measure.
Interest that is already deductible and not otberwise refundable in computing the taxpayer's income as an expense to earn
income, will not be eligible for the mortgage interest credit.
The mortgage interest credit will apply to any self-contained
dwelling unit Iocated in Canada that was ordinarily occupied
by the taxpayer during the year and was owned by the
taxpayer. A home will include a single family dwelling and a
self-contained dwelling wîtbin, or as part of, a multiple-unit
residential building, such as a semi-detached bouse, a duplex,
or a condominium apartment. No specific: reference is made in
the Bill to mobile homes. The Minister bas indicated in bis

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
statement of September 17, 1979 that qualified mobile homes
will be included. Similarly, the Department of National Revenue bas indicated in the form to be completed by eligible
taxpayers that mobile homes will qualify. The committee is
flot entirely confident that tbis is the better interpretation and
suggests specifie reference be made in the Bill to mobile
homes.
Only one bouse per family will be eligible for the credit.
This would be tbe bouse wbere the family ordinarily resides.
The secondary residence of tbe family, such as a cottage, will
flot be eligible for tbe measure.
Wbere tbe taxpayer moves during tbe year, eacb consecutive
bousing unit owned and occupied by the taxpayer during the
year will be eligible for tbe appropriation portion of the credit
subject to tbe overaîl allowable limit.
Spouses will be permitted to split tbe mortgage interest
credit and tbe property tax credit between tbemselves in any
agreed-upon manner, provided tbe total amount claimed does
flot exceed the allowable limits.
The following anomalies bave comne to tbe attention of tbe
Committee:
(1) Botb credits will be available to individuals sharing
ownersbip in a qualified home to be sbared between
tbem equally witbout regard to their respective ownership
interests
in
tbe
home
(subparagrapbs
122.3(l)(b)(i)(B) and 122.3(2)(a)(ii) as proposed by
subclause 2(l) of tbe Bill).
(2) A mortgage interest credit for the full year will be
available for a bomeowner wbo moves from a qualified
home wbicb is not subject to a mortgage and acquires

December 11, 1979
December 11, 1979

another borne wbich be mortgages. Tbis is in contrast
witb a tenant moving from rented premises to a borne on
wbich be places a mortgage. In the latter case, he would
only be entitled to a fraction of tbe credit represented by
the number of full montbs he owned the home (paragrapb 2(7)(a)).
(3) No credit is available in respect of interest paid by a
separated spouse if he makes payment on behaîf of bis
former spouse who occupies and owns the home.
(4) No credit is available in respect of interest paid by one
spouse when the bouse is owned by the otber.
(5) No credit is available in respect of interest paid during
the reconstruction period after a qualified home bas been
destroyed or unfit for occupation.
Lt is recommended consideration be given to introducing
amendments in tbe future to eliminate tbese anomalies but
witb retroactive effect.
CONCLUSION
Your committee wishes to express its appreciation for the
services rendered in the review of the Bill by Messrs. Charles
Albert Poissant and Thomas S. Gillespie.
Your committee has examined and considered the subject
matter of Bill C-20 in accordance with its terms of reference
and, except as noted above, bas no comment to make on tbe

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
THE BUDGET
STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF ONTARIO

Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, last night the
Canadian people and the Parliament of Canada were presented with the first budget of this new government. For the sake
of Canada, all of us hope that the budget is a successful one
[Senator Donahoc.]

December 12, 1979

and achieves the objectives which have been set forth by the
government. But may I say, on behalf of many members of
this chamber and, I suspect, a good many Canadians, that
there are some concerns in our minds with respect to that
budget. It is because of those concerns that we hope to have a
full budget discussion in this chamber in the next few days.
Our concerns are shared by some of the outstanding leaders
in this country, including certain supporters and friends of this
government. My question this afternoon arises from a statement made by one of the leading supporters of this government
and a person who worked perhaps more zealously than any
other provincial premier to assure its election, the Honourable
William Davis, Premier of Ontario. I shall first quote briefly
from his statement, issued in response to the budget, following
which I shall put my question.
*

(1415)

Premier William Davis of Ontario has stated that the new
budget "takes billions of dollars away from the consumers and
fails to use it to finance energy saving measures." He went on
to say, and again I am quoting his words, that he had:
"grave concern" about the oil and gas price increases in
the budget. The province had warned that huge price
increases will cost Ontario jobs.
He said:
What in fact appears to be happening is that billions of
dollars will be taxed from people across Canada and
transferred to the treasury of the federal government and
the governments of the producing provinces. These massive new revenues are not being adequately returned to
consumers and the economy.
He went on at great length to say: that this budget would
"place a severe financial hardship on many people." He concluded by saying: "Among the wealthy it will not promote
conservation. Among the disadvantaged it will cause serious
financial hardship."
In view of the fact that this statement has been made by the
leading provincial Conservative premier in this country, surely
the government must be concerned, and I ask this question:
Apart from the vague assurances that have been given that the
additional revenues will be used for energy-related projects,
how does the minister believe he can convince the Canadian
people when he has not been able to convince the Conservative
Premier of Ontario that he has any tangible and useful plans
for spending this money? Is he in a position this afternoon to
describe for the Senate some of the specific aliernate energy
projects that are going to be the recipients of additional funds
to be realized by this budget? Perhaps a positive statement
now will reassure the Premier of Ontario as well.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I would certainly
hope, first of all, to reassure the honourable senator opposite
who referred to "vague statements in the budget" that the
budget was very explicit in saying that all revenues to be
received by the federal government from the new energy tax
would be recycled in the economy in the form of investments

December 12, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

of one kind or another in new energy sources. Far from being a
vague statement, it was a categorical and clear-cut statement.
In terms of the specific projects that will be funded in one
way or another by these revenues, an announcement will be
made in due course. But there is no question about our intent
to recycle these funds from the energy tax into the economy to
increase our capacity and to enhance our supply of domestically produced energy.
Senator Perrault: May I ask, then: Can the minister explain
the source of concern on the part of Premier Davis, a Conservative premier, I understand, who campaigned for the honourable minister, and the man who campaigned for the Conservative Party in the last federal election? Why is the Premier
of Ontario unconvinced that the specifics simply are not there
for energy conservation?
Senator de Cotret: Well, honourable senators, I would certainly be happy to ask him the next time I see him. I have no
idea why he has concerns of this nature. Our plans have been
clearly laid out. This is not a proposal that we put forth last
night in terms of energy. This is a policy. This is the policy of
the federal government with respect to energy. It is the policy
that will lead us to self-sufficiency by 1990. It is the policy
that this country needs to insure itself against the uncertainty
of foreign supplies. It is the only responsible policy that this
government can take at this time, to give Canadians the access
to their own energy supplies that they deserve and require.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Perrault: Well, for some curious reason the same
applause for the government is not being accorded by provincial Conservatives in Queen's Park this afternoon.
The honourable minister stated that these promises in the
budget are not vague, and yet in his own words he said a
moment ago, "We are going to spend these monies in one way
or another on energy projects." Perhaps the minister may wish
to cite one specific segment of the program. Surely in the
planning stage the minister has specific projects which can be
delineated more exactly rather than assuring us this afternoon
that the money is going to be spent "in one way or another."
* (1420)

Senator de Cotret: Well, certainly, honourable senators, I
could talk about a number of projects or programs that were
referred to in the budget speech last night.
Senator Buckwold: We have time. Keep talking.
Senator de Cotret: Oh, yes, I will. I have time, too. There is
no rush. It is a sufficiently important document for Canada
that it deserves time.
We have talked, for example, about the need to provide
funds to help industry and also to help heavy oil energy users
and to help homeowners in various parts of the country to
convert from oil to natural gas, because as you well know we
have abundant supplies of natural gas but we have a shortage
of oil. One of the stated objectives of our strategy is to
encourage that kind of switchover from oil to natural gas. Part
of those funds will be allocated for that purpose.

Part of the funds will also be allocated for the purpose of
encouraging the shift from the oil-powered generation of electricity in the Atlantic provinces to the generation of electricity
through other sources. Part will be devoted to fund specific
offshore energy programs.
I think all of those examples, or examples along those lines,
were provided by the minister last night either in his budget
speech or in the documents that accompanied the budget
speech.
In terms of exact dollars, we have made a commitment. We
have made a commitment that the funds that would be derived
from the energy tax would be recycled in the economy for
purposes such as this. We have given examples; we have made
the commitment.
If there is a certain degree of prescience on the part of
members opposite that we have not yet been fortunate enough
to attain to in terms of exactly how much it will cost to
encourage the conversion, for example, from the use of oil in
various segments of our economy to a greater reliance on
natural gas, I would be most happy to receive that information. But we will be introducing a program shortly to move
along in just those ways.
We have also talked about the CHIP program. That was
mentioned specifically in the budget speech. That program has
been highly successful in terms of the participation of Canadians in increasing the insulation in their homes. We have talked
about expanding that program and we have also talked about
the possibility, since it is a housing program, of transferring
that program to the provinces, with the adequate funding to
carry it out.
Those are all examples, and I presume the honourable
senator was asking for examples. There is a long list of things
that have to be done. They have to be done now, if we are to
ensure that as a nation we are no longer dependent on decisions made outside our borders in terms of our energy future.
EXCISE TAX ON GASOLINE-FEDERAL SUBSIDY FOR URBAN
TRANSIT

Senator Perrault: May I ask the Honourable the Minister of
Industry, Trade and Commerce a question relating to the price
of gasoline? This morning there was a traumatic shock awaiting motorists when they drove up to the gas pumps and found
that they now have to pay almost $1.40 per gallon for gasoline.
Many of them would like to have the option of lower-cost
urban transport. They would like to have the opportunity to
leave their automobiles in the garage and use urban transport
to get to work.
On April 4 of 1977 the Honourable Sinclair Stevens, now
President of the Treasury Board, stated that, "the very first
Conservative budget will see $290 million to encourage the
urban transit system." I want to ask the minister what happened to the promise made by Mr. Stevens that $290 million
for urban transit would be made available in this budget.
Senator de Cotret: Urban transit is very much under consideration. I can assure the honourable senator that it is well

SENATE DEBATES

December 12, 1979

past the stage of study. I certainly would not want to suggest
that we have been inactive in this area. It is before cabinet at
the moment and I expect that we will be in a position to
announce a decision in the near future.

Senator Flynn: And that some promises have had to be
postponed. However, it does not mean that they do not remain
in the program of the Progressive Conservative Party.
We have to make the Canadian people realize what a mess

EXPORT TRADE-FEDERAL SUBSIDY

the new government was left with. Decisions which should
have been taken over the years now have to be taken by the

Senator Perrault: I know the minister is quite concerned
with the subject of export trade. He has spoken to a number of
seminars on that subject, and has spoken well. The same
President of the Treasury Board made a statement just about
the same time. He said that the "first Conservative budget will
include $75 million in support of export sales."
I want to ask the minister where the budget provides the
money for the improvement of export sales.

Conservative government, and some may well be rough decisions from the point of view of the Canadian people. However,
we will not avoid doing what is necessary in the common
interest, and those promises that cannot be met now will be
met eventually.
Senator Perrault: Honourable senators, that argument
really does not wash in view of the fact that the President of
the Treasury Board, after the Conservative government
assumed power, said that the books were in better shape than

* (1425)

he had expected.

Senator de Cotret: I shall have to refer that question to the
attention of the minister. I would be happy to mention other
budget statements that I have before me going back over the
last two or three years, but I would not dare bring the level of
debate in this house to within such a narrow partisan focus.

Senator Flynn: That was his first assessment. I believe he
corrected it afterwards. It was only because he accepted the
arguments made by the former administration. If I am not
mistaken, after reviewing the situation he changed his mind.
In any event, Senator Oison has given notice of an inquiry

Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator de Cotret: So I shall refrain from doing so. There is
no question that export trade is one of the main preoccupations
of the government and of the Economic Development Committee. A number of reports have been presented recently, one of
which, to be made public in the next few days, is the Hatch
Committee's Report on Export Promotion. Excellent suggestions have been made by that committee. Changes will be
brought to the Export Development Corporation in the area of
export financing, and those decisions should be announced
within the next few weeks. They will certainly be beneficial in
supporting the further efforts that we arc making in the field
of export promotion and export financing in this country, and I
am sure they will meet with the overwhelming approval of
honourable senators on both sides of this chamber.
INCOME TAX-PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CAMPAIGN
PROMISE

Senator Perrault: I have one final question. Perhaps it
should be directed to the Leader of the Government. On
November 20, 1978, the Leader of the Conservative Party
made a solemn promise to his "fellow Canadians" that there
would be "personal income tax cuts of at least $2 billion in the
first Conservative budget." That promise was repeated by the
Honourable Sinclair Stevens about the same time. I would ask
the leader: What about this massive promise that helped
propel the Conservative government into power? Where is it in
the budget?
Senator Flynn: It is quite obvious that following the statement to which Senator Perrault referred, the government
encountered a multitude of problems left on the table by the
retiring administration.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
[Senator de Cotret.]

on the budget speech, and when that inquiry is proceeded with

ail these matters can be discussed at length. His inquiry may
be a good thing. It would certainly be in better order than the
lengthy questions of the Leader of the Opposition in confusing
the facts and trying to confuse the publicHon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Flynn: -and perhaps confusing the members of his
own party.
DISTINGUJISHED VISITOR IN THE GALLERY
THE HON. ROBERT H. MACQUARRIE--SPEAKER OF THE
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES ASSEMBILY

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I hesitate to
interrupt the Question Period, but I feel it is my duty to call
the attention of the Senate to the fact that we have a very
distinguished visitor in our gallery to the south. He is the new
Speaker of the Assembly of the Northwest Territories. I am
sure that honourable senators would wish to welcome him, the

Honourable Robert H. Macquarrie, Doctor of Education,
member for Yellowknife Centre in the Assembly.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

ENERGY
DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS PRICES-- FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL
NEGOTIATIONS
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, I would like to ask the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce a question about

the status of the negotiations with the producing provinces. It
seems to me, by way of preamble to my question, that last
night the Minister of Finance laid out fairly well, and in

December 12, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

enough detail for us to be able to understand, the federal
government's position respecting future increases in the price
of oil and the relationship between that price and the price of
natural gas. However, I would like to ask the minister what
outstanding differences, or points of disagreement, remain to
be resolved between the producing provinces, particularly
Alberta, and the federal government.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, the only outstanding point that is still unresolved is that concerning the specifics
of the tax mechanism by which the federal government will
recoup 50 per cent, or thereabouts, of the increase in the
wellhead price of crude above $2 per barrel per year. It is with
regard to that matter that the discussions are going on.
I would like to re-emphasize what 1 said a few minutes ago
to an earlier question. What we laid out in the budget last
night in terms of the price of crude oil and the price of gas, in
terms of the energy bank, in terms of the measures we would
take with regard to conservation and with regard to substitution and enhancement of supply, is federal government policy.
That will not change. What we are doing with the producing
provinces is reaching agreement on that final specific mechanism by which we can ensure that the federal government
receives approximately 50 per cent of the increase in the
wellhead price of crude beyond the $2 per barrel that was
previously in place.
Senator Oison: Is it fair to say, then, that Alberta has
agreed to the $4 per barrel increase in 1980, and $4.50 per
year after 1980 until, I think, 1983?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, as I believe I had
said to Senator Oison on previous occasions, we had an
agreement in principle on all of the elements of the energy
package except that tax mechanism. When you look at an
agreement you cannot say that everything is set "except this."
It is a package. Obviously the package will either be accepted
or it will not. What I am saying today is that what we laid out
last night, in the budget presented by the Minister of Finance,
was the federal policy in this matter. In principle we have an
agreement with the producing provinces, and we are working
out the mechanism that I referred to just now.
[Translation]
THE BUDGET
IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, there are two or
three facts that I would like to place before you following the
reading of the budget speech. I would like particularly to draw
your attention to the appendices used as assumptions for the
government's projections.
For example, I see on the one hand that about $400 million
will be eliminated from the government's books and be paid by
employers and employees in respect of unemployment insurance. On the other hand, the consumer price index for 1980,
1981 and 1982 will rise about 30 per cent, or about 10 per cent
a year. There will also be higher unemployment. I could quote

the figures I have before me saying there will be more
unemployment.
I do not say those scenarios are wrong. I am not in a position
to destroy them but the only thing I am trying to do is to assess
the impact that will have on collective bargaining and the
social climate in Canada.
In view of those figures and remembering the days when I
was in the labour movement, I have serious apprehensions.
According to the projections, wages will not keep up with
rising consumer prices nor will the rate of unemployment
decline. I do not know under what logic one can think that
workers, regardless of productivity, are going to demand less
than the consumer price increases. I have to say that makes me
a bit fearful because it is an important factor in the debate
between the labour movement and employers in Canada.
There are considerable pressures on prices.
Senator de Cotret: These are no doubt very valid questions.
Now, as far as the data go, I do not have the budget documents with me. Still, if my mrnemory is correct, I would like to
tell you at this point that the forecast for the increase in the
rate of unemployment is for 1980, not 1981, 1982, 1983.
There will be a reduction in the rate of unemployment after
a year, in 1980, which will be a difficult year. Indeed, I said on
several occasions that was mainly due to the fact that the U.S.
economy will be going through a recession and, in the technical sense, that means we cannot expect two quarters of negative growth in 1980. However, considering the weakness of the
U.S. economy, we are still forecasting an acceptable rate of
real growth in the economy of about 1 per cent, which is much
lower than our potential.
The Minister of Finance indicated last night he was
anticipating for 1980 an average rate of unemployment of
about 84 per cent, if you look at subsequent years, depending
on the document to which you referSenator Marchand: This is one of your papers.
Senator de Cotret: Yes, it must be one of ours.
Senator Marchand: It is an appendix to the budget speech.
Senator de Cotret: I would ask you to refer to the last
paragraph of the first page which contains a short note which
is very important and also very interesting. It concerns the
status quo projections that the government accepts, in a way,
but which will influence the economic situation in the next few
years.
As for the inflation rate, it will certainly be higher next year
because of the energy price increases. This is inevitable and
there is no way to hide the fact.
However, we believe that the Canadian population as a
whole, in spite of the problems that may exist at the present
time and realizing fully our economic potential for the years to
corne, will face the challenge reasonably without causing a
undue acceleration of wage increases.
Senator Marchand: For the information of the honourable
minister, I would like to note that unemployment has reached
a level of 7.5 per cent in 1979. You were nearly right about the

SENATE DEBATES
1980 figure since it is 8.3 per cent. However, unemployment
will not go down since the forecasts show a level of 8.3 per cent
for 1981 and of 7.7 per cent for 1982. This is still .2 over the
level of 1979. These are the projections concerning unemployment. I am not saying that this is not a good methodology. I
am not saying that the figures are wrong, but simply that this
paper will have a major impact on collective bargaining and
indirectly on inflation.
Senator de Cotret: If you are talking about the impact of
the budget or of the estimates, I can say quite honestly that
psychologically and as conceris contents, this budget will have
much more impact than any other in the last several years.
The net impact of the budget will be extremely positive as
conceris growth, inflation and unemployment.
Senator Marchand: 1 do not see how the honourable senator
can say such a thing, especially since the productivity figures
show minus .01 per cent for 1979, minus .04 per cent for 1980
and minus .08 per cent for 1981. It is only in 1982 that we
have a positive figure of 1.1 per cent for productivity increase.
This does not make me particularly optimistic.
Senator de Cotret: I must point out respectfully that the
honourable senator is making a big mistake in interpreting the
figures. He should compare what would have happened without the justified initiatives of the present government with the
projections contained in these papers. What is important is the
difference between the two. I am telling you that this difference is very positive.
FUTURE RATE OF INFLATION

Senator Thériault: Honourable senators, to follow the questions asked by Senator Marchand, I would like to read to the
Minister of Economic Development a short paragraph from
the brochure entitled Budget in Brief. I shall read the second
paragraph in English:
[English]
Government spending increases over the next four years
will be held to an annual average of 10 per cent-virtually
no increase after allowing for inflation.
My question to the minister is: Is it an accepted policy of the
present government that for the next four years the minimum
increase in the inflation rate that the Canadian people can
expect is 10 per cent?
0 (1440)

Senator de Cotret: The honourable senator is obviously
reading much more into that statement than I would have read
into it or, if I had written it, that I would have written into it.
That is very clearly a maximum. It is a maximum that imposes
a very strict financial discipline, because the expectations over
the same period are that nominal GNP will be rising, on
average, at an annual rate of 13 per cent. If nominal expenditures by the federal government increase by only 10 per cent
while nominal GNP is increasing by 13 per cent, the honourable senator will readily notice the amount of constraint
involved, and also that the relative size of the federal govern[Senator Marchand.]

December 12, 1979

ment sector relative to GNP will decline. If my memory serves
me well, over that same period the size of the federal government sector relative to GNP falls from 20.6 per cent, which is
an historical high, to 18.3 per cent. I stand to be corrected on
the decimal points there; i have not looked at the numbers
today.
Senator Thériault: I thought I had asked the minister a very
simple question.
Senator Flynn: You never know.
Senator Thériault: I expected a very simple answer, which
could have been yes or no. Again I quote:
Government spending increases over the next four years
will be held to an annual average of 10 per cent-virtually
no increase after allowing for inflation.
That is over four years.
Again, I ask the minister: Is it an accepted policy of this
government that the minimum inflation rate that the Canadian people can expect over the next four years is 10 per cent'? If
he had given me a yes or no answer 1 might have followed
through by expressing my concern, as Senator Marchand has
done, about what the effect of this will be when the labour
movement and the labour leaders of this country go to the
negotiating table, in either the public or the private sector.
Senator Flynn: You have donc it now.
Senator de Cotret: I will answer that with a very categorical
no. Your first question asked me whether we were saying that
the minimum rate of federal expenditures would be 10 per
cent, and I think I answered that question. When we say we
are going to hold expenditures to 10 per cent, that does not
mean that is going to be the minimum. It means that is going
to be the maximum. When you hold something to a level you
limit it to that level.
Senator Thériault: It says "average"-a four-year average.
Senator de Cotret: I won't quarrel over a four-year average.
I agree with that. On the question about inflation, the statement you read is contained in a small pamphlet called Budget
in Brief. It says things in brief. Senator Marchand has obviously taken the care, for which I commend him, to read the
supplementary documents, and since I do not have them here
he would be in a better position than I to give you the
projected increase in the CPI over that period. You will sec
that it is declining, and that it is not 10 per cent per year over
that same period.
Senator Thériault: I am not surprised at all at the government jargon that is used in budget speeches. I have seen a few
of them in my lifetime.
Senator Flynn: You should know about that.
Senator Thériault: I am trying to make the points sufficiently clear that the average Canadian can understand them, not
only the experts like the minister.
Senator Flynn: Do that yourself.

December 12, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

PROPOSED CANADIAN ENERGY BANK

INCREASED EXCISE TAX ON AVIATION GASOLINE

Senator Thériault: I have another question for the minister.
Perhaps I should not quote from this pamphlet entitled Budget
in Brief; perhaps it should never have been produced. However, I quote from it:
A federal-provincial Canadian Energy Bank will be
formed to finance energy development projects with private sector participation.
Can the minister inform this house if there has been an
agreement with every province of Canada in relation to this
federal-provincial Canadian Energy Bank, and what participation we can expect from the private sector?
Senator de Cotret: 1 can inform the honourable senator that
there has been agreement between some provinces and the
federal government with respect to the federal-provincial
Canadian Energy Bank.

Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the minister responsible for economic development. While
most honourable senators may be shocked at the increase of 25
cents, or whatever it will be, even 50 cents eventually, on the
price of a gallon of gasoline, which is now $1.05, I should like
to inform you that for the people of the north, in places like
Dawson City and the Northwest Territories, that will be
tagged on to present prices of $1.50 and $1.70 for gasoline.
My question is: While there are exemptions in the budget for
farmers, fishermen and urban transportation, I wonder if
people who fly small commercial aircraft have been taken into
consideration for exemptions; and if not, is there a possibility
that they will be? I think that is a group of people who should
be considered. North of the 60th parallel is not the only place
to which this applies, but it applies particularly there. It is very
difficult. They are already having a difficult time because of
the price of fuel, so I wonder whether they could be included in
the categories exempt from the increase in the excise tax on
transport fuels?

Senator Steuart: How about Alberta? Is there agreement
with Alberta?
Senator de Cotret: Yes. Are you surprised?
Senator Steuart: I am delighted to hear it.
Senator de Cotret: I keep on answering the same questions
over and over again. There is agreement from Alberta on the
package. The honourable senator laughs. If you are in direct
communication with Alberta more than I am, fine.
Senator Steuart: Closer than you are.
Senator de Cotret: Then you are in a very fortunate position, and I envy you. There is agreement in principle. There is
no problem there. Senator Thériault asked me if there was an
agreement with all the provinces of Canada, and to my
knowledge the answer is no. I am not sure that there was an
agreement sought from all provinces in Canada. There will be
provincial participation and there will be federal participation
in the Canadian Energy Bank, and I am satisfied that that will
happen.
Senator Thériault: This is what bothers me about the whole
budget that I listened to last night. We are given what are
supposed to be facts, but based on what? I asked the minister a
two-part question. He answered with a partial no to the first
part of my question. The other part of my question he ignored
completely. What participation can we expect from the private
sector in the creation of this federal-provincial Canadian
Energy Bank?
Senator de Cotret: There is no question that there is going
to be active participation by the private sector in the development of the very many projects that will be sponsored by this
new federal-provincial Canadian Energy Bank. The honourable senator keeps on talking about the impreciseness of the
policy. I am quite astounded by that. Short of presenting, as
we will, the specific legislation and the specific proposals
setting up this institution, I would be hard put to make it much
more specific than it was made in the budget speech last night.
Senator Thériault: Wait and see.

0 (1450)

Senator de Cotret: I would be happy to look into that. I
should like to point out, though, that there was a major
measure introduced in the budget to deal with people, particularly people in the north, who fly small commercial aircraft.
That measure had to do with the tax treatment of the capital
cost allowance on the aircraft which was, for the first time,
deductible, if I am not mistaken, against other sources of
income.
I will be happy to check that specific measure, but I believe
it was directed specifically to people in the northern part of
this country where this kind of situation prevails most, but I
would be happy to look into it and give you a detailed answer.
REBATE OF EXCISE TAX ON GASOLINE

Senator McElman: Honourable senators, my question is
supplementary to that raised by Senator Lucier, but since it
has to do with taxation, I will direct the question to the Leader
of the Government.
As Senator Lucier said, there is provision in the budget for a
rebate of 10 cents a gallon of gasoline used for farming,
commercial fishing and urban public transit. My question
relates specifically to my own province, which is 85 per cent
forested, with 10 pulp and paper mills. I say that to show you
the significance of woods work to my province.
In this country, there are many thousands of woods-workers
who work for marginal wages. Many of these woods-workers,
contrary to the old tradition of spending winters in the woods,
now commute on a daily basis. This entails one-way travel of
20 to 50 miles, which means round trips of 40 to 100 miles a
day. They use a substantial amount of gasoline simply to go to
and return from work. This is the pattern in the leaders' home
province as well as in my home province. I will not refer to the
cost of fuel used in chain saws, but to just the cost of fuel
required for transportation to and from work.

SENATE DEBATES
Bearing that in mind, I should like to ask the Leader of the
Government to make a special appeal on behalf of the woodsworkers in the province of New Brunswick, as well for those in
his home province of Quebec, and those in north central
Ontario, northern Saskatchewan and British Columbia, so that
they may be given consideration similar to that given the
farming industry, commercial fishing industry and the urban
public transit industry. They now face a net increase of 8 cents
a gallon instead of 18 cents a gallon. If the same consideration
could be provided for woods-workers, it would certainly be
appreciated.
Senator Flynn: I certainly will put that question to my
colleague, the Minister of National Revenue. However, I am
not sure how these cases are treated under the present law. It
seems to me, if permanent residence is not required in certain
operations, that the cost of transportation is a deductible
expense. If such an interpretation is already in place, the
additional cost of transportation will, of course, be treated in
the same manner as the present cost of transportation. In any
event, I will obtain an opinion from the Department of National Revenue on that.
Senator McElman: Since there is special provision in the
budget as brought down last evening for farming, commercial
fishing and urban public transit, would the Leader of the
Government make representation to his colleague that similar
and equal treatment be given to woods-workers?
Senator Flynn: If there is no relief at the present time, it
might be considered, but, as I have suggested, it could be that
this instance is already provided for.
EXCISE TAX ON DIESEL FUEL - SPECIAL CORPORATION SURTAX

Senator Buckwold: I have two questions to put to the
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce for clarification
insofar as the budget is concerned.
My first question involves the energy excise tax. I am
particularly interested in the impact on diesel fuel. From what
I can gather, up until now there bas been no excise tax on
diesel fuel. If I am correct in assuming that the term "transportation fuel" now includes diesel fuel, then I believe I am
correct in assuming that a tax of 25 cents per gallon will be
imposed on diesel fuel, with a rebate of 10 cents per gallon
when it is used in the farming, commercial fishing and urban
public transit industries.
If these assumptions are correct, the impact on farmers, who
use a large amount of diesel fuel, will in fact be a 15 cent
increase in the price of that particular, useful and necessary
commodity. I should like to have your comment on that,
because I am sure that question will be asked.
While I am on my feet, I will ask my other question, which
relates to the special surtax of 5 per cent of regular federal
income tax payable by corporations.
Am I correct in assuming that the provinces will also
share-those provinces which are involved in tax agreements
with the federal government-in their percentage of that tax?
[Senator McElman.1

December 12, 1979

The Leader of the Government shakes his head, and he is
always handsome when he does that, but the question remains
whether in my province, where the provincial government
collects 47 per cent of the federal tax, 47 per cent of the
increased tax paid to the federal government will go to the
province. In fact, that would mean that corporations in that
province-and I can only refer to Saskatchewan-will be
paying approximately 7 per cent more rather than the extra 5
per cent that bas been announced.
Senator de Cotret: The answer is yes to the first question.
The new excise tax on transportation fuels definitely does
include diesel fuel. Since there was already an excise tax on
gasoline, the new tax implies an increase of four cents a litre.
Since there was no previous excise tax on diesel fuel, the new
tax implies an increase of 5.5 cents a litre.
With respect to your second question, my temptation would
be to answer that it is structured in a way that it does not
affect provincial revenues, but I should like to take that
question as notice so that I may satisfy myself that, in fact,
that is the case. As I said, my inclination would be to say that
it does not. However, it might, so I should like an opportunity
to look at the ways and means motion to be sure of that.
Senator Buckwold: I have one supplementary question. It
seems, having had your advice, that farmers will be paying an
additional 15 cents a gallon as of today on aIl diesel fuel? Is it
fair that this particular segment of society-a segment of
society so important to the national economy-should have to
shoulder this extra burden ail at once?
* (1500)

Would the government consider an amelioration of this tax?
Perhaps there could be an easing into it, rather than imposing
it in one fell swoop and thus adding a very heavy burden to an
already overburdened farming community?
Senator de Cotret: First of ail, you are correct in suggesting
that, for diesel fuel, there will be an excise tax, net of the
rebate, of 15 cents per gallon. Provision has been made for
fishermen and farmers because, to quote the words of the
Minister of Finance, fishermen and farmers are the backbone
of our economy. Yet, we are facing a difficult period. We are
facing difficult short-term issues, and at the same time we are
looking ahead to building a base on which this country can
move aggressively to realize its economic potential over the
next decade.
I do not think the budget has singled out any particular
group. Everything possible has been done to mitigate the
impact on those segments of the Canadian economy that are
least able to deal with the adjustments we must go through.
That is why there has been an income adjusted refundable tax
credit introduced on the energy side; that is why for fishermen
and farmers there is a rebate in respect of the excise tax
increase.
If one looks at the budget closely-I sec some honourable
senators smilingSenator Steuart: That is me.

Deceber12, 979SENATE

Senator de Cotret: Nonetheless, if one looks at the budget
closely, one will sec that it has attempted, to the greatest
extent possible, to spread the burden of the necessary adjustments as equitably as possible. Certainly, the benefits that will
accrue downstream will benefit equitably Canadians from
coast to coast in ail circumstances and al] walks of life.
Senator Steuart: If you last that long.
Senator Flynn: It is flot a question of lasting.
FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT
COMPTROLLER GENERAL 0F CANADA

Senator Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Justice. In the Third Session of the last
Parliament we passed Bill C-10, to amend the Financial
Administration Act. The purpose of that bill was to create the
position of Comptroller General of Canada. The minister,
speaking during debate on the measure, was critical of the bill,
stating that he wanted the Comptroller General to report to
Parliament, and expressing his desire that the exact duties of
the Comptroller General be set out in the act. lndeed, he
proposed an amendment to the bill setting out the precise
duties of the Comptroller Gencral.
Now that he is Minister of Justice and a member of the
inner councils of goverfiment, I arn wondering whethcr he
would be favourable to such an amendment as he proposed at
that time.
Senator Flynn: Since becoming a member of the administration, 1 have considered the arguments put forward by the then
government of the day, possibly including those put forward by
Senator Everett, as to why we should not be too specific about
the role of the Comptroller General. 1 arn now monitoring the
process to determine whether or not they were right. When 1
corne to a conclusion on the matter, 1 shahi let you know what 1
propose.

Senator Buckwold has already posed some questions
respecting the impact of the increase in the excise tax on
transportation fuels, but he did not mention that the very
farmers and fishermen he spoke of, and others in Canada, will
have to deal with an increase of $9.50 in the price of a barrel
of crude oul by July 1, 1981, assuming the intentions of the
Minister of Finance are put into effect.
My question, which I shaîl direct to Senator de Cotret, is: Is
it the intention to raise the domestic wcllhead price of oil by $4
a barre] effective July 1, 1980? The budget was not clear as to
when that first increase would take place.
Senator de Cotret: The next increase is the scheduled
increase on January 1, 1980, an increase of $1 per barrel, to be
followed by an increase of $2 per barrel on July 1, 1980, to be
followed by an increase of $1 per barrel on October 1, 1980, to
be followed by an increase of $2.25 per barrel on January 1,
1981, a further $2.25 per barrel on July 1, 1981, and each
January 1 and July 1 thcrcafter until 1983, at which point
there will be an examination of the relationship between the
domestic price of crude and the lower of the average international price and the price at Chicago.
If at that point the domestic price is lower that 75 per cent
of the lower of the Chicago price and the average international
price, the difference wiIl be made up by the increase on
January 1, 1983.
Then on January 1, 1984, a calculation will be made to
determine the extent to which we are lower, if at ail, than 85
per cent of the lower of cither the average international price
or the Chicago price and, if we are lower, an adjustment wilh
be made to bring the price up to 85 per cent of the world price
for oil. At no time throughout that period wiIl the domestic
price of crude exceed 85 per cent of the lower of the average
international price and the Chicago price.
Senator Austin: I thank the minister for his answer. I
believe that is the first time the schedule of pricing adjustments has been made available.

Senator Perrault: Another reversai!
Senator Everett: A supplementary. Can we be assured that
when the minister is back in opposition, he will take the same
view?
Senator Flynn: Possibly. I might add that I sometimes envy
those in opposition. 1 always feit very much at ease on your
side of the house, especially with you on this side. It was much
casier for us, 1 think, than it is for you.
Senator Steuart: Cali an election and you will be back in
opposition.

POSSIBLE NATIONAL GAS EXPORT TAX

Senator Austin: I wonder if 1 might ask the Minister of
lndustry, Trade and Commerce whether or not the government has considercd and rejcctcd the possibility of an export
charge on natural gas.
Senator de Cotret: We have ccrtainly not rejected any such
possibility. It is a matter that is being considered at the
moment.

to the question of the budget, and specifically to matters
relating to energy policy.

Senator Austin: 1 gather from the minister's carlier answer
that the pricing schedule for oil, of which we have now been
advised, is agreed to by the Provînces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Wouhd that be correct?
Senator de Cotret: In principhe, yes.

SENATE DEBATES
CANADIAN ENERGY BANK

Senator Austin: With respect to the federal-provincial
Canadian Energy Bank, is it the intention of the government
that the revenues to be raised by the increases in the wellhead
price of oil and natural gas-that being the 30 cents per
thousand cubic feet referenced in the budget-go directly to
the federal-provincial energy bank as the federal government's
contribution to that concept?
Senator de Cotret: I am not sure how to interpret the
senator's use of the word "directly". The total tax revenue to
be derived would not go to the energy bank. The budget docs
contain a schedule showing the contribution of the tax revenues to the federal-provincial energy bank in ternis of equity
for cach of the fiscal years from 1980-81 to 1983-84.
Senator Austin: Is there some relationship between the cash
flow that would be moved to the energy bank and the federal
government's total equity in that bank? Can it be related at
this stage? Perhaps you can begin by telling us what equity
position the federal government will take in that bank.
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to take the question as
notice. I believe that by the fourth year, there would be an
equity position on the part of the federal government of
approximately $1 billion, and it grows year by year to that
level. But I shall take the question as notice. I shall check the
budget papers and provide you with the exact figures.
Senator Austin: On that hypothesis-and I appreciate that
the answer is not an exact one-is it the intention of the
federal government to ask ail or certain of the provinces to
contribute an amount equal to the contribution of the federal
government, or a larger amount?
* (1510)

Senator de Cotret: First of ail, I would like to correct the
answer I gave you just a moment ago. The contribution to the
Canadian Energy Bank in 1980 will be $42 million, and more
than $1.5 billion over the four years will be contributed by the
federal government to the energy bank. That is the federal
contribution alone. The provinces are also being urged to
participate in Canada's energy future by providing equity and
loans to the bank. As a result, by 1983-84 we expect to have a
substantial amount of money in that bank available for the
development of major energy projects.
Senator Austin: Has the minister advised us that the Province of Alberta is agreeable to making contributions to this
federal-provincial energy bank?
Senator de Cotret: I would have to take that question as
notice in terns of exactly what the position of the Province of
Alberta is to contributions to this bank. There have certainly
been discussions between the federal governrment and Alberta
on this matter, and there is an understanding about the
establishment of the energy bank. But whether they would
contribute in equity form or in loan form, or at ail, is something I would have to refer to my colleague the Minister of
Energy for a specific answer.
[Senator de Cotret.

December 12, 1979

Senator Austin: I have one final question on this subject of
the energy bank, which is a very interesting one. Will the bank
be instructed to make loans only, or will the bank also be
entitled, as is possible in commercial banking, to take equity in
some of the energy projects as part of the total financial
transaction'?
Senator de Cotret: I think that is a question that will have to
await the specific announcement of the creation of the National Energy Bank for a reply.
FNERGY TAX CREDIT

Senator Bosa: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. I would like
him to clarify a statement which is to be found on page 5 of
the budget speech, as follows:
I am announcing tonight an income-tested, refundable,
energy tax credit of $80 per adult and $30 per child per
yearDoes it mean that the people who qualify for this income-tested program have to wait until the spring of 1981 before they
can receive whatever monies are due to them?
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I think that is a
very germane question, but, of course, the answer is yes. If the
honourable senator knows how to run an income-tested program in any other way, then the government would very much
like to hear about it. I have no idea how you run an inconetested program without knowing the income first.
Senator Bosa: I did not want to argue with the minister. I
just wanted to ascertain whether my interpretation of this
question was right.
I have a question of the Leader of the Government in the
Senate. The leader has stated on several occasions the reason
that this government cannot keep some of the promises it made
during the election is because it inherited from the previous
administration certain adverse conditions of the economy
which prevent it from keeping those promises. I would like to
ask the leader if he could tell us what areas of the economy
surprised him and his government, and so prevented them
from keeping those promises. I know the minister has a great
sense of humour and he also has a great ability as an orator,
but please, in this particular case, I am not looking for humour
or oratory, but a straighforward answer.
Senator Flynn: One of these days, honourable senators, I
will have occasion to make a very, very long speech.

this chamber whether the Government of Canada has been
approached by the Government of the United States to join

December 12, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

them in some kind of economic boycott of Iran, as the Government of France has been asked to do?
Senator Flynn: I think I have something here for you. I do
not know if the officials of the department knew that you were
going to be questioning me on that, but the answer I have been
provided with by the Department of External Affairs-and
here I am replying on behalf of the minister-is as follows:
We are looking at all kinds of ways in which Canada,
working with other countries, can exert maximum influence on the Iranian authorities to bring about the earliest
possible release of the hostages.
We understand the American Government is presently
consulting with its major allies as to how to increase
pressure on Iran, and Canada will stay closely in touch
with these discussions to help us determine what kind of
action we might take in connection with any collective
measures that may be discussed.
As far as unilateral Canadian action is concerned, it
would obviously be less effective than action in concert
with like-minded countries, given the relatively small
scale of our economic involvement with Iran at present.
IRAN-ADMISSION OF NATIONALS TO CANADA AS STUDENTS

Senator Haidasz: I have a supplementary question. Would
the government leader reveal to this chamber the policy of the
Department of Immigration towards granting student visas to
Iranian nationals, especially in view of the fact that an immigration official has stated that screening procedures for student visas are inadequate.
Senator Flynn: This is rather a technical question, and I will
look into it, but I do not think there is any policy at this time
to treat Iranian students in any different fashion from that of
any other group.
THE BUDGET
SPECIAL CORPORATION SURTAX

Senator Everett: I have a question for the Minister of State
for Economic Development. I am a little concerned about the
surtax on corporation income tax introduced in the budget last
night. As I understand it, it is a tax of 5 per cent on the tax to
be paid by each corporation in Canada. Certain corporations,
and I am thinking especially of some very large financial
corporations, are able to reduce their taxable income so that
the percentage of tax they pay in relation to their reported net
profit is considerably less than the roughly 50 per cent that
would be called the standard rate. If the objective of the
government is to derive revenue from corporations in Canada
in order to pay the additional costs of some of the programs
they have put forward, would it not make sense to impose that
tax more fairly on all corporations?
It seems to me that what the government has done is to
impose a greater tax on those corporations that are paying the
most tax, and corporations that are able to reduce their
taxable income-and I have no quarrel with that if they can

do it-will pay less tax than those paying the full tax. The
reason I quarrel with this is that in the situation in which we
have a temporary requirement, as the Minister of Finance put
it, to assist in the payment of programs, why is it not more
evenly distributed among the corporations, and why does it hit
in many cases the medium-size corporations, and allow some
of the largest financial corporations in the country to get away
with a lower tax?
Senator de Cotret: I shall have to take that question under
notice, because I would like to give you the measure of profit
on which the surtax is based. It does exclude certain things. I
just cannot remember exactly what the exclusions and inclusions are. Rather than lead you into error* (1520)

Senator Perrault: Oh, oh.
Senator de Cotret: Well, some of us are concerned about
leading others into error. Rather than do that, I would prefer
to verify it to make sure I can give you the specific answer.
Senator Everett: May I ask a supplementary? It might be
helpful, in giving the answer, to take, say, the major banks'
income taxes as a percentage of their net profits as opposed to
someone who is paying the standard rate on his net of 51 per
cent.
Senator de Cotret: All right.
Senator Everett: Thank you.
Senator Godfrey: When the minister is looking into that
could he bear in mind that, as I have been informed, Stelco has
paid no corporate tax in the last four years and does not intend
to pay anything in the next nine to ten years because of the
large expansion program it has, and the very fast writeoffs for
depreciation.
How will it affect companies like Stelco? Will they continue
to pay no tax, with this 5 per cent? Could you include that in
your investigation as well?
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to provide you with the
answer, senator.
ENERGY
SELF-SUFFICIENCY-RESOURCES

Senator Connolly: Honourable senators, I have a question to
direct to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. It is
on a much lower level of urgency than most of the questions
this afternoon.
Senator Flynn: At least those of your leader.
Senator Connolly: Honourable senators, I would like to jog
the minister's memory about a question I asked a couple of
weeks ago in connection with the self-sufficiency program and
objective of the government. It would be helpful to the Senate
if we could have answers to those questions some time.
Perhaps I should add that those questions are rather farreaching. I make the suggestions only because I think it might

SENATE DEBATES
be helpful both to the minister and to the Senate. Senator
Manning has an item on the Order Paper, which is No. 6,
having to do with the national energy policy, and that cornes
close to the series of questions I asked the minister. It might be
a useful device for ministers in the Senate to be able to use
debates of that kind. Perhaps this would be a good vehicle to
deal with that issue. The minister might be able to range
considerably farther than the details of the questions I asked. I
make that only as a suggestion.
Senator de Cotret: Thank you very much. I will accept it as
such.
THE BUDGET
DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS

Senator Hays: Honourable senators, I should like to direct a
question to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Has there been any change in the definition of small business
as a result of the budget last night? How do you define "small
business"?
Senator de Cotret: To my knowledge there has been no
change in the definition of "small business." I will be happy to
provide the senator with the definition of "small business" for
tax purposes.
Senator Lang: The wife is now included as an employee.
Senator Hays: Thank you.
DELAYED ANSWERS

The Hon. the Speaker: Are there delayed answers?
Senator Flynn: Yes, I have several, honourable senators.
Before I give them, may I say that it has occurred to me that
when answers are of a technical nature and are fairly lengthy
it might be appropriate to place them on the record rather
than to read them. I think that would be especially appropriate
when the Question Period has lasted for as long as it has
today.
I wonder if those honourable senators who have asked the
questions would be satisfied if I were to ask for leave to have
the answers printed at this point in Hansard. I have here, for
example, the answers to two questions raised by Senator
McElman, one regarding oil product supplies for the Atlantic
provinces and the other regarding increases in storage capacity
for oil in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. These answers
are rather technical.
If honourable senators want me to read the replies I have
received, 1 do not mind, but otherwise I would ask that the
replies be printed at this point in Hansardand that if honourable senators have any supplementary questions they put them
tomorrow.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it the request of the Leader of the
Government that these answers be printed as appendices to
today's Debates?
[Senator Connolly.]

December 12, 1979

Senator Flynn: No. I would like to have them go in at this
point.
Senator Smith (Colchester): He wants them to go in the
record at this point.
The Hon. the Speaker: My understanding, then, is that
rather than being printed as appendices the answers will be
printed as if they had been read by the senator. Is it agreed,
honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Flynn's delayed answers follow:
ENERGY
ATLANTIC PROVINCES-SECURITY OF FUEL OIL SUPPLIES

Senator Flynn: Senator McElman asked what action the
government is taking to ensure that heating oil supplies would
be available to customers of Gulf. In response I would like to
say that the government bas been in contact with representatives from Gulf Canada concerning that company's crude oil
supplies for its Point Tupper refinery. Its next cargo of Iranian
crude, which is still on its way and should arrive in midDecember, will permit Gulf to run its refinery until February.
Gulf hopes to replace the lost Iranian crude with supplies from
Kuwait, as it did during the Iranian curtailment last winter.
The government is concerned about the current oil supply
situation. However, it believes that the oil companies will take
the necessary actions to ensure adequate supplies for their
customers. A number of companies have already indicated an
intention to import higher-cost cargoes of heating oil to meet
supply requirements.
To further assist in bringing demand more closely in line
with prospective supplies, the Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources has telexed his provincial colleagues requesting that
they consider what accelerated conservation measures could be
immediately implemented to reduce consumption this winter.
This subject will be discussed at the upcoming First Ministers'
Conference.
Finally, while the government does not foresee a supply
situation requiring mandatory allocation or rationing, the
members of the Energy Supplies Allocation Board will be in
place this month. Should there be a serious supply shortage,
this board will ensure that available offshore and domestic oil
is allocated on a reasonable and equitable basis to all regions
including the Atlantic provinces.
ATLANTIC PROVINCES AND QUEBEC-STORAGE CAPACITY FOR
CRUDE AND REFINED OIL

Senator Flynn: Senator McElman asked last week about oil
storage capacity. In reply I would indicate that the last
significant increase in oil shortage capacity occurred with the
expansion of the Irving Refinery in 1976. At that time approximately 1.7 million barrels of crude oil storage was added at
the Irving installation in Saint John, New Brunswick.

December 12, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

The previous Liberal government did not have a program of
incentives to encourage the expansion of oil storage facilities.
However, inasmuch as there has existed since the mid-1970s
substantial excess refinery capacity in eastern Canada, and in
particular in the Atlantic provinces, there has also been some
under-utilization of available crude oil tankage. Given the
increasing cost of crude oil and the financial costs involved in
carrying stocks above working requirements, oil companies will
generally only store enough crude to meet prospective refinery
runs even though additional tankage may exist.
Discussions with some oil companies and terminal operators
earlier this year indicated that some surplus tankage existed in
the Montreal and Quebec City areas. However, it is possible
that in building heating oil inventories for this winter some of
this tankage has subsequently been utilized.
The federal government is now in the process of examining
the need to build a Canadian strategic petroleum reserve. In
this context it is reviewing both the possibility of using any
surplus above-ground tankage that might be available as well
as underground storage options.

minority of Canadians towards the refugee program. In fact,
the overwhelmingly positive response of individual Canadians
to the desperate plight of Southeast Asian refugees has
encouraged the government, while maintaining the commitment to 50,000 refugees before the end of 1980, to divert funds
which the government would have expended on bringing
refugees to Canada to providing additional medical and food
aid to the refugees remaining in Southeast Asia.

MULTICULTURALISM

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I have a response to
the question asked by Senator Macquarrie regarding the
encouraging developments in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and the
possibility of Canada playing a role in the resolution of the
civil war there.

CANADIAN CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL ON MULTICULTURALISM
AS SOURCE OF ADVICE

Senator Flynn: I should like to respond to a query raised by
Senator Bosa when he asked what mechanism the Canadian
Consultative Council on Multiculturalism (CCCM) will
employ to report directly to Parliament should it perceive that
the government is not following the advice it has been given.
The minister has advised me that, while the terms of
reference for the CCCM have been revised to allow the council
to bring to the attention of the public matters it deems to be
important, the primary function of the CCCM continues to be
to provide a source of consultation to the government directly
through the Minister of State for Multiculturalism. It is the
understanding of the minister that it is not the normal practice
for bodies which are advisory to ministers to report directly to
Parliament. Moreover, the minister advises me that he will
continue the practice of tabling the annual reports of the
council.
EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION
REFUGEES FROM INDOCHINA-REDUCTION IN GOVERNMENT
SPONSORSHIP

Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, on Thursday last,
December 6, Senator Thériault asked a question with respect
to refugees. I had elaborated, for the benefit of honourable
senators, upon the changes made to the government's refugee
sponsorship program. Senator Thériault wondered if those
changes had been motivated by increased pressure on the part
of those opposed to the refugee program.
I would like to reassure Senator Thériault that the new
approach has nothing whatsoever to do with any negative
opinions which may have been expressed by a very small

All honourable senators will appreciate that while Canada's
effort in sponsoring refugees is second to none, our country can
absorb a certain maximum, and the humanitarian figure of
50,000 has been established. I believe that all Canadians will
applaud increased assistance by our government to those hundreds of thousands of refugees who remain in Southeast Asia.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ZIMBABWE-RHODESIA-CANADIAN ROLE IN CONSTITUTIONAL
CRISIS

General agreement has been reached on all of the elements
of the settlement package for Rhodesia, and the parties
involved in the Rhodesian conflict have agreed to move quickly
to settle the remaining details on implementing a ceasefire.
These include arrangements for the disengagement and disposition of the opposing forces and the time between the signature of the ceasefire agreement and the beginning of the
ceasefire itself.
The Canadian government is pleased with the advances that
have been made to date in the London talks to bring peace to
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. At the Lusaka Conference last summer,
the Prime Minister indicated that Canada would be prepared
to participate in some kind of force or group that would help
bring about an internationally acceptable solution, namely, the
eventual holding of free elections. Our talks at that time were
more on the supervision and holding of elections than on
participation in a military peacekeeping force. We have had
discussions with the Chief Electoral Officer here in Canada on
how Canadians could be brought into any activity relating to
the election process, how they might be recruited and what
their role might be. The question of whether we might contribute to a peacekeeping or peace-monitoring force has never
been raised with us so we have been concentrating on the
aspect which we discussed with Britain and officials at Lusaka,
namely, that of helping in the monitoring and workings of the
election process only. Should any other request come from
Britain, we would have to evaluate it at that time.

SENATE DEBATES
TRANSPORT
VANCOUVER HARBOUR GRAIN SHIPMENTS-RESTORATION OF
RAIL SERVICE TO NORTH SHORE

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I also have several
delayed answers that I should like to have placed in the record.
I would ask for the indulgence of my colleagues to have them
put in in the same fashion as were the replies of my honourable
colleague, the Leader of the Government.
For example, I have a response to Senator Perrault on the
Vancouver Harbour with respect to grain shipments.
Senator Perrault: If it is short, I would appreciate a verbal
reply.
Senator de Cotret: On October 12, 1979, as the honourable
senator knows, the CN Second Narrows Bridge of North
Vancouver was extensively damaged on the north span after a
collision with a Japanese freighter. A contract was awarded to
CANRON Inc. to undertake repairs to the bridge, and CN
expects that the bridge will be re-opened as anticipated by the
end of January 1980.
Contingency plans were undertaken to move commodities by
barge across to North Vancouver as well as increased movements to Port Moody, re-routes to Roberts and diversion over
BC Rail to North Vancouver. Grain movements on BC Rail
from Prince George to the North Shore grain terminais have
been very satisfactory.
Car unloads, despite the fact that the bridge has been out,
have continued at a high level and continue to run ahead of
last year at Vancouver. For example, in week 18 last year, that
is the week ending November 29, the number of cars unloaded
was 2,070 as compared to 2,978 this year. Elevator stock and
vessel situation are good.
THUNDER BAY

ICE-BREAKING FACILITIES

Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I have another
answer to a question by Senator Perrault on the ice-breaking
facilities at Thunder Bay.
Senator Perrault: Is it a long reply?
Senator de Cotret: I have several replies to various questions
and they are all about the same length.
Senator Perrault: If there is a time factor, why not just put
them on the record?
Senator de Cotret: If you are happy to have them put on the
record, honourable senators, I would ask for your indulgence
in that respect.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator de Cotrei's dela ved answersfollow:
Senator de Cotret: In reply to a question in the other place
by the honourable member from Thunder Bay-Nipigon, the
Minister of Transport did announce that it was the intention of
Transport Canada to dispatch the Alexander Henry to Thunder Bay for this winter scason. This ship is now equipped with
[Senator FIynn.]

December 12, 1979

a new air cushion ice-breaking bow which will improve the
effectiveness of its operation. The Alexander Henry is scheduled to arrive in Thunder Bay at approximately mid-December. We can assure the honourable senator that the Coast
Guard will monitor the situation closcly to ensure that, with
the availabilities of resources, ice breaking appropriate to the
situation is maintained in the area.
GRAIN
FOREIGN SALES OBJECTIVE

Senator de Cotret: I would like to assure the Honourable
Senator Oison that contrary to his statement that we are
running quite low in grain exports this year in relation to
previous years, this is certainly not the case. In fact at the
present time we are running a considerable percentage ahead
this year in relation to last. Our exports are up by about
300,000 or 400,000 tons and this government is looking at
every positive way in concentrating on an all-out effort to get
that figure increased. As I indicated in my response to Senator
Perrault, car unloads at the west coast have continued at a
high level and continue to run ahead of last year with elevator
stock and vessel situation good. At Port of Thunder Bay, the
same can be said; the number of car unloads is good and the
elevator stocks are high. The minister responsible for the
Canadian Wheat Board said in the other place: "We are sure
that we will come very close, notwithstanding some of the
problems-bridges falling down and some burning-to
increasing our exports by 20 per cent, the figure which we
have set as a target."
That is the minister's target and that is the target that this
government is determined to achieve. There are 2,000 new
hopper cars coming on stream right now with another 3,000 to
follow during summer and fall of 1980. In addition, some
5,000 rehabilitated boxcars will be coming on stream by the
last quarter of 1980. This is a total of 10,000 boxcars and
hopper cars between now and 1981.
We can also point to the 24,000 tonnes of barley which were
shipped from the Port of Churchill last month. This is the
latest date that a vessel, in this instance, the M. V. Arctic, put
into the Port of Churchill to pick up a cargo of grain. It is
anticipated we can have the M. V. Arctic into Churchill in late
June 1980 to open the season earlier in that port.
TRANSPORT CO-ORDINATOR -MEASURES TO EASE
TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES

Senator de Cotret: Dr. Hugh Horner, as the Honourable
Senator Oison is no doubt aware, was appointed by the
government and will work in co-operation with farm organizations, provincial governments, grain handlers, longshoremen,
the railways, the Canadian Wheat Board and others to
improve our transportation system capabilities to meet the
ever-expanding world trade of grain.
I can assure the honourable senator that Dr. Horner is well
on his way in beginning to unravel the problems and complexitics in the transportation of grain in this country. Recently he

December 12, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

announced the establishment of his office in Winnipeg and the
appointment of several senior staff members. In addition to the
Winnipeg office, Dr. Horner will be setting up branches in
Saskatchewan and Alberta. He has in the past several weeks
begun his consultations with those groups I have just mentioned and is continuing to meet with them, and we have
confidence in Dr. Horner's ability as the new grain co-ordinator to get our grain moving faster and in a more efficient and
effective manner into both export and domestic markets.
TRANSPORT
PRINCE RUPERT-CONSTRUCTION OF NEW GRAIN TERMINAL

Senator de Cotret: I would like to advise the Honourable
Senator McDonald that the Minister of Transport announced
in Calgary at a meeting with the Alberta Wheat Pool delegates November 30 that the site for the new Prince Rupert
terminal has been selected, and the site chosen is Ridley
Island. The site evaluation report included several specifics.
Probably most important were: (1) the ability to develop an
operational structure approximately nine months sooner at
Ridley Island; and (2) an estimated additional cost of $20
million which would be required at the Kaien Island site at
Casey Point. I strongly support the minister in his statement
that if we wish to export more grain, it is imperative that the
new terminal at Prince Rupert go on stream as quickly as
possible, and it is estimated that if we proceed quickly, the new
terminal at Ridley Island can become operational by 1984. I
know that the Minister of Transport expects to have all
arrangements finalized by the end of the year so that development can be under way with no further delays.
With regard to the honourable senator's supplementary
question, an ipterchange agreement between Canadian Pacific
and Canadian National whereby cars from both railways will
be able to move grain into Prince Rupert is in final negotiation. This agreement covers movement from both the present
elevator and the new one. The development of Prince Rupert is
clearly contingent upon the interchange agreement. If we can
arrive at a suitable agreement vis-à-vis Prince Rupert, it may
well set the stage for further interchanges such as to Churchill.
When these negotiations have been completed, we would be
more than willing to make the honourable senators apprised of
it.
CROWSNEST RATES FOR MOVING GRAIN

Senator de Cotret: The Minister of Transport knows what
the Crow rates mean to the western farmer. He knows the
historical and economic significance of these rates to all
western Canadians and we as a government have no intention
of removing the benefit of the statutory rates as it now exists.
There are pressures to modify its application, to review its
structure, and there are differing views as to how it affects the
total industry. There is concern expressed about its impact on
secondary or value-added industries. These expressions of
opinion are coming from individual producers, organizations,
and various sectors of the industry.

80072-38

I want to assure you that any changes that may be contemplated will come only after there is full consultation with the
producers, for we happen to believe that the producers of this
country have some excellent ideas and views and we intend to
capitalize on that expertise.
Secondly, we believe that the railways have a firm obligation to move grain expeditiously, effectively and efficiently in
the national interest and in the producers' interest. I want to
make it very clear that under our government the railways will
not be allowed to run just the gravy trains.
And in saying that we are not accepting as gospel the
formula of Snavely, just as we have not accepted Prac or
Booze-Allen.
Thirdly, any freight rate adjustment will have to be coupled
with adequate service guarantees.
Fourthly, because we consider grain to be a national asset,
we in the federal government will not shirk from our responsibility in backing up that commitment with federal resources.
PENITENTIARIES
MEDICAL RESEARCH RESPECTING INMATES

Senator Flynn: On November 29, Senator Thompson asked
a very detailed question regarding medical treatment administered to inmates of federal penitentiaries.
I have been able to obtain a thorough but highly technical
reply, which is as follows:
In order to answer the question as specifically as possible, it
has been divided into two parts: Individuals carrying out
medical research; and the use of electric shock treatment.
In response to the first part, no such research took place in
the Atlantic, Quebec and Prairie Regions.
In the remaining Region of Ontario, the only research on
behavioural reaction to prescribed drugs was a study conducted by Dr. Workman, published in the November 1975 edition
of the CanadianFamily Physician and entitled "Psychotropic
Drugs and Aggression," which found that some tranquilizers
have a disturbing effect on certain inmates.
There have been no experimentally controlled programs
conducted on inmates in the Ontario Region by any pharmaceutical or drug manufacturing company.
In the Pacific Region, modified electroplexy, which is a
legitimate treatment for certain serious forms of mental illness, was used at Riverview Hospital for some federal inmates
prior to the opening of the Regional Psychiatric Centre in
1972.
At the Regional Psychiatric Centre, four cases received
modified electroplexy for the treatment of severe mental disorders under qualified medical practitioners in 1972 and 1973.
In reply to the second part of the question, no electric shock
treatment has been used in the Quebec, Ontario and Pacific
Regions. In the Prairie region, electric shock treatment was
occasionally given up until five years ago. It has not been given
since that time except in outside hospitals, in controlled cir-

SENATE DEBATES
cumstances, by outside spccialists. No other centre has any
knowledge of electric shock treatment administration.
In the Atlantic Region, Dr. Phillip Michel has prescribed
and performcd electric shock treatment on inmates from Dorchester Penitentiary. This is donc at the Moncton Hospital and
only on mentally iii inrnates who, in the opinion of the
psychiatrist, require it and who voluntarily sign a consent
form.
Dr. E. Ryan has referred sorne inmates from Springhill
Institution to the Nova Scotia Provincial Hospital for Psychiatric Treatment. Some of these inmates eventually received
clectrie shock treatment while in this hospital.
Due to the necessity of providing an immediate response 10
the senator's question, it is not possible at this time to provide
answers 10 the last part of his question: "If so, by what doctor
was it administcred, in what institution, and when?" A factual
response would require research of some 30,000 10 35,000
medical records in aIl five regions as well as those held by the
Public Archives in Ottawa.
It must also be borne in mind that, since penitentiary
institutions are not equippcd to provide electric shock treatment. the Canadian Corrections Service would have to check
the records of outside hospitals 10 ascertain the various doctors
involved. This, of course, would take a considerable length of
t ime.

ENERGY
PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL POLICY-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Manning, P.C., calling the attention of the
Senate to certain proposals for a national energy policy
for Canada.-(Honourable Senator Oilson, P.C.).
Senator Olson: Honourable senators, i should like to yield
the floor to Senator Godfrey.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Godfrey: Honourable senators, I wish to comment
briefly on two statements that Senator Manning made in his
speech on this subject. At page 387 of Senate Hansard he
makes the following statement:
The reason why the Ottawa River Valley was chosen
was not geographic. It was approximately the point in
Canada where the cost of Alberta oil coming east equated
the cost of offshore oil coming in from eastern Canada. So
it did not upset the pricing structure to any significant
degree.
The statement made by Senator Manning is strictly correct as
of that time; but the impression might be left that there was no
real difference from then on between the price of western oil in
Ontario and imported oil in Quebec and the eastern provinces.
i should like to refer to a table which the National Energy
Board submitted to the House of Commons Standing Committee on National Resources and Public Works. It is dated
February 21, 1973, and is a comparison of the crude oil prices
in Ontario and Quebec. The table shows that between 1962
and 1971 western Canadian crude in Ontario cost 51 cents per
barrel more than foreign crude in Quebec.
According to the Energy, Mines and Resources report An
Energy Policy for Canada, the cost of transporting oil from
Quebec to Ontario over this period would have been about 15
cents per barrel. On average, then, Ontario refiners had to pay
about 36 cents more per barrel of oil as a result of the national
oil policy.
That may not seem very much at the present time, but
honourable senators have to bear in mind that between 1962
and 1971 the price of oil was $3.14 per barrel. So it resulted in
an increase of approximately Il per cent for Ontario in having
to buy Alberta oil instead of imported oil.
The next point in Senator Manning's speech, to which I
would like to refer, appears at page 388 of Senate Hansard,
where he says that when Alberta buys B.C. lumber, salmon or
gold, and so on, they pay the international market price. He
goes on to say:

The same is true of Ontario nickel, Quebec iron, and so
on. They are all sold at the international price. Western
oil is the only commodity that should be treated
differently.
No doubt that is a typographical error. I believe it should say
"is treated differently." I must confess that when I heard
Senator Manning make that statement, my jaw dropped,
literally as well as figuratively. 1 recalled that for many years
there had been at various times a two-price system for copper.
I had the Research Branch of the Library of Parliament
prepare a paper for me on the subject. I sent a copy to Senator
Manning, and I should like to read several extracts from it. On
page 2 it says:
In 1965 the federal government placed copper under the
Export Import Permits Act, which required federal permits for the exportation of copper in all forms . . . By the

first months of 1966, the London Metals Exchange price
was double the Canadian producer price.
Later on, the paper says:
On March 1, 1970 the federal government set the domestic price of copper at 59¢ per lb. (the LME price was then
at about 85¢) while at the same time requiring domestic
firms to supply 23,500 tons of copper per month for
Canadian use.
The domestic price in that case works out to 70 per cent of the
international price. Later on, at page 4, the paper says:
-by
1974 ... the LME price was about $1.50 per lb.
while the North American producer prices were at about
80e. The federal government again set domestic prices
well below the world level and as a result had to force
Canadian producers to meet domestic demands.
That worked out to about 53 per cent of the world price.
t merely wanted to point that out to show that the statement
by Senator Manning, that western oil is the only commodity
that is treated differently, is not in accordance with the facts.
Senator Olson: I wonder if I might ask the honourable
senator a question'? He mentioned that from approximately
1962 to 1971 Ontario paid about 36 cents per barrel more than
it would have had to pay for offshore oil. t believe those are
the figures he used. Would he agree that that investment, in
establishing an oil delivery capability from western Canada
since 1973, has probably returned to Ontario at least tenfold,
and perhaps as high as fortyfold, its initial investment?
Senator Godfrey: I agree that it was absolutely the right
policy to follow. t believe it was good for Ontario as well as
Alberta, in the long run. The great thing is that it established a
principle that, t should point out to the people of Alberta,
certain provinces are prepared to make sacrifices-in that
case, not a very large sacrifice-in the interests of another
province and of the country as a whole. I would heartily agree
with the principle established so firmly by the national oil
policy.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, t wonder
if t might ask Senator Godfrey if, in connection with the

SENATE DEBATES
research project which he asked the Library of Parliament to
carry out, this was the only instance in which he could find
that Senator Manning's assertion was in error?
Senator Godfrey: I did not inquire. I asked them only to
look into the question of copper. I recalled quite clearly that
for many years there was a two-price system for copper.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Honourable senators, I wonder
if I might also ask Senator Godfrey if he can remember,
without research, that it is the custom in other parts of Canada
to sell products made in Ontario at a price substantially more
than that charged in Ontario for those same products?
Automobiles would be an example.

SENATE[ )EBATES

There is a statement here also .hat if the Conservatives
formed the government they would amend the Immigration
Act, in its opening reference to the "federal and bilingual
nature of Canada," by inserting the word "multicultural."
In a different part of this statement it says:
A Progressive Conservative government wiII not shelve
multicultural policy away in the Department of Labour
between elections, as Mr. Trudeau did in 1974.
That is precisely what has happened today. We have a Minister of Multiculturalism who also has other responsibilities. IHe
is the Ninister of Fitness and Amateur Sport as weII, for
example.
Here is another quotation:
A P.C. government wilI look to the C.C.C.M., not the
civil service, as its primary source of advice on multicultural policy and ethnic services. We will also shift control
over the bulk of federal direct spending in this field to the

guarantees of Parliamentary accountability.
We have had an answer to this question already, reflecting a
dramatic change in this policy, since the government does not
intend to carry out the promise that it made in that regard.
There are other reasons why 1 would like to see the Minister
of Multiculturalism appear before our committee, and other
questions that 1 would like to put to him. 1 arn sure that
honourable senators would not want me to rise every day and
put these questions piecemeal, and wait three or four days

STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
FIRST REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEF
ON POINT OF ORDER

SPEAKER'S RULING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, at the conclusion of Tuesday's sitting 1 took into consideration the direct
reference of a point of order to the Chair by Senator McElman. That reference concerned comments made by Senator
Bosa on December 4, and I quote:
Honourable senators ...

I wonder if 1 may have your

permission to raise a matter on a point of clarification.
At that time I heard no dissenting voice. Senator Bosa then
began to discuss the vote of the Senate which referred back to
committee a report of the Committee on Standing Rules and
Orders as a result of an amendment proposed by Senator
Neiman. At thai time Senator Bosa said, and again 1 quote:
1 just wonder whether the Senate was not too hasty in
adopting that amendment
Following Senator Bosa's remarks on December 4, Senators
McDonald, Roblin and McElman rose on a point of order, and
the point of order was later directed to the Chair by Senator

Smith (Colchester). The point of order was that Senator Bosa
was out of order in attempting to comment adversely on an
action taken by the Senate in the current session.
1 deait with the matter on December 6 in what 1 called,
perhaps unwiscly, a "non-ruling." I did so because of certain
customary latitudes in the Senate in the matter of the application of our rules, as well as some difficulties in their
interpretation.
On December l1, as honourable senators will recall, Senator
McElman again raised the matter as, to use his phrase, a
"continuing point of order," requesting, if I may quote again, a
"firm ruling" from the Chair.
Before reaching a decision, I found it necessary to refer to
two particular questions that had been raised during the
discussions, the first being whether leave (or, for that matter,
consent) was granted to Senator Bosa when he rose and,
secondly, if so, what was the extent of the leave or consent
granted, because there is a subtle but very important difference under our rules between "leave" and "consent".
On the first point 1 reached the decision that leave and
consent had been granted to Senator Bosa when he began to
speak on that occasion in respect to some but not all of the
rules involved. Certain rules require that consent be granted,
and that, of course, is merely majority agreement; others
require that leave be granted, and when lcave is requested and
granted it must be by unanimous consent, that is with no
dissenting voice.
S(1410)

Now I find that consent was granted under one rule and
leave under another rule on that occasion, because of the
words used by Senator Bosa when he rose and asked "permission" and there was no dissenting voice.
1 think honourable senators will agree that the practice and
custom in this place is for senators not to insist on strict
adherence to words, expressions and nomenclature as they
appear in our rules. The grant of leave or consent is often by
implication, for example, when a senator asks permission of
the Senate to proceed without necessarily observing al] the
required formalities under rule 3, which reads:
3. Notwithstanding anything in these rules, any rule or
part thereof may be suspended without notice by leave of
the Senate, the rule or part thereof proposed to be suspended, and the reason for the proposed suspension, being
distinctly stated.
My ruling on this matter of leave or consent refers, of
course, only to the specific time and occasion. 1 would not
want it to be taken as a precedent because I hope that the time
will come when it will not be necessary to regard a request for

December 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

"permission" to be taken by the Chair or by the Senate as
"leave." That would be a matter of adhering perhaps more
strictly than we have been doing to our rules.
The second question, of course, is more difficult. That
question is: For what was leave granted? For what period of
time when Senator Bosa was on his feet was he entitled to
consider that he had leave in the one case and consent in the
other? I would say this, honourable senators, and I hope it will
be agreed, that when a senator asks leave he is in effect
moving a motion, not necessarily a formal motion, that a
certain rule or rules, or perhaps ail the rules, that would
constrain him be suspended pro tem, for the time being. I
think honourable senators will agree that that is one possible
interpretation of our rules. He is asking, perhaps, that a
specific rule or ail of the rules that constrain him be suspended. This, of course, creates a difficulty, because we have not
been accustomed to observe our rules strictly, particularly the
basic rule that when leave is asked, the rule to be suspended
shall be stated and the reason shall be stated. It is for that
reason that we run, I believe, into these difficulties.
I took the position at first that both leave and consent had
been granted to Senator Bosa to proceed as he wished regardless of any constraining rule. That was the position I took at
that time. On a more thorough examination of the proceedings
on the days involved, those being November 29 and December
4, 6 and 11, and of our rules and the appropriate authorities,
not the least of whom is the distinguished Clerk of the
Parliaments who sits in front of me at this moment-I have
consulted him, of course-I am now inclined to modify that
position to say that Senator Bosa had leave only in respect of
rules 27 and 43(2) as applicable, both of which would have
required notice, but not including the suspension of rule 1. I
find it so, because it seems necessary in circumstances such as
these to retain the authority of rule 1 to provide a continuing
capability of reassessment for senators to decide whether they
wish the leave they had given to continue indefinitely as the
proceedings advance, or to ask again as necessary from time to
time, "What did we give leave to?"
As I see it, it is rule 1 that makes it possible for senators to
say, "We have given leave under our rules for the suspension
of certain rules, except for rule ."
Therefore, honourable senators, although there appears to
be no specific restraining rule of the Senate to apply in this
particular case, the residual authority of rule 1 is applicable
under the "customs, usages, forms and proceedings" of the
Parliament of Canada. For that reason, Senator Bosa was out
of order when he proceeded to comment adversely on action
taken by the Senate on November 29 in the current session.
Honourable senators who are interested in the background
of that ruling will refer to the comments made by Senator
McElman, when he placed on the record the rulings and
opinons of the authorities, Beauchesne, Bourinot, and others,
on this important question.
In making this ruling I take it, (if I may, from statements
made by Senator Roblin, Senator McDonald, and Senator

McElman and others during the discussion) that it now
appears to be the wish of the Senate that the Chair be more
diligent in the future than it has been in the past in putting the
request for and grant of leave to the Senate as a question from
the Chair, not necessarily in obviously routine cases, as was
pointed out by Senator Roblin, but at least more regularly and
consistently than I have done in the past.
I thank honourable senators for bringing the important
matter to the attention of the Senate.
It is never a pleasant duty to find an honourable senator not
in order, particularly in the case of a senator who serves the
best interests of the Senate so well and so often as Senator
Bosa has done. I know he will understand that it was necessary
for me to make this ruling, and I trust that it will be found to
be in accordance with the rules and standing orders of the
Senate and with the customs, usages, forms and proceedings of
the Parliament of Canada.

the leader migbt wish ta confirm or deny the report that the
Prime Minister bas booked television time on aIl national
networks for this evening.
Further, if the booking has been made, could the leader
indicate the subject matter that would prompt this rather
unusual action?
Senator Flynn: 1 have not heard anything about that. 1 don't
know where the Leader of the Opposition collects bis inf .ormation-

Senator de Cotret: I would be delighted ta comment. 1 made
a statement yesterday by whicb 1 am willing ta stand. We
presented a responsible budget, a budget that faced squarely
the problems that we as a nation bave ta face if we are ta
recognize the real potential that we have in this country in
terms of bath human and fiscal resources in the decade of the
1980s. It is a budget that will lead ta lower unemployment, ta
stronger growth and ta less inflation in this country, and 1
stand by that.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Senator Steuart: The CBC.
Senator Flynn: The CBC?
Senator Frith: Ask Senator Murray.
Senator Flynn: In any event, it is probably to announceand 1 tbink the Canadian people would agreeSenator Perrault: A tax reduction?
Senator Flynn: No, no. Tbat tbe Liberal Party was not able

Senator Perrault: Well, the universe will unfold, 1 suppose.
THE BUDGET
IM PACT ON TH E ECONOMY-STATEMENT BY WOOD GUN DY
LI MITED

Senator Perrault: 1 sbould like to ask a question now of the
Minister of lndustry, Trade and Commerce. Yesterday the
minister gave real hope to ail] of us when he said, as reported at
page 556 of the Debates of the Senate:
-this budget will bave much more impact tban any other
in the last several years. The net impact of tbe budget will
be extremely positive as concernis growth, inflation and
unemployment.
AIl of us like ta hear words of tbat kind, Mr. Minister.
However, some of us were rather sobered by a statement that
appeared in a Canadian Press article in the Ottawa Citizen
this morning. The article quotes from a report made on
Wednesday by Wood Gundy, Canada's largest firm of investment dealers, that the budget shows "fiscal conservatism is
triumphant and will bring Canadian growtb in real terms to
zero or below in 1980."
The newspaper article goes on: "If that forecast materializes, it would be the second time in the past-war period that
the economy did not grow at aIl."
I tbink the other time was when there was another Conservative gavernment in power.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Senator Perrault: In view of the fact, Mr. Minister-this is
not a political question-tbat this is a respected and responsible Canadian campany, whose services have been retained by
many governments in this country, including Conservative
governments, I wonder if the minister would care ta offer bis
comments.
80072-39

(1430)

Senator de Cotret: 1 also indicated, as did the Minister of
Finance in bis budget speech on Tuesday night, that 1980 will
be a difficult year. The U.S. is likely ta experience a recession,
the signs of whicb are already evident. We wiIl flot avoid the
impact of the recession in the U.S. That was made clear in the
budget, and it is certainly made clear by the history of the
post-war period. Wbenever the U.S. bas gane into a recession,
Canada bas known slower growth. As a matter of fact, the
period of aur worst economic performance in the post-war
periad, in 1974 and early 1975-we did not bave a Conservative government during the worst post-war periad-corresponded ta the worst economic recession in the U.S.
Our best estimate is that real growtb in this country next
year will be positive, it will be in the order of one per cent. We
will not, in technical terms, know a recession. In other words,
there wilI not be twa successive quarters of decline in GNP.
Those are the statements we bave made, and those are the
statements we are willing ta live by.
You quoted a respected source-and I agree it is a respected
source-that says real growth might be zero. We feel it is
likely ta be one per cent. Certainly ather sources are entitled ta
their evaluation of the situation, but we feel ours is a realistic
and honest appraisal, ta the best of aur knowledge, of bow the
economy will perform next year.
SHIPBUILDING
BRITISH COLUMBIA-CONSTRUCTION 0F BURRARD-YARROWS
DRY DOCK

Senator Perrault: 1 have one final question for the Minister
of Industry, Trade and Commerce relating ta the west coast. 1
have received a number of representatians from trade union
workers allied witb the shipyard industry on the west coast.
WiIl consideration be given ta the possibility of constructing
the new Burrard-Yarrows dry dock on the west coast? As the
minister knows, the proposed dry dock represents a substantial
investment of taxpayers' money, and there have been reports
that the dry dock might be built abroad or that there might be
some preferential treatment accorded ta an offshore company
ta build this dry dock.
If the minister does not have the reply immediately available, may 1 express the hope that he wilI bring same information on this subject ta the Senate?

SENATE DEBATES
Senator de Cotret: I will be happy to bring more detailed
information to the Senate at a later date, but I can certainly
say, firstly, that there is no preferential treatment being given
or to be given to any offshore supplier. Secondly, to underline
my first point, one of the first things that we did upon taking
office was to extend the period of the bids in order to allow
Canadian interests to put in their bids because the manner in
which the bidding had been structured in the past, by persons
unknown, was such that only foreign bids had been received.
We extended the bid period to make sure that we could treat
this whole question in an equitable manner.
The question is still under active negotiation, and I would be
happy to give any further details to this chamber as soon as I
receive them.
Senator Perrault: I thank the minister for the information
he has given, and I would welcome any further information
indicating that there will be a full and fair opportunity given to
Canadian firms to bid on this contract.
As the minister is aware, there is a great deal of unemployment in the Canadian shipyard industry. The industry needs
this contract. This is a matter of real importance to the
working people and to the economy of the west coast.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
LANGUAGE RIGITS-JUDGMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
CANADA

Senator Marchand: Honourable senators, I am informed
that the Supreme Court of Canada rendered this morning an
historie decision on the appeal placed before it, finding as it
did that certain basic provisions in Quebec's Bill 101 are
unconstitutional, and dealing also with the decision taken some
100 years ago by the then Manitoba government to withdraw
language rights from its French-speaking minority. Honourable senators, this certainly is an historie decision, but there
seems to be an attempt to hide the fact that this decision could
have far reaching implications not only in Quebec but
throughout Canada.
Under the circumstances, could the government leader indicate whether the Prime Minister intends to call as soon as
possible a conference of first ministers to examine the implications of that decision by the Supreme Court?

It should not be forgotten that the Supreme Court's decision
means that francophones in Manitoba have been deprived of
their statutory rights for more than 90 years.
There is also Bill 101. Quebecers are proud of the results of
that bill, but they are less than proud of what it took away
from the English-speaking minority. At this historic juncture,
should the Prime Minister not call the provincial premiers
together and ensure that those fights for the rights of Canada's
two principal languages, for more linquistic justice throughout
Canada, be pursued rather than curtailed?
Senator Flynn: Honourable senators, I agree with Senator
Marchand that those two decisions rendered this morning by
[Senator Perrault.]

December 13, 1979

the Supreme Court of Canada, on Quebec's Bill 101 and on
the Forest case in Manitoba, are of the utmost significance.
As far as the emergency meeting suggested by Senator
Marchand is concerned, I am not sure this is the best course of
action at this point. My department and are studying the
implications of those two judgments of course. Those two
judgments, concerning mainly two provinces, Quebec and
Manitoba-I believe the immediate problem affects those two
provincial governments-can have general implications, providing those two provinces act accordingly. I cannot see how

the emergency meeting suggested by Senator Marchand could
be beneficial. Only if these judgments were not complied with
would the federal government step in, with possible implications that cannot yet be determined. Then the Canadian
government could arrange the suggested meeting or take any
other action deemed fit, but I do not believe that any hasty
action is warranted at this point. We must first sec what the
provinces will do before we can decide on a course of action, if
one should be needed.
*

(1440)

Senator Marchand: A supplementary question, honourable
senators. I think that the Leader of the Government gets off a
little too casily when he says that it is the business of Quebec
and Manitoba. It concerns the Canadian Constitution, and one
of the essential section, of the Canadian Constitution is section
133. So the federal government should not say of the referendum, "Well, we will let them act and sec the resuits". 1 find
that it is a very cool attitude, which may be a quality of this
government. I would say that it is not keeping abreast with the
Canadian people.
You must, no doubt, know Montreal as I do. There is the
response of the anglophone groups, just as there is the response
of francophones in Manitoba. Since it is the basic Canadian
legislation, 1 do not understand how the Leader of the Government can adopt such a disinterested attitude and say, "Well,
wc will sec what they do and then we will decide."
Senator Flynn: I do not see why Senator Marchand is
getting excited. He refers to the attitude of the government. I
would not, under those circumstances, tell him about labour's
attitude. J am saying that the decisions of the Supreme Court
have confirmed section 133 of the British North America Act.
If the two governments involved comply with the decision,
there is no problem.

It is only in the event that the provinces involved do not
comply with the provisions of the judgment that the problem
would arise. On the contrary, I think that Senator Marchand
should say that they are good judgments. They acknowledge
the validity of section 133. I hope everybody will admit it and
not become excited but realize that it is a valid and very
effective decision in our national interest.
Senator Marchand: A last supplementary question. I am
probably too nervous, but I am afraid that the Leader of the
Government does not realize that I am not the only one who is
nervous following the decision of the Supreme Court.

December 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Flynn: I said that we should not expect negative but
positive reactions in that case. I trust we shall have positive
reactions. I do not understand why we should apprehend
negative reactions before they exist.
Senator Molgat: A supplementary to the question the Honourable Senator Marchand has just asked, Mr. Speaker. It
goes without saying that all Manitoba francophones, including
my colleague Senator Guay and myself, are very delighted
with the judgment announced this morning. However, Senator
Flynn's answer does not indicate to us really whether the
federal government will be acting in this affair and whether it
will correct the injustice which has been going on for 90 years
in Manitoba. Let us wait and see what happens later. At
present, would he be prepared to propose that the federal
government agree to take over at least part of the cost incurred
in Manitoba following that judgment, considering that the
Government of Manitoba will now have to do a lot of translation if it complies with the judgment? They will have to issue
the statutes of Manitoba in both languages and re-establish a
bilingualism policy which was there originally but which was
abandoned. Is the federal government prepared, at this time,
to announce clearly that it is going to take over a large
proportion of those costs?
Senator Flynn: It is a decision which will be made in time. I
simply want to tell my honourable friend that the federal
Government has indicated to the Government of Manitoba
that we would consider the situation should problems arise
following the judgment.
As I said, this is a judgment concerning first the government
of Manitoba. If it asks for any kind of assistance from the
federal government or even from the federal Parliament, I can
assure my honourable friend that we shall consider that
request favourably.
I repeat that the Manitoba government will have to assess
this judgment. It will have to look into the implications of this
judgment and make up its mind about which way it chooses to
go and what sort of assistance it may need from the federal
government.
Senator Molgat: I have a supplementary question. Assuming that the Manitoba government decides to do nothing, there
would be time limits. What are the time limits the minister
would accept? When would he start exerting pressure to make
sure that the decision is enforced?
Senator Flynn: I wonder if the honourable Senator Molgat
has read the judgment that the Supreme Court has just
rendered in the Forest case. The decision does not state that all
statutes which have been adopted, I think, since 1890 only in
the English language are ultra vires, null and void. The
judgment does not say that. It merely confirms the judgment
of the Appeal Court. There are possible implications. What
are they? The issue may be raised once again whether the fact
that these statutes had been adopted only in English makes
them all ultra vires. This issue has not been settled by the
Supreme Court.

What I suggest, therefore, is that the honourable senator
take a while to ponder the decision, as the Manitoba government certainly will, before choosing the most practical solution. I repeat that there is no reason to be concerned about
this, because there are no problems just yet. Sometimes problems are eliminated in the easiest way. It is not by making
mountains of them that we will serve our countrymen's best
interests.
Senator Molgat: A supplementary question. I like the calm
way in which my honourable colleague presents the question.
Had he been a French-speaking Manitoban during that time,
perhaps he would not be as calm.
So, since we have been waiting for ninety years, I am asking
the Honourable Minister of Justice and Attorney General
what time limit he is now prepared to give? Is he prepared to
wait ninety more years or will he say expressly to the Manitoba minister, to the Manitoba government: Well, you have
three or six months. Otherwise, things could drag on and on all
over again.
Senator Flynn: Once again, honourable senators, the time
limit does not rest with the federal government. It rests with
the Government of Manitoba. It is up to them to act. If I were
a French-speaking Manitoban, having won my case in the
Supreme Court of Canada, I would not start shouting from the
housetops that I have been persecuted for a hundred years, but
would simply say, "Well, I won my case." I would simply urge
my government, the government of Manitoba, to comply with
the decision as soon as possible, and in the best way possible.
That is what I would do if I were a calm, cool and collected
Manitoban.
Senator Guay: A supplementary question. I should like to
say, honourable senators, that I am also very pleased to
support what Senators Marchand and Molgat have just said.
On the other hand, I am a little disappointed by the few words
that the honourable Minister of Justice has just spoken.
On one point only, although I am not a lawyer, I do not
agree with him that only the legislation passed in English is
ultra vires. I do not follow him on that point.
Moreover, I did not appreciate his saying that we got
excited over the Supreme Court judgment. I think the people
of Manitoba, the old families, made sacrifices over almost a
hundred years to have denominational schools. In other words,
they paid taxes to the public schools while supporting their
own schools. I think they have a reason to get excited, and
happily so, in view of the judgment handed down today.
I think the Senate government leader must take into consideration the requests made to him today, in an urgent
manner, in order to see what can be done to solve this problem
in Manitoba.
It must be said that it was not only Mr. Forest who did
tremendous work in this area. The major effort was made by
our fathers and forefathers who insisted that we Manitobans
speak French and maintain our language, even if we had no
rights to do so.

SENATE DEBATESDeebr1,97
That is why, honourable senators, we are flot gctting excited
at ail. We are proud. We are happy. It is now up ta you ta act
and flot ta say that we have time. The statutes mnay be ultra
vires, but 1 think it is important that the judgmcnt bc impIemented as soan as possible.

Senator Flynn: 1 take due note of the short speech Senator
Guay has just made. 1 have said that 1 rejoice, with him and
with the francophones of Manitoba, in the ruling that was
brought down. 1 say 1 am studying it. He may not have ta
peruse it ta say right off that a conference of the first ministers
should be held right away. That is his business. 0f course,
when anc does nat rcalizc what a judgmnent stands for from a
legal point of view, anc can suggest anything. 1 have respansibilities. 1 have no intention of making dcmagoguery out of
this situation.
Once again. 1 agree that the ruling is based on law, that it
rcllects an element of' justice towards the francophones of
Manitoba. 1 fully agrce on that. Hawever, as 1 have
cxplained-thaugh it might take me anc hour ta explain tl ta
my friend Senator Guay-the ruling concernis the Legislativc

Senator van Roggen: Honaurable senatars, I have a questian
for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce rclatcd ta

make a statement ta this chamber and, through us, ta the
people of Canada, as ta what are appearing ta bc the very
unfortunate ramifications arising fram the recent ruling af the
National Energy Board an gas experts Io the United States'? It
appears now as though thase exparts may be placing the

This, of course, brings inta question aur crcdibility with aur
American friends, and has consequences of grave significance
ta thc independent Canadian gas producers wha would be
supplying their gas if prebuilding proceeds-gas which is now
locked in.

conditions that may well prevent the accomplishment of what
it was intended to accomplish.
Senator de Cotret: Honourable senators, I should like to
read a short statement on this matter which i made public
today.
The Government of Canada remains fully committed to the
implementation of the Canada-U.S. Agreement for the Transportation of North Slope gas from Alaska to the Lower 48
states. Along with the significant industrial benefits to
Canada, this project facilitates the access to Canadian gas
reserves in the Mackenzie Delta and the Beaufort Sea.
Furthermore, the government is of the view that the prebuilding of the southern sections of the system for the export
of the Alberta gas to the U.S. markets in advance of the
arrival of Alaskan gas is an important component of that
project, both for its early completion and for the substantial
benefits it would bring to Canada. i share the views expressed
by the former government when the two governments, on
March 3, 1979, agreed to, and I quote, "seek ways whereby
any additional gas exports, should they be authorized, could
facilitate timely construction of the entire Northern Gas
Pipeline."
These factors were important considerations taken into
account by the government when it approved the National
Energy Board Gas Export Report last Thursday. It is the
government's view that the board's report goes a substantial
way to encouraging the start of this much delayed project. I
am concerned, therefore, by the report that the project's
sponsors in Canada are disappointed with it. i note, however,
that the President of Foothills has indicated he wishes to
discuss this matter with appropriate government officials.
I have met with the President of Foothills, as well as the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Northwest Alaskan
Pipeline Company, Mr. John G. McMillian. I have listened to
their concerns, and I can tell honourable senators that those
concerns are under very active consideration.
Senator van Roggen: You did not touch on the last part of
my question, and that is that if there is indeed a problem found
by the government in the wording of the National Energy
Board's decision, do mechanisms exist for the amendment of
that decision without having to re-open the matter to public
hearings, with all of the delays that that would entail, and
keeping in mind that such delays would then put the timing
mechanisms in that decision out of whack entirely insofar as
supplies by independent Canadian producers are concerned?
Senator de Cotret: I think there are a number of ways of
remedying the situation. Certainly, the National Energy Board
is looking at the situation. It is my understanding that, in the
event of the wording being misinterpreted, they could change
it without holding public hearings. That is something i would
have to verify.
Senator van Roggen: It would be difficult to change the
reference from three years to eight ycars, and pretend it is a
misprint. In any event, I thank the minister for his answer.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
LANGUAGE RIGHTS-JUDGMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
CANADA

Senator Robichaud: Honourable senators, i have a supplementary question on the subject of the Supreme Court of
Canada judgment.
[Translation]
Please allow me, honourable senators, to continue my
remarks in French.
i should like to ask the Minister of Justice whether, after all
the changes made in our courts since confederation-1 ask him
this for the record because i imagine i know the answer-he
considers the ruling brought down this morning by the
Supreme Court of Canada to be perfect and final on the
matter of language rights in this country?
Senator Guay: It certainly is.
Senator Flynn: The decision, as such, is final. It may be,
however, that it has not solved all the problems one could think
of, and that other procedures, other legal procedures, could
intervene, asking the Supreme Court either to rule on certain
aspects on which it has not ruled, or to decide other matters
which are not directly or necessarily related. But, since its
judgment cannot be appealed-I think my learned friend
knows that appeals to the Privy Council have now been
abolished a long time-it is final.

THE ECONOMY
POSSIBLE IMPOSITION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS

Senator Austin: Honourable senators, I have a question for
the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. I would like to
ask whether it is under his direction that the government is
studying the question of imposing currency controls and
whether, indeed, the government feels that this is a matter
that, raised at this time in a public way, will be of benefit to
the Canadian economy and to the value of Canadian
currency?

e

Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge there is no
such study. May I ask if your question is as to whether or not
we are looking at the possibility of imposing foreign exchange
controls?
Senator Austin: That is the question i am asking.
Senator de Cotret: To the best of my knowledge, no, and, as
minister, I can assure you that there is no such study going on
under my direction in any of my various portfolios, and I am
not aware of any such study on the part of the government.
Senator Austin: Does the minister's statement indicate that
he thinks that such a study would not be useful to Canadian
government interests at this particular time?
Senator de Cotret: Well, I can answer this personally-and
perhaps I shouldn't. i can tell you i do not need a study to

SENATE DEBATESDembr3,17
know my own position on the question of foreign exehange
controls.
Senator Austin: 1 am asking the question because in the
National Issue Survey, issucd by the Progressive Conservative
Party of Canada under the name ot Terry Yates, one question
is:
Do you agree or disagrce that a good way ta ensure
stability of our dollar is ta impose controls on the outflow
of currency from Canada'?
And 1 am wondering what was the usefulness of such a
question, or whether it indicated emerging governiment policy.
Senator de Cotret: 1 would not take that at aIl as indicating
emerging gavernment palicy. It might be an indication of our
concern ta hear the views of Canadians on a great variety of
tapies, but certainly it is not emerging gaverrnment palicy.
Senator Austin: Yau indicate then that is a valid question ta
ask the Canadian people at this time, and 1 thought 1 heard

DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PRIVILEGES AND
IMMUNITIES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, December I1, the
debate on the motion of Senator Macquarrie for the second
reading of Bill S-11, to amend the Diplomatic and Consular
Privileges and Immunities Act.
Senator Thompson: Honourable senators, when Senator
Macquarrie introduced this bill, I congratulated him on the
lucid and comprehensive coverage he had given the need for it,
and I want to congratulate him now on having put it in a broad
framework, particularly so when we think of the outrage of an
embassy in another country, and the abuse that has been
inflicted upon representatives of one country attempting to
have a diplomatic relationship with a host country. Of course,
I am referring to the terrible situation, the deplorable situation, of the American embassy in Iran. Senator Macquarrie
pointed out that civilized countries for hundreds of years have
worked out a practice of a civilized approach towards the
representatives of one country in another. That has worked
through and evolved into a body of international law based on
custom, and by the operation of common law has been incorporated into the common law of Canada-this is part of the
bill, in fact-and it has been applied by Canadian courts on
that basis for many years.
As Senator Macquarrie pointed out, the Charter of the
United Nations assigns to the General Assembly the task ofand here I quote from the Charter-"encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification,"
and he referred to the Vienna convention as the habeas corpus
of international law governing relations between nations, and
indeed it is.
As we know, in 1961 the General Assembly called a major
international conference with respect to diplomatic immunities
and privileges that resulted in the 1961 Vienna convention on
diplomatic relations. Again, in 1963 a similar gathering adopted the Vienna convention on consular relations. Senator Macquarrie pointed out that 129 states are now part of this
convention and are signatories to it. This particularly interested me, because in 1977, when I introduced the measure to
which he has now proposed this amendment, there were 117
signatories. This shows-and we are very grateful for the
fact-that more countries are becoming signatories.

Honourable senators, we are all concerned with, although
sometimes we are flippant about, the role of our pinstripe
representatives abroad, but, from my own experience, I know
that the members of the Department of External Affairs
represent us very ably in other countries. I have not done quite
as much travelling as my colleague Senator Macquarrie has,
but certainly in my experience we have first rate people
representing us.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Senator Thompson: I might add that they are courageous
Canadians, and it is for us at home to provide all the protection we can through this chamber and through the House of
Commons for our representatves abroad. This bill, in its
essence, is designed to achieve that, because there is a tit-fortat arrangement between signatories. In other words, if we
cause embarrassment to some embassy here they may then in
turn retaliate on us through our representatives in their country. That is why we are signatory to the convention and that is
why we brought it into law, which law is now being amended.
* (1510)

Honourable senators, I listened carefully to Senator Macquarrie, particularly to his explanation that this amendment is
necessary to deal an occurrence similar to that experienced by
Australia, where a minority group cause severe embarrassment
to an embassy. This was a minority of a fine group of people
who had gone there from Croatia, as indeed they have come to
Canada from Croatia. It was the case of a minority feeling
that they might achieve certain purposes in their homeland by
taking actions of an extremely embarrassing nature in the land
to which they had gone, and to which so many of the majority
had made fine contributions. Apparently, the minority felt that
by causing embarrassment to the embassy of one particular
country, Yugoslavia, whose embassy had been given recognition there, they could somehow motivate the Australian people
to look favourably upon their, the minority's cause.
Indeed, I am sure their action would have had the reverse
effect. I am certain the Australian people feel as we do,
honourable senators, that it is wrong for any group of people,
large or small, to go outside the law, and to use their disregard
of the law as a means of achieving their ends. Such a group
would receive little sympathy, regardless of what cause they
espoused. Quite the contrary; they would be rejected even by
the very people who were in favour of their cause.
Honourable senators, I took the trouble to read the debate
in the Hansard of the Australian House of Commons. There
was an interesting and lively discussion presided over by the
Speaker. I noticed particularly that the sponsor of the bill in
Australia was quite sensitive about it. He said that he had
mixed feelings about their legislation, because he was aware
that a suggestion that the right of a minority group to dissent
would be limited is not in accord with the privilege of dissent
enjoyed by the citizens of all Commonwealth countries. That
freedom of dissent is at the root of the greatness of the
countries of the Commonwealth. He felt that their bill might
in some way limit that dissent, thus impairing to some degree
their strength as a nation. Therefore, he had some rather

SENATE DEBATES
nervous reservations with respect to how broad an interpretation could be made of their bill, when actually it was supposed
to focus on only one area.
The draftsmen of Bill S-1 1, which is amending legislation,
seem to me to have diligently tried to focus on a particular
problem, namely, the embarrassment of a legitimate embassy,
one given recognition by Canada through its country of origin-I mean the embarrassment of such a legitimate embassy
by a spurious embassy set up by a small group purporting to be
legitimate. The draftsmen have pointed right at that problem.
I should like to point out one particular distinction between
the Australian legislation and our bill. The Australian law
focuses on the person as well as the physical property that
would be bought by the spurious embassy. The Canadian bill
focuses on the physical property of the so-called embassy.
When I asked for some clarification on that point, 1 was told
that we already have existing in the law of this country, in
section 361 of the Criminal Code, a provision which precludes
anyone from impersonating a legitimately appointed person
from another country. Presumably, that would cover someone
coming here and saying he is the ambassador from some
country, or pretending to be attached to that country's
embassy, when, in fact, he did not really represent the country
at ail and when, in fact, Canada had not approved the establishment of an embassy. Such a person could be charged under
the Criminal Code.
I question whether it is really necessary to go through the
process of using the Geneva conventions and amending a
federal statute, which is what we are doing here, when we
already have in existence in the Criminal Code a provision that
makes personation with intent a crime. I leave that point as a
question for the honourable sponsor of the bill to consider. It is
one point I should like to have clarified, because there is little
reason in having unnecessary legislation.
If the argument is raised that, well, there is still the actual,
physical property and it is necessary to deal with it, despite the
fact that anyone entering the premises to work, posing as a
consul or ambassador, could be charged with personating with
intent, my answer is that if a spurious embassy buys a house
here and leaves it as an obviously vacant building, even if it
has some kind of sign banging in the wind, it would look so
ridiculous that people would laugh at it. In such a case, would
we really need this particular amendment? In short, if by
resorting to the Criminal Code we can get at the people who
want to use the property in their personation with intent, what
is the need for getting at the property itself?
Honourable senators, there is another important question
which concerns the kind of offence we are dealing with. Should
it be a criminal offence or merely a civil offence? The sensivity
of the Australian sponsor was such that he purposely went out
of his way to make it a civil offence rather than a criminal
offence. He did so because he did not want to sec curbed the
legitimate desire of people to express their dissent-whether it
be towards the Government of Australia or the government of
some other country. On the other hand, he did not want the
embarrassment of legitimate embassies as a tool or ploy to be
jSenator Thompson.]

December 13, 1979

allowed to continue. He therefore opted for a civil offence
punishable by a fine of $200.
For some reason, we in this country have decided that it
must be a criminal offence punishable upon summary conviction, which is obviously more severe than a civil offence. I
question the need to go that far and I would like to have an
answer to that, either in committee or from the sponsor.
Another of my concerns stems from the fact that the city I
come from draws some of its great strength and vitality from
the multitude of ethnic halls and associations that exist there.
We have a particular function called "caravan."
Incidentally, I should like Senator Smith (Colchester) to
make a tour of these halls with me. I am sure he would add to
the vigour and excitement of the occasion, and would be
delighted with the hospitality extended to him.
You might wonder what actually takes place on this "caravan." The "caravan" organizes the various ethnic halls-the
Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Czechoslovakian, UkrainianSenator Bosa: And Italian?
Senator Thompson: Yes, the Italian hall and, I know, too,
the Irish hall. After aIl, I don't want to leave my own
background out of the picture.
An Hon. Senator: What about the Scottish hall?
Senator Thompson: Yes, the Scottish hall, if there is one. If
there isn't, there should be.
At any rate, to get into any of these halls you have to pay
for a passport, after which you can visit, free, any one of them.
The point of these last remarks of mine, honourable senators, is that I wonder if, under this amending legislation, the
department, if it wanted to, could close down this activity on
the basis that these various halls are spurious in nature, or are
misrepresentations of other countries. That is my concern, and
because of it I phoned the department and was informed that
they would, of course, act with discretion. Well, I am concerned about that, too, because section 4 of the act which this
bill amends states that "The Governor in Council may make
such regulations and orders as are necessary." If Senator
Forsey were with us, I could sec him rising with respect to that
to state, as was his wont, that the ultimate control must be
with Parliament and not with a department.

e

(1520)

I am sure the Department of External Affairs-I said some
nice things about the department in my introductory
remarks-appreciates that. It is our role to scrutinize everything they do, even with some suspicion, even though I am sure
the department is serving our country as best it can.
I say that because there is another question that comes to
mind. The explanatory note to clause 2 says:
The proposed new sections 5 to 9 would make it an
offence to establish or continue the operation of purported
embassies or consulates in Canada by persons not representing a sovereign state or a government recognized by
Canada.

December 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES

of the Estonian and Latvian consuls, and they are now included in the book along with the Lithuanian honorary consul. If
they are not, and we pass this amendment, could there be a
situation where the Estonian and Latvian consuls could be
charged with a summary conviction offence? I am not satisfied
about that, and it is a point that has to be clarified.
Honourable senators, I have one further point concerning
this matter. I know that the present government takes pride in
the fact that it always consults with the provinces before
bringing in legislation. We may argue that this amendment
comes under "peace, order and good government" and that
there is no need to discuss it with the provinces. However, I am
impressed with the emphasis of the government on the fact
that "we are going to have consultation with the provinces."
When I introduced the legislation in 1977, Senator Smith
(Colchester), in committee, said, "You have waited eleven
years before bringing in this bill. What is your reason for
bringing it in now? Why the haste? You have gone approximately eleven years without it." When I inquired as to the
reason for the delay, I was told that there had to be consultation with the provinces, and also that the department had
waited to combine the diplomatic and consular conventions in
one bill. That was given as the reason, but, frankly, I feel that
eleven years for consultation is somewhat too long. However,
that was the answer given.
I appreciate that honourable senators on the other side of
the chamber are moving quicker, but I remain disturbed, and I
would hate to see my friend Senator Macquarrie embarrassed
if he has to tell us, "We did not discuss this with the
provinces." I look forward to his reply, and the answers we
shall receive when the bill is before the committee.
Senator Macquarrie: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is my duty to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Macquarrie
speaks now, his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate.
Senator Macquarrie: Honourable senators, I am becoming

debate. I suppose it is an attestation of the vitality of our

This amendment could insidiously destroy the stand which insofar as we view these important matters.
I shall not presume to attempt to answer the specific and
Canada, the United States and Australia have taken. Those
two Baltic consuls in Canada have now been denied official very important questions which Senator Thompson has directed to me. I recall the Honourable C. M. Drury, in replying to
consular recognition by Canada. In Australia the government

to emphasize that.
I should say to Senator Thompson that I have a fellow

Senator Macquarrie would confer with his colleagues in the about what has happened. On the other hand, I happen to be
the Canadian who delivered the anti-colonialism speech at the
Department of External Affairs and report to us, in the event
United Nations General Assembly some years ago. What, in
of any misunderstanding, that there is recognition by Canada

As honourable senators know, there are two approaches to
recognition by Canada or any other country. There is the de
jure recognition and the defacto recognition.
Here we have a situation-and I personally feel very strongly about it-where Canada has made a statement regarding
the annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union, by the
communists, and the method by which those states were
annexed. We recall the freight cars that rumbled out in the
night. I think particularly of June 14, 1941, when from my
wife's Baltic country approximately 40,000 people were herded
into cattle cars and sent to Siberia. Fortunately, the communists missed my father-in-law and his family by just two
minutes, and they were lucky enough to get out of the country.
His crime, as I have said before in the Senate, was that he was
a member of Parliament and a lawyer.
Canada, to its credit, said, as did the United States, "We
will accept de facto recognition, but we do not accept the de
jure recognition of the annexation of the Baltic States by the
U.S.S.R."
I telephoned the department in order to clarify the situation
regarding recognition. I inquired whether the words "Canada
by persons not representing a sovereign state or government
recognized by Canada" included de jure as well as de facto
recognition. To explain what I was talking about, I said that I
was thinking of the honorary consuls of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania in Canada.
The information I received was that there was only one
honorary consul from the Baltic states accredited by Canada-the Lithuanian honorary consul. The other two are no
longer accredited or put in the book, as it is referred to, which
lists diplomatic, consular and other foreign representatives. I
should mention that the listing of all the Baltic consuls in that
book was started by the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker.
The Latvian and Estonian consuls are no longer listed in the
book, yet they carry out consular services for Free Estonia and
Free Latvia. It is important that we should not forget how the
communists have treated free and independent small nations.
If the communist system had ever changed we might say, over
a period of time, that those harsh conditions will improve and
the problems will be resolved. But the situation has not
changed. In those small countries there is still no religious

ail candour, do we do? Do we move into a delegation of
Canadians from the Baltic States and say, "Yes, we will
declare war on the Soviet Union"'? We cannot, in fact, do that,
although we know that the things which were imposed upon
those people were grievous and terrible, and that not all the
perfumes of Araby can blot them out in our recollection.
*

(1530)

I would say to the honourable senator in reference to
provincial consultations and I have, I think, been known as a
Dominion rights man for a long time-that this government, if
it has faults-and I am not going to catalogue them, let alone
admit them-is not given to failing to consult the provincial
authorities. I think he may rest content that these consultations have taken place.
With regard to one of the specific things he mentioned, a
problem arises, as I sec it, when a group from one country goes
to another and purports to speak for that country as representative of a part, or even the whole of its population.
Naturally we ourselves welcome Atlantic House in London,
and Quebec House in Paris, and Ontario House, and so on.
This has been going on for many years. However, as the
Honourable Paul Martin used to say in the other place, these
things are all negotiated and arranged under one umbrella. In
other words, external affairs are the responsibility of the
dominion government. I use that rather quaint expression
"dominion government," which certain people do not like, but
to which Dr. Eugene Forsey, if he were here, would say,
"Hear, hear.' I think that is of tlie essence here.
I congratulate Senator Thompson, who has a better Scottish
accent than I have, and I envy him in that regardSenator Thompson: I think you should be saying "Irish."
Senator Macquarrie: I say it is Scottish, but I am trying to
flatter you. A Thompson who is an Irishman perplexes me, but
I still have a great regard for the honourable senator.
Honourable senators, there would be no point in our inviting
the distinguished experts from the Department of External
Affairs to appear before the committee if I answer the questions before they arrive. To do so would be, to use Senator
Roblin's phrase, an act of supererogation. I commend this bill
to your favourable consideration.

March 31, 1980.
Senator Langlois: Honourable senators, we are grateful to
the sponsor of this bill in this chamber, our new colleague
Senator Doody, for his lucid explanation of its main features.
This appropriation act provides for the expenditures proposed
by supplementary estimates (B) laid before Parliament for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1980. These estimates were duly
examined by the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance with officials of the program branch of the Treasury
Board, and Mr. John C. Smirle, manager, applications and
standards, from the Department of Communications. The
committee's report was tabled in this chamber on November
29 last.
Supplementary estimates (B), totalling $1,031 million, are
composed of budget expenditures of which $600 million are
statutory items and $392 million represent funds for which
Parliament is being asked to provide new authority. The
non-budgetary expenses, that is to say, loans, investments and
advances, total $39 million to be voted. The total of these two
last items of $392 million and $39 million respectively is $431
million, representing the amount to be voted by Parliament in
this bill. The total estimates for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1980, are now increased to $54,946 million, which amount
exceeds by $680 million the total anticipated estimates in the
federal expenditure plan for the year.
Here I digress for a moment for the purpose of drawing the
attention of honourable senators to a misprint in the third
paragraph of the report of the National Finance Committee,
where 1 find the following sentence:
The total Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1980 are not inereased to $54,946 million.
Obviously the word "not" should be "now."
The major items of these supplementary estimates (B)
which are to be voted by Parliament are as follows:
(1) $120 million for additional home insulation;
(2) $63 million for the Department of National Defence to
cover increased contributions to NATO;
(3) $20 million for additional assistance to the shipbuilding
industry;
(4) $30 million to increase the limit in the petroleum
compensation revolving fund; and
(5) $21 million to the Cape Breton Development Corporation for capital expenditures and rehabilitation and development of its coal and railway operations.
On the other hand, the major items of the $600 million
representing statutory items are: $297 million for additional
payments to provinces; $100 million for additional costs of
servicing the public debt; $53 million for income security
progranms such as old age security; and $60 million for additional election expenses due to the general election held last
spring.

SENATE DEBATES

The only difference between the modified motion and the
original motion is that it is a more gentle way to put the
proposition. In other words, we are inviting the minister to
attend rather than requesting that he attend. If honourable
senators would agree with that, I would appreciate it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when Senator
Bosa rose I thought he said he wished to amend the motion. Of
course, it is quite out of order for any member to amend his
own motion. However, he used the word "modify." Therefore,
is it agreed that, pursuant to rule 23, Senator Bosa have
permission to modify the motion before the Senate at this
time?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

I gave notice that in the new year, hopefully soon after our

SENATE DEBATES
that is to say, those matters that would be referred to this new
standing committce.
We believe it would take some time to do this in the session
when it resumes after the new year, and we agree that at least
one of the tasks the Special Committee of the Senate on the
Northern Pipeline would like to undertake would be delayed
unduly. By passing this motion today, that committee could
get on with that task, on the understanding that we would give
favourable consideration to reaching a decision whereby at
least one standing committee would be introduced to replace
the special committee that is functioning now.
Senator Smith (Colchester): I wonder if I might ask the
Deputy Leader of the Opposition what two committees he had
in mind when he said, I thought, that the ternis of reference of
those two committees might have to be modified to achieve the
objectives he is talking about?
Senator Oison: At least two committees would be the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce and
the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications. I should make it clear that that is not provided in the
ternis now before the Senate in the committee report. It would
appear to me that those things would have to be taken into
account if another standing committee were set up, and the
ternis of reference provided for it would be broad enough to
cover all the things Senator Roblin indicated.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Could I trespass on the good
nature of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to ask what
particular matters relating to the Standing Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications would have to be
modified?
Senator Oison: I expect that if il were going to be an
all-encompassing energy conimittee, including ail aspects of
energy and transportation of same, it would require some
modification of the terms of reference now provided in the
rules for the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and
Communications.
Senator Roblin: If I might speak to the same point, I should
like to make it clear that we would need to have close
consultation with Senator Smith (Colchester), and certainly
with Senator Hayden, to make sure that il met with their
general approval.
Senator Oison: Perhaps I might just reply to the question
just asked by Senator Smith (Colchester) and amplified by
Senator Roblin. The rule in question is rule 67(i), which sets
out the Senate Committee on Transport and Communications,
and which in subparagraph (iv) refers to:
-pipelines, transmission lines and energy transmission.
That is the rule that niight have to be modified if a new
standing committee such as the one Senator Roblin envisions
were set up.
Senator Smith (Colchester): Thank you very much.
Motion agreed to and reported adopted.

BANKS AND BANKING LAW REVISION
REPORT OF BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE DE-BATE ADJOURNED

On the Inquiry of Senator Hayden:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Report of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce on the subject matter of the Bill
C-14, intituled: "An Act to revise the Bank Act, to amend
the Quebec Savings Banks Act and the Bank of Canada
Act, to establish the Canadian Payments Association and
to amend other Acts in consequence thereof."
Senator Cook: Honourable senators, I would ask lcave to
make a short contribution to this debate now. Because of the
approaching holiday season we do not know when this inquiry
will be debated, and as I may not be present to take part then I
would very much appreciate having leave to make a short
contribution at this time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Cook: Thank you, honourable senators. As a
meniber of the Standing Senate Comnittee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce, I should like to make a few remarks on the
report of the committee at this time.
While I agree with the thrust of the report, there are
nevertheless two points that I and some other members of the
comîmittee feel need to be strengthened. I am therefore taking
what many senators may feel to be a bold step, which is to
deliver a dissenting opinion from the conclusions stated in the
report on these two points.
First, 1 have to remind honourable senators that the bill
itself was not before the committee. Ail we did was to consider
its subject matter. Had the bill itself been before the committee, I would have moved two amendments, which, of course,
might or might not have been accepted by the committee.
Happily, the procedure we have followed does allow us a
second kick at the cat, so in due course, if and when the bill
does come before the committee as now drafted, I will move
these amendments.
g

(1610)

I should point out that during the proceedings of the committee I became convinced that some other members feel as I
do. In view of this, it is only fair and right that the minister in
charge of the bill and the committee of the other place
considering it, as well as honourable senators, be aware of the
possible opposition to certain clauses as now drafted.
At the outset, let me assure honourable senators that the
amendments which I hope to move are not amendnients to
bring about drastic changes in the law; rather, they are
amendments to ensure that the law remains as it now is, under
the terms of which the banks have been operating with great
success and great profit.
1 et me explain. The first amendment relates to the limit on
mortgage lending by banks, which is dealt with in clauses 175

December 13, 1979

Deceber13, 979SENATE
DEBATES

and 192 of Bill C-14. The second relates to the exemption of
term deposits from reserve requirements, which is referred to
in clause 204.
While these two amendmenîs may at first glance appear 10
be unrelated, they arc, 1 think, two branches of the same tree.
Clauses 175 and 192 should be amended to provide that the
10 per cent limit imposed on banks be extended to and include
mortgage boans by the banks and their subsidiaries, which is
the present law. Clause 204 should be amended to provide that
the banks be required to maintain reserves on termn deposits
with the Bank of Canada, which they must now do under the
provisions of the present Bank Act.
Very briefly, some of the major considerations which have
been worrying some of the members of the commitîee are as
follows:
(1) It may well be that the chartered banks are taking over
100 large a share of the financial operations of the country and
the business community. It may well be that extending and
adding t0 the powers of the chartered banks will allow them ta
become too dominant in relation to other financial institutions
serving Canadians.
(2) Before the 1967 revision of the Bank Act, in general
terms a bank was prohibited from lending money on real
estate. 1 quote from the Second Edition of Falconbridge on
Banking and Bills of Exchange:
The object of this prohibition and, 10 a less degree, that
against engaging in trade or business or dealing in the
buying, selling or bartering of goods, is 10 prevent a bank
from locking up ils assets and to oblige it 10 keep them in
the form that renders themn most available.
In the 1967 Bank Act, the banks were given, for the first lime,
the power to lend on mortgages, subject to an overaîl limit of
10 per cent of their total deposit liabilities. Let me here point
out that the overaîl limit of 10 per cent did not apply 10 loans
made under the National Housing Act, the Farm Improvement Loans Act, and the Veterans' Business and Professional
Loans Act. A bank could boan money on morîgages under the
provisions of these acts in addition 10 the 10 per cent allowed
by the Bank Act. If the banks are given the right to have
mortgage boan subsidiary companies which can tend without
limit, ilwould seemn that thie draft bill would destroy the
effecîiveness of the 10 per cent limit contained in clause 175.
The provisions of the draft bill would permit the banks an
open-end "no limit" policy for mortgage loans. In these circumsîances, the question of the liquidity of the banks referred
10 by Falconbridge could become a malter of concern at some
point down the road. Possible concern on the malter of liquidity may also arise as a result of the draft bill releasing the
banks from maintaining reserves with the Bank of Canada in
respect of termn deposits.
My concern also arises from representations made t0 the
commitîee by the trust companies. These companies argue that
the unlimited right to lend on mortgages and the release from
the reserve requirement will do great harm 10 the share of the
financial and morîgage business which they now enjoy, with-

out any benefit 10 Canadians as a whole. In addition, the trust
companies carry on a very important general service 10
Canadians because of the fiduciary portion of their operations,
whereby they act as trustees, executors and general financial
agents and consultants.
When the bill does corne before the Senate, the question
may arise as 10 the abiliîy of the banks to compete with trust
companies and consumer boan companies. 1 have here some
figures showing earnings per share during the past 10 years
and the past five years for the five major banks, three trust
companies and three loan companies, which will clearly illustrate the ability of the banks 10 compete under the present
provisions of the Bank Act. 1 would ask the permission of
honourable senators to have these figures included in my
remarks aI this point.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

fully, and in a more convincing manner, their own views and
concernis.
Senator Connolly: Honourable senators, 1 will flot detain
you for more than a few minutes. As one of the group in the
committce who were impressed with the eoneernis expressed by
Senator Cook and other members, 1 think perhaps 1 should say
somcthing at this point.
If we have this important issue 10 eonsider when the bill
does eome before us, it will be due to the ingenuity of Senator
Cook. Perhaps that sbould flot surprise us very much. 1 am
told that anyone who eomes from Harbour G race has to have
ingenuity, or he doesn't survive. So, ingenuity is a way of life
for Senator Cook.
I do flot want 10 talk particularly about the question of
liquidity, for the simple reason that 1 think Senator Cook bas
expressed that concern adequately. The question arises about
the problems with which the trust compdnies arc faced should
the banks have such a wide ranging authority to lend on the
security of mortgages. As Senator Cook has pointed out, the
banks, before the 1967 revision of the Bank Act, were not able
to Iend on the security of mortgages. I understand that the
rationale f'or putting that provision into the Bank Act at that
time was 10 provide a more rcady availability of morîgage
funds in the country, and it was thought that the banks, with
their many thousands of branches, could do that.
But the limitation upon the banks 10 engage in that type of
business, as Senator Cook has said, was very strict. They were
to be restricted to 10 per cent of their deposit liabilities and
debentures. Wc thougbt that was the ceiling. Actually, it
turned out flot to bc the ceiling because Mvinisters of Finance
over the years authorizcd mortgage companties to be established by banks, and in fact this was donc for a limnited period.
But now the specifie provision is proposcd 10 be included in the
Bank Adt whercby, as Senator Cook bas said, banks can
neorporate. and cither wholly own or parîially own, morîgage
companies. and they can lend on the security of morîgages
with the guaranîce of banks wiîh uttcrly no lim-it t0 the
amount of moncy that they can put up.
This is flot an harangue against the banks. I want to refer îo
the last report of the comimittee on the predecessor bill, which
is 10 be found in the I)ehates of the .Senate of Thursday.
Nlarch 15, 1979, speccfically Appendix "D" of that report,
which shows that the banks do quite wcll in the morîgage field.
The banks did prctty well in the morîgage field beîwcen 1967,
when tbey first enîered if, and 1977, the lasI year for which
these figures were given.
* (1620)

In the first year the banks and morîgage affiliates loaned 10
the extent of $954 million, and in 1977 that amount had grown
to more than $ 14.896 billion. In 1977. the trust companies and
the morîgage companies wbich originally loancd $3.832 billion
n 1967, wcre loaning $18.794 billion. Tbcy were a littie ahead
of the banks.
Another portion of the table shows that in 1967, after one
ycar of' operation, the banks occupied 11.6 per cent of the
[Sena~tor Cwok.j

December 13, 1979

morîgage field in Canada, and in 1977 that share had grown
10 35.4 per cent. In 1967 the trust companies occupied 46.7 per
cent of the field, and in 1977 that share bad fallen 10 44.6 per
cent.
The significant increase in the banks' share of the morîgage
field in those 10 ycars. 1 îhink il is proper to report from the
commitîce, is a malter of great concern 10 the trust companies.
1 think that îhcy sec the competition becoming so ovcrwhelming that their business is going 10 be scriously affectcd.
Having said that. honourable senators, 1 tbink 1 should also
say that there may be a valid reason for the banks to have
unlimiîed authority 10 lcnd in the field of morîgages, but I
îhink the reserves of the banks, to preserve the liquidity of the
banks and our banking systcm, must be adequate, and Ibis
may be a ncw kind of game for the banks. In vicw of the fact
that the banks arc mbt the morîgage business, some ncw
systcm of reserves for this aspect of their business may have 10
be dcfined-may have 10 be discovercd, in fact.
One other tbing I want 10 say is that there may be a great
nccd in Canada for access to the banks' funds for morîgages 10
supply the housing requiremenîs of the country. This may be a
very saluîary provision. Wc do flot know, but we will find out
wbcn this bill comes before the Senate, and whcn it is referred
to the commitîc, whethcr the rationale for allowing the banks
10 go mbt the field of morîgage lending 10 the extent that is
now allowcd is a necessity for the devclopment of housing in
Ibis country. That will be a malter of goverfiment policy. and
that will bave 10 be explained. I do flot think any member of
tbe committce would wanî 10 resîriet the banks in the mortgage lending field if it was felt that the mnoney was requircd 10
provide bousing for the people of Canada, but 1 think evcry
member of the commitîce would say that if the banks are 10 bc
in Ibis morîgage field then it seems ridiculous 10 have one
clause saying that the banks are resîrictcd 10 10 per cent of
their deposit liabilities and debentures, and then another
clause saying that the banks can incorporate boan companies
under the provisions of the Loan Companies Act and ]end as
much as tbcy like, knowing pcrfcîly weIl that the banks will
guarantce the boans and the operations of those subsidiary
com pamnes.
So il is a malter of clcaring up, first of ail, the necd for the
availabiliîy of furîber morîgage money in the country from
bank sources, and, sccondly, the question of clearing up in the
minds of' the public the idea îhaî tbe banks are resîricted 10 10
per cent of their deposit liability. because that is flot a fact,
and you bave t0 be more than a Philadelphia lawyer, whicb
Senator Cook is, 10 discover Ibis anomaly in the legislation.
Senator Beaubien: Honourable senators, I apologize for
rising at Ibis laie hour, but there are a couple of things I want
10 say about the proposcd new Bank Act. The first is that since
1967 there bas been a tremendous change in the morîgage
market. N4ortgages wcrc usually sougbt for 20 10 30 ycars.
Over the period of 12 or 13 years since the prescrit Bank Act
was passed, morîgages have been issued on a tbrec-, four- or
five-year basis. That caused the life insurance companies 10
completely back out of the market, and somebody bad 10 filI

SENATE DEBATES

December 13, 1979

the gap. That was brought out by the Inspector General of
Banks very clearly. Therefore, the Inspector General of Banks
is greatly in favour of this new system. The banks are going to
be allowed to have more than 10 per cent of their deposits and
so on in mortgages, an amount they have never exceeded up to
now.
If they want to go into the mortgage field and occupy that
portion vacated by the life insurance companies, they are going
to have to form subsidiary companies. Why would this have
anything to do with the liquidity of the banks? If the banks are
going to put their money into something like that, who is going
to say it will hurt their liquidity? The banks are going to be
run as they have always been run, and they will have 10 per
cent of their assets in mortgages, and no more. If they want to
go into something else, then they will have to raise the capital
outside of their assets, and then set up companies which will
come under the Loan Companies Act. So this has nothing to
do with the liquidity of the banks.
* (1630)

Honourable senators, I did have another point I wanted to
make, but, as it escapes me at the moment, I will close my
remarks now.
Senator Mcliraith: Honourable senators, I notice that this
inquiry stands in the name of the Honourable Senator
Hayden. As he is not here at the moment I would ask
permission either to adjourn the debate in his name or to
adjourn it in my own name with the intention of giving him the
right to speak in my place when the matter next comes before
the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Mclîraith, P.C., seconded by the Honourable Senator
Connolly, P.C., that further debate on this inquiry be
adjourned to the next sitting of the Senate. Is it your pleasure,
honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
On motion of Senator McIlraith, debate adjourned.
THE CONSTITUTION
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Senator Stanbury, pursuant to notice of Tuesday, December

l1, 1979, moved:
That a special committee of the Senate, to be known as
the Special Committee of the Senate on the Constitution,
be appointed to consider and report upon the subject
matter of Bill C-60, intituled: "An Act to amend the
Constitution of Canada with respect to matters coming
within the legislative authority of the Parliament of
Canada, and to approve and authorize the taking of
measures necessary for the amendment of the Constitution with respect to certain other matters", of the Third
Session of the Thirtieth Parliament, or any matter relating thereto;

That the Committee have power to engage the services
of such counsel, technical advisers and staff and to incur
such special expenses as may be necessary for the purpose
of the inquiry;
That the Committee have power to send for persons,
papers and records, to examine witnesses, to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as rnay be ordered
by the Committee and to sit during adjournments of the
Senate; and
That the papers and evidence received and taken on the
subject in the Third and Fourth Sessions of the Thirtieth
Parliament be referred to the Committee.
He said: Honourable senators, I have just a few remarks to
make, if I am permitted.
Before proceeding with my remarks perhaps I may extend a
belated welcome to our colleagues who have joined us in this
chamber since the opening of the Thirty-first Parliament.
There is a veritable army of them, and I am pleased to see that
one of the problems of the Senate, which was discussed at
length by the Special Senate Committee on the Constitution in
the last Parliament, has been substantially redressed. We were
worried about there being too few people in the opposition. For
the time being that need not be a concern.
I also congratulate our long-time and highly respected colleagues, Senator Flynn and Senator Asselin, as well as our new
colleague, Senator de Cotret, upon their elevation to cabinet
rank. I appreciate that during Question Period that may seem
to be a mixed blessing, but I am sure that it is an experience
which any one of us would enjoy, and I wish them well in their
endeavours on behalf of our country.
I am sure that the wording of the motion that I have just
moved has caused some confusion in the minds of honourable
senators, since the necessary legal form of it requires us to
refer back to events and proposed legislation in the Thirtieth
Parliament. I hasten to assure honourable senators that there
is no intention of reviving Bill C-60; and, indeed, it is not the
expectation that the committee will, at least immediately,
enter into the massive task of revising the Constitution of
Canada.
The committee was established initially by the Senate for
the purpose of studying the subject matter of Bill C-60 of the
Thirtieth Parliament, and the committee proceeded to do just
that. Its first report was tabled in the Senate on Thursday,
October 19, 1978, and it dealt extensively with the subject
matter of that bill.
During the lengthy hearings leading up to the tabling of that
report the committee became increasingly aware of a great
vacuum of understanding of the role of the Senate on the part
of the public, academics and even legislators at the federal and
provincial levels. The committee was also well aware that there
were undoubtedly measures which might be taken to increase
the effectiveness of the Senate.
As a result the committee was reconstituted in the Fourth
Session of the Thirtieth Parliament and accepted as its priority
task a study of the Senate itself, its structure, its membership,

SENATE DEBATESDeebr3,17
ils jurisdiction, its responsibility to proteet regional and
minority interests and its relationship with legisiative bodies.
Extensive hearings and discussions were held, with the result
that when the Thirtieth Parliamient was dissolved the committee was in the process of preparing its second report. You wilI
notice that my motion calis for the papers and evidence
received and taken on the subjeet in the 3rd and 4th Sessions
of the Thirtieth Parliament to be referred to the committee. 1
believe that that wiIl mean a substantial economy in cost and
effort, and wiII permit the committee to move on toward the
tabling of a second report with reasonable dispatch.
I would ask ail] honourable senators to support this motion to
reconstitute the Special Committee of the Senate on the
Constitution.
Senator Smith (Colchester): 1 wonder, honourable senators,
if 1 might ask Senator Stanbury if he envisages that the
committee wilI be Iikely to do anything more than complete its

December 13, 1979

report. In other words, is it the hope or expectation that the
committee wilI continue taking evidence and embark on a
wider study than that which has been done so, far?
Senator Stanbury: Honourable senators, as you can sec, the
motion is broad enough to allow the committee to follow
whichever course it pleases. My understanding from discussions we have had concerning the matter is that at the present
time it is not the intention to proceed further than the discussion of matters relating to the Senate.
Whether either the steering committee, which wiII have to
be developed, or the committee itseif will feel that more
evidence and more discussion wilI be required before putting
together a report, 1 cannot say; but 1 do realize that there wilI
be many new senators on any such committee and that,
therefore, that must be recognized as a possibi!ity.
On motion of Senator Macdonald, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, December 18, at 2
p.M.

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF THE STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL FINANCE ON THE
ESTIMATES LAID BEFORE PARLIAMENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 1980

December 13, 1979
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance to
which the Estimates laid before Parliament for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1980, were referred, has in obedience to the
order of reference of Thursday, November 1, 1979, examined
the said Estimates and reports as follows:
INTRODUCTION
The Committee was authorized by the Senate, as recorded
in the Minutes of Proceedings of the Senate of November 1,
1979, "to examine and report upon the expenditures proposed
by the Estimates laid before Parliament for the fiscal year
ending 31st March, 1980".
In obedience to the foregoing, the Committee made a general examination of the Estimates and heard evidence from the
Honourable S. M. Stevens, President of the Treasury Board
and from the following officials of Treasury Board: Mr. J. L.
Manion, Secretary; Mr. L. J. O'Toole, Assistant Secretary,
Program Branch; Mr. E. A. Radburn, Director, Estimates
Division; Mr. E. R. Stimpson, Director, Expenditure Analysis
Division; and from the Economic Council of Canada: Dr.
Sylvia Ostry, Chairman; Dr. D. W. Slater, Director; Dr. R.
Lévesque, Director; Mr. H. Bert Waslander, Director, Project
Staff, Sixteenth Annual Review.
The Main Estimates for 1979-80 amount to $52,913 million.
Of this amount $50,768 million are for budgetary items and
$2,146 million are for non-budgetary items (loans, investments
and advances). These estimates are also divided into statutory
requirements amounting to $31,673 million and non-statutory
amounting to $21,240 million. Of the total Budgetary Estimates $20,382 million represents funds for which Parliament
is asked to provide new authority.
The Committee is continuing its examination of the Main
Estimates by reviewing the medium term economic outlook in
order to attain perspective on the implications of present
Estimates for future economic development and growth.
BASIC PROBLEMS IN REVIEWING THE ESTIMATES
1. Trend in Ratio of Statutory to Total Estimates
In fiscal year 1972/73, statutory payments represented 54%
of Budgetary Estimates. By fiscal year 1979/80 the proportion
had risen to almost 60%. In absolute amount, as well, statutory
expenditures increased substantially from $10.2 billion to
$30.3 billion and now exceed by 50 percent the total Budgetary Estimates of only 7 years ago of $19.0 billion (compared to
$50.7 billion in 1979-80).

For several departments statutory commitments exceed the
amounts to be voted. For example, although $1.143 billion is
to be voted for the Canada Employment and Immigration
Commission, statutory commitments amount to $2.32 billion.
For the Department of Health and Welfare, only $431 million
is to be voted as against $13.643 billion in statutory commitments. For the Department of Finance the comparable figures
are $168.1 million and $11.25 billion and for the Secretary of
State $328 million and $1.67 million.
Public Debt Payments
During the past decade payments on the public debt have
increased from 12.6 to 16.5 percent of the budgetary expenditures and now amount to $8.5 billion. They constitute the
second largest item of budgetary expenditure, exceeding the
combined payments for transportation and communications
(5.9%), culture (2.0%) general government (4.4%) and internal overhead (3.1%).
Comparing the growth of public debt with budgetary expenditure over time has been rendered less meaningful in recent
years by the increasing reliance on the tax system as a policy
lever, a practice generally known as tax expenditures. This
includes a variety of 'tax breaks' for business and individuals,
and yielding of 'tax points' to provinces. Tax expenditures have
grown rapidly during the past five years and amount to more
than payments on the public debt. The Committee is already
on record as being concerned with the fact that no systematic
parliamentary scrutiny of tax expenditures occurs. It welcomes
the initiative of the Minister of Finance in making public an
estimate of the cost of these tax expenditures.
2.

Decline in Economic Development and Support
The relative share of expenditure on economic development
and support declined from 13 to 10.9 percent during the
decade 1969-70 to 1979-80. During the first years of the
decade, the share rose so that the actual rate of decline in
recent years is understated.
3.

It is difficult to know how to interpret these figures. Economic development bas certainly been supported in certain
instances by tax expenditures, which have not been related to
actual expenditure. Moreover, direct expenditures for economic development may have also been partially replaced by loan
guarantees. For example, a $2 million item for liabilities under
the Small Businesses Loans Act appears to be in support of
economic development but would appear in the Estimates only
when guarantees must be honoured. Such changes in methods

of financing programs mnake il difficuit for thc Comm ittce Io
review the Estimiates and miake judgcrnents about the imiplications of overail shifts. As the President of the Trcasury Board
told the Commiittc in connection with tax expenditures,-..
whcn you arc trying I0 gel a handie on the rising expenditures,
you should kccp your eye on boîh sides.4.

Payrnents to Other Levels of Govcrnment
Payments to other levels of govcrnment have incrcased by
about $2.8 billion dollars in the past thrce years. In fact these
increases are understated by some 25%r, since thcy do flot
refleet decisions to yield tax points in lieu of expenditures,
complicaîing the task of rnaking comparisons over time.
5.

Validity of Expenditure Overvicw Guidelines
Iwas suggested 10 the Commiîtcc that improvement in the
monitoring of expenditure trends might bc achieved from the
use of thrce or four ratios which would refleet specîfic significant clements. The usefulncss of monitoring govcrnmenî expenditures by applying broad yardsticks such as, for example,
their ratio to gross national produci. was discusscd. Mr.
O'Toolc pointcd out that this ratio fails 10 reflect Changes in
approach such as sswitching from direct expenditures 10 tax

solved in this way is the comparison of paymenîs which are
quite different in nature such as transfer paymenîs 10 persons.

cautioncd the Commitîc that while the ratio information is
presented in the Federal Expenditure Plan, . ... the proccss

of îrying 10 allocate resources and carry out our functions, il
docs not enter int the science or art of resource allocation...
Thc Commitîce was also informcd that international coinpanisons such as expenditure dollars as a percent of gross
domcstic product or the ratio of public servants 10 total
emiployment are of' dubious value and possibly mnislcading as
guidelines 10 expenditure trends. For example, in the United
Kingdom employecs of the nationalized industries would bc
includcd in the governmenî total. In Canada or the United
States employces performing the same functions in the samie
industries would flot.

Lack of Policy Overvicw Information
The Commitîc requested information 10 assisî il in ils work

transfcrred by the federal governmcnî directly 10 persons by
various income groups and the total and net amounits transfcrred to groups which arc objecîs of governmient concern, c.g.

7.

Conclusion
The President of thc Treasury Board indicaîed that the
govcrnmenî had idenîified scrious problems in the expenditure
management process and was in the process of restrucîuring il.
The New Expenditure Management Systemi paper tabled by
the goverfiment in the House of Commons on 6 December
1979, identifies many deficiencies in the financial management
of public programs whieh this Comimitîce. unique as the only
parliamentary commitîce with responsibility for the entire
Estimates, faces whcn conducîing ils annual review of the
Main Estimiates.
When asked if he was content with the prescrnt mechanism
for parliamnentary scrutiny of the Estimates, the President of
the Treasury Board replied, -I am not satistied". He urged the
Commitîce in the course of ils nexî revîew of Main Estimates
10 give special attention to thc resource envelope sysîem of
expenditure management being inîroduccd by the governm-ent.
This suggestion could result in the Commnitîce having Io
consider tax expenditure information as well as the economnic
impact of regulations.
MONITORING IN4PLEMvENTATION 0F PROGRAM
TFRMS AND CONDITIONS
Responsibiliîy for mlonitoring esîablishcd programi guidefines, terms and conditions was the subject of' substantial
discussion, parîicularly in regard 10 the Indian Program
Activities of' the Deparîmient of Indian and Norîhern Affairs.
Comimitîce memibers cxpressed the view that such acîiviîy
should be the responsibility of the Treasury Board. M4r.
O'Toole replicd that, - ... rcly on the law and the regulawe
lions and assume that they are followed.- Hc then menîioncd
that the Compîroller Gencral. who reports 10 the President of
the Treasury Board, has functional rcsponsibility for this type
of comipliance audit. Primary rcsponsibility rcsts with the
internai audit units wîthin deparîmenîs and agencies and is
subject 10 review by the Auditor General.
Based upon a survey the Compîroller General has conducted
n twenty-one major departments, the quality of the work
performied by internai audit groups was rcportcd 10 bc very
uneven. In deparîmenîs where the work of the internaI audit
group was determined 10 bc inadequate, the Comiptroller General has or will reach agreement on a plan for improvement as
part of thc Improvcd Management Practices and Controls
(IMPAC) program.

Intergovernimental Agreements Objectives and Monitoring
In response 10 the question, "'Who is responsible 10 saîisfy
thernselves îhat the federal objectives bchind these programs
are achieved?-, the Treasury Board indicaîed that there was
considerable variation. In the case of the Established Prograins Financing Act, "the legislation governs- and monitoring
is clearly the rcsponsibility of sponsoring deparîments. In the
case of subsîdary agreements beîween the Deparîment of

December 13, 1979

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Regional Economic Expansion and a province, a management
committee, composed of representatives of both governments,
is responsible. Thus it appears that the chain of responsibility
from the Comptroller General through Internal Audit to the
Auditor General may not operate with the same degree of
assurance that it would in the case of a purely federal
program.
Effective monitoring rests upon clear statements of objectives, terms and conditions. Intergovernmental agreements
pose particular difficulties for monitoring because of their
negotiated nature. Clarity of objectives and precision in the
statements of terms and conditions may be compromised as
the price of agreement, according to Treasury Board officials.
Nevertheless the Committee considers that where the federal
government is contributing large sums of money to joint
programs, both the provinces and the federal government have
a responsibility to see that the objectives agreed to are actually
being achieved.
The Committee suggests, therefore, that the Treasury Board
provide a statement which outlines the major types of monitoring processes used in intergovernmental agreements. This
should include provisions for monitoring contained in an agreement, the actual mechanisms to be used as well as an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of provisions and mechanisms in practice. The Established Programs Financing Act
and subagreements within the Department of Regional Economic Expansion General Development Agreement Program
would be of particular interest to the Committee as cases in
point.
PETRO CANADA
Following substantial discussion of the financial outlook for
Petro Canada the Minister stated that he would provide the
Committee with certain financial information if the Committee felt that it would be helpful. Such information, in the view
of the Committee should include: the amount invested to date;
the value of loans and loan guarantees and letters of comfort,
if any; grants; current value of the assets and estimated cash
flow for the next ten years or until such time as the cash flow
is positive, and return on investment.
ACCOUNTSOFCANADA
The Minister expressed his concern that the accounts of
Canada do not quantify contingent liability in that letters of
comfort, such as the $350 million in letters of comfort to banks
on behalf of Canadair, are not specified, an amount which is,
proportionately, twice the $1.5 billion requested of the United
States government by Chrysler.
ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FINANCING ACT
The programs funded under this act, which include Medicare, Hospital Insurance and Post Secondary Education, were
formerly cost shared with the provinces. The advent of the

Established Programs Financing Act of 1977 changed the
means of financing from cost sharing of expenditures to a
combination of federal tax points transferred to the provinces
and cash contributions, the combined value of which is guaranteed not to fall below a specified amount. Thus if, as has
happened, the estimated value of the transferred tax points is
below the predicted value, the federal government must
increase its cash payments.
The Committee's attention was drawn to a legal aspect of
the Act with significant financial implications. Under the Act
the agreement cannot be re-opened unilaterally before March
31, 1983. Consequently the prospect of significant unplanned
for an uncontrollable cash expenditures exists for three more
fiscal years.
Treasury Board officials informed the Committee that at
the time the provisions incorporated into the Act were being
negotiated the economic assumptions made by the Department
of Finance regarding the potential value of the tax points to be
transferred were not reviewed by the Treasury Board. The
Committee was informed that it is not Treasury Board's
responsibility to do so in spite of the major financial implications involved. Nor is it their responsibility to do so for the
annual Estimates of the value of the tax points.
The President of the Treasury Board indicated that in
budgetary presentations, the government would provide four to
five year economic overviews " . .. which will show the trends

we are heading into if expenditure levels are not halted." Dr.
Ostry presented estimates of such trends to 1985 based on
present programs and anticipated economic developments over
the next five years. Dr. Ostry suggested that, "If the present
tax and transfer payment system, and the present federal
provincial fiscal arrangements continue, the federal government will continue to run a deficit in the order of $12 billion
year after year to 1985 . . . even if unemployment were to

decline to 5.5% . . . " Dr. Ostry concluded that the federal
government had "lost almost all of its room to manoeuver in
terms of stabilizing the national economy," and urged that a
number of steps be taken regarding government finance
including possible reformation of the Revenue Equalization
Program in light of the strains imposed by rapidly rising
energy prices, and a re-evaluation of the Established Prograis FinancingAct as soon as possible. This latter suggestion
was also made by the President of the Treasury Board. The
preliminary reaction of the Committee is that such evaluations
would be desirable, and the Committee will be considering
these problems as part of its ongoing examination of the
progress of the economy into the medium term future.
Respectfully submitted,
D.D. Everett,
Chairman.
