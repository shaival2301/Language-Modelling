At three o'clock Hia Excellency the

i'is Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased ta opea the
Fourth Session of the Sixteenth Parliament
of the Dominion of, Canada with the following
Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It affords me much pleasure fto greet you at
the commencement of another session of parliament, and to be able to congratulate you upon
the continued prosperity of the country. The
year 1929 was the most productive year in the
history of Canada. In industries% other than
agriculture, employment reached the highest
point on record; new construction was the
largest known.
Mining production was of
unequalled value. Manufacturing production
surpassed all previous records. There was vast
increase in the development of hydro-electrie
power. The products of our fields and our herds
reached higher standards of excellence and
The
quality than at any previcus time.

Dominion is already recoverig frm the seasonal slackness evident at the end cf the year,
and it is not .to be forgotten that the bulk of
the 1929 wheat trop still remains in Canadian
hands for final disposition.
Our trade with foreign countries has shown
marked increase. During the year additional
Trade Commissioners' offices have been opened
in several counitries, and additional steamship
services inaugurated 'to Australia and South
America. Tenders have been called for proposed extensions of steamship services to India
and British East Africa.
Our two railway systema have carried out
extensive construction and development plans,
and are contemplating further construction
and developments. The final section of the
Hudson Bay Railway has been completed.
The construction of the Welland Ship Canal
is now nearing completion. On the opening
of the new oanal the Upper Lake grain carriers
will be able to reach Lake Ontario and Upper
St. Lawrence ports. The work of providing
suitable terminais is proceeding.
Legislation will be introduced respecting the
several railway properties formerly privately
owned and now embraced in the Canadian
National Railway System.
For some time past my Ministers have been
giving special attention to those problems
which, for many years, have been a source of
coptroversy between the provinces of Canada
and the Dominion. Among matters of concer
have been centain economic and financial
readjustments
deemed
by the
provinces
essential to their being placed in a position
cf equality one with the other. To a greater
or lesser extent, problems have arisen with
respect to all the provinces of Canada. Those
of the Maritime Provinces were investigated by
the Royal Commission on Maritime Olaims and
have been in large part solved by the effect
given to the recommendations of that body.
Consideration is at present being given ta the
final revision of the financial arrangements
oontemplated by the Conmiseion's report.
The provinces of Manitoba, Saskatehewan and
Alberta have negotiated for many years with
the Government of Canada for the return of
their natural resources. The Province of British
Columbia has sought the restoration to the
province of lands comprising what is known as
the railway belt and Peace River block. With
the Provinces of Manitoba and Alberta and with
the Province of British Columbia agreements
have been relached, whâoh wili be submitted
to you for approva*l. An offer similar in
character and terms to that accepted by Alberta
has been made to Saskatchewan with respect
to the transfer to that province of its naturel
resonurces.

The Provinces of Ontario and Quebec have

having become apparent, through a reference
canto the Supreme Court, that this question
not readily be settled by judicial determination, a solu-tion has been sought by ceonference
which it is hoped will lead to a satisfactory
settilement of this highly controversial problem.
My Ministere have also been making careful
inquiry into the workings of the provisions and
administration of the Pensions Act with a
view ito ascertaining vhat, in the light of past
and present e'cperiences, may be necessary to
ensure full effect being given to the purpose of
Parliament in that enactment. As a result

dependents.

is career
was an extremely striking ane. He came from
the littie English patch in the Province of
Quebec, whichbhas furnisbed sa many disting-uished men ta Parliament and to commerce and industry in this country. Sir
Edward Kemp was anc of tbe very successfui men recruited fram that littie settiement.
Individualiy I am greatly indebted ta bim for
bis readiness at alil times ta give counsel to
a junior like myseif, particularly in matters
of trade, commerce and finance, in wbich be
was peculiariy capable of giving advice.
In spite of the demands of a succcssful
career he was kindliness itscîf. Perhaps no
other man in public life in Canada had a
kinder beart or was mare williag ta extend
a helping band ta, relieve those in distress.
I kaaw of many occasians wben he exercised
this kindiy spirit, but wbat 1 kaaw is only
a tithe of the many kindnesscs that he perfarmcd.
Hie will be very much missed on tbis side
of tbe flouse. The party ta whicb I have
the honour ta belong will miss bim. While
bis attachment te bis party had not weakened,
he bad ceased ta be a very keen partisan and
always displayed a rcadiaess ta approacb
matters
in a p.ubic-spirited way.
We
esteemed bis couasel, at ail times, for bis wide
experience made it invaluable in aur endeavour ta legislate in the best intercsts of
the country.
I bad know~n the late Dr. Reid personally
for a langer period tban I bad known Sir
Edwa.rd Kemup, but after eoming ta this flouse
1 was not tbrowri into, such close conthet witb
him. The striking events uf Dr. Reid's career

but the late Senator R{eid did ail that it was

As ta tbe late Hon. Mr. Laflamme, I bad
very littie oppartunity of becoming intimately

first time I met bim. It wvas in tbe city of
Winnipeg, at a meeting (yf tbe Carsadian Bar

Sa we called on Mr. Laflamme and pazsed

a laxvyer, that tbroungh bis d'eath this House
bas smffercd a real loss.
Hax ing a pride in
my profession, I ain very eager ta sec aur
ranks recruited fromn time ta time from the
bcst legal talent in tbe otbcr flouse. Mr.

5

FEBRUARY 25, 1930
other members of the Senate acquiesce in
what they say. But in this case I feel thankful for the suggestion that I should say a
word or two.
I do not intend to enter into the records of
these four gentlemen, for that has been pretty
thoroughly done by the honourable leader of
the Government and the honourable leader of
the Opposition; but on the ground of personal friendship and intimate collaboration,
especially with two of those gentlemen, I am
moved to say a word. They were amongst
lny older colleagues, and since I have been
engaged in public affairs they have been very
close and intimate in the way of counsel and
co-operative work.
There are different kinds of tics that bind
us together in friendship. The ties that bind
public men together are closer among those
who belong to the same side of politics, but
extending beyond the bounds of party politics
there is a sort of Freemasonry-shall I call it?
-- which unites all public men who are working for their country along their different lines
of light and guiding. From my experience of
public ilife-and I have had a rather long
experience in that respect-I am happy to
add my testimony, if testimony is necessary,
of the strong conviction,. which I have no
doubt I share with many others, that, public
men according to their lights are moved by
a spirit of love and self-denying service for
their country. The bonds of intimate personal friendship are not overlaid, but strengthnled and extended by the work that public
men undertake in cemmon for the larger and
less selfish interests of country, of empire, and
of humanity.
It is in thinking over the long years we
have spent: together that just at, this moment
I havé a sense, of personal loss, and in-expressing that sense of loss I find a response in
the hearts of many men on both sides of this
Chamber, whether one or: another stripe of
politics binds them together. We think of
our old friends. and miss them. One can
almost hear the sound of their voices in this
Chamber. One can shut one's eyes and almost see the familiar faces, glowing with
friendship; can. feel the impulse and emotion
of kindly thought, which, passing beyond the
limita of party, distributes itself generally
amongst. confreres and companions in the work
of public life
A ceremony like this, if we may call it a
ceremony, brings thoughts to us al of the
swiftness with which life passes, and of the
certainty that an end shal.1 come sooner or
later. To those that are left it brings a
reminder of their duty to take up the torch

that lights the path that our young nation is
travelling. Canada will have a greater and
more prosperous future if we who remain
bear the torch as it should be borne, with our
sense of responsibility increasing as those who
are companions along a part of the way slip
off in the dusk and leave us for ever.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. Henry H. HORSEY moved:
That the following Address be presented to
His Excellency the Governor General to offer
the humble thanks of this House to His Exeellency for the gracious Speech which he has
been pleased to make to both Houses of Parliament; namely:-To His Excellency the Right. Honourable
Viscount Willingdon; Knight Grand Commander of the Moet Exalted Order of the
Star of India, Kniglit Grand Cross of the
Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael
and Saint George, Knight Grand Commander of the Most· Eminent Order of the Indian Empire,- Knight Grand Cross of the
Most Excellent Order of the Britioh Empire, Governor Géneral and Commander-in
Chief of the Dominion of Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate. of. Canada; in Parliament
assembled, beg leave te offer'our humble thanks
to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech
which Your Excellency bas addressed te both
Houses of Parliament.
He said: Honourable members, let me at
once thank the honourable leader of the
Governmsent for giving me the privilege of
moving the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Thoie.
lTie Speech itself, it. seems to me, can be
fairly well divided under two or three major
headings. The opening. paragraplis deal with
oanada as a whole, her oStinued proesperity,
lier production and development. Under the
second heading corne several paragraphs dealing with the various provinces of the Dominion,. and with the Dominion's relations to
those proyinces. - Then follows a very important pamagraph indeed, referring to soldiers'
pensions. Lastly,. undier anotber heading,
might be put the very important reports and
other matters which will eventually come before Padiamént for our cansideration, but
which I think can be betteir dealt with when
they come epecificalily and in detail before
us.
With your permission I should like to
comment very briefly on a few of the mat-

6

SENATE

ters under the first heading, with regard to
Canada, its future, and its continued prosperity. The Speech itseif makes a nunmiber of
statements that I think go fer to uphold that
particular condition of prosperity. One statement is that 1929 was the greatest year for
Canada in the matter of production. Well,
if Can3da produced totally more wealth in
1929 than in any other year in its 'history,
surely that is one test of continuing prosperity.
Then the Speech goes on to state that
records have been made in the output of
manufacturing products and in the value of
mining output. It refers also to the great
increase in the development of hydro-electrie
power and in the floreign trade of the country.
It seems to me that these things are a good
enough guarantee to uphold the statement that
the country is continuing in its prosperity. If
more were needed, and if time permitted, I
could make quotiations from tihe presidential
addresses of practicady every president of
every chartered bank in Canada, and from the
reports of trust and loan companies, insurance
companies, and many industrial concerns.
If that is so, it means that not only are profits
being made for sharehiolders and direotors in
large marnfacturing corporations, and for
policy-holders in insurance companies, but also
that there must be a tremendous amount of
labour and a very large circulation of money
in bthe
country.
We ail know that during the last two or
three years the foreign trade of Canada has
grown and increased to such an extent that
our country has been raised from a comparatively low mting in this regard to one very
much higher, and in some features she ranks
abead cf alil other nations in the world in
proportion to population.
It is true that the Speech from the Throne
declares that soîme slowing up ocourred in
the increase of prosperity during the last
month or two of 1929, due to seasonal slackness and the withholding of some 200,000,000
bushels of wheat, by the wheat pools and
grain merchants generally, I presume. But
honourable gentlemen aIl know that this
wheat must eventually be marketed, that we
are now within a month or so of spring time,
when the seasoal slackness must pass away,
and that with bhe coming of spring tremendous
development will commence along railway and
other construction lines, and our people will
be engaged in developing their natural resources. So we shall very shortly hear again
the aeeleratetd or the louder 'buzz of industry
throughout the length and breadth of the
country and Canada wil1 leap once more into
its stride for furbher and greater progress and
prosperity.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY.

Nobody would dream that to the Administration belonged all the credit for this wonderful showing. We all know that many factors
enter into the account. Our vast, varied and
rich resources, the energy, industry and skill
of our people applied to these, the direction
and action of the Government, and in a sense
over all, with all depending on it, an overruling Providence, have brought this to pass.
But I think we must all concede that the
Government should have a reasonable amount
of credit for these results.
Take for example one department, that of
Trade and Commerce, and see what the
Government has donc in this connection.
It has established commercial intelligence
offices in a large number of countries; since
1922 fifty per cent more such offices have
been opened. They have more than doubled
their personnel, and they have improved its
quality to some extent. In every case where
one of those additional offices has been
opened, live university men have been
selected for appointment, after passing strict
examinations. Valuable knowledge has come
to our exporters through those men, who have
put our exporters into touch with the importers of those countries, and Canada bas
had an increased trade in every country where
new offices have been opened.
The Government has also inaugurated
steamship services with a considerable number of countries, paying small bonuses in this
regard, and Canada's trade bas been increased
with every country with which a transportation service of this kind bas been established.
The Government has also negotiated trade
treaties with a large number of countries, not
only those connected with the Empire, but
alse foreign countries, and in every case our
trade with such countries bas been largely
developed.
I have touched on only some features of
one department, but I believe it could be
shown that every department of the Government has helped, both directly and indirectly, towards the aggregate results in this
continued prosperity.
We might now turn to the second heading
that I have mentioned, dealing with matters
in regard to the various provinces. I will
read the first paragraph, referring to the
financial arrangements that are under way in
connection with the Maritime Provinces.
For so.me time past my Ministers have been
giving special attention to those problems which
for many years have been a source of controversy between the provinces of Canada and the
Dominion. Among matters of concern have been
certain economic and financial readjustments
deemed by the provinces essential to their
being placed in a position of equality one with

FEBRUARY 25, 19307
the other. To a greater or lesser extent,
problenis have arisen with respect ta ail the
provinces of Canada. Those oif the Maritime
Provinces were investigated by the Royal Commission on Maritime Claie aaid have been in
large part solved by the effect given ta the recommendations of that body. Consideration is at
prescrit being given ta the final revieinn of the
financial arrangements contemnplated by the
Comnnission'a report.
This paragrapli I take ta mean thst tihe
Government, through the Finance Department,
is at present assessing and accounting in order
ta determîne the proper sum to be paid as
a permanent subsidy ta the Maritime Provinces. When that has been dane those provinces will be put on a parity with the other
provinces, and in this way effect will be given
ta another recommendation of the Duncan
Report. The paragrapli also says that most of
the recommendations in that repart have
already heen carried out. That is sa. I shal
mention sanie of the thinga that the Commission recommended and that have been donc.
The ports of Saint John and Halifax have been
nationalized. In this work the Government
has expended fromn five ta ten million dollars
in equipment and improvements. Freiglit rates
bave been lowered twenty iper cent, not only
on the Canadian National Rai1lways but on
the Canadian Pacific Railway and on a14 the
branci lines in the Atlantic district. It is
calculated that this bas already resulted in
a saving of some tliree and one-half million
dollars ta the people of the Maritime Provinces. I understand that the railways of
Prince Edward Island are being clianged, over
to standard gauge. Improvements are being
made ta the harbour at Charlottetown, whereby the people of Prince Ediward Island will
Ie able ta slip tiheir products abroad, with
greater facility; and a second ferry will be
provided for service between the Island and
the mainland. Honourable senators will see
that all the major recommfendatione cf the
report have been, or are in process of being,
carried out. Suggestions thet have not yet
been adopted are still under consideration, and
doubtîcas sanie of them will be given effeet in
due course.
The next paragrapli of the Speech <rom the
Throne readis:
The provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchiewan
and Alberta have negabiated. for many years
with the Governuient of Canadla for the return
oif their natural resources. The Province of
British Columbhia hms souglit the reetoration to
the province of lands coxuprising what is known
as the railway belt and Peace River block. With
the Provinces of Manitoba and Alberta and
with the Province of British Columbia agreemnents -have been reathed, which will ie submitted ta you for approval. An offer uimular in

character and termes t;o that aecepted by Alberta
bae beenmiade ta Saskatchewan with respect ta
the transfer ta that province of ite natural resources.
'It seerns ta me, honaurable senators, that
the Government deserves ta be commended
and complimented for so efficien'tly solving
these western problems. An agreement lias
not yet been reaohed wàth Saskatchewan, but
the Government has made an offer ta that
province along the linos of the arrangement
made with Alberta.
As the paragraph points out, agreements
have been arrived at with Alberta, Manitoba
and British Columibia, terminating contraversies that have baffied. successive administrations for twenty years ar more. When
the necemary legisiation ham been adopted,
Conifederation will be rounded out, for the
Western Provinces wiil have contrai and
authority over their lands and natural resources in accardiance with similar powers of
the other provinces.
The next and last paragraph dealing with
the provinces is sa f ollows:
The Provinces of Ontario and Quebec have
been cancerned over the question of water
powers in their relation ta navigation. It having
become apparent, through a reference ta the
Suprenie Court, that this question eannot readily
be eettled by judicial determination, a solution
has been 9ouglit by canference which it in hoped
will lead ta -a satisfaetory settlemnent of this
highly controversial problem.
A conference already lia been held between representatives of these two provinces
and of the Dominion Government, and, although the Supreme Court decision did, not
deal with the question effect.ively, it is expected that the negotiations that ste proceeding wfll lead to a satisfactory- conclusion of
the complicated, dispute as ta -the awnership
of water-po'wers in navigable streams.
I feel that the Government, because cd the
course pursued. and the resurlte aohie'ved -in all
these negotiations relating ta the provinces,
bas turned cantroversy and discord in the East
and the West into harznony, contentaient and
happiness, and by so doing has made a tremendous contiribution ta nationial unity.
I had thouglit of saying somath-ing about
the reference in the next paragrapli to the
Pensions Act, but 1 will refrain.
In conclusion, I wisli to draw the attention
,of honourable members ta the unique and

b

and her own merits, realize rWhat a splendid
appointment it is. I believe the Seniate of
Canada is to be congratulated on this appointment, and perhaps honourable gentlemen will
allow me to express my sentiments on their
behalif by congratulating ber and welcoming
ber to this august Chamber.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON (translation):
Honourable gentlemen, it is not by my own
will that I am here. My impression is rather
that I am among you because my services
have been requisitioned. Needless to say, I
have not souglit this great honour of representing Canadian women in the Upper House.
To the Government that has called me I
return my sincere thanks. May I also, on
behalf of the women of Canada, express my
profound gratitude to the Government for
having facilitated the admission of women to
the Senate by referring to the courts the question of their right to membership.
I cannot forget the valiant part that has
been taken by those women who have carried
our case even to His Majesty's Privy Council.
Canadian women owe a debt of gratitude for
their success to those determined women who
so fortunately intervened in the discussion,
and whose names I have the honour to mentien: Judge Emily F. Murphy, Mesdames
Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung,
Louise McKinney, and Irene Parlby.
I have always been interested in public
affairs, for I was brought up in an atmosphere
in which politics were the chief source of
conversation and the great concern of all.
Being a firm believer in the doctrines of
Gladstone, Edward Blake, and Laurier, it was
quite natural that I should give my support to
a cause that was dear to me, without, however,
forgetting my domestic duties. I say this because I desire to remove the misapprebension
that a woman cannot engage in public affairs
without deserting the home and neglecting the
duties that motherhood imposes upon ber.
Sometimes I am amused to hear this argument
on the lips of certain fathers 'who are utterly
indifferent to the upbringing of their sons and
leave that solemn obligation, to the mother
alone.
A man is supposed to devote his time to the
material needs of his family. No one disputes
his right to participate in public affairs. But
does such activity relieve him of his duties
towards his children? Yet we constantly hear
mothers complain of the huband's indifference
about the supervision and guidanoe of his sons.
I trust the future will show that while engaged in public affairs, the woman, the mother
of a family, by reason of ber maternal instinct
and ber sense of responsibility, will remain
the faithful guardian of the home.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY.

I deem it a high privilege to address you
in French. It is the language of the province
in which I was born and grew up. I cherish
tender recollections of my native province,
the old French province of Quebec, where it
is good to live, because of the broad spirit of
tolerance that animnates its people. In this
connection I recall a thought that the bonourable leader of the Government in this House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) expressed at the
Assembly of the League of Nations in Geneva.
Speaking of the problem of minorities in
Europe, lie asked that they be treated not
merely with justice, but with generosity. "Let
us deal with them," lie said, "in such a way
as to make them forget that they are minorities." I avail myself of this opportunity
to declare with pride that the English and
Protestant minority in Quebec has never been
made to feel itself a minority in that province.
I desire to pay this tribute to my native province and cite it as an example for the whole
of Canada.
I shall not discuss to-day the various questions mentioned in the Speech frem the
Throne. With my honourable colleagues I
shall consider them when they are submitted
to us in the course of the session.
(Text) Honourable gentlemen, it was my
wish to enter this Upper House as unobtrusively as possible, but this privilege has unfortunately been denied me. Women have
corne so recently into public life that promotion has been almost too rapid. In my own
case I feel the lack of preliminary training,
but hope during this coming session to show
you that I am at least able to listen and, I
trust, to learn.
In the first place, I shoud like to -thank
the Government for the honour conferred
upon me in naming me as the representative
of the women of Canada in this House, and
to thank the honourable senators for the
cordiality of their reception. It has aliways
seemed to me that I might find written above
the door the antithesis of Tennyson's line,
"Let no man enter in on pain of death."

I owe my appointment to the bravery of the
five pioneer women from the Province of
Aliberta who took the plea fer the admission
of women to the Senate to the highest court,
His Majesty's Privy Council: they are, Judge
Emily F. Murphy, Mesdames Nellie F. McClung, Louise C. McKinney, Henrietta Muir
Edwards and Irene Parlby. To them I tender my thanks.
In our criticism of the entry of women into
public life we are apt to forget that four
thousand years ago Deborah judged Israel;
and although wcmen have made great strides
since then, not one of us aspires to such a

viewpoints of the two provinces than those
wlio have lived, in only one. Since my ohildhood I have always been interested in public
affairs, and I cannot remember the time when
I did not regard the nome of Gladstone with
veneration.
While women's work is essential to civilization, it does not give much, opportuniity for
the study of politicad development, but with
the vote our reponsbilities have increased.
It is now our diuty to f amiliarize ourselves

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable

that under the circumstances this decision
is a wise one. I know how difficult it would
be to secure the attendance of representatives
from the various Dominions-presumably the
only ones that would attend outside of those
from Britain-if the Conference were held
here in Ottawa, because the other Dominions
as well as our own would want to be represented at the Imperial Conference in London,
and to attend both conferences, one in England and one in Canada, would be a very
serious encroachment on the time of public
men holding office for the time being in the
various Dominions in which they reside. For
some of the Dominions access to the Old
Country, in point of time, is undoubtedly
easier than to Canada. Individually I make
no complaint. As both conferences are being
held in the same year, I think the solution

I do not suppose that anything like that is
likely to recur.
The Speech from the Throne has a reference to a very, very important topie that has
engaged the consideration of public men in
Canada for a long time indeed-the question
of returning to the Prairie Provinces their
natural resources. It is intimated that settlements have already been found in the cases
of Manitoba and Alberta. We know that a
commission sat for Manitoba, and I had the
pleasure of reading their report. I understand
that the Province of Alberta is ready to
accept, so far as applicable to it, the conclusions that were arrived at by that commission.
Then we have the Province of Saskatchewan
left. I do not know absolutely whether the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

FEBRUARY 26, 1930
Many of tihose areas have since been. devoted
to ordlinary fiusbandry. Perhaips the fart that
the areas in Saskatchewan were more suitable
for immnediate deveiopment as f arm lands,
once the raii'ways were constructed, was the
reason why those areas seemed at that tirne
more attractive as subsidies to railrway builders
than lande in Alberta or Manitoba.
Another faetor in this matter ie that fortunateiy the Province of Alberta is magnificentiy
eýndowed with minerais and bas also a conThough
siderable amount of water-power.
that water-power is partly ln the park country
at present, I suppose arrangements wili he
made that it wili ail be avaulable for that
province. The Province of Manitoba, while
not containing coal in any remarkable quantity, as far as I icnow, le wondexluly endiowed
with water-power, wbicb has been deveioped
for years past. With chesip access to, the
power, Winnipeg je now becoming, and is
bound to be in the near future, a great in-~
dustri al centre. In the Province of Saakatchewan we have no water-power at present, and
an.y amal portion that may ever be devekoped
away off in the Churchill River is too distant
for economic transmission to the central or
southern portion of that province.
It wiil be seen from wbat 1Ihave said thst
the conditions in Saskatchbewan are not the
,samne as tihose in Alberta and Manitoba, anxd
f or econornic reasons, spart fromn sny other,
Saskatchewan might very properiy refuse an
offer that the other two provinces would be
glad to accept. It le true bat Saskatchewan
hopes for minerai development of the preCaxnbr'ian area, whicb runs through the northeaetern portion of that province. Manitoba
contains some of that area. I du not know
tihat Alberta hias any of that particular one,
but it bas very great mineral deveopment in
prospect, and bas, imnmediately availale, considerable resources fromn royalties on coal,
from the poesibility of water-power deveiopment, from ranoh lande and drom tirnber limita.
We in the Province of Saskatcbewan can hope
for practicaliy no immediate revenue from
the turning over to us of the publie lands.
The Province of Manito~ba, as the owner of
water-powers, can derive considerabie revenue
not oniy tbrougb the private development of
them, but probabiy also through development
by thé Province of Manitoba itself, and that
revenue is bound to increase with the industrialization of tbe provinoe. So I believe that
the Province of Saskatcbewan might weii say
that what wouid be suitable and agreeahle to
either of bier sister provinces would flot be
We
equally suitabie and agreeable to ber.
ishould have at present no such revenues for
carrying on provincial affaire as tbey would
enioy.

il

Speaking for myself, I have long entertained
the opinion that we have an absolute rightthis ie flot the time to, dieuse it in detail-a
right to -an accounting from 1870. Ilf it be true
that in 1870 it was conternpinted, that the
Hudson Bay Territory and the Northwest
Territorieis wouild enter Confederation, the
Dominion Government should give such an accounting to the western provinces, particularly
Saskatchewan anid Alberta. 1 tbink the question cannot be settiled by mutual arrangement
between the Governments and we shaUl have
to go to the final court, the Privy Oouncil. If
that court decides that the Dominion Government hed et any time, s right to alienate our
lande, we rnust abide by the dSeision, for we
shall have lo8t. But speaking as an individual,
without having consulted witb the Government of Saskatchewan on tihat aspect, I @hall
not be content until that right is either recognized or held not; to exist, and that by a
judgrnent of the ultimate court of the British
Empire.
We have in the Speech from the Throne
an allusion to the Pensions Art anid the system
that the Governent proposes to put into
force. I regret thiat that system was flot
adapted 'frorn the very beginning. Under the
present systemr, if a man was consoripted and
was passed by a medical doctor as fit for
service, and later was inivalidied home, and it
was shown that hie disalhility was due to
something prior to hie conscription, hie le out of
iuck. What le promised now, and what I tbink
sbould always have been the practice, le that
the medical record made of the man when he
was finally passed and became a soldier will be
taken into consideration, and if subsequently
a disahility developed it will be considered
to be properly attributable to the war. TIf a
main was wounded, there was no difflculty;
but frequently a main was affected, psychologicalIy and the resulte did not becorne apparent
for yeare. This is flot a psarty matter and I
arn not discussing it in a party sense. I think
all parties have been generous witb the soldiers. The leaders on aid aides have realized
their duty towards the soidiers and have tried
to do the right thing by thern. Nevertheless,
most men in public tif e and many in private
life have had ex-soldiers corne to tbem, stating that their olaime had been rejected on thbe
groutnd that their disability was due to prewar causes. This BIl will rectify that condition, and will do a justice that I think we
ail agree ebouid be done.
The next topie to wbicb I shail ref or has
the aippointment of women to
reference Vbo
the Senate. I have aiready congratuiated thbe
seconder of -the Address on the very admirable
speech that she made to the House in both
French and Engiish. The a.ppointment of a

12

woman to this Chamber is a new departure.
Individuaiiy I have grave doubts that such a
contingency was foreseen by the Fathers of
Confedieration.
I read the report of our
Supreme Court on the subject--in fact, I
attended the court during the argument, for
it was a very interesting subject-and the
judges were unanim.ous in their opinion, and
though they failed to convince the Privy
Coiencil, they convinced me.
It has been
wittily said of the Privy Council that it is
the court of the last guess, and while I do
not say that by way of reflection, the surprise
that some of its judgments have caused
would seem to bear that out. Take for instance its decision in the NewfoundlandLabrador case. Many people tbought our own
Supreme Court was correct in its judgment
when it decided that under the Act a woman
was not a person. I would not dare to call
a woman a person anyway. The question
was rather whether she was an eligible person.
The matter has nvow been settled, and I think
the people of Canada as a whole are very well
satisfied that it has been settled as it has been.
There are in this House and the other House
many spheres of activuty in which a woman's
knowledge and experience enable ber to make
valuable contributions. It is rather remarkable that a daughter of Quobec, a province
that denies its women the right to vote in
provincial affairs, should be the first wo-man
to have the honour of a seat in this House.

A great deal is said in the Speech from
the Throne about the prosperity of the
country. It is true that for two or three
vears there was perhaps a certain abnormal
prosperity, the causes of which I am not going to attompt to analyze to-day.
Undoubtedly the enormous expenditure on the
developient of our mineral resources was one
of the nost striking causes; or perhaps I
should say the expenditure upon the search
for minerals all over Canada. There was a
very marked development also in certain
other linos, particularly in the pulp industry.
Tlhat bas been so marked that it bas been
necessary to combine and unify some companies that were perhaps a little overextended, and to curtail production. On the
whole there bas been a great deal of industrial expansion during the past three or four
years. Particular emphasis is laid upon building construction. This line of endeavour certainly -has been very active throughout Canada. Unfortunately. I regret to state, building construction in Western Canada bas come
to an absolute standstill. I have been in the
West for thirty years, and in my exp'erience
we have never had as bad times as we are
experiencing at present. The city of Winnipeg has been suffering froi
a depression.
This is due to some extent, and perhaps
mainly, to the agricultural problein. In the
Province of Saskatchewan we had the worst
crop failure in thirty years, and it extended
over a very wide area. This could not but be

FEBRUARY 26, 1930
reflected in the general conditions of the
province. Construction in same of the newer
places bas ceased, and in the cities and towns
on the Prairies, and in sorne of the villages,
there is a great deal of unemployment, and
public relief stations have been established,
and I fear the end is not yet.
Fortunately there were average crops in certain areas in the provinces of Manitoba and
Saskatchewan, but I could take you over an
area extending frorn thirty miles nortli of
Moose Jaw ta the American boundary, and
,extending perhaps a liundred miles east and
west, where there was an almost complete
failure'. This condition must be refiected iii
the trade of the country. It lias been very
disastrous ta the farmers, and lias had its
effect on the earnings of the railways, and on
bank clearings, as well as other forms of
business activity. Althougli the railways sometimes say that they are quite independent of
the farmer and the earnings on the grain
hauled-and, we admit that the rate is very
favourable-stili their 'wlole equipiment is designeil and prepared for the hauling of the
grain. At the present time that equiprnent is
lying idle and great numbers of men have
been laid off, particularly by the C.P.R.; ta
which fia man can abWet, because t~he work
is not there ta be done. Thus there is
brouglit about a very deplorable condition.
Some people say that the Pool is largely respon.sible. I arn not a member of the Pool,
nor arn I speaking-on its behalf bere, but in
my "opinion it is daing anuch ta develop coamong the
ordination and co-operation
farmers ýof the West. It may be that the
Pool did not have the power in the world
markets that :it was lioped it would have.
Orderly marketing is:a proper slogan for the
Pool, but it-may be thàt its members have
been unwise. -I arn not eriticizing tliem at
ahl, but they may hiave overlield in tlieir
eagernes-s ta reap a higlier price in the warld
market than was warranted; and no doubt
tliey have been met by the opposition'of
those who wislied to put them out of business.
My observation of the Pool is tihat it bas
developed a. spirit of satisfaction that did
'not exist before ini many parts of the West.
As a westerner I sliould be extremely sorry
ta think that the farmers were exploiting the
idea that the hand of the manufacturer, the
industrialist, the financier-the hand of everyone was against them. I do flot believe that
is so. I think we all prosper or eink together. I think the sucoess of the farrning
industry is linked up closely witli the industrial if e of Canada. Their intjerests have
grown too large, there is toco muci -money at
,stake, they produce too large a volume of

13

produce for shipment, for any company or
bank or financial institution in Canada to
overlook them as a material and important
factor in the production of wealth in this
country. Mr. Crerar's naine is connected
with a rival concern. I ar n ot criticizing
that. So far as I know, it is doing its work
admirably. It is simply a company of farmers
and lan-downers in the West organized to
enable them to seli their grain wherever tliey
wish, and because I own a small tract of land
I arn a member of Mr. Crerar's company.
As you kn.ow, in the Pool you are obligated
under your contract for five years to seli it
ail your grain and flot bootleg any elsewhere.
That is an ientirely different form of contract.
1 do believe the Pool has moderated the
opinion of people in the West that the people
of the East are trying to exploit them. I
do not think the East has any such abject
in view, and I thin-k the Pool, with its opportunity for propaganda and instruction, lias a
peculiarly good chance of getting acquainted
with the general trend of business throughout
Canada, and that the individual farmer is
very mucli more arnenable to a proper and
honest presentation of the case of the industrialists and financiers than lie lias been heretofore.
The farmers have had an unprosperous
year, and I do not think we are helping them

is different. That is a smail, compact island,
praceticaily ail the interior beîng within about
one hundred miles of the seashore; the
climate is 50 admirably suited for the raising
of -catt-le and the -em.rying on of the daîry iadustry that 1 doubt whether it is ex.celled for
tihese purposes anyvehere in the world, even
in Denimark. Wben I saw the great natural1
advantages thle New Zealanders possessed in
these respects over Canada, I realized that
t-hey were gaing ta be very keen competitoxs
of ours. I will tell lionourable members something I have not mentioned before, that wlien

thought of opposing it; but we forebore because we thought it would be an ungracious
act to disapprove in the Senate of a treaty
with a sister dominion following an understanding arrived at on a personal visit by a
Minister of the Government of this country.
I realize, as we all do, that some manufacturers derive important advantages from the
trade with New Zealand, but I do not think
that the benefits received by this country are
a quid pro quo for the gains accruing to New
Zealand under the treaty. I am anxious that
we should have friendly relations with the
other dominions, but trade arrangements between us and any of them should be such as
to give us an equivalent return for the concessions we make. Farmers along the boundary in Quebec and Ontario who are in the
fresh milk business, the most profitable part
of the dairy industry, and are shipping their
produce to New York, know what we are
suffering because of this treaty.
The Saskatchewan Dairy Association at its meeting
in the city of Moose Jaw-and I may say I
did not attempt to influence the membersobjected to the continuance of our treaty
with New Zealand so far as butter is concerned.
I have, in common with all other
honourable members on this side of the
House, the kindliest feelings towards the other
parts of the Empire, but when we make treaties the interest of our own people should
come first, and this is quite consistent with
a spirit of good-will. Let the representatives
of other countries look a.ter their own people.
I venture to suggest to the Government that
some different arrangement should be made
with New Zealand. It is not for me to suggest what change should be made. In the
three Prairie Provinces we have devoted considerable attention to the diversification of
farming. Townspeople used to Jearnedly advise the farmers to cease growing only wheat,
to diversify their products, but as soon as the
dairy industrv began to go ahead, it was
made unprofitable because our tariff gates
were thrown open to the world.
There has been great commercial and industrial activity in Canada for two or three
years past, but apparently we are moving very
rapidly on the down grade now. There was a
period when the prices of stocks and commodities were highly inflated; now the water has
been taken out of the stocks and the people of
Canada will prdbably find that they lost more
than they made from their speculations on the
exchanges. Some individuals were fortunate
enough to esoape the catastrophe, but I fancy
the man on the street has been a loser. The
temporary profits that were received from
stocks undoubtedly had a beneficial effect on
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

general business conditions for a time, and
perhaps some of the money so received was
spent in the creation of new enterprises. The
storekeeper whose speculations made profits
for him overnight perhaps bought more goods
the next morning, but, as I say, the period of
moneymaking did not last long, and now that
it is over the average Canadian is worse off
because of those abnormal conditions. Honourable members would be surprised at the
number of bucket shops, as they are called, in
the Prairie Provinces. In Moose Jaw, a city
with a population of from twenty to twentyfive thousand, we have five exchange houses,
in Regina tihere is a larger number, and even
in communities of five or six hundred people
you will find one of these houses dealing in
stocks. Weli, we have the experience and they
have the money.
I have spoken longer than I had intended,
though I have not discussed other matters to
whioh when listening to the Speech fron the
Throne, I thought I should refer.
Hon. R. DANDURAiND: Honourable members, I join with the honourable leader on the
other side in welcoming the first lady member of this House, not only for her personal
qualities, but because she represents the better
half of humanity as exemplified by our
mothers, our wives and daughters. During
the last six years I have had the great honour,
with other Canadians, of representing Canada
at the League of Nations. I have met there
a number of women representatives from
various countries. I have found them equal
to their male colleagues in many a field, and
I have no doubt that there are in ail the
provinces Canadian women who can be sent
to the Canadien Parliament and will rank
among the elite in brains, judgment and culture. It is our great privilege to have one
among us.
I 'congratulate her upon the
speech that she delivered yesterday.
I desire also to congratulate the honourable
mover of the Speech from the Throne, whom,
I believe, we were hearing for the first time
in this Chamber, and whom I hope we shall
hear often.
I ,desire at the same time to join with my
honourable frienid opposite (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) in the welcome to the ex-Minister of
Immigration (Hon. Mr. Forke), who now sits
among us. He ,represents a large element in
the West. My honourable friend knows that
the new representative from Manitoba was
elected by the Progressive Party, and has
been the leader of that rparty in the other
House. I notice that my honourable friend,
the leader on the deft, bas been wondering
how the principles of the Progressives could

fit in kso easily with thse of the Liberal
Pwrty. I desire to remind him that before
the darners of tihe West formed 'tihemseves
into a selparate party theix leaders were mostly
in the LiberalParty. In fsact, the sode representative od the Progressive Party in this
Chamber, the honourable gentleiman f-rea
Assinibola (Hon. Mr. Turriff), sat for a number
of Parliaments in the other Huse as a bIÀberal.
I know that tihe Progressives were the advanced wing of theLih-eral Party in econornic
matters, and the Liberal Party bnci to consider
the views of that wing of the party. The

of this Government. It is true that he suggesteci that the Speech from the Tbrone

at the Speech from the Throne he will find

that Parlis>ment should be informed of what
bas been accomplished by uts executive during the preceding year. As Vo what will be
submitted Vo this Parliamrent, lie will find that
the program embraces legislation "respecting the severai raidway properties formerly
privately owned anci now embrated in the

of the option-al clause, which is a most important step bringing us nearer to permanent
peace. The matters in dispute hetween the
peoples can be divided generally into two
classes; Vhe issues that are calleci justici-

able questions, and those that are political.
The justiciable questions arise in the interpretation of treaties and international law,
and are questions which undoubtedly must
be brought before a judicial tribunal. We
all agreed to recognize the Court of International Justice in 1920, but no nation at
that time bound itself compulsorily to submit to that Court all its differences touching the interpretation of treaties or international law. Each nation recognized the
Court, contributed to its maintenance, and
accepted the idea of going before the Court
with a special case, by special understanding
with another country; but the statute
respecting the Court included a provision,
clause 36, which declared that the nations
could, either when they j'oined the Court
or later on, agree to submit to it compulsorily all difficulties coming within the
class of justiciable questions.
The great
powers 'hesitated to bind themselves, though
the smaller nations were eager to do so.
The small nations had but their right to
assert, whille the great nations could rely
upon their might. The probleim was to
have the great nations come down to the
level of the small nations, just as in the case
of a great corporation and a humble individual appearing on an oqual footing before
a court of justice. lit took some time for
thcm to agree to submit to the Hague Tribunad all questions of a justiciable nature
that might arise. Germany, last year, was
the first to do so: being disarmed, it stood
fairly on a plane with the smadll nations, and
was desirous of showing that it intended
not to arm, but to rely upon justice. For
four years we had been awaiting the action
of the great nations, and I am happy to say
that at the last session of the Assembly, in
September, Great Briitain led the great
nations in declaring its adherence to that
clause; then France and Italy foIllowed, and
I think Japan also. But I desire to say that,
as Great Britain recognized, it did not lead
the Empire in this movement. It was Canada, the oldest Dominion in the British
Commonweal!th, that took the dead. The
newspapers in Europe gave credit to Canada
for having in February last, during the last
session of Parliament, declared that it intended to sign the clause, and I may say
that I heard representatives of Great Britain,
journalists among them, commend Canada
for having made that official statement, because it he'lped to olariy the situation in
Great Britain. Up to that moment there
was an impression that Great Britain hesitated to sign the clause on ancount of the
unwillingness of some of the nations to do
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

so, but when Canada deelared that it was
desirous of signing there was a movement in
Great Britain in favour of accepting a like
obligation.
I may add that in the year one event
stands out as ýpromising greater peace in
Europe; it is the settlement of the war
debts at the Hague Conforence in December
and January last. This settlement will be a
powerful factor for peace, because it removes
very many causes of friction, which was
felt not only in the Assembly but more
especially in the Council of the League. For
the last five or six years there have been
constant recriminations and discussions between Hungary and Rumania as to the rights
of Hungarian optants in Transylvania. There
has also been considerable friction between
Poland and Germany. There were difficuaties
in the Baikans betveen Bulgaria and the
other members of the League in that region.
There were also difficulties in Austria. Many
of those differences arose from the unsettded
conditions rela'ting to the war debts, which
of those
.materiallly affected the budgets
various countries. There has been a general
clearing up of those differences, and I believe that the slackening of tension will be
felt in Geneva. I may say that in January
last, for the first time, I noticed considerable
relations between
in
the
improvement
Poland and Germany-a degree of cordiality
which had hitherto been lacking.
There remains to be settled the great question of disarmament, now being discussed in
London. Strenuous efforts a.re being made to
reach an agreement for some reduction in
naval armaments. I shall not dwell on this
matter. I may say that the main question
is one of security and there is involved to a
certain degree the factor of prestige. Nations
have signed the Briand-Kellogg Pact, binding themselves to abandon war as an instrument of national policy, but they feel that the
moment has not yet come when they can
dispense with their means of defence. One
needs to travel but little in Europe to realize
what prestige means. Some of the countries
that are represented at the present conference in London claim that they require certain tonnage, which I am sure they do not
intend to build up to, but which would mean
for them a certain status in the community
of nations. I well recall some words that
fell from the lips of M. Briand when, in 1921,
he returned to France from the Washington
Conference somewhat dissatisfied with the
apportionment of naval tonnage to his coun
try. A journalist asked him, as he was boarding his ship in New York: " Has not a certain coolness developed between those two

flot the entente been somcewhat shaken?"
M. Bria-nd sAid: "No, the entente wiil continue; we shail travel together, but abrcé.st,
not in tow." When Mr. Snowdcn, a-t The
Hague st autumn, held out for the full share
that was due Great Britain in the s ettiement
of reparatians, Lloyd George used the sa-me
expression. He sa-id, "At last Great Britain
asserts itself and is no longer in tow by
France." Honourable members will realize
that prestige is a very important factor, but
the chief difficulty will be to give the nations
a proper setise ai security.
There is anc great country that ca-n give
this necessa-ry assurance, if it wili only adopt
an attitude a little mare sympathetic towards
Europe, and that is the United Sta-tes of
America.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members
it is difficult to extract much juice from a dry
orange, and it 'bas been pretty well demonstrated, I think, by the spee!ches to which
we have listened, that it is difficult to get
very much meat fron the Speech from the
Throne. I read the Speech from the Throne
with as much interest as I could muster, and
also the speeches made in this and the other
Chamber by the movers and the seconders
of the Address, and, while I enjoyed them all,
I was rem-inded very forcibly of the title of
one of Shakespeare's plays-"Much Ado about
Nothing."
I am gong to follow in the footsteps of my

leader and be as brief as possible in what I
have to say. The honourable gentleman who
moved the Address (Hon. Mr. Horsey) referred to one particular feature of outstand-

ing importance to the Maritime Provincesthe complete cairrying out of the recommendations of the Duncan Report. Lest we forget that that report has not been entirely
im'plemented, may I refer to a few of the
recommendations yet to be fulfilled? We
might almost have inerred from the remarks
made by the mover of the Address in this

House that so far as the carrying out of the
recommendatione contained in the report is
concerned the Maritime Provinces are satisfied. I want to d'isabuse bis mind of that
idea. At the sane time, I do not wish to
complain. I desire to say that what has been
done in carrying out those recommendations
bas been of very great benefit to the people
of the Maritime Provinces.
In his remarks yesterday the honourable

gentleman said that

some

$3200,000

had

accrued to the Maritime Provinces because of
the adjustment of freight rates. I think that
is quite correct. Nevertheless, it is well to

keep in mind the fact that that money is
given to the Maritime Provinces simply in
return for money that in previous years had
been taken from them. That does not go far
enough. It does not restore to those provinces the money that was taken from them on

freight rates from 1912 until 1928, when the
recommendations under the Duncan Report
first came into effect. We do not complain
of what bas been done, but we want it com-

pleted.

We want still to keep before the

people of Canada the just claims set forth

by our people-the obligations under the Confederation pact that have not been carried
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

out. We never ask for more than our just
dues, and we think that to a large extent we
are going to get them when full effect bas
been given to the recommendations in this
report.
But, as I have said before, my reason for
speaking to-day is to disabuse the minds of
the people outside of the Maritime Provinces
of the idea that the report bas been implemented to the full. In order to refresh your
memory I wish to refer to some of the main
features in regard to which the recommendations contained in the report have not yet
been fulfilled. It is true that the freight rates
were to be reduced 20 per cent between Levis
and the East, over what was originally the
Intercolonial Railway and additions thereto
prior to 1912. It was stated in this House
and in another place that that 20 per cent
reduction had been carried out. That is not
quite a fair statement of the case. If you
turn to page 22 of the report you will find
the following:
We recommend, therefore, that an imimediate
reduction of 20 per cent (so that 192 will becorne approximately 155) be made on all rates
charged on traffic which both originates and
terminates at stations in the Atlantic Division
of the Canadian National Railways (including
export and imiport traffic, by sea, from and to
that division), and that the same reduction be
also applied to the Atlantie Division proportion
of the through rates on all traffic which originates at stations in the Atlantic Division (excluding import traffic by sea), and is destined
to points outside the Atlantic Division.

Now, a reduction of 20 per cent was made
on the freight that originated in our own prov-

inces, but the reduction does not apply to all
exports and imports. I am quite aware that
the railway authorities will explain that the
reason for this is the existence of certain
freight agreements with other railways. We

expect that this recommendation will be carried out, and we are anxious that honourable
members should not get the impression that
this bas been done.
There are in connection with initerprovincial
freight rates certain ifactors that work decidedly to the disadvantage of the Maritime
Provinces. No doubt honourable members
will be surprised to know that although the
freight rate on a certain article from a point
in Ontario to the city of Saint John is about
46 cents a hundred pounds, the rate from the
city of Saint John to the identical place in
Ontario is about $1.86 a hundred pounds.
That is just another condition that we of the
Maritime Provinces expect to have adjusted
in order that all parts of the Dominion may
receive similar benefits from freight carriers.
The adjustment of freight rates bas been of
great benefit to the Maritime Provinces, but

have seen no evidence of action. I refer
now ta the steel and coal industries in the
Ma'ritime Provinces, particularly in Nova
Scotia. If honourable members will allow me,
I shail reud brief extracts. On page 36,
under the heading "Customs Tariff on Coal,"
there is this paragraph:
Several features of the CJustoms Tariff in its
relation -ta coal were brought to our attention
bathb by the Government of Nova Scotia and by
the operators of the coal mines. These we f eel
ourselves precluded from dealing with, since
they are a matter properly .to be considere-d by
the Tariff Àdvisory Board; but we may be
permitted to say that we are impressed with
the need for reconsideration of the Customs
Tariff in its relation ta coal,' anthracite and
coke, and we recommend that the Tariff
Advisory Board should be asked ta give immediate consideration to the subject.
And on page 37, under the heading "Steel
and Customs Tariff":
In respect of this mà,tter, we do not concelve
it ta 'be our duty ta exjpress any opinion, since
the question is, as we were indormed by the
Chairman of the Tariff Advisory Board, Who
met us at aur request, at the present mont
under the consideration of that Board. But we
do regard it as our duty ta record that the
significance of this industry ta the Maritime
Provinces was forcibly brought home ta us,
not, only in the manuifacturing tawns we visited
in the Maritimes but also throughout the agricultural districts of the Maritimes. We record
this in order ta emphasize -the need for prompt
action.

bas been ta bring the Maritimes back into
full accord with Conýfederation, and ta convince the people of those three provinces that
once more they are reaIly a part of this
Dominion. There is no longer the feeling ci
isolation that so long existed, which was partly
due, perhaps, Waa lack of foresight and attention on the part of those who were sent here
ta represent our people in days past. In
other words, the resuit of the report has
been very largely psy'ohological. Fonmerly
in the Maritimes there was a feeling of unrest, of dissàtisf action, of depression; andl
accession was advocated because it was feit
that we -were neyer going ta get the rights
ta which we were justly enbitled. No country
whose people are ini that state of mnind,' can
prosper.
There is another matter in respect ta which
the report bas not ibeen implemented, although
about three and a half years have elapeed

claims that they had made year after year to
both Houses of Parliament.
. In conclusion, I wi§h to add my compliments
to the mover and the seconder of the Address.
The new member of tihis House who seconded
the Addiress sthowed slaill nnd politioail sagacity
beyoind tihat possessed by most of us, as honouraiblie members will realize if they read her
address, for she knew that there was nothing
in the Rpeech from the Throne to discuss, and
dhe did not disouas it.
Hua. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I should like to deal as briefly as possible
with the first part of the Speech fram the
Throne, but before doing so I want to extend
my sincere congratulations to the mover
of the Address in Reply.
I have been a
member of this House for quite a few
years, but I have rarely listened to language
more digrnified and more suitable for this
Chamber; it was language of a. style that
probably many of us have long wished we
had been able to acquire. I should like
as well to congratulate the Governeent
upon the nomination of the honourable senator who seconded the Address. There has been
a great departuxe from the constitutional traditions of this House, but if anything could
comifet those who thought this departuire was
too grcat. i was, wiýthout any doubt, the excellence of the dhoice thalt was made in the
appointient of Hon. Senator Wilson. There
could not have been a happier selection of
a representative of the women of this country and of the many excellent qualities that
distinguish them.
May I congratulate the
honourable senator on her maiden speech?
I should like to express particularly tihe appreciation of those of us who come from the
Proince of Quebec for the compliment paid to
the French language in her skilful and pleasing remarks. In proving her qualifications
to occupy a seat in this Chamber Hon. Senator Wilson has given further evidence of her
graciousness.
I freely confess that I was somewhat surprised at the first part of the Speech from
the Throne. It sounded to me as if it should
have been written -in the past tense. A great
proclamation has been made by the Government of the prosperous times that we are
enjoying throughout the land. The honourable leader on this side of the House has
stated briefly the conditions that exist in
his province at the present time. If honourable senators were to go ta Montreal and
visit municipal refuges for homeless people
who every night beg for a bed and something
to eat. they would not agree with the Speech
from the Throne.
If honourable members
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

could be present at meetings of city councils
where there are discussions of the pressing
need to go ahead with public works in order
to find jobs for those who have no bread;
if honourable members could hear the report
that was made recently by Alderman Shubert,
who says that not for years has there been
so much suffering -as there is at present in
the city of Montreal; if I could show honourable members the able-bodied men who
are organizing by the hundreds to beg for
food from door to door, the difficulty of reconciling the existing situation with the Speech
from the Throne would be evident at once.
An urgent meeting of mayors of different
cities was held in Winnipeg for the purpose of
organizing some relief. The acuteness of the
situation is plain to everybody, except, I am
sorry to say, the Minister of Labour. This
is the more regrettable as he is in a better
position to help.
When I listened to the Speech from the
Throne I was thinking of the queer effect
that it would have on the hungry men who
went from door ta door, humiliated because
they had to beg for bread. That condition
by no means exists only in my province and
in Montreal. Just allow me to quote a newspaper that certainly cannot be suspected in
the present instance of political bias. This
is what the Citizen of this city has said:
No use coming here for work from outside;
never before in the history of the city has the
Union Mission, the hostel for indigent men,
been so crowded at this season of the year as it
is to-day. The officials are becoming alarmed,
as each day brings in its quota of homeless,
hungry and penniless men.
Will anybody doubt the good faith of this
paper? What is happening in Montreal and
in Ottawa is repeated, unfortunately, throughout the land. What news do we get from
Winnipeg? What news do we get from Edmonton? What reports do we get from Vancouver, where hundreds of men rely upon
municipal authorities for aid because they
have no bread? So, after four years of great
abundance, a period of abundance greater perhaps than we have ever had in this country,
this prosperity peters out in one night. How
can one explain the abrupt transition from
apparent prosperity to stagnation and want?
That is the question that I want to bring
forcibly before this House, if I can. You have
abundance, apparently you have great prosperity, and in one moment it is gone. It
means this, that the prosperity you had was
much more apparent than real. When a man
works very hard, but makes very little, he
has hardly any chance to lay aside a penny
for a rainy day. Our people, it is true, have
worked bard, and you have wonderful figures

FEBRUARY 26, 1930
t.o show the activity in ail branches of industry; yct at the slightest reaction the resuit
of it ail is gone. Why? Because the people
of this country have nlot had a chance, to
lay aside a reserve for the hard times that
must always follow prosperous days. That
is the situation as it strikes me at the present
tirne.
Two explanations have been giveIn, and I
will refer to them very briefly. The flrst is
that we have had a short crop in the West.
That is truc, but the Minister of 'Commerce
has estimated the loss in that respect at
s138,oo0,oco, which is lcss than seven per cent
of the total agricultural production, and les
than three and a. haif per cent of our total
agricultural and industriai production for 1929;
and to my mind it does flot in the least explain the complete change that has taken place
in the condition of Canada. What is the
second reason given? It is the stock exchange reaction. But everybody knows that
that could affect on'ly a small proportion of
the population, estimated at three per cent.
How could it change in one day a condition
of absolute prosperity to one of dullness in
business? No, honourable gentlemen, there
must be other reasons.
But, alarming as that symptom is, there is
a condition very much more serious, and unhappily it aiways exists: it is the continued
and increasing exodus of our population to
the United States. Now, honourable gentlemen, I want to deal at once with the answer
that is given by the Government in this connection. They say: "Yes, it is truc that
we have lost a great many of our citizens,
but they are trekking back.» Did I flot hear
that statement in this House last ycar? And
has it flot been echoed in a certain portion of
the press of the country?
I have tried ýto investigate the -return of our
Canadians. I wrote to the Bureau of Statistics at Otta:wa, asking thern to bie good enough
te give me the figures regarding our compatriots whom we have been losing during the
last year; anid, not to my surprise, but, I rnight
Say, te my great disappoinment-for it is noi

politely referred to Vihe Statistioatl Department
at Washington. It is rather eurious that
thougis we have an excellent Bureau of Statistics that carefully records whcre we send our
butter, or wheat, or hams, or bacon, or whate'ver Canadian agriculture or industry rn.ay
produce, and t.hough that Bureau keeips track
of ouTr

goeds from the time they leave our

shores until they arrive at their destination,
yet as to our own peoptle no effort bas ever
been made to trace those who are loat to us.
So I wrote to the Departrnent -of Iinmigrakion

211

in Washington in order to obtain their report,
and I want to refer my honourable friends on
the other side to page 40) of this report. There
the number of immigrants from Canada to thse
States for the year ending June, 1929, is given

as 64,440. On the very sarne page can be
found the nuinher of emigrants who have
come to Canada, but it is painful to ascertain
that out of 30,527 persons leaving for Canada,
the number that Canada bas reclaimed
dwindles down to 2,706. -The rest, nurnbering
27,821, are classifled in the report under tise
terni "non-emigrant." That termi is definect
on page 1 of thse report as follows:
The non-emigrant is one who departe after
having been admitted tcmporarily, or a per-

manent alien resident who departa yvith tise lu-

tention of xetur.ning to thie country,
0f course that is not what we are lookîng
for. The man who departs from tise States
afrer having been adrnitted only temporarily
is no boss to Canada; he rcRnainýs perm.anently
scttled in this country. Thse man who leaves
thse States temporariby, but returns to live
there permancntly, is no gain to Canada.
The report establishes that out of 30,527
people shown as having returncd to Canada,
27,82 1 are not reclairned at ahl; they cither
have had their domicile in Canada, and continue to have their domicile here, or have had
their domicile in the States and continue to
have their domicile there. Therefore, of the
64,440 people that wc lose, we get -back only
2,706. Unfortunately, this is clearly conflrmed
throughout this report.

If yen look at the percentage, given at page

201, of those who leave the States and corne
back tQ us pcrmanently, what do You find it te
be? For last year it was four per cent of the
64,000. The previous year it was two per cent.
What was it the year before? Two per cent.
So it is truc that when they go they are gone
for ever. Tell me, have you ever met a man
that came back? I have neyer in my lift--I
say it in ahl sincerity-met, a Canadian who
settled in the States and came back to Canada.
These American statistics constitute tise only
evidence available. That is tise evidence to
which we are referred by the authorities here
in Ottawa.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very well, of Canadian consumers. 1 have heard that argument time and again, and it lias left me ini
a quandary. Can anybody draw a distinction between the producer and the consumer
in Canada? My honourable friend speaka as
if we had a leisured class ini tis country.
The honourable gentleman la a lawyer. Io

lie la manufacturing the instruments which

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is not an
over-generous reciprocity, and it seems strange
in view of the fairness of the British people.
Why do they treat us like that? Possibly,
if 1 may open a page of illustriaus history
and refer to the remarks made many yeara
ago by Canadian statesmen and quoted in
the British Parliament by Mr. Thomas, the
Secretary for the Colonies, in 1926, the situation will be explained.
During a debate in the Canadian Parliament
aweek ago, Mr. Lapointe, the Canadian Minister of Justice, said that "Canada was giving
Great Britain a preference in lier market of
ber own free will, but mainly because it sui.ted
Canada to do so."
Mr. Grahamgentleman whom we have the great
-a
honour of counting amongst our members in
this House-said at that time, "That preference was given
to Great Britain out of the heart of the people
of Canada, but flot altogather from altruistic
motives, because Canadiens believed, and ithlas
turned out to be true, that giving preference
to the Motherland wouild be mainily for the
benefit of their own country."
Thle British Parliament bias ever since remained under the impression thaît in granting
the British preference Canada's main objeet
wau to serve her own selfish inte-reste; 9o
these declarations and others of the same kind
have resulted in Canada being rohbed of any
acknowledgment by Great Britain of what we
djd for her..
But let us paas on rapidly and ascertain how
the other members of the British Empire have
reciprocated Canada's treatment in their
favouïr. Since the war their tarifas have been
eiher generally or partially increased as follows: one tariff increase lias heen made by
East Africa, Malta, Mesopotamia and Palestîne; two tariff increases have been made by
New Zealand, Newfoundland, Barbados and
Jamaica; three tariff increases have been made
by Australia, the Irishi Free State, British
Honduras and Trinidad; four tariff increases
have been made by British India; five by
British Guiana.
Now let us deal witli our special friends,
those countries to which we extend the benefits
of the most-favoured-nations clause. Onie tariff
increase lias been made by Argentine, Colombia, Italy and the Netherlanda; two by
Switzerland; three by Finland, Esthonia,
Czechosiovakcia and Roumania; four by Denmark, Japan, Norway, Spain and Belgium;
five by France and Portugal.

seven per cent. And do you know that even
at the present time iron or steel can be
imaported much more cheaply than we can
afford to produce it? What is the Goverrnment going to do about it?
Now, I wish to call attention to one phase
of this situation. My honourable friend who
leads the House could give us better information than I can in this respect, but I will do
my best. Lately we have seen a very interesting conference of no less than twenty-six
European nations at Geneva. What were they
meeting for? They were going to form the
United States of Europe. That is a polite
term; but what was their real object? To
combine and protect themselves against the
invasion of American goods. If any one in
this House doubts this purpose, I have at
hand excerpts from a newspaper clearly
demonstrating that this is the purpose pursued by those twenty-six nations.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would my honourable friend permit me t.o ask him a question? Is not their purpose really to do atway
with the customs between one and another
of their respective countries?

Sam, which bombards us incessantly with
exports. Here we stand, a nation of nine
and a half million people with a total wealth
of twenty-six billions of dollars, unprotected
from the world, having thrown down our
defences. We say to Uncle Sam and to the
other nations of the world, "Come along and
meet us in our open market." The Americans
have accepted the invitation, and their exports are coming in at the rate of $100,000,000
more every year. Every year our balance of
trade falls, and this last year we were humiliated by seeing our currency, our good Canadian dollar, depressed at the rate of from 1
to 21 per cent, which means an annual loss
to our country on our remittances to Uncle
Sam of from 88,000,000 to $15,000,000.
I have here an excerpt from the Gazette
of the 22nd instant, which quotes the Intelligence Journal, in whieh Mr. Harrison Watson,
the Canadian Trade Commissioner in London,
reports that in 1929 the exports to Great
Britain of practically all our leading food
products have seriously declined. He says:
Shrinkages in volume in some of the more
important lines are as follows: flour, 23.7 per
cent; bacon, 35 per cent; hame, 14.9 per cent;
eheese, 21.3 per cent; cainned salmon, 9.3 per
cent.
The export trade in live cattle, of which so
much was expected a few years ago, cempletely disappeared in 1929, when not a single
animal was shipped to this country.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will answer that
by reading a telegram published in the Star
of the 15th instant, a despatch from Geneva:
Europe negotiating its first peace-time
armistice, is facing a situation fraught with
greater potentiali-ties than the truce which ten
years ago ended the greatest war in history.

PROHIBITION OF LIQUOR FIXPORT TO

DISCUSSION AND INQUIRY

Hon. R. H. POPE rose in accordance with
the follorwing notice:
That he will cail the attention of the Senate
ta the question, and inquire, whether the Prime
Minister has given assurance, or undertakings,
ta any persan, or persans, represcnting the
Toronto Globe newspaper, or the Manitoba Free
Press newspaper, or ta any other persan, ta the
effect that the Government would submit a
measure ta Parliament for the purpose of probibiting the export of spirituous liquor from
Canada ta the United States.
He said: Honoura-ble senatoro, -the matter

I have been particulsrly interested in this
question because for some weeks it has been
rumoured in the sbr'ets of citdes and towss
in varieus parts of the country thba' the (3overnment intended te take action with a view
to preventmng the exportaVion of liquor from
Canada ta the United States of Anierica.
This is a very serious suggesfiion, beicause if
it were put ànto effect i~t would deprive a
number of provinices of a great deal of
revenue. I àh,11 speak pa&ti-culýarly of iny

if we were prevented <rom emporting liquor

that ie intended, according to rumour, when

In order to prohibit the expert of Ijquor

to epend a tremendiaus suai of money in maintaining -a strong preventive force acroffl the

whaît serious issues might arise in dealing
forci-bly with Ametricans under our flag. Greaèt
risir would be taken by our Goverreent wiéthout ýany possibiiity of return ta tb.is counitry.
There woulid be a widespread disturbance of
existing legilation and of international harmony. The United States may promise ta
co-operate te a certain exten>t, but I do net
know of a single arrangement made wiith us
that thcy have carried out withouit a long

It would bc different if -the quantity of
liquor that we are scnding over to the United
States were large -in proportion ta -their total
consumption. The fact is the very opposite,
and on that account *we could not hope ta

them of one-tenth of the spirits they drink.
At any rate, prohibition is not temperance.
but an extreme action in the opposite direction.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. POPE: All our provinces, with
possibly one or two exceptions, are controlling the consumption of spirituous liquors
within their own territories, and thereby they
derive certain revenue. Visitors from abroad,
we are pleased to say, come to the Province
of Quebec in the summer to stay with us and
spend their money. I am sure no one would
object to a friendly outsider buying a bottle
of good Scotch whisky in this country and
going to the nearest hotel for a little enjoyment. That is one of the results due to the
efforts of the prohibitionists. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has just
suggested that we should keep those visitors
out, but I say no, let thcm come in and spend
their money. We have to build roads for the
people from outside to travel on.
If there is any truth in the street rumours
that assurance was given to representatives
of the Manitoba Free Press and the Toronto
Globe, I should like to ask why this was
donc. Was a promise made for political purposes? Are we in the Province of Quebec
to bc deprived of valuable revenue in order
that certain partisan agencies may be exploited by these two newspapers?
If honourable members will read an article in the
Press by Colon-el Porter about the old days,
they will find that the American Government
took no action to prevent the shipment of
liquor to the Indians in the West, and this
country had great difficulty in maintaining
peace and order. Our neighbours to the south
did not try to regulate conditions up here.
and I feel that we should not interfere with
what goes on in their territory now. If they
want prohibition let then have it, but I
object to the Government of this country
undertaking a tremendous burden in order to
further the plans of any political party,
whether Liberal, Progressive, or any other.
We Lad an illustration two or three years
ago of the risk involved in matters of this
kind, when a change was made at Halifax
concerning steamers carrying liquor abroad.
What was the result? The business that had
been done in Halifax was transferred to Newfoundland. The consumption of liquor did
not stop, but this country lost a considerable
amount of money because of that change.
A large number o gentlemen have come

Is it
the intention to rclieve unemployment by
putting an army of men al,l along the frontier?
In the part of the Province of Quebec
where I live there is a forest, and it would
be very easy there to smuggde liquor into
the United States. If exports are prohibited
by law the province would doSe revenue, but
the liquor would still find its way across the
border. Our taxes are high enough now;
there are few who are so fortunate as not to
feel the beavy burden that we arc carrying.
Therefore I repeat that I can sec no good
that. would corne from legislation whichi would
delprive us of revenue and would not result
in accomp.lishing its real object. I was told

comiprised serious op)osition to proposecd

shows that a verv considerable portion of
this country is opposed to an attcempt on the
part of the Government to turn the tide of
liquor flowing to ýthe south. I did not get
this information concerning the caucuses fron
a leak. It is impossible to hold such a gathering without everybody knowing what goes
on. Such information always comes out, and
I be-lieve that what happened to-day was
sufficiently important to make
a strong
impreirssion on the Government. The whole
qîuestion is a very serious one and I should
like to be informcd what the intention is.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of is Excellency the Governor
Ceneral's Speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Horsey for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. P. B. CAiSGRAIN: Honourable
memibers, my first worcis must be words of
congratulation to the proposer of the Address.
I had the pleasure of being invited with himn,
in Montreal-we were the on.ly mailes-to a
gathering of charm.ing and beautiful ladies,
every one of whomn, eager to be a senator,
displayed a great deal of zeal for the party
at present in .power. On that occasion, as
usual, the honourable gentleman mnade a very
good speech. It is easy for him to make sucb
a speech, for he is an old campaigner, baving
once been a can~di.date for the House of Commons. The ladies, I thought, were eyeing him
in such a way as to- indicate that if they could
flot be senators themeelves, they would Like
to be a senator's wife, had the honourable
gentleman been free.
As to the seconder of the Address, the honourable member from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs.
Wilson), I sat with ber father in this House
from the day when he became a senator
until-he led t the House neyer to retura. His
daughter bas inherited her father's sterling
qualities, and she has improved on him a
littie in her knowledge of the French language.
I do not believe that during tbe thirty years
I have been in this House there has ever been
a nomination that met with se, much approval
throughout the coun'try. As proof of this,
witness the fact that the Montreal Star and
the Montreal Gazette bave agreed for the first
time in msany years. That is but one proof of
the unanimous acclaim that this appointinent
bas met throughout the length and breadth
of the country.
The honourable leader of the Opposition
(Hlon. Mr. Willoughby)-if I may so describe
him, though it is quite true, as the honourable leader on this side says, that therp is
no opposition in this House-spoke wîth bis
usual moderation and that excessive modesty
wbich characterizes him and which comes

2

frorzh deep reading. He wôiild baÉve this
House regard. bim as a very humble man.
That.ii to my mind the surest sign of .greatSûme Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: H1e deplored the
fact that the negotiations for the return of
the resources of Saskatchewan were flot entirely satisfactory to that province, and that
it had no water powers or forest reserves such
as Alberta had. But Saskatchewan is pretty
weIl off. I ,remember full well that at one
time Saskatchewan guaranteed the capital
and the înterest .on certain branch lines of
the Grand Trunk Pacific, and I recail quite
well also that Saskatchewan has ever since
enjoyed the use of those lines, and wîll stili
continue to do so. Furthermore, I hear that
more railways will be huilt there. But what
happened when the railways were taken over
*by a previous Government? That, Government
took everything holus-bolus and saddled the
guarantees and the bonds and coupons, which
to-day would run into an enormous sum, on
the Dominion. Exchequer, to which Ontario
and Quehec are making large contributions.
The Province of Saskatchewan to-day has
twice as many miles of railway per capita
as has the great Province of Ontario, and
it bias four times as many miles of railway
per capita as the old Province of Quebec.
The railway mileage of Saskatchewan is one
and a haîf times that of Quebee, although its
population is only one-third of that of Quebec.
I think it is only right and just to Ontario
and Quebec that those things should be
taken into consideration in the settiement,
and it seems to me that if any money is to
change hands a fine opportunity is offered
for Ontario, Quebee and the other provinces
to get some of it. I do not say that it was
unwise to subsidize or build those railways;,
but why should there be four times as much
railway mileage in Saskatchewan, per capita,
as in Quebec? In Québehc there are 500 persons per mile of railroad, while in Saskatchewan there are oniy 125; so either there is
too much raîlway mileage in Saskatchewan or
we have not enough in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The Federal Government owns those lines now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am not intending to be antagonistie in what I am saying.
I wish only to see fair play and justice. The
prosperity of Saskatchewan is wonderful.
The quantity of wheat grown there in a good
year is equal to that grown in the other two
Prairie Provinces.

30

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It is more than that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
0f course they
get a bad year now and again in the south,
owing to dry weather or some such cause,
but how can that be helped? We are told
that this year the C.P.R. is going to spend
some fifty million dollars on the improvement
of its lines, in addition to building some new
lines. The Canadian National is also spending at least an equal amount, I should judge,
since it has 22,000 miles of railway as compared with the Canadian Pacifie mileage of
14,000. But, after alI, where would the western provinces be if it had noV been that
Ontario and Quebec paid the piper? And
when you pay the piper you usually have
the privilege of calling the tune.
The honourable leader of the Opposition
(Mon. Mr. Willoughýby) touched. upon anothex
point, but he did it in such a mild way bliat I
do flot think it did receive the attention that
it should. I refer to the statua of Canada since
the ýconference of 1926. 1 would direct the
attention of honourable members to an article
that -appeared in "The Nineteenth Century
and After," by Sir John Marriot, a member of
the British House of Commons. In that artiýole
he says thaýt oniy onc Dominion, the Union
of South Africa, ever voted. approval of the
report of that conference. Whetber that is
true or not, that is bis statement. Anything
I say here I 'have taken from the written
article; I cannot vouch for it myscîf. I shaîl
perhaps say later on why they were in a hurry
ta approve -of that report.
The change of status has not 'been notifled
to any foreign governinent; so that until it
is so notified the foreign governýments are
,perfectly excusable, in case of a major criais
involving warfare, if 'they send belligerents
here Vo engage in all the acts of war that they
choose. Not only the foreign goverfiments
but even the League of Nations has nat been
notified-and this is a pity, because it would
have given thema something Vo do-and the
matter has neyer been mentioned. in the
British House of Commons.
Now, if General Hertzog's olaim is right,
that Great Britain on that occasion in 1926
granted absolute aovereignty -and abandoned
aIl rights it ever had or could have had in
that South African territ.ory-these are the
words of Sir John Marriott in his article in
January-if all that has been done and South
Africa is a sovereign state, and as auch can
independently declaýre war, is it sufficient for
the Mother of Parliaments and the Dominion
Parliaments simnply to acquiesce, without any
legisiation or witho-ut any notice ta foreign
powers?
Hen. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Any action taken at the conference of
1926 may be aIJ rig-ht within the Empire, just
as in this room, if we were unanimous, we
could agree to almost anything; but what
about the beiligerents theinselves? They are
free Vo say whom ýthey will attack, and where.
Suppose a major criais arose: the belligerents
could go down ta Cape Town, and no matter
what Mr. Hertzog may think, they could aay,
"England has deolared war, and we are at war
with England, and we will 'bombard Cape
Town if you do not give us the keys of the
city and ail ýthat is in it." And what could. Mr.
Hertzog do?
There was also the Lausanne Treaty. Fromn
that the Dominions were excluded; they were
noV called in. I read late]y that in conncian with the great Versailles Treaty Vhey were
.calded in twice-first as members of the British
Emnpire, and then as different entities; and
tbey were naturaldy glad to aign, for Vhis was a
historie even.t, and it was gratifying Vo have
their names on thýat wondcrful book, and they
were anxious .to please the powers. But Sir
John Marriott remarks that when the Lausanne
Treaty came here o<ur Prime Minister made
a very adroit statement; he said that we were
to have none of the obligations, and only by
the volition of the flouse af Commýons should
we benefit by that reaty; we should noV have
anything ta do with it unýleas we chose. But
what about the belligerents who subscribed Vo
that treaty? Are we stilI at war with the
Turks, or are we noV? Th-at is the great
question. Those poor Turks were a party ta
the treaty, and I think that this ýpreaent
Government, out *of aharity and kindness,
shauld. tell them, "Now, dont came near
Canada, because we are still at war with
Turkey, though you don~t know it."
Then there was the Locarno Pact, and the
Dominions were not oonsidered a-t alI in thaýt.
The Dominions secan to be considered oniy
when they are parîticularly wanrted or invited.
I have been told thaît when the Versailles
Treaty was beiing ma-de, aIl that their reprearnitatian could hear as ta what was going on
was what was told thern when a messenger
býoy or somesbody came out fr-om where the
great, powers were delibcrating. By tipping
the boy they snight leam whether the great
powers were quarreling or weïre unaniimous;
but they did flot knaw very much about the
proceedinga until after %themeeting. As ta
the Locarno PacV, if the Minister -of South
Afrioa is righit, we had nothing ta d~o with
the actcn -taken there. I believe tlaut under
that pact it was agreed ta guarantee the
frontiers between France and Germany and
bet.ween Belgium and Germany; and, mark
you, England was ta send out the whole force

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
of ber great fleet Vo carry out that pact.
Suppose a major crisas aeoae there, Or suppose
another war broke out. Should we be hound
by that Laca>rno Treaty or not? ThaL is the
question I put ta tbe Senate. God forbid that
I abould try ta answer any of these quesions;
but there you wili eee our exaect position.
The King-knperor reosives rnany differemt
kinds of adv&îe. I am glad ithat Divine Providence has been plesed, to spare Mie lie, bit
àit l enough to ruake anyone ili ta bave -ta
take s0 iniuh different advice. Re bas ta -take
the advoice of the Cabinet in England, and
advice from here, and framn Australia, from
New Zealand-eveil fromi Heitzog, who aays
be bas notbing ta do with bim now. But His
Majesty etill has ita take bis advice, for there
is na Iaw Vo the cootrary. Noçw suppose tbe
Cabinet Ministers of Canada advise His
Majesty in a certain way, and, -for reasons
tbat we need not enquire about, AustraLia
advises him the ather way. Wbo is going Vo
decide? He will bave ta take bis chaice.
Recently Mr. Ramsay MacDonald thoughut
fit -ta recognize the Soviet (iovernrnent. Do
we want ta recognize the Soviets? I cauld
make a speech -on. thait suibject alone. I
received information through what may be
caliled a family talk, and I arn sure tbat if
I told what I know about the Soviets in
Canada honourable gentlemen would not
admit that bbey would have anything ta do
with the Soviets. But their Goverumeat bas
been. recognuized, and gaod conetitutional
authoritbies say that be.cause it has been
recognized by the JImperial Governrnent tbe
Soviets can came ta Canada now just as
tbough we had reoognized tbem. That desa
question for conotitutionai lawyers ta debate,
and after the debate there would be some on
aine side and some on the other.
But consider the position af Mei Majesy.
In Wa.shingtVon be bas four representabives.
If they were Vo agree, one would be quite
enougb, and if Vhey were going Vo quarre! and

links ithat now remaixi between the Dominions.

Counceil; and Ireland wfll noV ad-mut even t
much. The other day the Privy Council gave
a judgment tba.t did noV suit the Irish, and
Vbey said, "We are an independent Free State."
Well, if bonourable gentlemen think this situatian is ta endure, 1 amn soSry to, say I do not
tbink 9D. There mnust be a settlement. Il
some af the Dominions want ta eut loose, the
amputation will be a painful operatuion, even
to people of th;Ls country, but amputation le

As to what took place at the conference:
Mi,. Bruce, who was then the Prime Minister
of Australia, stopped in Montteal on his way
home, and I had lunch witli him, and efter
lunich I took hian ta one aide an~d nid, "'Telli
me, have an~y changes been made at this Wau
conference?" Hle said, "None at ail.» I said,
"Thank God." But this view did net seem
ta agree wâih that of -the powers here or
elsewbere.
Coming ba>ck to the bonourable leader of
the Opposition, I think one of bis principal
complaints was about New Zealand butter.
We made a treaty with New Zealand, and
when we seil them $4 worth of commodities
they seli us Si worth of butter or something
else. So it is a tresty by which this country
makes 400 per cent; yet the 'honourable gentleman suggested tha.t it should. be abolished.
Has the bonourable
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
gentleman any figures to verify that statement as to 400 per cent?
Hon. Mr. CASGRMJN: I got tlhat from die
very best source that anybody in "hi House
can find. When we make a treaty we cannot
expect that the ather country will buy our
goods and we shall buy noh.ing from tbeni.
I leave it to the honourahie gentleman wbo
bas just in.terrupted. me: can you pretend
tbat you will buy notibing fTom tbem?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is what the
United States do witb them.
Han. Mr. LAIRD: I do flot pretend that,
but I disagree with your f<our-to-one suggestion.
Han. Mr. CASGRAIN: We can fight that
out af.terwards. Now, thiere is a more seriaus
problem, anc tbat is in thbe mind of everybody and affects every class of peaple in tbis
country; that is the action of the Wbeat Pool.
The authorities governing tbe Pool tboughi
tbat tihey could! 'dey creation-that they
could oorner wheat. That bas been tried the
world over, but it has neyer been done, and
I do not believe it can be done. Tbey were
forgetting that there is a wbeat crop coming
in every month of the year, and I could name
the variaus countries from wbich wheat com.es
in from January to December. These gentlemen from west of the Lakes out teolte foot
of the Rocky Mountains seetm ta forget tbat
for a long tirne before a bushel of wbea.t was
grown there, people ail over the world were
eating bread and neyer missing western
wbeat at ail. The sac! thing about it is tbat
peole bave been -allowed Va find substitute-.
for the very thing the western farmers want
ta sell.

32

SENATE
Some years ago I Was visiting Port Suln-

light, Where Lord Leverhulme bas a wonderfui 'factory. an:d for a very few pence the employees there could get a dinner. 1 was surprised how cheaii it was, and I asked what was'
given them, and was told that they were given
r .oast beef-and you know there is nothing
better in the world than the roast beef of (Ad
England. They were also given p&tatoes, but
without bread. I asked about this, and the
reply was: "Why should they eat bread when
they are eating potatoes? One or the other
is quite sufficient."
We ail remember the
potato famine in Ireland in 1846 and '47, when
the po.tatoes rotted because of too much
rain. Potatoes 'had been used as a substitute,
and there are other substitutes.
In addition to substitutes that operate
againEst the Pool, there are agents and brokers
in Engiand who make a living out of handling wheat business, a.nd when the Wheat
Pool was formed they determined that they
were not going out of business, for they had
offices and probably familles f0 keep up. So
they concluded that if they could not get
wbeat fromn Canada tbýey would get it from
somewhere else, and they did. Týhat is the
reason why ten times more wheat went into
England from Argentina in September last
than in the corresponding montb of 1928. In
October the same thing bappened, and in
December five times more wheat went into
England from Argentina than last year. Those
months-September, October and November
-covered just the time those brokers wouid
have been buying our whieat, but the Englishman is proud, and, like other people, he does
not like f0 be dictated to. Individually he is
a littie more independent thaja others. H1e
said, "If you intend f0 bold this wheat and
thiýnk you can dictate to us, we will just
let you sec that you are not the only people
on earth that grow wheat." The buyers have
establisbed relations with other countries,
and thus wheat is being obtiained, and substitutes are also being used, so tbat when MT.
McPhail and Mr. Melntyre and the third
memnber of the Wheat Pool, Mr. McLeod,
went across sud spoke to those brokers, I
happen f0 know that the brokers said, "We
are net interested at ail."
We absolutely need the British market for
our wheat. If we lose it, whst is going to
becorne of the Northwest? Wheat growing
is the staple industry of this country, and
particularly of the western plains. Wbst is;
going f0 become of it? To-day we have
lost that market ýonly temporarily, I hope.
I trust that we shall recover it, but we have
lost it for the present. For instance, we have
H,,n. Mr. CASGRAIN.

lost it to the wbeat of Eastern Pnassia, wh)icb
is subsidized to the extent of 13 shillings 6
pence a qunarter, which means about 42 cents
a bushel.
t *may be of interest to bonourable members to know-it is flot ini my notes, but I
just happen f0 remember it-tbat the wheat
crop in the Northwest this year amnounted to
220,000,000 bushels. Would it surprise you,
honourable members, to hear tlhat in France
they haid a crop of 320,000,000 busheis, of
which they stili have 120,000,000 bushels left?
In France flour is sold in sacks weighing 280
pounds ea.ch, and the Goverument psy 20
shillings a sack, as bounty, which means 1i
cent a pound. I may say that I have taken
these figures from a newspaper published by
Lord Beaverbrook, which no doubt you have
a,1l read. H1e would hardly start a camnpaign
by felling what was not true, and I take it
for granted that he is rigbt. The cost of
such sacks of flour in England is 37 shillings,
and in France 57 shillings, and it is rather
extraoýrdinary that in. spite of this, bread is
cheatper in France than it is in England.
We have hsd a short crop, whieh is a great
pity, but I amn told th-at there is somne of the
1928 crop stili lef't.
You must remnember,
howevcr, that to carry a bushel of wheat
costs

134

cent a month for storage, interest,

and insurance. You can imagine what that
means on the 1928 wheat.
But every
cloud bas a silver lining, and if the Pool
ýdoes flot succeed, the effeet ýmay flot be
s0 disastrous affer ail, nnd for this reason,
that if they had secured the price they were
trying to get, everybody el-se would have
started producing whest, and next year there
would have been sucb a glut of it on the
market that the producers would probably
have ha-d to dispose of it witbout profit, and
perhaps at a loss. I am afraid they wiil not
attain their goal, but it is a consolation to
many peoiple to know that other countries
wi'll not be starting to grow wheat next year,
and that therefore we shahl be able to dispose
of our ýcrop, which I hope vi-ii be a large one.
Now I come to a statemnenit appearing in
Mining Truth, of Spokane, Washington, of
the l6th of January, and made in the course
of an acidreass by a very well known journalist
and economist, Mr. P. A. O'Farrei, whose
reame, I arn sure, is familiar to many here.
Ho says that the Ainerican per capita consumption of wheat per year is 300 pounds,
while tbat of the rest of the world is 100
pounds. 0f course there are some countries,
like France, where the people consumne more
than the average, and England, where a great
deal is used in the manufacture of biscuits

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
for .ships' stores. Mfeverybodly aVe tihe Wihite
man's bread-the bread that we use in this
country-about 300,000,000 tons ef wheat or
10,000,000,000 bushels would be necessary, and
to raise that qu,%ntity of wvheg)t 1,000,000,000
acres of land wou.id be required. At present
in the whole world there are 350,000,000 acres
in wheat. If ail the nations of the world
coneumed wheat at the samie rate as the
United States, three times as much as
could be grown on the Prairies, the Northwest cou-Id safely produce aIl that it is
capable of producing. But I amn afraid we
shall have to wait -a littie while for bliat, or
we might pro-duce so much that Lt would
kili the market. The Pool muet ha in rather
straiteried circumatances, because it is public
knowledge that it is being called on for more
margin. Anyone who has had anything tc,
do wjth the stock mnarket recently knows
what that means. That being so, the Governiments of the provinces said, "We wiIl
stand behin'd the Pool;" but the banks said,
"We would rather see you sit down. and put
it in writing."
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: la the honourable gentleman aware that the banks have issued an
authoritative statement in which they say
that on no occasion did the-y eall on the
Wheat Pool for more margin-that they were
perfectly satisfied with the position of the
account?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then what La the
matter with those three premiers? They must
be crazy.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They are flot crazy at
ahi. They volunteered their efforts in the
interest of the western farner.
Why dLid they
lon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
bring in legislation?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They lied te, hecause
a letter guaranteeing -the acounts wouid not
be effective. It had te be done by legislation,
and that La why legiciation La 'being brought
in. But the 'banks have apeoifically stated
that -they did not esk for the additienal
margin.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They are passing
those laws juat for fun. They do not Lntend
to gLve those guairantees at ail.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They do.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then why are they
doîng Lt?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: *The reason La that we
have very aggressive Progressive and ConservatLve Governments in the western provinces, and they decided to assist the farmers,
if necessary.

33

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Well, we will leawe
Lt ait that, for we shahl neyer get ainywhere by
arguing. They could not d& Lt by Order in
Counci4, for I know f romn sad experience that
an Order in CouncilisL not worùh a anap of
the fingera. Ail they would have te do would
be te go te the Exchequer Court and .plead
that the King can do no wrong, and the Court
would say that Lt waa ne good and that Lt
mLght as well be thrown into the furnace.
The banka are the trustees for the money of
theLr deposLtora, and as auch are responsLhle
and nmust call for more guarantees; and
apparently they are doLng so, and laws are
heing passed, and no doubt they wil1 be
passed unanimoualy and wthout muoh discussion. To my mind that La the worst thLng
that ever happened Ln this country. I take
Lt thiat Ln the great provinces of the Nerthwest
six out of every ton farmers aire in the Pool,
and I wonder what La beLng done feor the

other

four.

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS:

They do net need

Lt.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why? If things
go wrong thýey will be taxed. It is ail wrong
fromn start to finiish, and if there La any way
of vetoing that legislation Lt should be
vetoed in the Lnterest of those very provinces.
If the provinces are call1ed upen, they will
have to raise the monmey by taxation, and
the people who get no guarantee for their
grain will be taxed. Then the provLnces theinselves may say that the Pool has heen badly
administered; and Vhey xnay have to step in,
and they may find that teo much money wa43
being paid te, certain people.
Now, I do not want te, prolong this discussion unduly, but I should like te say thait
xve Ln Canada are ne worse off-we arW
probably better off-than are the people Ln the
United States. A wonderful article appeared,
in the AtlaDtic Monthly last March, in which
Lt was proven beyond question that out of
eighit farmers in the United, States seven are
juat one jump ah.ead of the sheriif, because one
out of eight was quite enough to supply aIl the
wheat required. Honourable members sho-uld
remember that since the introduction o.f the
gasoline engine there has been a tremendous
transformation in production meühoda, andbecause of the use of machinery and the
consequently simaîl number of men ermployed
there haa bren a striking decrease in the cost
of harvesting wheat. The M.cCormack firm,
which is well known as manufacturera of farmLng Lmplementa, givea in an advertisement the
names of a family, comipriaing a man, his
wife and his daughter of fifteen years of age,
who are cultivating 160. acres. The mother

does the housework and chores, and when the
father goes to his meals the daughter, who
took a degree at schoo-] last winter and in
the summer returned to the farm, operates
the combine. I never saw one of these
machines in operation, but I understand it is
a marvellous piece of mechanism, which can
perform several kinds of work; and according
to the statement attributed to the girl it is as
easy to control as a 'motor car. The manufacturers of the combine claim that it could
eut all the wheat on the 160 acres in, I t'hink,
about 22 hours. .Now, if machinery is going
to take employment away from seven out of
every eight farmers in the United States, what
is going to happen? Mass production on the
farms will send labour into industrial centres
and make the unemployment situation there
mare serious than it already is.
I shoulýd like to refer to some of the remarks
by my honourable friend from Montarvilile
(Hon. 'Mr. Beaubien).
He made a very
eloquent speech, as he always does, but I
cannot agree with all he said. According to
him there is such an exodus of our people to
the United States that this country is going
to ruin, and the prosperity of which we have
heard so much is a sort of castle in Spain,
which eould not withstand the pressure of the
most gentle zephyr. But Mr. E. W. Beatty
has publicly stated that the country never
had more prosperous times and his company,
the Canadian Pacific Railway, is goinig to
spend $50,000,000 this year. The presidents
and general managers of the banks have been
singing songs of joy about the material success
of the country. and the big trusts and industrial companies showed better balance
sheets this year than ever before.
Now,
honourable senators, you can take your choice
of these statements. I am sure the honourable
'member for Montarville was sincere in what
he said, but there are a great many people,
who are in a position to know the facts, whose
version of the state of affairs is entirely contrary to his.
The honourable gentleman blames all our
alleged troubles on the tariff-at least, that is
what I understand from his remarks, and I
listened carefully. He says, in effect, that if
the tariff were changed everything else would
be all right. Honourable members will remember that prior to Confederation in 1867 the
four provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia had btheir own separate
customs revenue, and at the time of the union
it was decided that there ahould be a uniform
duty applicable alil over jhe country in place
of the varying rates that had existed. That
uniform raite was set at 10 per cent, but
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

since then it bas, like Topsy, "just growed,"
in certain directions.
The strongest advocates of free t:ade that
I ever met were some manufacturers who had
appeared from time to ti:me before the Tariff
Board. So far as I can make out, those manufacturers would like to bave all the raw products they use on the free list, and everything of their own manufacture protected by
a high tariff. If tic Tariff Board has never
done unything else, it has ait least demonstrated that ve'ry many manufacturers are
free traders in their own interests and protectionists as far as everyone else is concerned.
Sir John A. Macdonald continued the · ariff
t
at 10 per cent for a time, until he was faced
with a deficit, when the uniform rate was
raised to 15 per cent. Ater the Mackenzie
Government had been in power two or three
ycars they decided tha.t t'he country was in
a very bad financial condition and t'hat the
remedy for the situation was another raise
in the tarif.
n thoese days I happened tO
be a French translator of the House of Commons Debates, and I frequently spent leisure
moments in the gallery. The presumption of
Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Charles Tupper,
who was si'tting next to him, was that the
Government intended to boost the rate to
20 per cent, and they were prepared to contend that the people would not stand for
such an additional burden. But the Government's proposal was to raise the duty up to
only 171 per cent. When this was declared
I saw Sir Charles Tupper put into bis desk
the notes of the address he had intended to
deliver, and Le made instead a good protectionist speech. That shows what a strange
thing polities is, because if the Government
of that day had set the -tariff at 20 per cent.
the Liberal Party would have been the advoca,tes of protection, while the Conservatives
would have come forward as the champions
of free trade.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
made the difference.

Five per cent

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have the authority of an extremely well informed man, the
late Sir Clifford Sifton, for saying that during the last fifty or sixty years the tariff as
a whole bas not varied one per cent. Some
manufacturers have got concessions when their
party was in power, and later when another
party came into office there was a transfer of
the duty to other items. I have read in
Hansard the boast of the Right Hon. Arthur
Meighen that his party had reduced the
tariff. What do honourable gentlemen think
of that for the Conservative Party?

What did Hon. Frank Oliver say in Saturday Night last year? He should know something of the Northwest, having been a
pioneer, a journalist, and Minister of the
Interior. He said, "In the Northwest we
want no more wheat producers."
You say you want population; that
population will make the country rich. If
that is se, what about China with its 400,000,000 inhabitants, and India, with its people
living on five cents a day? There is
population and there are resources in those
countries. It is not the number of people
but the quality that counts. Take Holland
and Denmark with their populations of
two and a half or three million people.
They are prosperous because the people are
intelligent and work; they are educated and
know what to do. Professor Lower says we
shall a'lways have as many people as we want
in Canada. Thon lie adds: "If you want
population you have to develop industrydevelop your coal industry and your iron
industry." Our trade balance against the
United States is composed of just two items,

this country one dollar, because the ports of
entry where the bounties were paid received
through the customs more than was paid out
in bounties. But suppose that had net heen
se: all the bounties amounted to was $15,000,000, and commodities were produced to
the extent of $500,000,000, of which $250,000,000 went in wages to the mon. That was
because Mr. Fielding was familiar with the
situation, and the result was that for every
dollar paid out the country got back $33.
That is a good investment, and that is what
should be done if we want this country to
go aheaid and have a big population.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: What would the
honourable gentleman advoeate?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If you want to get
back your English market for wheat, keep out
the Amerioan anthracite that comes in here
and let WeNlh anthracite oome in. We import
3,800,000 tons of anthracite, of which only 600,000 tons come from England. Put the duty
high enough so that the Ameriean coal will
net come in and you will help coal development in England. You will get baek your
wheat market too, because in return England
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

will find some way of protecting your wheat
against competitors. I would recommend
everybody to read the paper that Lord
Beaverbrook bas just issued in that conneetion. There is a lot of information in it.
Now, honourable members, I have taken
almost too much time, but I just want te
recall a prophetic view, and perhaps a solution for England and -the United States. I
have lhere an artiole from the Toronto Globe
entitled " The London Naval Wreck." Some
of the older senators will remember a dinner
that was given to Sir Richard Cartwright in
the Houses of Parliament on the occasion of
the fiftieth anniversary of his entry into Canadian public life. With his unequalled elohich was such that the reporters
quencein this House or the other, taking it down
verbatim, never had to change a word-he
reviewed the events of that period and said
that few could have thought that in 1870
Louis Napoleon would be a fugitive from his
capital. Thon, lifting the veil of the future,
with fifty years of intellectual and political
life behind him, lie praphesied that we of the
then younger generation would see a rapprochement between England and the United
States of America, and that the two
f orm
mighty Anglo-Saxon peoples would
such an alliance that any nation or nations
would hesitate before ignoring it. The hour
bas come. If to-day the London Naval Conference eould bring forth su.ch a reunion that
the olid Union Jack and the glorious Stars
and Stripes would be entwined after 155 years
nf separation, we in Canada, being the bond
of union between tihe two great nations, free
from the nightmare of fear and confident in
their might and wealth, could rejoice and be
glad to behold them, under the guidance of
Provid'enee, worhipping the same God,
though at different altars, praying in the sarne
language, and with common idealis and aspirations marching together towards the same
goal-the peace, liberty, haippiness and prosperity of mankind.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACAISSE (transijation):
Honourable colleagues, while I do net wish
to prolong unduly this debate on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, I
cannot refrain fron espressing to the honourable senator from Rockeliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson), on behalif of the Frenchspeakýing people
of this country, our deep appneciation of her
generous gesture in making her first speech
in tihis House in the language that is spoken
by the majority in her native province, whicl
is also one of the two officiai languages of
Canada. And it gives me much pleasure to
say that she has done it with the grace and

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
charm that are so beeoming to the feminine
manner.
I desire also to make a few remarks in
repiy to the very interesting speedh of my
honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien).
(Text) Honourable colleagues, I was just
expressing in a few worda my feeling of deeip
appreciation to thie honourable lady senator
(Hon. Mr. Wilson), whose presence has
graceid this Chamber since l'ast week, and in
doing so I have availed myselIf et the beautiful
language by the use of which she stamped
herself as one of the mesit gracious and broadminded menten of this lihonourabl'e assenbly.
I also compliment the mover of the Address
on his elloquent and able presentation.
Now I wish to refer for a few minutes to
the speech delivered yesterday by my honourable friend and colleague from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The honourable gentleman from De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has already answered a few of the more
important points. I do not hesitate to say
that the honourable senator from Montarville
is going to be the most abundantly quoted
author in the course of the next Federal election. I regret, however, that his words will
be deprived of the dramatic action which
characterizes all his performances on the floor
of this House, and I am afraid that as a result
they will lose much of their effect.
We are about to listen again, with more or
less attention and interest, to the oft reedited song of blue ruin. I challenge my
honourable friends across the floor to lay at
the door of the present Administration the
responsibility for the weather conditions in
the West and to burden them with blame
for the long drought which is too often responsible for erop failures. I was somewhat
surprised yesterday that my honourable friend
from Monbarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) failed
to blame the Government for the Great Flood
and the assassination of the Czar of Russia,
and for all the other calamities that have
taken place between those two events, becàuse,
judging from his remarks, there are very few
evils for which, in the mind of the honourable
gentleman, the present Administration is not
responsible.
Furthermore, surely the present Canadian
Administration cannot be blamed for the stock
fluctuations on Wall street or for the recently
adopted industrial methods--particularly the
principle of mass production and the gradual
substitution of the steel shaft for the human
arm.
I happen to live near a city which is the
third largest industrial centre of this industrial
Province of On:tario; I live a-nost under the

37

shadow of the great Ford industry, and without entering into detaile I want to aive here
to-day just a few figures to show that the
cloud is not as dark as my honourable friend
from Montarville wants us to believe. I have
in my hands a press report stating that while
in the city of Detroit, right across from the
city of Windsor, a single concern a few days
ago was discharging 1,500 men, the Ford Motor
Company of East Wiator were adding to the
number of their workers since the first of
February 1,000 more men. Now, those are
facts, and recent ones; those are the official
figures from the staff of the company.
I mentioned a while ago the adoption of
new manufacturing methods, and particularly
the building or using' of machinery instead
of human help. Apparently the manufacturers
themselves have realized that everything is
not right within their own walls, and here is
a press report publishing the following statement from the lips of Mr. Campbell himself,
the General Manager of the Ford Motor Company of Canada:
President Campbell's statement on Saturday
respecting the operations of the Ford Motor
Company of Canada is decidedly satisfactory.
Approximately 1,000 men have been added to
the company's pay rolls since the first of the
present month and the employment now totale
5,663, on a five days per week basis. With the
new minimum wage scale of $7 this meane that
every workman is making at least $35 weekly.
One of the interesting features of Mr. Campbell's statement has to do with the hope of the
company to stabilize employment at a steadier
level throughout the year, getting away from
some of the seasonal aspects of the businees that
are unfortunate from labor'e standpoint. The
aim is to distribute production over a longer
period of time. This is an excellent plan and
everyone hopes that it will work out well, because it means much to the community as a
whole.
May I add that, according to recent statistics of the Border Chamber of Commercewhich makes a monthly survey of industrial
conditions in the district-1,000 more men
were employed in January, 1930, than in January, 1929.
We should not take too much to heart the

countries are suffering from the same disease
at the present time. Australia has her own
.problems. There is a large number of idle
people in Australia, and in England it has
been a problem that has passed into the
chronic stage. Of course, it is not for us to
interfere with the business of the neighbour,
but it is our paramount duty to keep order
within our own house.
I should like to say a few words with reference to immigration, but my honourable friend
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has

38

SENATE

covered that ground thoroughly well, and I
will not presume upon your patience this
afternoon. If I were invited to express an
opinion, I would simply say that from my
everyday observation in the Border Cities, and
in view of the large influx of foreign population there, I for one wouM favour, not the
raising of our tariff, but what to my mind
is much more important, the shutting of our
gates to stem the flow of immigration. But
as to the exodus of our people to the United
States, let me say for your information and
that of my honourable friend, that for eight
months I have not been called upon as a
medical man to issue a health certificate to
anyone wishing to cross over. Two or three
years ago, long before we encountered such
a terrible period of stagnation, I used to issue
regularly perhaps two or three certificates a
week. Now, I am n ot partisan enough to say
that the reason why our Canadians are not
trying to cross over as usual is that the Administration of this country is making a paradise of it, but I do say that very likely,
indeed undoubtedly, conditions ate not so
good across the river. I should be quite interested in getting from the honourable senator
fron Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) the
real reasons that he lias in his mind in explanation of the fact that in this country we
have, after two or three centuries of thriving
existence, a population of but ten millions,
whereas in the United States, after about the
same number of years, they have a population
of 120 millions. Is it because Canada has had
from the beginning a Liberal administration?
There omust be some other reason. As a
matter oif faot, the one Administration which
clong to powcr longer than any other was a
Conservative Administration.
There was an argument used a few days
ago with reference to the great responsibilities
in dealing with the prohlem of uiem.ployment. It was said elsewhere that it was a
matter for the municipal administrations to
deaI witi first, then the provincial, and thirdly
tîhe federal authorities. I think that opinion
is absolutely a sound one. Just a few days
ago I noticed in a newspaper that in this
neighbouring city of Hull the council had
seen fit to grant sorie manuiifacturers the
privilege of a fixed assessment for a number
of years, and that the opinion of the Mayor
was that it would help grea.tly to bring about
a wave of prosperity, because it would put
that particular industry on a sounder basis,
give more confidence to its managers and
eventually induce them to employ more men.
Here is a munici.pality which bv itself is dealing with the problem of unemployment.
In closing I want to say that at this partilion. Mr. LACASSE.

cular time in the history of our country, it is,
I think, of paramount importance that every
man of influence and every man of action,
instead of singing the song of blue ruin, should
preach -confidence in our resources and in the
brilliant future that is in store for Canada;
and I would rather listen to the revered voice
of one of our greatest and most venerable old
men in this country, Sir William Mulock, who
just a few days ago, at the age of 89, in conoluding a speech in Toronto, said: "I still
have morning in my soul."
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
members, the observations made by the honourable gentleman who has ju.st taken bis
seat indicate to me that lie has undoubtedly
taken some pains to ascertain -the conditions
existing in his own 'ocality, but I question
whether he understands very definitely and
intimately the conditions that exist throughout the rest of Canada. I do not intend to
enter into a long discussion of the statements
made by previous speakers, as I do not wish
to prolong this discussion, but I desire to
refer to what I think are the subjects that
are really interesting to the people of this
country; and they are more serious than sane
honiourable gentlemnen seem to realize.
I did not have the pleasure of listening to
the honourable gentleman from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) yesterday, owing to my
absence from the House, but I judge from the
criticisms that have been made of bis remarks, and from the reiplies, that he must have
paiuted a picture tha.t was pretty nearly truc
to the facts, and perhaps did not altogether
please honourable gentlemen opposite. There
is no gainsaying the fact that the Address
itself is peculiar, in that it varies from anything tîat I have ever heard in the years that
I have been in Parliament, because it deals
almost entirely with the past and makes very
lýittle reference to the future, and such reference is in very indistinct and non-committal
terms.
But there arr- two or three main subjects
which I do think merit discussion and serions
consideration by all the people of Canada,
regardess of political affiliations, because of
the desire on the part of our Canadian people
to discover if possible what is wrong, and why
the conditions are as they are in this young
country, wit its still untapped natural resources, wi-th its virile population, and with
the opportunity it would afford for every person to be employed and happy if proper
policies, so far as governmental activities are
concerned, were in existence. If such policies
can be brought about, surely there is room
for all of the small population that we have
in this country to be gainfully employed.

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
What little I have to say sha1 be directed
first to a serious critioism of the statement
that prosperity continues in Canada. I am
reallyr surprised that any Government dhiould
have the audacity to make a statement of
that sort to the Canadian people under such
conditions as exist in Canada to-day; but
inasmuch as the Government itself, by the
Speech that it placed in His Excellency's
mouth to deliver to Parl.iment, has referred
more to the past than to the future, I take
it that the Government could not and will
not object to some retrospective views covering a few past years.
I think if has been conceded that the
Government ougit not to be too severeiiy
critieized for sins of omission during the first
year or two of its life. I remember very wel
that in the first two years that the present
Government was administering the affaire of
Canada-1922 and 1923-dt was repeatedly
suggested: "Well now, give us time; do not
charge our conduct and the result of it until
a little time has elapsed and the people have
time to see that our policies are succeeding."
That suggestion was generally aocepted, I
think, for 1922 and 1923. Then in 1924, as
members will remember, the
honourable
Prime Mindster cf Canada brought down to
Parliament a policy thaît was stated to be
the means by which real prosperity snd
progress would be brought to the Canadian
people; and I have no doubit in the world
that the Prime Minister and his advisers,
when they formulated and submitted that
policy, were sincere and beldeved what they
said. I want to point out this basic fact,
that, as history records, after every great war
there has been a period of depression, followed
by a period of expansion and development
which has been in almost every case
remarkable. Tihe United States Civil War
perhaps is a case within the recollection of
many. At any rate, that fact s drue in
history and experience. So £rom the end of
1920, when the depression first came to Canada
after the Great War, we had to pass through
that period, and by 192 or 1923 we were
getting past it and were again on tihe uipward
turn. Thien in 1924, as I have sati, the Government of the day broughlt daxwn its policy by
which permanent prosperity was to come to
Canada. Nine years have now elapsed since
the present Governiment ttook office, and I
therefore assume that no fair objection could
be raised to a discussion of what has transpired as a resulit of that policy.
In 1924, in bringing down the Governme.nt's policy, the Prime Minister stated it
very definitely, and lest I sbould err, I should

39

like to quoite the words that he used at that
time. On May 15, 1924, the Prime Minister
said:
The Liberal Party bas aimed at all times
where tariff matters are concerned to reduce
the coet of -living, and also to reduce production
cost by removing in part, and in some cases in
whole, the duties on the implements of production of the basic industries. We are endeavouring in that way to increase production in
the basic industries of agriculture, mining,
lumbering and fishing, with the hope and expectation not only that those industries wili be
benefited, but that the whole manufacturing
industry of the country, which is necessarily
based upon the basic industries, will also be
benefited, the trade, commerce and finance of
the country similarly benefited, and also, but
by no means least, that the consumers of the
country will be benefited through obtaining in
larger quantities and at lower prices the commodities which they require for daily consumption.
In theory, very beautiful indeed. As to its
effect in practice, we shali diseuse that in a
few minutes.
At thait same session of Parliamenit another
principle was laid down as the policy of the
present Government: the Prime Minister
stressed the necessity, in his opinion, of swelling the tide of immigration to Canada and
the Empire ithroughout all that year. He
said, on March 3 of that year:
Of course, during the period of war no effort
was made to bring in immigrants. Immediately
after the war the immigration machinery was
set in motion. The offices on the other side
remained closed. My right honourable friend
did nothing to start immigration to this country during the entire time that he was in office.
As every one knows, immigrants are not brought
to the country in a day; a great deal has to be
done in the way of advertising, in the way of
establishing immigration offices for the purpose
of giving information and the like, and it takes
some little time before a movement wiil begin
to set in f.rom one country to another. When
we came into office, we began immediately to
establish that machinery. We opened offices
in Europe, and particularly in the British Isles,
and to-day we are beginning to see the fruits
of our work in the tide of immigration which
is now setting toward our shores.
Therefore it is apparent that in 1924 this
Government stood for a swelling tide of
immigration and reduction of duties, particularly on the implements of production, to
reduce the cost of living to consumers. Those
who have 'carefully followed the Government's
activities through the succeeding years can
reach only the one ineviiable conclusion,
which is thait this fiscal policy has inareased
the price of the implements of production to
the Canadian farmer, has closed most of the
plants manufacturing them, has created a
monopoly of this trade in the hands of a
few, and increased the impSrtation of these

40

SENATE

implements of production to 'the extent of
400 per cent in four yeam.
W'hat happened' as a resultý of the adoption
of that pollicy? The Governiment was able to
pass the necesary legislation in the session off
1925; that we know; and in 1925 the general
elleiction octeurred, and the farmers of Canada,
who constitute a very liarge and very ianportant ellenent in our society, said: "We will
support that. We will try it ouit. We believe
that might work. If we can get the cost of our
imiplements of production redued, it wil1 be
helpful." The working men and wage-earners
said, "1If a redluction in the cost of living can
be brought about, that wiI be beneficial to
us." I believe these two 'elements in soaiety,
the farmer and the industril worker, were the
determining fa!ctors as te what party should
govern this -country. The Government succeeded in getting a majority that enabled it to
hang on to power by the eyelashes in 1925,
and proceeded, to give effeict to the policies it
had advocated in 1924.
The duties were removed from implements
of production, and I remember very well, and
the records will show, that the Government
forecast a reduction of $30 in the price of an
eight-foot binder. But has any honourabile
member heard of a farmer being able to buy
a binder at a reduction of $30? On the contrary, the records prove that the cost of
binders is higher to-day than it was in 1924.
Instead of receiving a benefit from the removal
of the tax, the farmer has sustained a substantial loss. In 1925, the year this legislation
was passed, implements valued at $6,000,000
were imported into Canada, and the rest of the
machinery that was used on farms was made
in this country by some 52 factories. In 1928,
which is the last year for which statistics are
given in the Year Book, the Government's
own reports show that there were imported
into Canada implements of production valued
at $29,000,000, and meanwhile half a million
of Canadian workmen had emigrated to the
United States in search of employment and
were belping -to make those very implements in
American factories. Therefore in addition to
other losses the farmer was deprived of the
market requirements of half a million of
Canadian citizens who had gone abroad to
earn their living.
The next question that one naturally asks is
whether the cost of living has been reduced.
If honourable members will refer to the reports
issued by the Department of Labour they will
find that in December, 1923, which was not
far from the time when the Government made
its declara-tion of policy to which I have referred, the cost of living for an average
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

famidly was $21.21, and five years later, in
December, 1929, it had risen to $22.11, roughly
a dollar a week increase, despite the promise
made to the people that there would be a
reduction in the cost of living. The farmer
believed be would be able to buy his implements more cheaply, and he was fooled; the
industrial worker believed that it would not
cost him so much to live, and he was fooled.
The increase in the importations of farm
machinery and equipment rose from 61 million
dollars in 1925 to 29¼ million dollars in 1928,
almost 400 per cent. Had the Government
not adopted the policy which was announced
in 1924, had there been no reductions in the
dutios on implements of production, I believe
that the farmer woulid have been able to buy
his implements more cheaply than te now
can, and that we should not have witnessed the
closing of 38 out of 52 factories and the consequent giving of a monopoly in farrm machinery to a few ma.nufacturers, who, in my
opinion, have been able to fix prices.
We perhaps may be able to profit by surveying the result of the Goverment's policy.
The removal of taxes by itariff reduction and
the abolition of sales tax on implements of
production used in agriculture, unfortunately,
did not reduce the prices that the Canadian
farmer had to pay; for the records show that,
notwi,thstanding the rather substantial reduction in production cost, the price of these
implements rose and is higher to-day than in
1924.
May we for a moment view the results of
the Government's fisca.1 ipolicy from the
broader standpoint of the country's trade? I
have referred to it first from the standipoint
of the farmer and the industrial worker, who
are the two most important classes of society
in ithis country. I need not ýdwell longer on
their unfortunate experiences since 1925. But
what has been the effect on the country's
trade 'as a whole? The tariff tinkering process
has resulted in a rise in our imports from
$796,000,000 in 1,925 to $1,109,000,000; that is,
an increase cf $3;12,000,000 for goods whicb
for the most part might have been manufactured in Canada by Canadian workmen.
That night not be so bad if there had been
a corresponding increase in our exports, but
unfortunately during the same period the value
of the goods we shipped to other countries
of the world fell from $1,069,000,000 in 1925
to approximate-ly $990,000,000 in 192 9-a decrease of $79,000,000.
I submit, honourable
members, that these figures show a decline in
prosperity.
Now in what industries did this shrinkage
occur? Was it in agriculture?
If so, the
agricultural industry must have suffered. If

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
the agricultural industry suffered, then the
industrial worker also must have suffered,
because agriculture is a basic industry on
which many others depend. ln the short
period of four years covered by this revised
fiscal policy it has been rather clearly indicated that the cause of our present business
depression and unemployment problems lias
changed a favourable national trade balance
into an adverse one.
A more detailed analysis of the trade situation reveals some further interebting facts,
when we discover what these increased imports consist of. The importations of agricultural produets into this agricultural country increased by fifty-five million dollars. The
importations of animal products into this
grazing country increased by twenty-four
millions of dollars. This country, being an
agricultural, meat-producing and dairying
country, miglit reasonably be expected to
provide most of the food requirements for its
ten million people, but in 1928, $238,000,000
worth of the produce of the soil and $41,000,000 worth of meats of aIl sorts were imported
-an inerease of $37,000,000. These imports
of commodities natural to our country have
contributed substantially to the discouragement of the farmer and to the abolition of
employmient opportunities for farm labourera
and otiher wage-earneen.
Now, besides agricultural produets we iraported, ainong other things, wuod products.
0f course, in most instances these wood products were highly manufactured. Nevertheless, our imports of wood produets in this
land of vast f orests was increased from
$38,000,000 in 192 to $51,000,000 in 1928. At
the samne time the imports of iron and iron
products, which my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) lias referred to, rose f rom $134,Q00,000 in 1925 to 8259,000,000 in 1928. If
those increases of $138,000,00 had not occurred,
and the Canadian requirements of those two
basic commodities had been supplied by Canadian industries and labour, very few, if any,
Canadians would have had to leave their
home land to find employmient elsewhere.
In addition to the unfortunate trade situation, of which the country's false fiscal policy
is the chief cause, two other factors have contributed to create the present lamentable unemploymient situation in Canada. One is the
constant advance of science and invention
in this electrical and mechanical age, wlierein machines are raqidly superseding huinan
labour in industry, and the other is an immigration policy which is obsolete, foolish ini
the extreme, and defeats the very purpose
for whiieh it oughit -to be disign'ed, namelr tihe
protection and welfare of Canadian interests.

We have one-seventh of the world's coal
supply lying under the Province of Alberta
alone. We have also in Western Canada
boundless stores of iron, of oil, of gas and
many other things, ail surrounded by a large
farming community-an ideal situation for
building up a balaneed population and carrying on advantageously the industries of
agriculture and manufacturing. I look upon
the Province of Albierta as the one province
in the West that is going to develop industrially some day. It is the heart of the country west of the Great Lakes, being centrally
situated where it ought to be possible for
industry to prospar and employ several
millions of increased population, wbo wouX1d
provide home markets for the farmers throughout that district.
Last faîl I visited the Turner Valley. I
was there two days and remember full well
the impression made upon me. I trie-d to

some 160--many of them of steel and some
of wood, aîl towering towards the sky. There
were many liuge drilling outfits boring wells,

was a tremendous developmnent, and, one
would say, an evidence of wonderful progress.

and I k-now in my own heart that the Minister of Labour did not do that on his own

A few days afterwards the staitement was
slightdy changed: it was to the effeet that if
there was unemployment it was of no concern
ta the Federal Governmnent, beoause it was
the du'ty of the municipalities and the provinces ta deai with unemployment, and that

forwa.rd a reply from, I think, tlie premiers
in three different provinces, saying that no
such request was ever made ta the Federaà
Governmcrnt, and that they themnselves, on
behalf of their provinces and their people,
urged the Federail Government to carne ta
their assistance in this situation, and it lias not
been done.

Hlowever, when I heard his statement over
tlie air from London to the effect bhat there

the Premier of Canada knew tlie facts lie

A few days later I was in the city cf
Montreal, and in the mornîng paper I saw
an announcement that on that day a relief
station was going ta bie opened on Craig
Street, where the liungry were ta lie fed and
the cold unemployed men were ta lie warmed.
I went down about one o'olock Vliat day ta

women of Canada have had the opportunity
and the responsibility of exercising the franchise, and I am glad to see that they are taking more and more interest in public affairs.
I believe that none of our people are more
deeply interested in the happiness and welfare
of the rising generation than are the mothers
of the children now at school. I believe that
every mother's ambition is that ber child shall
have all the education that be can possibly
get, and that as the child grows up he shall
have a reasonable chance to earn a comfortable living by his own industry in the land
of his birth; and I hope that those women
who read parts of the discussion that has taken
place in this debate here and elsewhere will
give deep and earnest consideration to existing conditions. I trust they will realize the
truc state of existing conditions and rise to
the responsibility when they are given an
opportunity to improve them. What is the
outlook for the hundreds of thousands of
adolescent children who are just about to step
across the threshold into the active struggle
of life in this country to-day? Policies and
theories that were good for days gone by
do net fit modern conditions. The opinions
cf Sir Clifford Sifton on immigration were
perhaps good at the time he formed them,
but they are not suitable nowv; and no one
knows this better than the people in the West,
because they are the most deeply affected.
There must be a more balanced population
throughout the country before we can make
the best of our industrial and agricultural
opportunities, and I believe the farmers
throughout the land are rapidly coming to
that point of view.
May I now make a few remarks with partieular reference to the industrial workers?
It has been my privilege to work for and with
themo, to try to advance their interests, over
a period of many years. They have patiently
swallowed panaceas of the type that was
handed out in 1924. and they have endured
exile froin their native land in order to get
employment. Approximately 800,000 industrial
workers left Canada betweenl 1922 and 1929.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Seven years.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The head tax
exacted by the American Government rose
from $8 in 1921 te $20 in 1924. Ilf we assume
$12 to be the average paid during that time,
the 800,000 emigrants from this country contributed from their alil too meagre resources a
sum of about $9,500.000 for the privilege of
leaving home. During that same period we
received approximately an equal number of
immigrants from foreign countries, and the
Government of Canada expended approxiHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

mately $18,000,000 to induce them to come
here. An interesting book by Robert England,
which has recently been published and is
distributed by the Canadian National Railways, states:
The conbined expenditure of the Dominion
Governnent and the two great railways is not
much less than $5,000,000 annually for immigration and settlement purposes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it not a fact
that most of the people who left Canada to
go to the United States were not born hem,
but came from abroad and used this country
as a sort of gateway?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am sorry that
I have to differ witih mv honourable friend.
The quota elaws seriously restrict the entry
into the United States of non-Canadians, and
the American immigration records refer to
Canadian-born citizens.
Comparatively few
persons born outside this country have gone
from bere across the border, as they were
able to gain admittance only under the quota
law. But there is no longer the same tide of
immigration flowing into the United States
as there was four or five years ago. Why?
Simïply because ten years ago the United
States foresaw what was coming and partly
closed its doors against foreigners from the
whole world, excepting North America. But
in spite of the increase in the head tax and
other measures that were taken with a view
to limiting immigration, the United States
reached about a year ago what might be
called the saturation point, because the use
of machinery in industry had reduced the demand for labour, and because population had
grown tremendously from the natiurail increase
in a counbry of 120 millions of peoplie. So at
the present time ithe United States cannot
absor4b eur suplus labour. Only yesterday I
noticed a newspaper item which stated that
798 Canadlians employed by the City of Detroit had been aibitrariiy dismissed, from their
positions and woulid have to corme back to
Canada in search of work.
Faced as we are with an increase in imports, a decrease in exports, with roughly
100,000 unemployed in the country and
assisted immigration still flowling in, with the
outlet to the United States for our surplus
labour being closed, I submit to honourable
members that the time has come when the
Government of Canada ought seriously to
consider making a very drastic change from
the foolish policy which they enunciated in
1924. Let us endeavour to take a broader
view of the necessities of our own people, and
while doing so support policies on which to

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
build a bronder and better Canada by andi
for ouir own'people first, with good-will
towardsa the people of other countries as a
secondary consideration.
Hýon. Mr. UIAYDON: May I asic tihe honourable

gentleman a question?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Certainly.
Hlon. MT. HAYDON: Would he say that
rncreased protection of industîry would
satisfy?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will say this,
believing it to be absolutely true: thet if we
had increased protection and if in 1924 we
had not decreased our tariffs, hundreds of
thousands of Ganadian workmen would nover
bave 1eft Canada, the Canadian fermer would
have lhed a greatly expandesi market at home,
and there would not -bo the unemoîyment
situation that we have to-day.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: May I asic one more
question? The honourable gentleman will
admit tlho United Stateos is a faiiily hily protect-ed country. How does ho fit his arguruent to the fact tlhat there are four million
unemiployed there to-day?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I say in raply to
my honiourable friend that I have alreadY
answered that very question by stating 1that
the use of machinery in industry ini the
United States, wvhesreby labour is being constantly thqown out of eimployment by the
thousands, plus tihe natural increase, accounts
for the difficulty thoy are having. There are
many employers in the United Ststes who teday are standing for a flve-deiy week or a
six-hour day, saying that it is the only way
in which Vhey will be aible to absorb the popula-tion. Furthei'more, tlhe one country that
lias been aible to prove boyond peradventure
1the benefit of a protoctive poliey la France.
There are not to-day twenty-five thousand
unernployed men in France.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Not for that reason.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable friend does flot want the roason, very
well. I should like to say this, howover. In
every country save France you find a differont situation. Why is Lord Boaverbrook
coming down wîth this new policy in England? In my humble opinion it is because
the British people have corne to the place
where they are beginning te realize that they
must change their policy, oven though it is
a hundred or more years old, and must take
care of thoir own people first, as 1 have been
proposing that Canada should endeavour to
do.
At six o'clock the Sonate took recess.

45

The Sonate resumed- at eigàt o',cllok.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Honourable nembers,
before proceeding with the discussion, 1 wish
to make a few comments in regard to the
rerfnarks made thia afternoon, by thie honourable gentleman from De Lanandière (Hlon. Mr.
Cawra;in) and caîl the attention of this flouse
to what struýck me as being the very remarkable position taken by him. upon several
imnportan't questions.
I would refer first to his criticism wi.th
regard to the rail-way branich lines in the.
Pirovince of Saskabchewan that were taken
ov er snme years ago and embodied in the
Canadian National Railway Systein, and bis
complaint that the guarantees given by the
Provincial Governmenit for construction of
th-ose roads were assumnod by the Federal
Government at the time the lines were taken
over. The faots are -as fie stated -them, :but
it is equatly true that it was flot at the request
of the Province of Saska'tchewan that those
linos wore taken over. The Government of
the -day took thom over for good and sufficient
reasons, and for their own reasons; and, having taken over the property, ît was only
logical that at the sa-me time -they should
asslume the outatu&ndng securities that tihe
province 'had iamued against them. I mighlt
add (that those lines are perbaps the most
profitable lines in the whoile Canadian
National System; so that this -country lost
notlhing by 'the transaction, but on the contrary bolstered up ot-her lines, in other parts
of Canada, which were not se fortuna-te in
lhei-r earnings.
I -can hardly roconcile the critioism coming
from my honouraible friend from the Province of Quebetc in tihis regard. Honourable
mnemfbers of this Cheimber wiii recal llhat a
3-car or two eg-lthink it was during the
lagt session-legisietion went through this
Flouse appropriating the enormous sumn of
a.bout $28,000,000 for the purpose of purchasiïig a number of raleýoade i the Province of
Queoc which the Governmengt knew, und
which we knew, had neyer paid their way,
and which probably will nover pay their way,
and which are known fromn one end of this
cnuntry to the ot.her as the cats and dogs
that were gathered in by the Canadien
National Railway Syotem at thait timne. I cdd
not hear any crîticism f£rom the Province of
Saskatchewan because of tihe Go-vernment's
action; and I think it would have corne with
botter grace from gentlemen from somne othor
province than Quebec ta suggest, norw that
the Province of Saskatchewan is closing the
transaction for taking over its public resources, thiat tihe guairantees assumed by tile
Foderal Goverisment in exechange for those

46

SENATE

branch lines in Saokatchewan shou'id ha considered a.s a claim against the province in
the deul.
That d1ai~m lias neyer been
urged before. I shcyul like to know whetiher
the honourable gentleman spoke on behaif of
the Gov.ernment of the day when making that
suggestion, and whotbar, when we get to grips
on the financial features of the resources question, we are ýto be confronted wit-h a bill for
the subsidies given 'to ýbrancb line ra-iways in
Saska tchewan.
Another feature of bis remarks to which I
wvould draw attention is the question of the
operations of tlbe Wheat Pool. I propose to
deal wvith that at greater Iength later on, but
possibly I might; mention some aspects of it
at the present time. Hie laid particular cmphasis on the statement that the wheat pools
were speculating on margin and that the
banks had caiied for more margins. I took
occasion to contradiet that statement at the
time, as I knew it was not correct, but since
the House rose I have been abie to locate
some officiai records whjch will substantiate
my statement. This is the officiai statement
issued by 'the pools in, regard, t'o their dealings
with the banks:
Stummarizing, the pools' margin with the
banks is stili weii maintained, which means that
the pools have on deposit with the banks
collaterai valued at more th-an 15 per cent in
excess of the present bank loans to the pools.
A conference was held by the Prime Minisf crs -of tbhe tfire Prairie Proîvirsees in order
to determine the form of the legisiation that
it was necessary to pass in the varinus legislatures, giving effeet to the verbal and letter
agreenments in that respect, and the statement
issued by tbcm is as follows.
Jo the meanti-me, the Governiments desire to
make plain that this action is only in order to
supplemeo.t the undertaking already arranged
and not because of any impairment of the pools'
margin with the .banks or because of any doubt
of the pools' financial position, as the pools
have at present on depesit with the banks collateral valued, at current market prices, at
more than 15 per cent in excess of the total of
the banks' boans to the pools.
These officiai statements successfully dispose
of the honourable gentleman's dlaim thac the
pools have been speculating beyond their
means, that they have attempted to corner
the wheat market, and that the serious trouble
that now overshadows the wbeat market is
attributable to too ambitious a scheme on
the part of the pools and to bad management
on their part.
It is flot my intention to enter into a detaiied examination of the Speech from the
Throne, as the opportunity to discoss it more
in defail will corne kater on, as the session
progresses. At the outset of the brief remarks
Honyr.
Mr. LAIRD.

I Propose to make, may I take this opportunity
of extending a welcome to our distinguished
colleagues who have just becomne members of
this -Chamber, the honourable gentleman from
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke) and the bonourable liady fr~om Roickclliffe (Hon. Mrs. WiLgorL).
The honourable gentleman from Brandon
bas been much in the public eye for many
years, and needs no introduction to, the members of this Huse. We are glad to welcome
such a distinguîshed addition to our numbers,
and to, sec him so, happy and comfortable in
bis new envirofiment. I gather from some
of the honourable gentleman's speeches which
I have read somewhere at some time, that hie
did flot always possess the same friendly feeling towards this Chamber tbat hoe apparentiy
dîoes to-day. ln f set, as I reeall1 it, he considered the Senate rather as a fifth wbeel to the
coach of state, whioh could easily he dispensed
with without boss to the country. Howevcr,
we ail know the old adage that circumstances
miter cases, and let us hope that what to him
at one time appeared a very unnecessary and
useless body wiib now become a most important and indispensable part of our parliamentary institutions. No doubt my honourabie
friend's appointment was part of the generai
sebeme of things wbereby the Senate was to
ho reformed; but wbatever was the basis of
it,' we extend the band of feblowsbip to him
and trust that bie xvill have many years of useful service before him.
While we are ail glid to welcome the honourable member from Brandon, I think even
hie will agree wbcen I say that, we are doubly
glad to. welcomecour lady colleague, whom we
designate by the dqstinguisýhing tible o-f the
honourable lady from ]Rockcliffe.
Our only
regret on this sida of tbc House, pcrbaps, is
to see ber so comfortahly seated to bbc right
of the Speaker. 1 would advise my hono-urable friends opposite bo treat her well, for
womnen are somebimes fickle in their friendships, and she wclýl knows that, meb.aphorically
speaking-, our arms are outstretchcd bo bar,
and we sh-ah ha oniy too glad to weicome bier
bo a seat on this side sbould bier firat love
grow cold or in-differenit to bier.
In tbe midst of bier great, triuýmph as the
flrst woman senator in the Dominion 1 would
rcmind beýr that ber appointment involves
a, sacrifice of at, Ieast some of thbe timehonoured prerogabives that women have anjoyed from time immamorial. One, of theoe
privileges is that of saying the lasb word. I
would suggest to beýr that this privilýege, by
practice and tradition, :is accorded to the ýGoveýrnmenb leader in thîs Huse, and sbe wili
now bave to bow to the inevibable and allow
a mere man to exercise this priviiege in

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
future. Trained in the strict sehool of domesticity, she bas no doubt exercised for many,
many years, this right which she now relinquishes, and the pang invol*ved in saýying farewell to it rnust be painiful îndeed. Stili, this
does flot mean that parliamentary rule shall
govern in ber own bousehold, an~d she will
continue to exercise the wornan's privilege
in the enlvironiments of fier own ho.me as beretofoire.
The appointmnent of a wornan to membership in the Senate is an 'historie evenit. Neyer
bas it occurred before, and it sign-alizes a new
departure which oarries with it great significan.ce, as it constitutes the recognition of
women's rights not heretofore recogn'ized.
While this is true, it is perhaps well that we
should have an understanding Of the significance of ber appointment. In lier delightful
address, with which we were charrned, she
claimed to, be "~the represen'tative of the
women of Canada" in this Chamsber. While
not for a moment daring to enter into any
controversy on -the subjet-for I knKow from
experience how useless such argument usuafly
is--may I point out that our fair colleague
is hardly correct in so designating herself.
She is a senator front the Province of Ontaxio,
and is one of the representatives in this
Chember of al the people of Onbario, men,
women and chi1dren. She stands in a position
no different from. that of any other member
of tihis Huse: no one of us rerpresents any
partieular 'chass, creed, OT sex, bult eac.hmeniber
is liere to speak foir ali the people. It is possibile thet in thbe effluxion cg turne 'ladly senators
may be appointed from. my Orwn prOVinCe Of
Saskatchewan, and I should regret very znuoh,
in that event, being de4prived, of the honour
and privilege of representing the woinen of
Saskatchewan as well as the men and the
childTen. I arn f orced to challenge, as courteously as I inay, my honourable lady friend's
dlaim to represent the wornen of Canadia, for
fear that, if it is lof t unch-alcnged, other
women may repeat similar dlaims in othier
provinces, and it may become a recognized
principle.
May I conclude my references to ber by
saying that this delighbtiul gesture in the
direction of Senate reform is welcomred witb
joy and approval by ail of us, and partidulorly 'hy members on this side of the House.
I wish to congratulate the mover of the
Address in reply (Hon. Mr. Horsey) for 'bis
very careful and considerate presentation of
the case on behaif of the Goverument. I was
very much encouraged by the rosy picture
whfidbh be painted of the prosperity of the
country, sbowing that 1929 was the most productive year this country bas ever bad, and

47

that our enormous foreign trade was eonstantly
increasing. He referred in glowing terms to
the way in whicb. our interests are being looked
ai ter in various parts of the worid by trade
commissioners sent out by the Government
He told us, too, the banks, insurance eompanies and industrial concerns had enjoyed
enorm-ous earnings and prosperity. Taken as a
whole, bis rernarks bad a very cheer-ful effect
upon me, because 1 had heard somewhat disquieting rumours as to conditions in the
country, wbich caused me rnuch concern.
When I left this Chamber and went to my
hotel, I met a gentleman fromrn y hborne city
of Regina, and in the course of conversation
with birn I learned that lie was one of a
delegation of representatives of every Canadian city frorn Fort William to Vancouver,
who bad corne to Ottawa to ask tbe Government for assistance in the relief of unemployed men and their 'families. Naturally I
was very much surprised to hear this, and I
made furtber inquiries of this gentleman. He
told me tbat in Regina, whioh b-as a poipulation cf about 60,000, the city is supporting
450 families, that in tbis relief work $40,000
'bas aiready been spent, and it is expected that
this figure will be in.creased to 870,000 before
the winter is over.
Wben I heard tbese things I began to fear
that there was something wrong witb the
very assuring statement my bonourable
friend made in this House at thbe very time
that the deputation was presenting its dlaims
for assistance from the Federal Government
on the ground that destitution had become
so widespread that the provinces could no
longer cope with it and the inatter was of
national concerfi.
The bonourable mover of tbe Address
quoted figures in support of bis statement that
our foreign trade was growing satisfactorily.
I was very pleased to bear that, because, like
rnost Canadians, I arn sincerely interested in
the welfare of this country, but unfortunately
I was again doometd to disappointment. That
very afternoon I heppened to run across official
records relating to our foreign trade., and I
.found that in 1926 we had a favourable trade
balance with the rest of the world of
8275,000,000, t-hat in 1927 it bad dropped to
$151,000,000, wbich. figure was maintained approximately in 1928, but in 1929 there was
a complete change, and we bad an adverse
'balance of trade of 890,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my honourable friend realize how different those
figures would baïve been if the western croro
had found its way to Europe as usual?

48

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It may be that there
are certain factors which will in part explain
these figures. I have not made a sufficiently
deep analysis of the situation to be able to
speak definitely as to that. I am merely
stating the fact, which is that an adverse
balance of trade of some $90,000,000 exists,
and this is very much to be regretted, whatever may be the circumstances, as I think my
honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) will agree.
The honourable mover of the Address referred to our " continuing prosperity," and
observed:
It is true that the Speech from the Throne
deelares that sone slowing up occurred in the
increase of prosperity during the last month
or two of 1929, due to seasonal slackness and
the withholding of some 200,000,000 bushels of
wheat, by the wheat pools and grain merchants
generally, I presume.
My honourable friend was apparently under
the impression that the fact that 200,000,000
bushels-or, to be more correct, 250,000,000
bushels-of the western wheat crop have not
yet been sold, is responsible to a considerable
degree for the general depression throughout
the country. Now, with all deference to him,
I submit that he is mistaken in that point
of view, because when a farmer delivers a
load of wbheat he reiceives from the Pool an
advance of $1 a bushel on the basis of No. 1
Northern, receiving further instalments when
the grain is sold, according to the prices
realized by the Pooil. It cannot be said that
the present unfortunate conditions are due,
to any appreciable extent, to the fact that
the farmers have received only $1 a bushel
for their wheat, because there have been many
years in the past when that was the full price
paid.
A statement recently issued by the Bank
of Montreal in this regard deals pointedly
with this phase of the matter, as follows:
It is not from the unmarketing of last season's crop the prairie ftarmers suffer and business activity is curtailed, but by reason of the
near-failure of the harvest in many fields and
an aggregate yield less by half than that of the
previous year. Upon the crop gathered,
growers received a substantial payment several
months ago-in the case of Pool members a
dollar a bushel, No. 1 Northern basis-and their
concern is now the ainount of the final payment
to be mjade to them. The price at which the
supply carried over is ultimately sold will determine this, but for the smaller crop of 1929
farniers have received as rnuch, proportionately,
as for the previous harvest.
Buit what is worrying us most in Western
Canada at the present lime is that the
very existence of the Pool is at stake.
It is a very important organization, with
enormous assets in thousands of interior eleHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

vators and a number of costly terminal
elevators, and if it should cease operations the
farmers would suffer greatly through being
deprived of the service that it affords. I am
glad I have the opportunity cf correcting the
opinion of my honourable friend from De
Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Casgrain).
He apparently has the same idea that is held by
many other people. The facts are that in
the Prairie Provinces 45 per cent of the total
crop is raised by non-pool farmers who sell
their grain in their own way, and it is highly
probable that their crops have been turned
into cash long ago. The 160,000 farmers who
constitute the membership of the pools produce 55 per cent of the total crop. The
Pool owes a smal final payment on, the crop
of 1928, and also whatever payment is due
over $1 a bushel for the crop of 1929, and it
still has in its possession approximately
250.000,000 bushels of wheat unsold, which the
banks are carrying. In addition, it is faced
with the prospect of another crop coming on
the market within five or six months, and in
the meantime it will be necessary to market
the 250,000,000 bushels at present on hand, in
competition with crops coming from other
parts of the world.
Another feature of the western situation
which does net appear to have been given
much consideration is that whereas the farmers
formerly have been able to finance their operations in the spring by using the payments
they receilve from the Pool, this year they will
be without such assistance and will be forced
to go to the banks for money to finance the
putting in of their crops. The banks are already heavily drawn upon, and if they have
to make further advances to the farmers in
the spring, the resulting scarcity of money will
be felt all over the country. The banks have
not called for margins, as I think I have
clearly shown from the statements I have read,
although an honourable gentleman suggested
this afternoon that such a call had been made.
The whole situation in Western Canada is
undoubtedly extremely serious and the Governments of the three Prairie Provinces have
stepped in and guaranteed the banks against
loss that might be incurred in carrying the
crop. The provinces took this action quite
voluntarily when they realized just how acute
the situation was. The ambitions of the western fa.rmers have been realized to a very
large extent in the formation and operation
of -the Pool, and nie one knows better than
those who live in that part of the country
what a disaster it would be if the pools
could not continue to carry on. But the
difficulty is net confined to the West; the

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
buiness stability and genieral welfare of the
whole Dominion are iniwolved.
Just wbat the solution of thbe problem will
be, only turne can tell. It is -te first time
in our history that we -have been daced witb
such a situation, aand whiie te present grave
circumstan-ces continue, it behooves all who
have the true interest of the country at beart
to avoid captious criticism as far as possible.
But of course there bas been complaint, and
it has 'been asked, "Who is to blame for thbe
existing situation?" and "Why did the Pool
not seIl as inucit as possible of the wbeat at
from $1.60 down to $1.35 while the price was
declinimg?" Some people bave even gone s0
far as to charge thaï lie Pool tiiied to 'corner
thbe market and to witbhold the wbeat until
te prices rose. But I wish to state empahatieally that ut no, trne, witbin te last firve
montits bave tbe wheat pools of Western
Canada refused to sel'l anyr portion of the
ecrop that remained on t>hei.r bandis at tbe
regular market price as indicated on the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange. It is possible thte
present difficulty is caused in part by the fact
tbat tbe w'theat pools dercided it wouid' he in
their interest to discontinaue using lte Winnipeg Grain Exchange fior seliliug faoililties, and
instead to establish tiheir own selling sgt-ies.
lI accordance with that decision, they looated
their own selling agencies in all the wbeat
purchasing countries of the worid, and wbetber
tbis procedure bas been one of tbe causes
of the present state of affairs, time will proibably tell. But I wish to repeat mýy statement,
w'hich. oannot be succesofully challenged, that
at no time witbin, the lastfive yeýars bas te
Wheat Pool decilined to seli any portion, large
or amail, of its holings of wheat on the
hasis of the ruling price on the Winnipeg
Exohange at the time. In Oact, lit wouldi have
been giad to do, it.
There bas been a great development in the
grain business in Western Canada, and no
co-operative movement can assume the great
proportions of titis company wititout itaving
developecl animosities among other business
interests, cûmenifitirve or other; and 1 suippose it is a feature of all business that we may
expect criticism and suggestions titat are not
always fair. We may expect statements to
be made which possîbly are not founded on
fact, and reports to be circulated wbich are
not always intended to promote the welfare of
tLhe wbîeat pools. I imagine this bas been doue
in tbis case, and it bas belped to accentuate
te situa-tion that now exists in Western Canadà. I tbink Vhey possibliy made a inistake
in not gîving to thte world tbe information tbat
they have been ready at all times during the
past five months to selI any portion of their
holdings at the market price.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What prevented that?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 1 cannot understand wby
they did flot make that announcement; but
for some reason it was flot made until it was
made in Parliament the other day, although
I was informed of it as 1 was coming down
to the opening of this Huse.
In the shadow of what might easily become
a financial ca!l!mt5 ini this O~ountry, and i
view &~the large h.oldings reipresenited by the
wheat pools, the marketmg of whifd inivolves
so muoh, honouribMe gientlemnen should be
careful in rnaking staitements that may have
a f ar-reiching effect snd do mundi injury.
Under the circumstances the provincial governments had no hesitation whatever in lending assistance, and in my opinion they were
right. If they had flot done so, their inaction
migbt have led to serious consequences in the
country. The situation now bas become s0
widespread in its import that to my mind it
approximates a national issue. Provincial governments have their limitations, and it is just
a question whether conditions are not of sufficient national significance to warrant the
partâiVpatdon cdf tihis Governiment wMt a view
to doing something to relieve the situation. I
have been a little surprised that such an interest bas not been taken before by this
Governgmen't. The three Prairie Provinces are
represented in the Government by five ministers, two of whom occupy the important portfolios of Finance and Agriculture, and if anyone should be able to keep in touch with the
situation and bave a true appreciation of it,
surely those two ministers sbould. Possibly to
those gentlemen the situation bas not assumed
the dangerous proportions that it has to those
of us who lîve nearer the scene of operation,
or it is possible tbat they may bave under
consideration some general scheme for solving
it. There was a time during the war when
the national Government stepped in and took
over the control of the wbeat crop in Canada
for the public welfare. I believe that in some
respects the sitiuation is more serious at preselit
than it was at that tîme-but for other reasons,
of course-and I sbould like to suggest to the
Government that they should take a keener
intcrest in tbis subject tban tbey apparently
have done up to tbe present time. Perhaps
sooner or later-and it bas been suggested
witbin the last few days that it will be sooner
rather than later-this Government will go to
the western farmer and ask for bis encouragement and support. Then it will be for those
people to ask some very pertinent questions
of the Government as to wbat tbey bave done,
or offered to do, or wbat they bave suggested
in this emergency.
It is not for me to suggest wbat tbey can
do. We bave read in thbe Speech froïm the

50

SENATE

Throne about trade 'commissioners who have
been located in the different countries of the
world. We are aware of the brade treaties
that this Government have made with various
countries, some of whi-ch have recently put
into effect tariffs against our wheat-in one
instance of 56 cents a bushel, and in another
of over 70 cents-and it is possible that the
Governmaent might say te those countries:
"Is it not about time that we made some
revision of these treaties? If you are going
to virtually prohibit the importation of wheat
into you'r country, is it not time that we
withdrew some of the privileges that we accord to you in our market?" At least the
question could be dealt with by 'the Governnient as a national question, in an effort to
sec whether something could not be done to
extend our sales in comuntries whose prohibitive tariffs have closed their markets to us.
I have concluded what I have to offer on
This subject, and I would urge upon the
Covernment in the strongest and sincerest
possible way that if there ever was a time
when the farmers of Western Canada required
assistance and encouragement and some suggestion from the national Government, it is
the present time; and if some such encouragement is not given the Governrment will have
some serious questions to answer when they
go to those people and ask for their support.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable members,
first I wish to refer very briefly to · he statet
ment made by the honourable mover of the
Address in reply te the Speech from the
Throne (Hon. Mr. Horsey), in which he referred to the provinces down by the Atlantic
Ocean. He said:
Freight rates have been lowerecd twenty per
cent, not only on the Canadian National Railways but on the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
on all the branch lines in the Atlantic district.
It is calculated that this has already resulted
in a saving of some three and one-half million
dollars to the people of the Maritime Provinces.
That statement, standing alone and without
explanation, might convey to those not
familiar with all circumstances the idea that
the remission of those freight rates to that
extent was a very generous contribution to the
welfare of the Maritime Provinces. I wish
to make this explanation. From the year
1916 to the year 1920 the freight raies on the
railways in Canada were largely increased,
and on that part of the National System
which was formerly calied the Intercolonial
they were increased twenty per cent more
than on any other part of the National
System. The reduction recommiended by the
Duncan Commission was just to take off
that excess increase in ates. I presume
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

that the honourable gentleman in his calculation of three and one-half million dollars
referred to one year only. If the reduction
amounted to that sum for one year, then
there would be a considerable amount due to
the Mari-time Provinces because of the unjust
rates that ha-d existed for several years. The
mere taking off of the twenty per cent of
the excess increasedi rates did net square the
account.

I have listened attentively to the speeches
mide by different honourable gentlemen,
particuliarly those of the honourable menber fnom Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who always speaks well, the honourable member for Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the honourable gentleman who has
just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Laird). I think
they all hold the idea that the balance of
trade is a good barometer te show whether
a nation is making money or is trading unfavourably; that, for instance, -if the balance
of trade is in our flavour it is proof that we
are trading suacesfully; that if it is against
us, it 'is proof that we are trading unsuecessfully. I think that idoes not follow; a great
many other factors have to be taken initio
acicount; and I think that if the meimbers of
this House couild agree iuipon a fundamental
principle we should then be more likely to
cone closer together in regard to the details.
I wili try to show by illustration that the
statement I have made in regard to the
balance of trade is correct, and I would ask
my honourable friends to please give me their
attention. Take any commodity. Take the
article of wheat for example. For the sake
of easy computation I will take one hundred
thousand bushels at a price of $1 a bushel.
Say that some Canadian shipped that cargo
to London or Liverpool and sold it at a profit.
I do not care what the profit is-say twentyfive or fifty per cent. Suppose he sold it for
$150,000-that would be an excellent profitand instead of bringing back the money or a
bil of exchange he invested' it in merchandise:
the export entry would be $100,000 and the
import entry would be $150,000. In that case
the import would be fifty per cent greater
than the expert. He made an excellent bargain, he profited well, and his country necessarily profited to the same extent. The reverse of that, of course, would be truc if he
sold at $75,000, or a loss of 25 cents a bushel,
and brought back $75,000 worth of merchandise. In that case the expert entry would
be $100,000 and the import entry $75,000, and
the balance of trade would be in our faveur,
although the merchant might be nearly ruined
and his country would have made a loss. I

FEBRUARY 27, 1930
think that is conclusive in showing that you
cannot always take what is called the balance
of trade as proof that you are trading successfully or unsuccessfully. 0f course that would
apply te trade in ahl articles, let them be
what they may.
Trade is in itself a good thing. Trade is
what differentiates, largely at all events, the
civilized man frora the savage. Trade differentiates the progressive nations front the unprogressive, and the more trade we do the
more progressive we are. Goveroments do
not trade with one another, except perhaps
to some extent in time of war, when everything is upset. In normal times trade is carried on hiy individualls, cosnpanies or ooporations; and no two men living, no two entities
in existence, will, engage i., trade unlese they
1
think it is going to be to tiheir mutna
advantage. Thiey snay be mnistaken. At ail
events tJhis is correct, that no two individuals
or entiities wil'i continue in trade unless it is te
their nu-tual advantage. And. if tihose indhiduals or entities beilong to diff erent nations
andi are trading to their nwutual advantage, it
f.ollows as the night follows thie day thlat their
trading muot be to the adivantage of their
respective countries, let the trade balances
be what they may. Therefore, business men,
merchants, traders, are the best judges of
whether bradýe is profitable or not, and,
according to my belief, the interference of
Éovernments in trade matters should be very
little. They can help, but by unwise interference they can aiso do a great deal of harm.
There is, I think, a sure mcthod of arriving at
a conclusion as to whether a country is trading profitably or not. In my opinion there
is nothing mysterious or abstruse about trade
or political economy. It is absolutely the
same as individual economy.
Noiw, ithis is the proposition I will lay, down.
Providing the counJtry is paying for ail it
imparts, paying ail -its eu'rren.t obligations, increasing .the value of the estate, paying off its
debts, and not going into debt, its trading la
profitable. I th-ink that statement is as true
as the m'ultiplication table, or as any axiom
in Euohid.
I will trouble the H-ouse weith veiry f ew
figures, bosu&se soémehow or other figures ca.n
be manipulated to prove almost an5rthing, but
if honourai>le gentlemen final any flaw in the
figures I subm.it or in the reason.ing I arn
trying to niake, 1 shahi be glad to know it,
beicause I wanit to be righit in this rnatter if
possible.
Now, -taL-ing aur position in Canada for the
['ast lem, years, I thrnk it cannot be disputed
that we have been pay.ing off the national
2425-4k

51

debt. I have net thie figures, but my impression is that the reduotion has 'been around
$58,000,000 a year; perhaps a littie more. Some
time ago, I heard the statement that il we
continiied paying at our presenit rate we sflould
wipe out -our n.ationial debit entirely in iorty'
years. And while we are doing that we are
pay.ing off ail our other obligations.
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is my ho-noura<ble friend keeping in mind the fsot that
the Government of Canada have endorsed, by
way of gua.rantee on the raia account,
larger amounts arhan have been paid off on
thc pliblic debt during the last few years?
For Which the
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
National Ilailways are responsible.
H!on. Mr. ROBERTSON.- But the Govcrnme'at of Canada are the guarantors of the
notaes.
Hoin. Mr. HUGHES: I know they are the
endo,.rsers-, but if the value of the rail.ways
bias been increaeed to the extent of the
hcerowing, then the counitry is not -t.he po>orer.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If; thait is right.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: We are increasing
the value of the estate; we are incereasing our
national wealth very rapidly, aooording te the
figures obtaint-d from the Staitistical Branch of
the Depaitiment ici Tradie and Commerce, bobli
per capit!a and absoluitely. Here are the
figures. The per oapita wealth in 1921 ws
$2,525; in 1925, $2,772; in 1926, $2,842; in
1927, 12,907. Our national wealith. in 1921
Ivas $22,195,000,000; in 1925, $25,673,000,000;
in 1926,$26,691,000,000; in 1927,627,668,000,000.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Ail based upon
tlie 1921 census, was it?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The first table I gave
was based on the population.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Was the capital
ýwealth based on the 1921 population -or based
en the population of the years quoted?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I cannot say as to
that. In six years our total national wealthi increased frein 22 to 27 'billions-over five and
a quartier billions. 1 do not know the figures
regarding other count-ries, for I bave not had
time .to obtain thora, but I think ou.rs mouet

aots are ungraitifying, and I think these ýf
answerable. I think such -a coraparison is a
reliable test -as t-o whetber we are progressing
or receding.
I have sometimes heard the statementnot ini this debate, though I think it in a

52

SENATE

natural inference from. mueh that is saidthat one nation can swarnp another with cheap
goods. I want to imake a very ibrief remark
a'boul that idea. It is flot practictable, and
un-der world conditions it is flot possbhe, for
any nation Vo do that. But if it were possible,
what harma would it do? Suppose that some
other nation-I do flot care which. one-miade
up its mmnd to swamp us with goods, that is,
to give us goods for nothing at aillVo give
us ail the food and ciothing we needed and
flot to charge us anything. Surely that would
flot be an enem.y nation. It wouid be the
most generous nation in the world so far as
we were concerned, for we should have its
people as servants, as slaves, and they could
flot object. But, since of course that wou'id
flot be possible, let us suppose they gave us
f ood and clothing at fifty per cent of what
they were worth. That would ýbe a very generous aet. They would have to take something in payment, and ini doing so they would
not injure our industries. The fear that some
obher nation will banm us by selling us cheap
goods is the greatest fallacy in the world.
In busiriess it is not practicable for any nation
Vo injure us in that manner, and it is neyer
even tried in any lar'ge way. In the last
ana lysis trade is barteýr. Nations or inýdividuals cannot in the long nîn selI unlc'ss they
buy. There mus, be ýbarter and by' that
means and nc other can a nation deal properly anrd successfully.
May I illustrate that point? At the close
of the war the nations of Europe, particularly
Great Britain, were hcavily in debt te the
United States. Great Britain is making a
lierculean effort to meet that obligation, but
the derbt will have te be paid in kind or
it will ccx er be paid at ail, for it cao bc
paid in no other way. I -will endeavour te
explain that. The United States axe opposed
Vo taking goods in payment, because that
methýod( would injure their industries. The
only thing left is go'ld, which has an international value, and tbey have to takc payment iii that. When they geV more gold than
t.he7 wanit Vo use, the balance is of ne use
at ail; tbey have te dig isoles in the ground,
and] lino those hoies with cornent wall-s, and
ha;ve steel doors on them, and appoint mon
with shotguns te guard the dooýrs. Thev
might as well have shore sand or stene there.
That geid at some time or other has te be
taken oct and ex'ehanged 'for goods. If it
were nover taken eut, it would never be worth
anytihing. The United, States did neot want biset
meney, and they did net keep it; they immediately lent it te other countries; iargely
te Germany, and in some measure, te France.
At some time, lot it be fifty or a hundred or
"-u. Mir. HUGHES.

a thousand years f romn now, they will be
obiiged te take payment in kind for the
capital and interest, or they will never geV
payment at ail.
If the interest goes on
accumuiating in Europe and they nover coiboct any part of that, and nover collect the
capital, of eourse the debt is nover paid.
The eniy value that a trading nation is te
geV is by exehange in goods. Ail profit is
made by taking goods fromr where they are
cenîparativeiv' che-ap te whero they are coinparativoiy dear.
I Vhink it weuid foiiow from that-I arn
net suro-that ail nations of the worid ceuid
trado xvith one anether, and the imports ef

becauso they were ail seiling at a profit. I
bave tried te lay down whatappeared te me
te ho the fundamentai principies of trading,
and if we couid agree on these we might corne

It xviii bo neticed that the figures I gave

the latost I couid geV fromn tise Statistical

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But I would
draw the attention of my honourable friend
from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) to the
fact that there were more men employed in
industries in Canada in 1929 than there wore
in 1925.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
should there not be?

Certainly. Why

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: We lose one child

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There has been
a steady movement for twenty-five years to
the New England States.
-Ion. Mr. HUGHES: On January 1 of this
year, aocording to the table ýfrom which I
have been quoting, the index figure stood at
111.2. Now, is there any other country that
is doing better than that? I should like to
read a brief statement which appeans in the
Labour Gazette on page 197:
The losses in employment registered im manufactures were larger than on January 1, 1929
and 1928, but smaller than in most other years
on record. The index, though slightly lower
than at the beginning of 1929, was considerably higher than January 1 in any other year
since 1920.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear. That
does not look like blue ruin.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No, I should not
gather from that statement that there was
very little employment in this country. The
number of persons employed in industries has

explains to some extent the departure of
people from our country. Then, again, the
large American cities are undoubtedly a strong
attraction, and Canadians, because of their
character and fibre, seem to make a greater
success there than people from any other
country.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Has my honourable friend not heard that members of Congress are bitterly com-plaining because the
number of Mexicans coming north into
the United States has been larger than the
number of Canadians going south?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: There can be no doubt
that we have been progressing. Honourable
gentlemen opposite say that we are not going
ahead as quickly as we should, but it is admitted that our farmers are better off than
those of the United States. It is commonly
said that agriculture is the basic industry of
this country and that if the farmers are
prosperous everybody else must be prosperous.
Well, no one can deny the prosperity cf our
farmers, but we are asked to adopt a system
that has not operated in the best interest of
the farming communities of the United States.
I say we should be extremely careful before
we take any such action. It is hard to get
a Scotsman to believe that a policy that has
brought about the conditions existing in the
country to the south of us would be a good
policy for Canada. We should enact legislation that experience has shown is best suited
for ourselves. I am reminded of a story I
read somewhere, in which Canada was compared to a man who was persuaded by a patent
medicine vendor to purchase a bottle or two
of an alleged remedy. The man did not live
long afterwardls, and on his tombstone there
was written: "I was well; I wanted to be
better; I took some medicine, and here I am."
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is what the
unemployed say now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Canada is well, compared with the United States, but we are
asked to take the medicine that has brought
about unhealthy conditions in that country.
I have in my hand what I think is excellent
proof that every province in the Dominion
has been enjoying good times. In January
there was a Conference of Provincial Premiers
in this city, and interviews with them were
published in the Ottawa Evening Journal on
January 14. It is not necessary for me to
say that these Premiers are not aIl of one
stripe of politics: some of them are Liberal
and some Conservative. If honourable members will permit me, I shall read some brief

extracts from their statements. Here is what
Prime Minister Saunders, of my own province, Prince Edward Island, said:
The island is, however, prosperous; 1929 has
been a successful year.
I can bear personal testimony to that. And
the Premier said further:
To the year 1930 we look forward with conOur people, in comfidence and optimism.
mon with Canadians generally, are conscious of
that urge resulting from a sense of past achievenients and the promise of great destiny in
store for Canada.
Prime Minister Rhodes of Nova Scotia
said:
There has been a distinct improvement in
conditions surrounding our steel-coal industry
and prospects for stabilized winter employment
are most promiising. Real progress has been
achieved in the development of our mines other
than coal, notably at Stirling, in Cape Breton,
where the zinc-lead deposit has about reached
the point of regular production, and in the
further development of our gold mines and the
Malagash salt industry.
Taken as a whole the outlook for the coming
year is distinctly bright. I am fully confident
that marked as has been our progress during
the past few years, there are even better
things in store for this province. Our future
is assured. The extent of our progress and
prosperity depends largely upon the amount of
individual effort which we are prepared to put
forth.
And here is what Premier Baxter of New
Brunswick said:
New Brunswick has enjoyed one of the most
prosperous years our people have ever known,
with agricultural
and inclustrial
activity
especially narked and a substantial upbuilding
taking place in vi'rtually overy field of development.
I am sure my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will be glad to
hear that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Brunswick?

That was New

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes. That part of
Canada is not going to the dogs. Premier
Baxter went on to say:
The financial position of the province has
been markedly improved this year by the successful culmination of negotiations which had
been in progress for some time to have the
Saint John Valley Railway taken over fron
the province by the Federal Governrment as
part of the Canadian National Railways System.
Premier Taschereau of Quebec said:
In spite of many counteracting factors, general prosperity has prevailed throughout the
Province of Quebec during 1929. Much advance
has been made in some of the most important
domains, notably in agriculture.
That is all right for Quebec. Here is what
Premier Ferguson of Ontario said:

During the past year Ontario has maintained
the steady progress that has long been aharacteristic of this province. In all important departments there has been satisfactory advance
and in many ways the outlook for the future
bas been improved.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And lie goes on to
say:
In the considered judgment of our financial
experts, the position of Canada is fundamentally
sound, and this is especially true of the Province of Ontario. We are constantly growing antd
expanding and our faith in the outlook is
firmly established by experience. I am glad of
the opportunity ta give voice to this note of
confidence and to extend at the same time my
hearty good wishes for the New Year to all I
may be privileged to reach.
Well, that does not look as if we were in
a bad way and needed patent medicine. The
Premier of Manitoba said:
It is a emnmop belief that Manitoba is a
purely agricultural province. It is true that
agriculture is stil.1 her chief maintenance, but
during recent years other industries have
sprnung up, and have grown and prospered until
to-day the annual value of their groas output.
closely rivais that of farm products.
Listen to this further statement of the
Premier of Manitoba:
The year 1929 has seen sustantial progress in
this direction. During the past year 36 new
manufacturing concerna have been established in
Manitoba, while 22 others have expanded their
plants. The total output, it seems certain, will
substantially exceed that of 1928, which was
estimated at $159,252,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And Hon. Mr. Anderson, Premier of Saskatchewan, said:
The Province of Saskatchewan has experienced phenomenal growth and developmnent
during the twenty-five years which have passed
since the province was organized in 1905.
The future progress of Saskatchewan rests
upon the firm foundation of the productive effort
of our people, aided by a discriminating immigration policy. Capital fron Eastern Canada and the British Isles is increasingly available for the develo pment of our natural resources. The achievements of the past have
been considerable.
But we have merely
scratched the surface of our vast resources, and
there is every indication that the future holds
in store tremendous possibilities for the people
of Saskatchewan.
Alberta, Premier Brownlee:
At the end of another year the Province of
Alberta finds itself in a strong financial position. At the end of March, 1929, the fourth successive surplus was reýported.
Then lie goes on:
Our industrial development continues to expand, the annual payrolil of the industries under the Workmen's Compensation Aet having
increased over 60 per cent in. the past three
years.

56

SENATE

We face the end of the year therefore in a
spirit of confident optimism, believing that the
next few years, at least, will be years of continued development, both agriculturally and industrially.
Premier Tolmie of British Columbia said:
British Columbia has just elosed another
active year in all its primary lines of industry.
Comipleted returns shou'ld show that the forestry
outipuit for 1929 will surpass aIl previous records
for quantity, though owing to falling prices
values will be somewhat lowered. In spite of
the lull in the lumber market the companies
are showing signs of renewed activity in the
coming year, and plans for a number of new
logging railways have been approved.
With new mines discovered and old mines
developing, with all our primary industries ex,panding, with additions contemplated or in
progress in our abundant hydro-electrie power,
there appears at this time to be no good reason
why 1930 should not be a banner year for
British Columbia.
Is there any country in the world that can
make a better shîowing? Possibly the United
States can. I do not know. In some respects
I should say no. I do know, however, that
there is no other country in the world to-day
that is in as favourable a position and progressing as fast as Canada. So it was well
within the truth to refer in the Speech from
the Throne to our "continuing prosperity."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend allow me to say a few words on
the question of unenp-oyment, and to explain the situation that we now face? He
will rememiber that in 1923 there was something of a crisis in Canada. Financially we
were somewhat downhearted, our railway situation was not good, the balance was very
much against us, and we all wondered how
the situation could be remedied. My honourable friend will remember that we appointed
a Committee of the Senate to inquire into.
the railway deficit and to see whether there
was not some solution of the dangerous problem thait confrontedi us. That Comimittee
heard men of high stndling n the railway
and financial world. What did they all say?
They repeated the statement madle by Lord
Shaughnessy a few montihs before he died;
they were unanimous in saying that our only
salvation lay in an increase of population. I
romember that at a great funntion in Montceall Lord Shaughnessy said that with three
millions more of population we icould save
oursebves. That statement was echoed by
men af high standing. We all were convinced
that that was ithe only solution, and bthroughout the land the press, Conservative, Liberal
and Progressive, repeated the declaration:
" We need more population."
It seemed
obvious that with such large deficits on our
raibways we could imiprove the situation only
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

by means of more iconsumers and a larger
population in the West, and there was a univc'rsal demand fdor increased population. The
Government in its efforts to increase -the
population was supported by the whole of
putle opinion in Canada, inoluding, I think,
every member olf the Senate Comenittee. We
soon found, however, that the railway situation was improving before we got those ithree
millions of addltional population.
Now we are in 1930, and we hear from.
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta that
assisted immigration should stop. But this is
the season of unemployment in Canada, at
all events in the East. There is always a
certain amount of unemployment in Montreal
from November until the opening of navigation. The unemployment situation bas been
accentuated, and the number of unemployed
increased, I think, by the efforts that have
been made by the Governiment, supported by
public opinion, to obtain a larger volume of
immigration. I lived through the crisis of
1923, and felt that it was necessary that the
procession should start again from the British
Isles, if possible, towards the fertile plains of
our West. It bas been found that many
people who declared that they were coming
bere to settle on the land have moved towards the cities. I saw a statement of the
number of immigrants who had drifted fron
the farms into the city of Toronto. We canot go against the will of a province that
says that it is desirous of receiving a population of a certain kind, and I do not know of
any power by whieh the Dominion Government or any other Government could go
contrary to the opinion that was voiced. The
situation confronting us is the result, I believe, of the policy carried on, which seemed
to be the only salvation of this country.
Within twenty-four months of the inquiry
that was made by a Committee of this Chamber we found that the statements and convictions of the gentlemen who appeared before
us, which were shared by others, had a false
basis, for within that period the Canadian
National Railways began to go forward and
develop and increase their surpluses. I recall
a member of Parliament at one time asking
facetiously why we did not sell those railways
for a dollar. At that time no group of men,
no syndicate, Canadian, British or American,
would have expected those railways to do as
they did, even if a bonus had been given
of $25,000,000 a year for ten years. The
deficit was over $10,000,000.
Nevertheless,
within twenty-four months the income of the
railways would have justified anyone in paying $800,000,000 for them. They had $40,000,-

that market. Such conditions no doubt prevail ail over Canada.
SIn British, Columbia we have the finest
fisheries in the world, yet s0 far from assisting
us ta maintain them, this Governinent have
disposed of them one by one. 1 brougbt up
the matter of the seal fisheries last year,
but it will bear repetition. They disposed of
the seal fisheries under a treaty accepted with
very grea-t reluetance by British Cokimbia, in
1911l, on tble promise al this Giovernment tht
it would be limited ta fifteen years. It was
in.tended ta be ten years, and was made
fifteen. The terni of fifteen years has long
since gone by, and it appears that the seal
have been stripped from our industry in perpetuity, because in the four years that have
sinee elaipsed, the Governîment have done
nothýing about àt.
The Halibut Treaty was handed over to an
inîternatiiontal commission ajppoiniteà in 19!24.
In the series of years intervening the commission bas made two or three reports about
the life of -the halibut, duplicating evýidence
already in gavernment publications bere and
in British Columabia, but bas donc nothing
whatever ta stop the rapid extinction now
going an 'of tbe halibut, one of the 'greatest
fishery interests. We had last year the promise
of the appaintment of a Minister 6f Fisheries
whenever the moment should be opportunesomething recommended by a commission
organized by this vcry Government-but
notbing bas been done,' althougb more than
twa years have elapsed since the recommendation was made ta the Government; and we

find in the meantime that a further ind-ustry
of British' Columbia, that of the sock-eye
salman, is menaced by the lack of some supervisilg bead at Ottawa ta direct the aiffairs
cf tèhe Departsnent af Fisheries.
SI will not go inta the matter of the, Fisheries.Treaty further, because it is still under
negatiatian, except ta say that the treaty of
last year was withdrawn by this Government
from the Commons because bath parties, at
Ottawa and Washington, recognized when once
attention was called ta it, that the treaty was
taa remarkable and too ridiculous in its provisions to be seriously entertained. The
prinicipals have nat weakened, in their desire to have a treaty. It was carelesy presented by this Government a year aga, and
bas been witbdrawn for an amendment ta put
it inito some reasonable shape. As I see it,
such a tb.ing as that cuuld not bave occurred
if there bad been a Minister of Fisheries ta
take that treaty before bis colleagues of the
Government for consultation before it was
ever sent down ta Washington.
I had no intention of taking part in this
debate, and I shall not prolong it except ta
say that after listen'ing for two days ta
speeches of the honourable gentlemen opposite, and finding that they avoided altogether the essence of the situation, it
seemed to me iuobent. upon some persan
to caîl attention to it at this stage of the dehate. Tbeirefore I rase ta make my protest
that in the face of a situation so, serious as
that whicb confronts Canada in unemployment, and in wh~eat perticularly, this Government bave no suggestion wbatever ta make of
any action intended on their part, but intend
simply to -continue ta drift.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

PROBLEMS
SPECIAL COMMITTEE

On the Order:
Consideration of a message from the House
of Commons to the Senate to acquaint Their
Honours that a Special Committee has been
appointed to meet with a similar Speciai Committee of the Senate, if such Committee be
appointed, to consider and, during the present
session, to report upon matters referred to
them relating to pensions and returned soldiers' problems.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members, since this message reached the
Senate I have had occasion to discuss the
policy to be pursued by this Chamber in
response to the kind invitation to join the
Committee of the House of Commons in their
work. Some doubt has arisen in the minds of
a number of members of this Chamber as to
the possibility of a Comimittee of the Senate
sitting jointly with a Committee of the House
of Commons on a -Bill and other matters referred to them by the Commons, as the report
of such a Committee must be the report of
a Committee of the House of Commons to
that House. In view of this impediment, I
beg to move:
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons to inform that House that the Senate
does not deem it opportune to appoint a Special
Committee to act jointly with a similar Special
Committee of the House of Commons to consider matters referred to that Committee by
the House of Commons relating to pensions and
returned soldiers' problems, for the reason that
they could not participate in the final decisions of that Committee, which must report to
the House of Commons.
That the Senate recognizes the necessity of
avoiding as far as possible the duplication of
work on that Committee, and with that end in
view the Senate has agreed upon the names of
the Senators who will later be asked to form
the Special Committee to whom will be referred
whatever legislation in this connection may
reach this Chamber. They are the Hon. MesBelcourt, Black, Béland, Blondin,
sieurs:
Buchanan. Gillis, Graham, Griesbach, Hatfield,
Laird, White, Macdonell, MacArthur, Rankin,
Taylor, White (Pembroke).
The above named Senators will, when notified, be pleased to attend the sittings of the
Special Committee of the House of Commons.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

TRADE

WITH BRITISH WEST INDIES
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Hon. H. J. LOGAN rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That he will move the following resolution:
Resolved, That in the interests of Canada,
the British West Indies, and of the British
Empire as a whole, Canada should admit all
tropical products coming direct from the British
West Indies to Canadian ports, free of customs
duties.
He said: Honourable members, in 1925 we
formed with the West Indies a new treaty,
known as the Canada-British West Indies
Trade Agreement, in which each country
agreed to make certain concessions. The prin-

62

SENATE

cipal concession which we undertook to grant
is contained in Article I of Part 1 of the
Trade Agreement and reads as follows:
Subject to the provisions of The Customs
Tariff, 1907, and to the provisions of Article II
hereof, the duties of customs on all goods (other
than tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, and spirituous
or alcoholic liquors) being the produce or
manufacture of any of the Colonies aforesaid
imported into Canada which are now subject
to duty or which may be made subject to duty
at any future time shall not at any time be
more than fifty per cent of the duties imposed
on similar goods under the General Tariff of
Canada.
The British West Indies on their part, in
Article IV, agreed to give us general preferences. Article IV reads as follows:
Subject to the provisions of Articles V and
VI hereof the duties of customs on all goods
(other than tobacco, cigars and cigarettes)
being the produce or manufacture of Canada
when imported into any of the Colonies aforesaid which are now subject to duty or which
may be made subject to duty at any future
time shall at any time be in the case of
(a) the Bahamas not more than seventy-five
per cent,
(b) Barbados not more than fifty per cent,
(c) British Guiana not more than fifty per

(h) the Windward Islands not more than
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent,
of the duties imposed on similar goods when
imported from any foreign country.
At the same time Canada gave to the
British West Indies certain special preferences.
We agreed in the first place to preferences on
sugar. I will not enter into details on this
item of sugar, because the treaty contains a
very intricate and extensive list, but one
clause in this regard reads:
The Customs Tariff of Canada shall provide
that sugar above number 16 Dutch standard
mn colour when imported by a recognized sugar
refiner, for refining purposes only, upon evidence
satisfactory to the Minister of Customs, shall
not be subject to these duties, i.e., the duties
on sugar over number 16 Duteh standard, specified in item 134 of the Canadian Tariff.
Provided that sugar as defined under item
134 of the Customs Tariff of Canada shall
receive a preference of not less than 25 per
cent of the duty charged on foreign sugar.
We made bananas fre. The result of this
provision has been that, whereas in 1924-5
there was a total importation into Canada
from the British West Indies direct of only
2,400 or 2,500 stems of bananas, during the
past year ther have been imported direct
from the British West Indies no less than
3,000,000 stems of bananas, which have corne
into this country free of customs duty.
Then, as te other items, Canada agreed to
make these concessions:

A preference of $1.50 under the intermediate
tariff and $2 under the general tariff.
A preference of 15 cents.
Free, as against a general tariff of 15 per
cent.
Free, as against a general tariff of l cents.
Free, as against a general tariff of 75 cents.
A preference of 50 cents.
A preference of $1 under the general tariff.
A preference of 50 cents.
A preference of $2 per gallon on the strength
of proof.
A preference of 60 cents per gallon on the
strength of proof.
Free, as against a general tariff of 30 per
cent.

There were aLoa same speelal preferences
given in reference ta spirits and brandy,

That, in a f ew words, was the trade treaty
which wa.s consummated in this city in 1925.
lIn that treaty Canada agreed further ta
provide certain ships. Af'ter a good deal of
delay we have provided, five of the fines--t
ships that sail aur waters, as I thinkc will be
acknawledged by any persan who bas travelled
upan them at a.ny time. They are superb. I

Now the question arises, are we getting out
of this West Indies Trade Agreement ail that
we expected ta get? We import into Canada
about $100,000,000 worth of tropical produets,
yet the total amoun-t of prodiucts brought
fram the West Indies was only a little over
32000000. Sa, even at present, with this
agreemient in force, we are not by any means
securing a large quantity of aur tropical
producto from the British West Indies.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would the hanourable member permiit a question there? Wauld
he mention from what country we imported
the other articles?
Han. Mr. LOGAN: Principally from the
Uni ted States of America, notwithstanding
that many of the articles we import fram that
country are very inferiar in quslàty ta the

64

SENATE

prodtets qf the British West Indies; for instance, grapefruit.
The United States of America have
perhaps taught us a lesson in dealing with
those outlying islands. About twenty-five
years ago, when the United States took over
the island of Porto Rico, they abolished all
dut-ies between Porto Rico and the United
States, making the trade between those
countries as free as air. Since that time the
trade has increased by not less than 800 per
cent.
Now, the question is whether we in Canada
should not to some extent follow the lead of
the United States of America. No doubt the
point will be raised that we should have a
reciprocal tariff. But I want to put before
you the fact that the people of the West
Indies are far from wealthy or affluent, and
are suffering under very great disadvantages.
At the present moment they are trembling
at the threat of Great Britain to take off the
preference on sugar. I do not believe they
are able to reciprocate in the matter of taking
off the duty. May I point out further that
the tariffs of the West Indies are negligible
as compared with ours: for instance, they
regard 10 or 15 per cent as a high tariff, while
we do not regard 30 or 40 or even 50 per
cent as extremely high.
I submit, honourable members, that at this
time we should hold out to the West Indies
more inducement to trade with us; in other
words, that our import trade with those
Islands should be free of any customs tariff.
What would the reduction of revenue
amount to? I have here a statement of imports from the West Indies, which shows that
in the year ending March 31, 1929, we collected
on alcoholie beverages coming from the
British West Indian Colonies $385,844; on
other distilled spirits, $126,360,
on cocoa
beans, not ground, $6,067; and on coffee,
green, the very small sum of $31. And there
are other items. The whole amnount of duty
collected on goods imported from the British
West Indies in 1929 was onlv $2,029,974. Of
that sum the duty on sugar not above No. 16
Dutch standard amounted to $1,403,424, and
on sugar above No. 16 Dutch standard, $64,422.
This shows that the total duties collected on
products other than sugar, coming to Canada
from the British West Indies, amounted to
only about $500,000. I will admit that the
problem of sugar is a difficult one, but I
repeat that at this time the Government of
Canada should consider the advisability of
holding out a helping hand.
Hon.

Mr. LOCAN.

These are the days, honourable members,
when we should be doing something in the
way of Empire building, of drawing together
more closely the far flung parts of the Empire.
While the inhabitants of those little islands
have been blessed by nature with great fertility of soil and a beautiful climate, they
are nevertheless a comparatively poor people.
They have prospects of development if we
can assist them in some way to increase the
production of those islands. I do not think
we should deal with the West Indies as we
would deal with any other country in the
world. Those islands are the part of the
Empire that is nearest to us. Why should
we not, as a big brother, hold out to them
the hand of kindness, and encourage them in
every way possible? It seems to me that
nothing else that we can do would better
assist the development of British trade.
The people of the British West Indies are
extremely loyal. When I was down there as
a Commissioner in 1924 and 1925, travelling
from one island to the other, I was struck
with the intense loyalty that was evident
everywhere-a loyalty of the purest and best
character, and just as great as that of the
people of the Dominion of Canada.
Many inducements are being held out to
those people to trade with the United States.
But it is not their desire to trade with the
United States; they dlesire to develop their
trade with us; and if we can assist them to
increase that trade by throwing off the duty,
such action would be, I think, in the best
intcrests not only of Canada, but of the
Empire as a whole. As I have already stated,
we have $11.000.000 worth of ships travelling
between Canada and the West Indies. If we
can encourage the importation of more goods
into this country from those islands by taking
off the duties on the goods produced there,
we shall be helping to make these ships more
profitable, and we shall also be helping our
railroads, which will have the transportation
of the goods in Canada. All in all, I submit,
honourable members, that the course of
action which I an proposing would be in the
best interest of Canada, particularly of our
consuming public, in the best interest of the
West Indies, and of great benefit to the whole
British Empire.
I do not desire to press this motion to a
vote. I gave the notice of motion simply in
order that I might call the attention of the
Government to the condition of affairs that
exists, and ask them to consider very seriously
the question of abolishing the duty on products coming from this tropical zone.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is not the point
I was asking about. My observation is that
those imports are scheduled under general
tariff, preferential tariff, anid treaty tariff. I
thought my honourable, friend could perhaps
tell us how much carne in under the treaty
tariff.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn sorry to trouble
my honourable friend, but some of us ini Nova
Scotia, like hîmself, are interested in this
matter. How about exports fromn Canada?
I understand that we have this stearnship service frorn Canada to the British West Indies
for the purpose of developing direct trade.
Is there still rnuch of the Canadian trade
going through the United States? Can my
honourable friend give us the figures for 1929?
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I cannot give the hionourable gentleman that information. Not a
very large amount is going through the United
States. We exported direct to the West Indies
in 1927, $17,702,013; in 1928, $19,145,155; and
in 1929, $20,524,3W6. Frorn this the honourable gentleman will see that the increase in
exports from Canada has anxounted to about
83,000,000 in three years.
Hou. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Could the honourable gentleman give us some figures as
to the exports of the United States to, those
saine possessions? I presurne that on goods
coîning from the British West Indies to the
United States there is no preferential treat-

SENATE

ment. What would be the export from the
British West Indies to the United States,
and vice versa? Porto Rico, of course, is
an illustration of the development of trade in
consequence of the absolute abolition of duty.
I do not suppose there would be any duty.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: There is no duty.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: So the comparison with the very enormous growth in that
trade would not enlighten us very much. I
am not speaking adversedy, but am asking
for information.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I have not at present
the information in reference to the imports
and exports to and from the United States.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Those figures
would illustrate whether our trade has grown
materially at the expense of the United States,
or whether it is new trade that has been developed.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable members of the Senate will agree, I am quite sure,
that this country has done fairly well by the
West Indies in attempting to develop trade
under the treaty of 1925, and that we might
very well allow a little more time to test the
value of that treaty before passing judgment
upon i.t. I will draw the attention of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, and the
Minister of Finance, to the remarks of my
honourable friend, and to his desire to improve still further upon the 'arrangement
arrived at in 1925. Of course he will realize
that all these schedules are the result of conferences between the two countries, and that
home time was expended upon the matter before an agreement was reached. I believe that
the Minister of Finance, knowing the sacrifices that we have already made under the
treaty, will be perhaps a little slow to proceed
further in that direction; yet I feel that
whatever we can do to increase the importations of tropical products from the British
West Indies will be to our advantage and to
the advantage of intraimperial trade.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable members,
I am going to suggest that, as my honourable friend has given the House a great deal
of information on a subject which, in our
province, at all events, is of very great interest, the House might very well devote
to the matter a little further consideration. I for one should like to have an opportunity of going a little more carefully into
the subject, and therefore I would move the
adjournment of the debate till nex-t Thursday.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a few words in support
of the general idea that we ought to do everything in our power to promote trade with the
British West Indies and every other part of
the British federation of nations. I think
that general idea will meet with a wider
acceptance in Parliament and throughout the
country at the present time than it has met
with in the past. Our neighbours to the south
do not appear to be so favourable to trading
with Canada now as they were some yea-rs
ago. In the exercise of their undoubted right.
they appear to be moving in the other direction. We will not murmur nor complain
about that, I think, but rather we will put
forth greater efforts to develop our own country and the great commonwealth of nations
to which we belong. I do not think we couild
very well complain, even if we felt inclined
to do so, because some twenty years ago our
neighbours were willing and eager to trade
with us and made us an offerHon. Mr. McMEANS: That is getting to
be a matter of ancient history now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, and all the more
regrettable, in my opinion. In the exercise
of our undoubted rights, we declined their
offer; our Parliament and our country intimated that we did not value that trade as
highly as formerly. It is our duty now to
take things as we find them and to endeavour
to make use of the resources of our own country. It looks as if the United States would
not renew the offer of twenty years ago during the lifetime of the present generation, nor
perhaps of the next generation. While w:
want to live on friendly terms and to trade
with every nation in the world that is willing
to do business with us, we shall not protest
if any nation gives us to understand that it
would rather not have our trade.
I could not hear all the questions that were
asked of the honourable mover of the resolution (Hon. Mr. Logan), nor could I hear all
his replies. I should like to ask whether he
can give us information as to the trade, export anid import, that we carried on with the
West Indian Islands for the five years prior
to the treaty, and for the period since the
treaty came into operation. Can he tell us
whether that trade has grown or decreased,
and to what extent, since the treaty has been
in force?
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: The trade has grown
very materially, but I have net the figures
with me.

MARCH 27, 1930
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Perhiaps the honourable gentleman would have the figures with
him when the discussion is resumed, because
I think the figures would beHion. Mr. CASGRAIN: Illuminating.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, iiluminating.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Tanner, the debate
was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I cannot givie the
h-onourable gentleman that information at the
present time. There was an application for
a reifund of f ees, and we couid not deal wit~h
it uniess we had the authority of the Senate.
The motion is merely to authorize the Comnmittee on Divorce to consider the application
and to report upon it.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 10, an Act to amcnd the
Timber Marking Act.
He said: Honourable members, the object
of this Bill is to cmpower the Exchequer
Court, when so requested, to remove old
timber marks that have been registered for
a number of years and are no longer in use.
There is in the Trade Mark and Design Act
a provision similar to that which is now to
be incorporated in the Timber Marking Act.
That is the whole object of the Bill. I move
the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND

READING

POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANJDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 11,, an Act to amend the
Supreme Court Act.
He said: Honourable members, the purpose
of this Bill is to amend section 37 of the
Supreme Court Act. That section, as amended
in 1920, defines the conditions under which
special leave may be granted to appeal from
a provincial court other than a court of high.
est resort in the province. Two conditions
are mentioned in the section as it stands.
There has been a difference of opinion as to
whether the two conditions must exist, or
whether they are only alternative. Thià Bill

SENATE
is intended to remove any doubt as to that,
and to provide that the two conditions must
exist.
The Bill is somewhat technical in its form,
but the members of the legal fraternity who
have exainined it find that this will reconcile
the members of the Supreme Court, Who were
flot at on1e as to the m<eaning of the clause of
1920.
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIN: Does that mean
that appellants can go to the Supreme Court
without going to the court of last resort?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, provided
the amouint be over $2,000.
Hon. Mr. W'ILLOUGHBY: The honourable
leader of the buse spoke to me in reference
to this Bill, and I started to read it, but was
interrupted, and I have nlot had an opportunity of looking over it. I want to know its
meaning. I do flot know it now, and the
Bill is highly technical.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I move to
diseharge the order and place it on the Orders
of the Day for the next sitting of the House.
The motion was agreed to.
PATENT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
readýing of Bill 14, an Act to amend the Patent
Act.
He said: There are in this Bill two amendments. The first deals with the length of
the period during which a patent already
filýed in a foreign country that has an agreement with Canada may be filed in this country. The other amendment allows the production of a copy of the foreign patent in
order to save time an'd expense. These amendments have been suggested by the judges of
the Exebequer Court.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
members, I do not purpose to discuss the details of this Bill, but I would enquire frorn
my honourable friend the leader of the House
whether he coulci give us any information
respecting the reciprocal rights that are extended between, countries in the registering of
patents. It has come to my notice that
some countries are refusing to register Canadian patents, and I understand that this is
detrimental to Canadian interests. That is,
our eitizens cannot get a patent registered
in certain foreign countries, and therefore they
have to purchase there the article that they
may want to use as a part of some machine
that is being constructed here. I understand
that Germany is a country that is exercising
lion.

Mr. DANDURAND.

that privilege, not onIly against Canada, but
against many other countries, for the purpose
of conserving to her own people and her
manufacturing plants the sole rigbt of manufacturin-g certain articles. They think this
course desirable from the standpoint of the
industries of their own country. That being
so, as I believe it is, I would ask if the policY
of the Government is that Canada should
grant patents promiseuously upon request
from any country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I arn not in a
position at this moment to answer my
honourable friend"'s question., but in order that
I may not lose sight of it, I will not move
the third reading after the Bill comes out of
Committee, but will defer the motion for the
third rcading until I get the information
that my honourable friend desires.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read: the second time.

He said: Honourable members of the Senate,
this is the usual procedure by which Parliament is asked annually to vote a certain
portion-one-twelfth or one-sixth--of the
supply. In the present instanice the sum of
$142,625,436 is asked for, which is sufficient
to cover the two months of April and May
of the present year.
With the leave of the Senate, I move,
seconded by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham,
that this bill be now read a second time.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. POPE: Is that for one month
or two months?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Two months.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Is that the usual thing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. POPE: The usual thing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 say "usual"
because, as far as my memory goes, while
out of eight or ten Bis one may have been
for a month, the general practice lias been to
cover a two-month period. There are honourable members of the Senate who have been
on the Treasury benches and know what the
tradition is.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
is generally two months.
Hon. Mr. POPE: It is my innocence that
makes the question possible.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I have no objection to the passing of
this Dili. It lias always been the understanding, on the vote of one-sixth of the supply,
that if any question should arise as to the
propriety of the expenditure it could be deait
with subsequently. I presume that is truc
now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
fricnd in making lis reservation, and I in
agreeing to it, are adhering to tradition.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND laid on the
Table a return including:
Copies of ail communications, correspondence,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

documents and writings, of every nature, that
relate to export or shipment, between or to the
United States and Canada, respectively, of merchandise prohibited under the respective laws of
the United States or Canada, or both.
H-on. Mr. POPE: Arn 1 in order, Mr.
Speaker, in asking that this return be printed
for the information of the members of this
House? I have been asked to make that request.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I doubt very
mucli whether that could be done by sucl a
request, or without notice of motion. These
are important documents, nine-tcnths of which
have been on the Table of this Chamber for
over a year. There was no question last year
of moving to have the documents printed.
If my honourable friend, whoma we shahl certainiy have the advantage of hearing during
this session on this matter and others, should
find it intercsting to draw the attention of the
Senate to some part of this correspondence,
lie would bie welcome to do so.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Yes, but there was no
occasion last year to ask for the printing.
I think it shouid be recognized that this correspondence is far more important at the present
moment than it was when certain portions of
it were laid on the Table of the House previousiy.
Legisiation is coming before us
which demands our serious attention, without
regard to the side of the House on which we
sit. I have been requested by members on
both sides of the House to ask that this correspondence be printed. I admit that it is not
my duty to insist on this, but I make the request because honourable members on both
sides of the House so desire. It is ahl right for
me to read the correspondence, but they may
not have seen it. Howcver, it is not for me,
aithougli I arn a Pope, to dictate the procedure that should be followed.

Hon. Mr. HAYIDON moved the second reading of Bill 27.
He said: Honourable members, with the

Dili be now read a second time.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Wili the honourabie
member explain the Bill, se that we may know
something about it?

'il

APRIL 1, 1930
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: The purpose of the
request for leave ta move the second reading
IIOW 15 that the Bill may be before the Railway Committee on Thursday next. The Bill
is a simple one, containing only two clauses.
The first provides that the par value of the
?hares of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company may be changed from $100 ta $25. In
the second clause of the Bill the number of
dîrectors is increased by the repeal of the
clause 110W providing for them, and the substitution of a provision whereby the number shahl
be su-eh, not ee~eeding twenty4'our, as fâal
be fixed by by-law.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What is the object
of reducing the stock from $100 to $25?
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: May I adopt the
answer given, rather privately, across the floor
of the Chamber, ta the honourable gentleman
from Winnipeg? This change would make it
easier to deal with the shares in public, and,
as my honourable leader says, wouhd allow
the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg, as
well as the leader on this side, to deal in
shares.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It makes for
a wider distribution.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: And gives a larger
liberty ta seli and buy.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I thought the steeck
jobbing was beîng surrounded by certain
reetrictions.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: I do nlot think anybody would say that the Canadian Pacifie
Railway was ini any business of that kind.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable
mnember has brought in a Bill and has moved
the second reading, but I ca!rnot finid that
hie has given any satisfactory reason for it.
It is true that the Bill has met with approval
in, another place, but surely the honourable
gentleman. docs not undertake te father it in
this House without being able ta tell us what
it is about.
Hons. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable members, 1 have heard the reasons expressed.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: The honourable
gentleman is not ýconnected with this at all.
He is not the sponsor of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: The chief reason, as
I understand, is that the directors of the Railway Company are holding their annual meeting in the 2nonth of May, when they will
consider this and other questions, and. if the
Bill can be given second reading and be considered in committee and then given its third
reading before the adjournment of this House,

which I understand is likely to extend for
a couple of weeks from. the middle of next
week, tihe directors of the Company wili feel
free to make thei-r arrangements.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Are we to give it
a third reading without having any explanatien? That would be a sort of drop-a.-nickelin-the-slot system.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: No; I arn asking for
the second reading so that the Bill may go ta
tihe committee and be considered as careluiJly
as any other Bill.
Right Hlon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
think the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) is bound to press for
further reasons. It is not very clear.
Hon. M\r. CASGRAIN: May 1 speak now?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No, I do not think
80.

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Well, I will take
the liberty. We have free speech in this
country. It has been advertised on the stock
exchange, and elsewhere, that the Company
wante ta get a larger number of shareholders.
Many cornpanies have spl!it up their stock for
the purpose of giving the poor man a chance.
I know my honourable f riend from Winnipeg
will be only too glad to see that the poor
mian gets a chance.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved the second
reading of Bill 28.
He said: Honourable members, I hope that
my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) 'will not question me as
closely as hie did my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Haydun). I undierstand
that if this Bill is given the second, reading tanight it will necessarily have to go be4ore the

Banking and Commerce Committee.
explanation, I may say that the Bill is presented on behaîf of the Eastern Canada
Savings and Loan Company, of Halifax, which
company was founded a long time ago and
has been operating conservatively and, successfully. Under the provisions of the Loan
Companies Act it is necessary to ask permission of Parliament to oeIl some real estate
which the company owns, and the purpose of
the Bill is ta give that permission. I may
add that the Bill has been submitted ta the

72

SENATE

Department of the Government that supervises loan companies and has been approved
by Mr. Finlayson. I hope that this explanation will be satisfactory and that the House
will consent to the second reading to-night.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Well, this explanation is very much more satisfactory .than was
given in connection with the other Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

PREVENTIVE

OFFICERS IN NOVA
SCOTIA

DISCUSSION

AND

INQUIRY

Hon. C. E. TANNER rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will inquire of the Government what
is the name, place of residence, or duty, rank
or position, and salary and allowances, of each
person in the service of the Department of
National Revenue in Nova Scotia, as Preventive
Officers, for prevention of liquor smuggling; and
that he will call attention to the subject matter.
He said: Honourable members, I am asking
the Government for names and other particulars in respect to preventive officers of the
Department of National Revenue who are
acting for the prevention of liquor smuggling
in Nova Seotia. The subject is perhaps a
little more interesting than usual, inasmuch
as there is a suggestion, I believe, that we
should not only prevent liquor from coming
into the country, but also take a forward step
and prevent it from going out. I am a little
interested in ascertaining how far we have
been successful in the matter of keeping
liquor out. I remember that two or three
years ago, when the Government decided to
appoint a special preventive force, the Department of National Revenue, through their
spokesman who appeared before our Committee, gave us assurance that the very best
men available would be selected, and although
some of us were a little doubtful as to the
probable effectiveness of this force, the necessary legislation was approved in this
House.
I have learned that there are 69 preventive
officers on duty in Nova Scotia, 35 in New
Brunswick, and 9 in Prince Edward Island113 in the Maritime Provinces. But that is
not all, honourable gentlemen. I havo dis;on. Mr. TANNEX.

covered in my researches that on the waters
along the shores of the Maritimes is a large
fleet of war vessels armed and otherwise
equipped for the purpose of keeping illicit
liquor out of the provinces. I find that there
are no less than 29 such vessels. I have here
a list, which gives the armament of each
and the number of the crew. The ships are
armed with rifles, three-pounder guns and
six-pounder guns.
I do not know whether
they are muzzle loaders or breeeh loaders.
I must confess that I was a little surprised
to find that there was such a large fleet and
that it was supported by so large an army
on land.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Does the list include
the Niobe and the Rainbow?
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
No; I think the
Niobe and the Rainbow are now helpless.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:
Do all these
war vessels form part of the great Canadian
Navy?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not know that
I can answer that question. There is a
special preventive force, a special preventive
navy, for the particular purpose of preventing
people from landing liquor illicitly on the
shores of the Maritime Provinces--or, in the
more vulgar phraseology, preventing smuggling.
I am not going into much detail, but I
would say froin my observations, and from
information obtained from people in Nova
Scotia who are well informed-and I am
speaking only of Nova Scotia in this regardthat notwithstanding this large arrned fleet
which is supposed to be patrolling our Atlantic
Coast, from 50 to 75 per cent of the liquor
consumed in the Province of Nova Scotia is
smuggled into the province.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
pretty thirsty.

How much

Hon. Mr. TANNER: That may seem to
be a reflection on the people of the province,
but I have to state the facts, notwithstanding.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The honourable gentleman has made a statement, but is it correct?
He has said that at least half the liquor
consumed in the Province of Nova Scotia is
smuggled in. Is that a fact?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I know the newspapers are continually full of reports that
smoall quantities and occasionally large quantities of liquor are being discovered from time

to time in the province; but, notwithstanding
the gathering in of such quantities, I believe
it is quite within the mark to say that at
least 50 per cent of the liquor that is consumed in the province cornes in from the
outside. That is no surprise to people who
know the facts. For instance, I have rigbt
in my hand a report of the annual meeting
of a very well known temperance organization
in the province, the Sons of Temperance,
which bas long been alive, although perhaps
not active until recently, and bas been carrying
on a campaîgn of education along temperance
lines for a great many years. At its annual
meeting in Halifax in November of Iast year
its chief organizer made the statement that
provincial prohibition could not be enforced
in Nova Scotia, because of the extensive coast
line. I hardly believed that that was true,
and I discussed the matter with the gentleman personally afterwards, when he assured
me that the newspaper report of his speech
was correct, and bis opinion was accepted
without any demur by the people who were
present at the meeting.
I believe, honourable members, that the
wbole expense occasioned by 29 war vessels
and 69 armed men is abeolutejly iineffective,
and that the financial outlay is rnoney wasted.
I arn not going to discuss the effectiveness of
the force now, although I may have something to say when I see the names of the
officers. I had occasion to report one personally to the Minister of National Revenue
after an observation I made a year ago,' and
1 think he was dismissed. I arn afraid there
are a good many more like that man.
Ilon. Mr. McMEANS: How do they vote?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: 1 do not know how
he voted. I neyer inquire about a man's
politics on occasions of this kind. We are
dealing with this matter on a very much
broader line than my bonourable friend from
Winnipeg is disposed to deal with it. I repeat,
bonourable gentlemen, that the money we
spend on tii force is wasted. In Nova
Scotia there was an overwhelming vote against

prohibition and we are now adoptîng there a
system sirnilar to that in Quebec, Ontario and
other provinces. I have stated here once hefore, and I amn going to say it again, that there
is only one common-sense way to prevent
smuggling, and that is to make it unprofitable
for the smuggler. I cannot conceive why the
Government dues flot recognize that. Once
the duties are eut down so that Vhere is no
profit in smuggling, then the illicit business
will -cease, but unless that step is taken we
may retain armed forces on land and on
water, but they will not keep liquor out.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
members, I arn very rnuch surprised at the
implication in the remarks of my honourable
friend. He seems to desîre to convey the idea
that the people of bis province are flot absolutely abstemious.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: They do flot pretend
to be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, I
know from what country many of them corne.
That remÀnds me of a speech made by Mr.
Duncan Fraser, of Guysborough, who accompanîed a curling club to Scotland. On one enjoyable evening speeches were being made,
and Scots from the other side were boasting
of their lochs and mountains, and Mr. Duncan
Fraser said: "Your lochs would be mere
ponds in Canada; your mountains would be
mole-Jbills. The wbole of Scotland could be
dropped into the middle of one of our lakes,
and it would create hardly a ripple: we would
flot notice it but for the smeil of whisky."
Scotland manufactures whisky, and other
countries drink it.
Now, I have in my band a list of the names
of preventive officers in Nova Scotia. My
honourable friend spoke of New Brunswick,
but that province is outside the bounda of bis
inquiry. I have perused the list of these
officers, wbicb is somewbat lengtby, and I find
that most of them have fine Scotch names. I
think my bonourable friend will recognize
some of bis compatriots among them.

no one would have suspected tha-t outside of
penitentiaries and jails there could be found
so many rum-runners, smugglers and lawbreakers as were invading that country. The
newspapers informed us that rows of steamers
loaded with liquor for the United States were
lying at anchor on the Atlantic a few miles
off the American coast.
The first move on the part of our neighbours
to put an end to this business was made not
with Canada but with Great Britain. In 1923
the American Government asked Great Britain
to co-operate in having the domestic laws of
the United States respected.
They asked
Great Britain to agree to an extension of the
territorial limit. Three miles off the coastline
had been the limit ever since the American
Colonies separated from Great Britain, and
is the limit recognized by international law.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
By the law of
all countries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
By the law of
all countries, with this exception, that neighbouring countries on the Baltic have entered
into agreements to extend certain limits for
the purpose of protecting those countries
against liquor smugglers. For centuries Great
Britain has been Mistress of the Seas and
quite jealous of its power and jurisdiction;
so it hesitated to help the United States.
However, a convention between His Majesty
and the President of the United States of
America respecting the regulation of liquor
traffic was signed at Washington on January
23, 1924, and ratifications were exchanged on
May 22, 1924. After some formal words at
the beginning, the preamble reads as follows:
Being desirous of avoiding any difficulties
which might arise between them in connection
with the laws in force in the United States on
the subject of alcoholie beverages;
Have decided to conclude a convention for
that purpose.
That was the intention and the motive of both
parties. Then the convention goes on:
Article I:
The high contracting parties declare that it
is their firm intention to uphold the principle
that three marine miles extending from the
coastline outwards and measured from lowwater mark constitute the proper limits of
territorial waters.
Article II:
(1) His Britannic Majesty agrees that he
will raise no objection to the boarding of
private vessels under the British flag outside
the limits of territorial waters by the authoritics of the United States, its territories or
possessions in order that inquiries may be
addressed to those on board and an examina.

United States, its territories or possessions, in
violation of the laws there in force. When such
inquiries and examination show a reasonable
ground for suspicion, a search of the vessel may
be instituted.
I pass the second clause of that article and
come to the third:
(3) The rights conferred by this article shall
not be exercised at a greater distance from the
coast of the United States, its territories or
possessions, than can be traversed in one hour
by the vessel suspected of endeavouring to
commit the offence. In cases, however, in
which the liquor is intended to be conveyed to
the United States, its territories or possessions,
hy a vessel other than the one boarded and
searched, it shall be the speed of such other
vessel and net the speed of the vessel boarded
which shall determine the distance from the
coast at which the right under this article can
be exercised.
That treaty was ratified by the Canadian
Parliament.
We recognized, with Great
Britain, that an effort should be made to help
the United States in the enforcement of their
domestic laws. In the course of that same
year, 1924, the United States turned to this
country and asked our Government to discuss a treaty for the suppression of the
smuggling of liquor across the border from
Canada. A treaty was drawn up and received
the sanction of this Parliament in 1925. The
preamble is as follows:
His Majesty, the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British
Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India,
in respect of the Dominion of Canada, and the
United States of America, being desirous of
suppressing smuggling operations along the
boundary between the Dominion of Canada and
the United States of America-I would draw the attention of honourable
members to these words:
-being desirous of suppressing smuggling operatiens along the boundary between the Dominion
of Canada and the United States of America,
and of assisting in the arrest and prosecution
of persons violating the narcotie laws of either
government, and of providing as to the omission
of penalties and forfeitures in respect to the
carriage of alcoholie liquors through Alaska
into the Yukon territory, have agreed to conclude a convention te give effect to these purposes and have named as their plenipotentiaries:
I omit the names.
Article I is as follows:
The high contracting parties agree that the
appropriate officers of the governments of
Canada and of the United States of America
respectively shall be required to furnish upon
request to duly authorized officers of the other
government, information concerning clearances
of vessels or the transportation of cargoes, shipments or loads of articles across the international boundary when the importation of the
cargo carried or of articles transported by Iand
is subject to the payment of duties; also te
furnish information respecting clearances of

APRIL 1, 1930
vessels to any ports when there ie ground ta
suspect that the owners or persons in possession
of the cargo intend to smuggle it into the
territory of Canada or of the United States.
(2) The high contracting parties agree that
clearance from Canada or from the United
States shall be denied to any vessel carrying
cargo conrsistiiig of articles the importation oi
Nvhich into the territory of Canada or of the
United States, as the case may be, is prohibited,
when it je evident froni the tonnage, size and
general character of the vessel, or the length of
the voyage and the perils or conditions of
navigation attendant upon it, that the vessel
ivili be unable to carry its cargo to the destination proposed in the application for clearance.
We found from experienc e that this treaty
fell wide of the mark, although it covered
the thea existing practices of the Tum-runners.
The' rumn-runner cleared for a near port an
the A'tlantic and gave a bond or paid duty.
If he gave a bond, it was annulled when hie
returned a certificate from the customis
officiais of the country to which the liquor was
destined. If hie paid duty, he of course was
not required to return the certificate of the
customs officer. This procedure curhed considerably the activities of the rumn-runners.
Clearance would not be given to a sirall boat
that could flot put ta sea. The rum-runners
were undoubtediy hampered by the treaty,
but they gradually discovered that they could
secure a direct clearance to a United States
port, and a return of the sales and the clearances to United States ports fairly indicates
the extent of their operations by direct export.
In 1920 there were exported frota this country
to the United States 1,286 gallons of whiskey;
in 1921, 1,616 gallons; in 1922 there was an
increase to 20,228 gallons; in 1923 there were
28,568 gallons; in 1924, 244,576 gallons; in
1925, 415,282 gallons; in 1926 an increase ta
794,624 gallons; in 1927 there were 1,!163,165
gallons; in 1928, 1,1-28,152 gallons, and in 1929,
1,126,W99 gallons. As honourable gentlemen
will see, a large increase occurred between
1925 and 1926, and there was a stili further
increase in 1927, after which there was a alight
decrease.
If honourable members look at -the reports
fromn the Bureau of Statâstics they will find
that there was a similar movement of ale, beer
and porter during those samne years, whereas
before the passing of the Volstead Act there
was no brade ina those articles. In other words,
prior to the passage of the Voldstead Act,
when it was legltimate, there was no brade in
whisky, -aIe and beer, but when it was declared illegitimate the brade became profitable.
lt has been said, and the stateinent may be
repeated 'here, that the Canadian Goverament
was somewhat tardy ia bringing the preseat
Bihl bef are Parliament; that the delay in this
respect lured capital labo the distilling busi-

77

ness; that la 1922 there were but ben distilleries ia Canada, and on the lst of January
this year there were twenty-seven distilleries
registered. I-b may also ha said that in 1922
there were in bond in Canadian. warehouses
8,000,000 gallons of çroof spir.its, that la 1926
there were 11,000,000 gallons, and on the let
of January last there were 36,593,869 gallons.
I suggest to my bonaurable friends, however,
that they ponder over tbis situation. I-t may
bc alleged, and I think it bas been alleged in
the press, that considerable injury will ha
done to the distilleries if this business is
stopped at this date; but surely, honourable
members, these 36,593,000 gallons of spirits
have not been distilled for the American
trade, for last year onfly 1,126,M9 gallons wcre
sold ta the United States. There must ha,
therefore, same other reason for the development of the trade. Unduubtedly, new conditions have brought it about. Eil4 t provinces have been .opened ta that trade, and
surely the people wha have been investing
their money la distilleries have been doing sa
ln order ta carry on a legitimate business, and
not for the illegal or doubtful trade with the
United States, carried an in a way of w'bich
we are ail aware, and which I .dha'll describe
la a moment.
Though it may be said that the action of
the Goverament is tardy, we aIl recagnize that
public opinion plays an impartant part la
democracies, and public opinion had to be
edu-cated and brought ta realize the true
situation. The press of the country also bad
ta *be educated, because large metropolitan
newspapers in Canada had been for many
months carrying on a campaiga against the
legislatian that is now bef are us.
Furthermore, I would ask whab represeatations were made ia Parliameat la favour of
prampter action an the part of the Gavera.ment. I have nat heard many vaices raised,
either la the popular branch or in this Chamber, la favour of the action that we are now
taking. One vaice may have beau raised
bere, but, if sa, it was not within my hearing,
owing perhaps ta my absence from the House.
Now, what is the palýicy bebind this Bill?
It is a policy that bas twice been endorsed by
tbis Parliament; once when we endorsed the
Briti-sh treahty and acted jointly with Great
Britain ia assisting the United States ta defend
itself against the assaulbs that were being
made upon it, and once when we passed and
ratified a convention intended ta curb
smuggling. The action that the Goverament
are takjlng by this Bill is very simple. Ib
does not affect the question of temperance
or of prohibition, nor does lt attempt ta
protect aur neighbour's shores. The United

78

SENATE

States will attend to the enforcement of their
All the Canadian
own prohibition laws.
Government desire is to cease being a party,
officially, to the smuggling that is going on
under our own legislation. Without Government co-operation this trade must stop, and
the Government simply ask that they be
allowed to withdraw their hand. They have
decided that they will not allow national
agencies to be used in such a trade. There lies
our responsibility.
This trade is being carried on in violation
of the domestic laws of our neighbour. What
is our part in it? An application is made to
an excise official for the expart of liquor ta
the United States. Such an application may
be made by a Canadian or by an American.
I am told by the officials of the department
that such applications are made mostly by
Americans. They will nat even pay a commission to a Canadian, but come and attend
to the affair themselves. They do not wish
to share with our citizens. At the very outset the Government are aware of the nature
of the transaction. Our official cannot heip
kn'owing with whom he is dealing, because
the permit he issues shows the destination of
the liquor, and he knows that the liquor cannot legally enter the United States. The law
of Canada does nat preclude him fram giving
a permit, withouit which the liquor could not
be moved from this country. Without such
a permit it could not be transferred from the
distillery even ta an expart dock, because
it is by our authority that the goads are
moved fro-m the distillery to the port or the
border line. Without that permit the Canadian Customs officer would nat let the goods
pass. It is to a Customs officer that the permits are handed. When he receives a permit
he receives also a form iof customs entry
from the owner of the goods. This describes
the merchandise and gives the place of destination, the name of the foreign consignee,
the name and tonnage of the ship, and certain
other particulars. The Customs officer, after
checking the goods, puts his signature on the
customs entry, and if the liquor goes into a
vessel the captain then obtains his clearance
papers. Once the liquor has been transferred
from the Customs official it can re-enter
Canada only in the same way that foreign
goods enter-by means of a customs entry. So
the Federal authorities, through their Customs
officials, are aware all the way through the
transaction that their agents are the link
between the distiller and the bootlegger or
smuggler.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman has described to us the procedure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The Customs officer has put the liquor on
board the boat, and he has given his clearance
certificate.
There is one further thing that
he has to do under the treaty, and that is to
notify the American Customs, seven hundred
yards away, on the other side of the river,
that he has put on board the Saucy Sally, or
whatever the name of the vessel may be, so
many cases of rye whiskey, that the name of
the captain is so and so, that the vessel is
about to depart from a certain wharf.
Theoreticailly that is what he has to do..
Would the honourable gentleman tell us, does
he do it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was a
meeting here of high officials from Washington
and our own officials in January of last year,
and it was stated at that conference-my
honourable friend will see it in the discussion
that took place elsewhere, where the report
was read and cited-that this precaution had
been fairly and honestly carried out by the
officials of the Canadian Government, but that
it did not work.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:

Why?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Because the
rum-runner who had the boat and the clearance certificate was acute enough to know of
this signalling from one side of the river to
the other, and when lie had declared that
the consignee was at Detroit, at such and
such a street, he made it his business to
keep clear of Detroit, disappeared in the,
darkness, chose his own time, and made a
landing wherever lie could. The whole discussion in January last demonstrated that in
spite of the good faith of both parties and
the loyal carrying out of their obligations
under the convention, their efforts were futile.
That is why I say that all through the transaction our employees know that it is a monstrous deception. They all know that they
are being made parties to the trade that is
being carried on by the smuggler, the rumrunner and the criminal on both sides of the
rivers and lakes.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
May I suggest that
that was not a treaty; it was only an agreement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was a convention approved by this Parliament-by the
Commons and the Senate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
What is the.
difference between a treaty and a convention?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have been
allowing this demoralization of our own staff
to continue for too long a time. Here are
men, all representatives of the Canadian Gov-

APRIL 1, 1930
ernment, who are lending their good offices
ta the carry-ing of liquor into the hands of
the smuggler. Though these documents namne
a point of destination in the United States,
it is known ta every man who handies the
cargoes that the ship is flot going there;
it is going ûnywhere but there. Thus the
ýCanadian Government have been iending our
agencies, instrumentalities and authority ta
the carrying of liquor from the distillery into
the hands of the smuggler.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is no doubt
it is a very bad Government.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Perhaps my difficulty
is due to my ignorance, but I should like to
get this thing straightened out. 1 understand
that at the meeting where that agreement
was drafted there were nýone but officiais.
My honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend is speaking of January iast?
Was there ever a
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
convention?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes. I have
cited the convention that was entered into.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
Who were the contracting parties?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British
Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India,
in respect of the Dominion of Canada, and the
United States of America, being desirous of
suppressing smuggling operations along the
boundary between the Dominion of Canada and
the United States of America.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is that a treaty
or a convention?
I say a treaty,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
because 1 find it is so designated in another
place.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What lias the
honourable gentleman from Brandon (Hon.
Mr. Forke) to say?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I should like to have
it speciflcally stated that when a boat was to
be loaded with a certain shipment of liquor
the officiais had to telephone over. Was that
ever menti*oned in a treaty or convention?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes; it was
agreed. that the parties were required, upon
request, to furnish to dlu.y auVhorized Government officers ail information pertaining to the
clearance of vessels, or the transportation of
cargoes, shipments or loads across the international boundary, when the importation was
subject to the payment of duty.

My honourable friend f-rom Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) lias said. that it is realiy a very
bad Government that could tolerate such a
thing for so long. I have just drawn his
attention to the fact that we did, from anc
step to the other. help jointly with Great
Britain in trying to, curb smuggling aiang the
borders of the United States of America, and
we helped separately by that treaty. It took
some time for the rum-runners to adjust
themselves to new conditions, but they gradually found out-what apparently they had not
known-that by paying down the $9 excise
bax, they cold actually go, or pretend to go,
'o a designated American port.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Would the honaurable gentleman mind if 1 asked a question
just at this poinýt? The common, practice
was that ariy liquor distilled in Canada, when
taken out of a warehouse for use in Canada,
paid excise, but when taken out of a bonded
warehouse for export ta a f oreign country
paid no excise.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They paid fia
excise if they gave a bond for double the
amount of the excise duty.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH:
been. the Iaw.

That lias always

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but they
couid pay the excise if they pleased.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is the honourable gentleman quite sure of that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I am quite sure.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourabie
gentleman is quite sure that the iaw lias aiways
been that a man wlio took liquor out of a
bonded warehouse for shipment from Canada
liad always the cliaice of giving a bond for
double the amaunt, or paying excise?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I miglit say that
my information is ail -the more direct on tliat
point because I desired ta know wliether at
any time there liad been a change in regulations whereby, instead of a bond being given,
tlie excise duty could be paid for export. The
answer of tlie chief officiai of the Departmnent
of Customs was tliat no alteration lad taken
place in the iaw, and that prior ta the Volstead
Act the royalty on liquor for export could be
oovered either by a ;bond or by the excise
duty.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH: In tliat connection I suggest that my lionourable frien-d read
the speech of the riglit honourabie the Prime
M-inister. In bis speech in another place tlie

SENATE

80

Prime Minister gave a memorandum showing
how the excise is paia. The impression distinctly conveyed to my mind was that there
are two methods, but there is no choice; that
it is specifically provided that on any export
to the United States the excise shall be paid.
On exports to the United Sta.tes you cannot
give a double indemnity bond; you must pay
the excise. In exporting to a foreign country
you can give a bond for double the amount
of the excise. A reading of the Prime Minister's speech gives the impression that there
are those two distinct methods, one dealing
with export to foreign countries where there is
no prohibition, the other with export to the
United States.
There are not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
two methods, and I am sure I can confirm
that statement by a written declaration from
the customs officials, which I can bring tu
the Senate at the committee stage. Goods
could be exported either under bond or excise
to the United States, but at a certain timeI do not know precisely when-the officials
refused to accept the bond on exports to the
United States. So evident was it that the
certificate could not be obtained from the
customs official of an American port that the
Canadian officials refused to take a bond on
exports to the United States, and said, "You
will have to pay the excise duty." The alternative did exist until our official refused, either
directly or on instructions from higher officials,
to allow a bond on exports to a country that
was under a prohibition law. It stood to
reason that the goods could not legally be
delivered at any American port. Therefore,
at a certain time the alternative ceased to
be allowed, and it became necessary to pay
excise.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is very interesting. That more nearly squares with the
Prime Minister's statements. The question
I wanted to ask my honourable friend was
how this provision is evidenced. Is there a
regulation of the Customs Department which
specifies that the excise shall be collected in
a case like export to the United States? In
the Prime Minister's speech on the 14th of
March, page 623 of Hansard, you find three
methods definitely stated for collecting this
revenue on sales to a purchaser who intends to
export to the United States. In the most
definite form this suggests to my mind that
there must be in existence somewhere either
an amendment to the Aot, or a regulation
issued by the Customs Department or the
Minister of National Revenue, which specifically instructs customs officers as to what
they are to do. Surely if there is such an
instruction we ought to be told about it.
Hon. Mr.

GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
the form of the instruction, or when it was
given, but I suggest that the law generally
allowed, for export, either a bond or the payment of excise. At a certain time, as it was

quite evident that no bond could be cancelled
by any certificate from an American customs
officer declaring that he had received the
goods, that alternative was discontinued by
some kind of direction or action from a higher
official or by the action of the officials themselves.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is proper to
suggest to the honourable gentleman that they
had a bad Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I interviewed
the officials most thoroughly in order to
get all the information they could give me,
but my memory is somewhat at fault as to
the precise time when this limitation went
into force.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I think I have
described to you under what kind of law and
regulation the liquor left our distilleries, and
under our protection was delivered into the
hands of the smuggler. I say under our protection, because the law was made by the
Canadian Parliament. One of the most vexing features of this whole procedure is that
in the operation we have collected $9 a gallon.
Not only have our officials been the link between the distillery and the rum-runner, but
we have been associated in the process to the
extent that we have received $9 per gallon
on whisky exported.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would my honourable friend be good enough to make clear
to the House under what law or compulsion
the Government violated its own treaty with
the United States?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was no
violation of the treaty with the United States.
The officials of the American Government who
came to Ottawa in January of last year and
remained for a number of days in conference
with our officials, clearly stated, and repeated
more than once, as my honourable friend will
find in the debates that took place elsewhere,
that they were quite satisfied that the Canadian officials had done their duty. But the
treaty had been made to meet certain conditions, and those conditions were completely
transformed by the ability of the rum-runner
to adapt himself to the situation.
I could read a statement made by some of
the gentlemen who came here, but I need not
do so if my honourable friend will take my
word that they declared themselves to be
satisfied as to the sincerity and the loyalty of
the Canadian Government officials, who

APRIL 1, 1930
furnished ail the information that they had
obligated tbemselves ta furnish under the
treaty. But the United States representatives
said: "This is not sufficient. Could you not
go one step fartiier?"
That was in January. I may say that in
August last the Prime Minister, perbaps aiter
examining very seriously into the matter,
came ta the conclusion that aur position was
an untenable one, and asked the law officers
af the Crown whether the Government could
nlot by regulation or ordier in council stop the
action af those excise and customs agents.
He was informed that the law was such that
there was no way out of the difficulty exoept
legislation, and I think he announced that legislation would be submitted ta Parliament at
this session. I *as not in the country ten
but such was the news that I read while
abroad, as ta the attitude af the Prime Minister.
Those who, in tbis Chamber and outside, are
naw, like myseif, cognizant of the state of
things, will think and say that it is time ta
amend this law. I find this statement by
Admirai Billard, who was at that conference
af officiaIs in Ottawa in January last year:
I would like ta leave a thought with yau as
we are adjourning. The discussions have been
mast interesting. I arn gaing ta ask you ta

This is an oppeal fromn a highly responsible
oflicial ai thue Ainerican Governmenit righut at
aur door. I know that people are going about
asking whether we should put ourselves out in
order ta be friendly ta aur neighbours, and

si

running £rom the Atlantic ta the Pacifie, and
it is our duty to avoid doing anything that
would indicate an indifferent or hostile spirit
towards aur neighbours. It is for us to blaze
the way in showing amity, even if new legisiatien be necessary. No nation can feel a conecientiaus reproach for a generous act loyally
performed. On the Govemnment rests the
responsibility in fareign affairs. It knows what
is necessary in order to preserve proper international relations, because it is kept informcd of events ail over the world. I repeat
that the responsibility is upon the Government, and I pray that honourable members
wiIl leave the responsibility there.

'Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I intend ta mave in amendment that
this matter be referreci ta a Committee, and
for that reason 1 shall not discuss the question
as fully as I otherwise would. If it should be
the opinion of this Chamber that the matter
should be referred ta a special Committee,
every honourable member will be in a position
to discuss the whole situation when the Committee makes its report, accompanied by the
evidence taken before it.
However, there are one or two points upon
which I wisb. ta make some brief commente
now. The honourable leader of the Government (Han. Mr. Dandurand) has attempted
ta make an excuse, as I understand it, for the
delay on the part af the Govemnment in dealing with this matter. He made no reference ta
the report of the Customs Committee, which
was drafted after a very extensive and expensive inquiry, and which recommended that
clearances should not he accorded. That was
in 1926. The Government could bave brought
this proposeci legisiation before Pgrliament
long bef are thîs, if it had seen fit, and possibly
even if the Minister of National Revenue had
been agrecable. But, as the public knows, he
has neyer expressed himself in favour of this
legisiation. lie was not in favour of it last
year, and I assume that he takes the same
stand now. In other words, the Minister who
should have had most ta do with the legisiation that is now proposed, is, as far as the
public bas been infor.med, opposed to this
legislation.
I believe in preserving the most friendly
and peaceable relations possible with aur
cantending that we owe them n o, more th=a neigUbours te the south. I arn not sure, how'.

taken by Great Britain.
I would draw the attention ai honourable We in Canada know from wehat we read in
members ta the fact that aur geographical the newepapers and public journals of the
situation is a peculiar one. We are separated United States that there is considerable infrom a mighty republie by a barder lime effioiency in the enforcement of their sumpý

tuary prohibition law. That is discussed in
their leading papers almost daily. It would
appear from a so-called straw vote taken by
the Literary Digest that a imajority are opposed te the Volstead law. We should have
reason to feel differently disposed if there
were a genuine desire on the part of the
bulk of the American people to comply with
their own law. Undoubtedly many honourable members have travelled extensively in
the United States in the last few years. It
has been my pleasure to visit a few places
there, and I confess that I never attended a
social function across the border where liquor
could not be obtained. As a rule it was very
much in evidence.
The honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has referred to the action of
Great Britain in entering into a convention
to extend the territorial waters of the United
States froin three to twelve miles off the
shore, or to the distance a pursuing boat
could travel in an hour. Well, that has not
prevented the shipment of liquor from Great
Britain to the United States. No doubt it
bas made the work of the rum-runner a little
more difficult, but, in the language of the
street, ho gets there all the same. The records
show that, and we know it is a fact. Moreover, the rum-runner has access to the British,
French and Dutch West Indian Islands, if not
to the American, and certainly he has no
trouble in getting into Mexico. If we were
to pass the proposed legislation, do honourable
members think it would iprevent to any considerable extent the importation of liquor
into the United States? Notwithstanding our
treaty, as the honourable gentleman has told
us, the exportation of whisky from this country
across the border has grown from some 700.000 gallons in 1926 to something over 1,000,000 gallons in 1929.
If we grant that it is our duty to try as
far as possible to co-operate with a friendly
neighbour in the enforcement of laws against
acts that are inherently criminal and wrongful,
that is not a reason for supporting this Bill,
for I venture to say the great majority of
people in this country do net believe that the
consumption of liquor is an act that falls
into that classification, or that it is morally
wrong. Many people may consider it unwise
for various reasons to consume liquor, but
they would net look upon it as an offence
against morals. We should not be violating
any law that is regarded throughout the world
as fundamentally moral if we continued the
Act as it is at the present time. We gave
concrete evidence of our friendliness when we
passed the Act of 1924, and I do not know
whether the United States Government have
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

come to us asking anything further. As I
understand it, the proposal is that we should
tender an extension of the privileges we are
now conceding to them. I think that the
possibility of an approaching election may
have had some influence on the mental outlook of some gentlemen. I refer, net to the
honourable gentleman who proposed the
legislation so eloquently to-night (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), but to the Premier of this
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was no
question of an election in August last, when
the Prime Minister declared his intention.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I do net intend to discuss any statement that was made
at that time. It was net current in the
country. In fact, I heard of it here for the
first time. I certainly think everyone was
surprised when the measure was brought down
in the other House; and I may say that I am
surprised by the warmth with which the
honourable gentleman has advocated the
passing of the Bill here.
When legislation is intended to curb actions
that are net inherently immoral, we have a
right to consider the economie sacrifices that
will have to be made if the legislation goes
into effect. It has been indicated by the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that fresh expenditure of capital bas been
made by persons engaged in the manufacture
of liquor since 1924, since the convention was
entered into, and that the number of distilleries has increased from 10 te 27.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
was made elsewhere.

That statement

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We will assume
it is truc. Are those people who have made
that investment-and who have made it
legally-to be suddenly prevented by this
Parliament from lawfully disposing of their
legitimate products? There was a great deal
of expenditure of labour in connection with
the increase in the number of distilleries. The
expert of liquor brings in a large revenue at
the present time, of which Canada seems to
be very much in need. That $9 a gallon is
net to be despised. I do not want to be
considered as opposing the Bill merely on
economic grounds, although in these times of
mounting costs and diminishing revenues
the income that is derived from this exportation is very important. It is of material value
in connection with the employment situation
in Canada, for labour is engaged net only in
operating the distilleries, but also in the
erection of buildings and plants and the extension of operations.

when they ask the Government of Canada ta

land to wbich it is a crime to send it, 1 tbink

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Why does the
Government do it? Why does it direct it
there, in the face of its own treaty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The treaty of
1924 does flot deal with this point.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It purports ta
suppress smuggling.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At the reading
of this treaty in the other Huse a prominent
legal gentleman facing the Government asked,
"Why did you, fot make a dlean job of it by
pro'hibitting clearances?" We did not make
a dcean job off it, but we majde such a bargain as covered at the moment the activities
of the bootlegger. He was asking for clearance
ta a foreign port in a ship of a few tons; he
was asking for cleartnce ta the Bahamas when
hie wvas going just across the Detroit river or
across Lake Ontario. That was iprovided for,
but we did not go far enough ta dispose aibsolutely of the situation. We are doing Vhat now.
My honourable friend says we should have
ta inquire inta the economic, the national
and the international aspects of this treaty.
Well, even tbough my bonourable friend is
not a Privy -Councillor, the exalted position
he occupies would, I think, justify the Prime
Minister in allowing him ta delve inta the
records of aour external affairs. International
affairs are not discussed in the open; records
are not brought ta Parliament. There are
such things as confidential documents that
pass between states. I wouild draw the attention of my honourable friend ta, the

express it in this Oliamber, not in a dark baleand-corner meeting where the representatives
of privatie interests will surround the comnmittee table. I do not want toaee the private
]nterests in this matter. I have been flaoded
with their literature. Il know what some of
them stand to lose, though, as I have said,
the twenty-nine or t:birty million gallons of
liquor in bond are surelly flot for tihe country
ta the south of us, since only one million
gallons sold last year were for that country.
My bonourable friend must knoiv that there
bas been an investigation as ta the importance
of this trade. We bave a record of the permits issued and the amounit tbat was collected.
I bave froni the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, and I can pass it over ta my bonourable
friend, a complete record of tbe aperatians in
this conneotion from 1911 ta 1929. The

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does tbe honourable gentlemen intimate ta the bonourable

SENATE

Stateinent of Prime Minister following Cabinet
Council is believed to mean ultimate stopping
of export of liquor to United States.
(By William Marchington, Staff Correspondent
of The Globe.)
Ottawa, Oct. 1.-That the Government is
definitely moving toward the prohibition of
liquor clearances fron Canada to the United
States, and wvill probably introduce legislation
at the approaching session of Parliament, was
indicated by Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King,
Prime Minister, following the Cabinet meeting
this afternoon.
Asked by the correspondents whether there
had been any developments since his intimation, in August, that the Government had been
impressed with the efforts the United States is
making to suppress the illicit importation of
liquor into that country, the Prime Minister
stated that the Cabinet some time ago had
instructed the Department of National Revenue
to draft a regulation dealing with the matter
of liquor clearances, and submit it to the
Department of Justice for an opinion as to its
validity.
No Authority at Present.-In compliance
with that instruction, the Commissioner of
Customs submitted to the Justice Department
a proposed regulation, couched in the simplest
possible terms, and the opinion of the Department of Justice was that the Governor in
Council Lad no authority to stop by Order in
Council shipments of liquor from Canada to
any country wherein the importation of liquor
is prohibited or restricted.
lu reply to further questions, the Prime
Minister stated that an Act of Parliament
would be required to prohibit the traffic, which
now goes chiefly across the Detroit River and
the Great Lakes, and it would be for Parliament to decide whether such an Act would be
passed at the forthcoming session. Whether
the Government would introduce a Bill to make
the necessary changes in the law would be disclosed in the Speech fron the Throne.
To Refuse Clearances.-The Prime Minister's
statement to-day was construed to mean that
the Government has definitely decided to accede
to the request of the Government of the United
States, and refuse absolutely to grant clearances to liquor-laden vessels destined for the
neiglbouring Republic. This course has been
strongly advocated by The Globe, the Manitoba
Free Press and other newspapers and by influential citizens and supporters of the Government in all parts of the Dominion.
Should the Government bring down a bill
at the coming session of Parliament-and there
now seeis to be little doubt of it-it will win
the approval of thousands of people, throughout
Canada, who have long felt that the Dominion
should have no connection, officially or otherwise, with the smuggling of liquor into the
territory of a large and friendly neighbour.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called I should like to renew a discussion
which I had last night with the honourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), with a view to clearing the ground
for a further discussion of the Export Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ask permission
to have Mr. Taylor, of the Department of
National Revenue, come to the floor.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
The question
that I asked of the honourable leader of the
Government last night was whether or not
the law had always permitted to an exporter
the alternative of either paying the excise
or giving a bond for double the excise, and
when the practice was adopted of paying
excise for the purpose of exporting to the
United States. I referred to the speech of the
Right Honourable the Prime Minister in
another place, as reported in Hansard of
March 14 of this year, in which a form of
procedure was given and from which it would
appear that at some time and under some
circumstances some officer of the Government
issued a regulation or memorandum to provide specially for exportation to the United
States, with the payment of excise, as distinguished from exportation to other countries. Prior to prohibition in the United
States there was no necessity for any such
provision: the practice must have originated
after prohibition. I should like to know by
whose authority and by means of what circulars, or in what way, the practice has been
inaugurated by the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, the statement I made last night was
that prior to the Volstead Act the law covering the exportation of liquor provided that
a bond might be given or excise duty might
be paid. That law has never been altered to
this date, but after the Volstead Act came
into effect the distilleries ceased to ask for a
bond, inasmuch as there could be no return
certifying that the goods had reached a eustoms officer at a port in the United States.
It was the demand for the bond that ceased,
and the excise duty was collected instead.
The alternative always existed, and still exists,
for all countries that are not under a prohibition law. It would continue, in posse,
with regard to the United States, but that
the giving of a bond would mean the forfeitire of double the duty; so the shipper, instead
of giving a bond on a cargo for an American
port, would simply come in and deposit the
money.
I am informed that the procedure which
followed, and which I described, for the issuing of a permit to allow of the transport of
liquor from the distillery to the port of exit,
was arranged, with the provincial authorities,
in order to make sure that there should be no
short-circuiting. Sir Henry Drayton was here
about two years ago interviewing the authorities to see that such liquor shipped from the
distillery would leave the country and would
be outside the jurisdiction of the Province of
Ontario.

APRIL 2, 1930
Hon. Mr. BELAND: It seems that in some
cases a bond of twice the amount of excise
duty was demanded. I should like ta know
in what particular cases that was done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is still being
done. It is the law that when a shipper asks
for the right ta export liquor ta any country
not under prohibition, he may give a bond,
representing double the duty, ta insure that
such merchandise shall reach the port indicated
in the ship's statement. When a certificate
comes from that country that the merchandise
bas reached there and has been delivered, then
the bond is annulled; so the shipper pays nothing, either in excise or otherwise. There is
no charge on goods going out of the country.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I think it is incorrect
ta refer ta the prohibition law in the United
States as the Volstead Act. Prohibition in
the United States is the result of an amendment ta the constitution.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. There are
two laws.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The Volstead Act
defines the alcoholic content of the beverages
that may be used.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, the honourable gentleman is right.
EXPORT BILL (INTOXICATING
LIQUOR)
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned diebate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 15, an Act ta amend the
Export Act, and the amendment thereto.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, my honourable colleague on this side of
the House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has moved
an amendment ta the motion for a second
reading of the Bill. The amendment is as
follows:
That the Bill be not now read a second time,
but that it be referred to a special committee,
ta be selected by the Senate, for the purpose of
first obtaining information as to the effect the
passing of the said Bill would have on the
economie, national and international conditions
and relations of Canada.
The honourable leader of the House yesterday took the view that such a committee
would be useless. But to-day we have, right
before our eyes, an illustration of the fact
that this committee would be very useful indeed, and is very necessary. Sitting in front
of the honourable leader, on the floor of the
House, we have an official of the Department
of National Revenue, I presume. Why is he
here? He is here, as we have just observed,

87

to pass information ta the leader of the
House in order that he may be able ta answer
intelligently the questions put to him by
honourable members. Now, if my honourable
friend the leader of the House is not completely informed in regard ta the questions
that arise under this proposed legislation,
how can he expect the ordinary member of the
House ta be in a position, as he ought, ta
understand the question fully, ta exercise wise
judgment, and ta vote intelligently? If it is
necessary ta have an official of the Department here, it is more necessary to have a
committee who could ask that gentleman and
other persons ta come and give them information. The members of the committee would
sit around the table, and any member could
make enquiry, as he is entitled ta, and
examine witnesses called, and thus learn the
merits of this Bill, so as ta judge whether it
is in the public interest that it should be
supported by honourable members of this
House. I say that my honourable friend has
demonstrated that there are great merits in
the amendment moved by the honourable
member for Moose Jaw.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me? I did not know but
that a technical question might be put ta me,
and I wanted ta be sure that I had the support of the official of the Department.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: For what other
reason would he be here?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And I find that
my statement was exact.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: For what other reason
would he be here? If my honourable friend
is not sure, what about myself? What about
the honourable member who was asking the
question? What about the former minister
of the Crown, who was a minister in this
Govemment? He had ta ask a question.
Then what about the ordinary member? I
do not think that my honourable friend can,
by any manoeuvring, get away from the conclusion that he has demonstrated before this
House and the country that there is real and
urgent need for understanding this Bill, its
possible consequences, and its relationship ta
the ,public interest in Canada, and to public
interests outside of Canada.
I had intented ta say a word or two further
in regard to the committee. I thought the
Senate ýprides itself upon its deliberateness and
the splendid and effective work of its committees, and that this was one of the great
traditions of this honourable House. Often
I have heard the statement made by honourable members, even by my honourable friend

88

SENATE

the leader himself, in this House and outside,
that when we want good work done in the
public interest we send a measure to one of
our standing committees or to a special committee. I am sure I am correct in saying
that honourable members have not been slow
to express the view that it was then that
we got the best results. I am at a loss to
understand why my honourable friend should
so suddenly lose ail confidence in the committees of this House. In this amending Bill is there nothing suggested that
requires the careful consideration of the
best minds in this House? Is there any more
effective or more successful way of giving
it such consideration than to refer it to a
special committee? Have we not demonstrated
year after year that a special committee of
this House will do better work in a week or
two than will be done in many weeks in
another place in this building? We have
been proud of that, and my honourable friend
the leader has been proud of it; yet in this
very important matter, bearing upon great
vested interests in this country, and relating,
as he has told us, to questions of international
concern with which we are not ail familiar,
when it is proposed that there should be a
reference to committee in order that we may
without semblance of hurry get to the bottom
of these affairs, and know where we stand and
see clearly what to do, my honourable friend
rises and, discarding ail his previous sentiments in regard to the efficacy of our committees, tells us that tihe proposed cornmittee
would be useless.
Honourable members, I do not accept that
dictum. I adhere to the doctrine, which I
have endeavoured to explain, that if we are to
do right in this matter, we must take time,
and that there is no better way te go about
the work than to turn this matter over, for
inquiry and investigation, to a. committee of
the leading members of the House. Let them
call whom they will., and inquire where they
like, and find out alil about this matter, and
then come back to the House and enable it
to give a judgment that is fundlamentally wise.
Why should we hurry? My honourable
friend has told us that this matter has been
under consideration for a very long time; in
fact, for a number of years. If it has taken
the Government five or six years to make up
their minds on the subject, why should honourable members d this bouse be grudged not
only a committee of inquiry but a few days
within which te arrive ati a full understanding
of the subject? When we have had before us
questions like the St. Lawrence waterways,
involving international issues and international
loa. Mr. TANNER.

concerns of the highest importance te the
country, there has been no hesitation in sending them to a special committee for the purpose of inquiry and investigation. My honourable friend had no compunction in turning
over to a committee of inquiry ail that was
involved in that question. Surely there are
greater international interests concerned in
the proposed St. Lawrence waterways development than are involved in the question of
stopping some liquor frorn going out of this
country and dribbling, perhaps, into the United
States. Another great and momentous question that I might mention, the safeguarding
of the rights of the men who served
this country during the war, and the
rights of their wives and their children, was
sent to a special committee. Is this question
about a little liquor, a dribble in comparison
with the quantity that the people of the United
States make for themselves, of such high and
mighty importance that we cannot trust a
Senate committee even to look into it? The
interests and welfare of the returned men who
fouglit on the battlefields of Flanders, and
of their wives and children, are insignificant
in comparison, I suppose. No! No Senate
committee shall lay their hands upon this
question of a little liquor getting into the
United States. The reason is, I presume, that
they might not understand it and they might
make a mistake about it. At least, this is the
only conclusion that I can come to, in view of
my honourable friend's dictum in that regard.
As I say, I have some faith in the Senate
and in its committees. I believe it is necessary to have the fullest inquiry. I will not say
whether I am going to vote for this Bill or
not, but I want to know about it. I differ
from my honourable friend when he says that
a great majority of people in this country
desire it. I take issue with him on that. I
believe the majority of the people of this
country do not want this legislation. Ahl we
have to do is to open our eyes and read the
press, and listen to what people are saying. My
honourable friend says that the people on the
other side of the line want it. I take issue with
him again. I do not believe the people of the
United States want it. I can well believe that
some of the politicians over there want it. I
am saying only what everybody knows, that it
is nothing but a political party football. Anybody who travels through the United States
and observes what is going on knows that it
is only a political party football. It has been
since the beginning, and is to-day. As for the
people at large, I believe the great majority
of them are opposed to it.

APRIL

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Just for the sake of clearness, will my honourable friend allow a question? He has expressed a belief -as ta what our peaple think
about "it" and what the people on the other
side oçf the line Vhink cd "it." What is tihe
Does he mean that the
'lit" involved?
majority of the people in the United States do
flot want this Export Bill, and that similarly
aur own people do not want it, or is he referring ta the sentiment of the people in each
country with regard ta the liquor traffic?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not think the
people are interested in this particular Bill.
I should net like ta repeat some of the language I have seen in letters from people of
importance in the United States. The Ianguage they use, an the assumptÀion that Parliament is going ta pass the Bill, is certainly
not very complimentary. Nor do they intimate that there will be any reciprocity on
the part of the United States in regard ta it.
0f course that does not surprise anyone, because the politicians of the United States were
neyer known ta give very much, although
they m'ay be asking for or expecting a good
deal. What I arn referring ta particularly is
the fact that 1 do not thin4k public sentiment in this country is in favour of legislation
of this kind-I may be wrang-nor do I believe that public sentiment in the United
States is in favour of this legislation or the
legislation which is now on the books of that
country.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My honourable friend says he is nat sure that popular
opinion in this country is in favour of this
legisiation. How would he account for the
vote in another place, where the members are
supposed ta represent directly the views of
thc people?
Hon. Mr. TANNEBR: My right honoumble
friend had a seat in that Chamber for a number of years. I think it s1hould hardly be
necessary for him ta ask me to explain wby,
on occasions, that House passes legisîstion.
which wouild neyer be passed if the mesubers
sincerely expressed their real views. On
occasions when legisiation bas coame up ta
this House frorn another place, the messge
that was conveyed, not with it, but in the air,
was that those who Ïhad passed it wauld be
very pleased to see it defeated in this Hause.
Has that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
message came ta my hanourable friend?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We live in a world in
which we understand one another. In the
political world we have at least some understanding af political moves, and I say that in

. 89

2,1930
my judgment bath aides in the other House
are playing politics with this Bill. I do flot
know that 1 arn in a position to give judgment.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Inferentially,
if they are playing politics they are doing
something that they think will please the
electorate and get them votes. This would
indicate that they feel that the people are
with them in the vote they have given.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: They think that, but
I do flot think it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:- Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I say I do flot think
it. They may think it. Sometimes a man
who is looking an at a game of chess or
checkers can see the moves very much more
clearly than the man at the table. Personally
I have had a littie experience with both aides
of thîs question, and I know that if I were
going to take my chances on election-if I
were merely gaing ta look for votes, I would
not vote the way those gentlemen voted.
When my hanourable friends interrupted
me, I was going to say that there is a statement here with which I should like to take
issue. It is a statement by my honourable
friend the leader of the House. In the course
of bis remarks he said:
All the Canadian Government desire is to
cease being a party, officially, to, the smuggling
that is going on under aur own legisiation.
1 do not know whether my honourable friend
intended to make that statement as strong as
he did, but I listened ta the subsequent part
of bis address and I came ta this conclusion,
that the uninformed man, the man listening
to the tenar of the honourable gentleman's address, and to words such as I have quoted,
would draw ne otiher inferenoe than that
the Government of Canada and the officers of
the Government of Canada are positively and
actively engaged in the business of smuggling
liquor into the United States; that the Canadian Government and the Canadian people
are the ones who are doing the smuggling.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who are feeding the 8mugglers.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is a very different aspect of the matter and one to which
1 arn going to cail attention. My honourable
friend said:
Ail the Canadian Government desire is to
cease being a party, officially, to the smuggling
that is gaing on under our own legisiation.

My honourable friend understands, and 1
understand; but what I arn endeavouring to
state is that the uninformed, ordinary man
would came ta the conclusion that the Government of Canada is in the smuggling business,

90

SENATE

whereas the fact is that all the duty, all the
concern of the officers of this country is to
protect its revenue. Every step they take is for
that purpose and for no other. My honourable
friend should have made that clear. He should
not have left the matter as he did.
Why do those officers protect and safeguard this liquor and see it on board ship?
It is because in the Province of Ontario and
the Province of Quebec there is only one
lawful selling agency, the legal vendors, who,
as I understand it, have the right to buy
liquor from the distillery or brewery, and
consequently it is the duty of the Dominion
officials to see, first, that the revenue is paid,
and secondly that that liquor does not go
into any other hands than those of the legal
vendors in Canada, who are the only ones
entitled to buy such goods. Now, I say that
by his renarks my honourable friend-perhaps
it was done unwittingly; I am not charging
him with doing it purposely-led me to the
conclusion that I have mentioned, which I
do not need to repeat.
My honourable friend also said that this
policy had been endorsed by Parliament
several times-twice, I think he said. What
my honourable friend did not explain, and
what I should like to know, is, why the conviction was so long in sinking into the mind
of the Government. When they submitted
those treaties and resolutions to this House
why did they not take the stcp that they are
taking now? My honourable friend says that
no doubt they did not become fully convincedHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
My
honourable friend forgets that I stated that
we took steps to meet conditions as they
developed. From the British treaty to our
treaty there was an advance made towards
trying to curb smuggling. The new conditions
that developed, which the smuggler discovered,
enabled him to take advantage of our law
and regulations, and necessitate the further
stcp that we now propose.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes, but the developments in this export of liquor to the United
States occurred shortly after the treaties were
made. Conditions one year ago, say, were
not different from what they are to-day. In
1929 there was just as much immorality-if
it be immorality-and there was just as mch
violation of international relationships as today. My honourable friend was not ready in
1929 to make any such proposal as he now
makes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon. I have just cited
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

an interview given to the press by the Prime
Minister on the 1st of October, saying that
the matter had been seriously gone into by
the law officers of the Crown last summer.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am referring to a
year ago, whieh is not a very long time. The
Right Honourable the Prime Minister may
have been suddenly converted, like the man
who was travelling to Damascus; he may have
seen a great light in October. But I am saying that in 1929, just a year ago, there was
no hurry about it, as far as the Prime Minister was concerned. He may or may not be
right now, but it is the duty of honourable
members of this House, who perhaps have not
seen the same light, to know the facts; and
we should be very glad to have the Prime
Minister come before our Committee and tell
us, in this connection, what converted him,
what changed his mind, what gave him a new
heart. In Marih and April of 1929 ho had a
stony heart; you could not drive a peg into
it. His mind was closed to argument, to
reason, to international appeal. Let us have
a committee, before whirh the Prime Minister
can appear and tell what happened in October
last. Was that the time he was thinking about
having an election, I wonder. A common
rumour says that last fall ho wanted to go to
the country, but was overruled. Now it is
said that he wants to have an election in June
or July, with two sessions this year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend has a very good imagination.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We shall all be lucky
if that happens; we shall be very lucky indeed, because in addition to having two sessions we shall have a new Prime Minister.
My right honourable friend (Rt. Hon. Mr.
Graham) asked me a short while ago about
the vote in another place. Perhaps iif lie would
make a few inquiries underground Le might
find out that the prospect of two sessions in
1930 had something to do with the vote in
another place. I do not know, but there are
stories about it.
I regard this whole question as a very
serious and grave one in every respect. I think
it is the first time since 1867 that a measure
has been presented to Parliament as a threat
of a kind from the Prime Minister. We read
that in another place the Prime Minister, in
the course of expounding this measure, gave
Parliament to understand that if this Bill
were not adopted lie would no longer carry the
responsibility of Minister of External Affairs
for this country; by which lie meant, I
presume, that he would retire from the
responsibility in that regard. I say that was

APRIL 2, 1930
a threat of a kind. But I find compensation
for it in the reflection that, after all, Canada
is not a one-man country. No matter how
great the leader of a Government in this country may be, there bas always been found
somebody willing, ready and able to take his
place and to carry on the work that the position entails. So if this honourable Chamber
should decide that this Bill is not in the public
interest, and if the Right Honourable the
Prime Minister should decide to retire, I arn
not at al! fearful that there will be a calamity
or a cataclysm. I feel sure that someone will
be found-it may be my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)-to take on
the burden and carry out the great work of
the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister made a distinct statement in another place in regard to this business, in these emphatic words:
Distilling and brewing is a perfectly legal
and legitimate business, and is so regarded.
Further on he said:
Then it is said that the manufacture and
sale of liquor for consumption and export is
under our laws a perfectly legitimate business.
I do not dispute that for one minute.
So I want to put it on record here that the
Right Honourable Leader of the Government
in another place has pronounced his benediction on the legal and legitimate character of
the business that we are now discussing.
As I understand it, there are important
industries in this country related to, and in
a certain measure interlocked with, the distilling and brewing business. Large sums of
money have been invested in all these industries. Men have put capital into them for
the good of the country, because the businesses are legal and legitimate. As a consequence, large numbers of people are employed
throughout this country. We find, too, that
this Government, over a period of years, has
encouraged and sponsored the development
of these industries, and that no notice has
ever been given that a time might come when
the Government would use a club on them.
The people of the country have co-operated
in the extension of these undertakings, because every province to-day, with one exception, has divested itself of what is called
prohibition. Not only did the Federal Government protect and foster these .industries, but it
took good care to draw from them large sums
of money in taxes of various kinds, whicb
money was spent for public works and other
purposes in this country.
Now, what is about to happen? These legal
and legitimate businesses, if this Bill goes
through, will receive a severe blow. In an-

other House the Minister of National Revenue
likened brewing and distilling to the boot and
shoe business, or any other kind of business
in Canada, one being just as legitimate as the
other. Why should these industries be singled
out for such a severe blow? Would the leader
of the Government here, or the Government
itself, propose to strike a blow at the boot
and shoe business, or any other wliich it had
fostered and protected, without seeing that
there should be some compensation? In a
word, after having built up these industries,
and encouraged, protected and fostered them,
and milked them for taxes, the Government
comes along-it may be, in a paroxysm of
virtue- and says, "We are going to strike you
a blow, possibly destroy a large part of your
business, but you will get nothing." We do
not take the land or property of the meanest
citizen of this country or injure his business
without compensation, but in this instance we
have not a word as to compensation.
Worse than that, honourable members:
when a special committee of this honourable
body is suggested for the purpose of considering all these matters, so that the men
who have invested their money, and also the
representatives of workmen, might appear,
state their case, and ask for consideration,
the honourable leader of the Government
turns to us and says: "It is useless. We will
not do it." I want to ask whether it is not
the inherent and fundamental right of every
British subject not only to be protected in
his rights and property, but also to have the
opportunity of being heard? Is there any
body in this country more fitted for, or more
specially charged wit.h, the duty of protecting
the people and hearing their grievances than
the Senate of Canada? I say there is not.
But my honourable friend says such a procedure is useless. Why is it useless? Is it
because my honourable friend wants to ram
this Bill through without full consideration?
Is it because he wants what we call railroading of legislation in this regard? It should
not be. We are here as a deliberate body.
We have been accustomed to take time. It
is our business to take time. The Lord knows
we have plenty of time to do this work. Instead of adjourning so often, let us sit and
hear the people, and render justice to them.
I referred a few moments ago to the situation existing when this matter was before
another House one year ago and we had a
long and carefully considered judgment from
the Government of the day. What was that
judgment? Every aspect of the question was
considered. The memibers of the Government knew then as much as they know today; they have not learned a tittle in

92

SENATE

the twelve months. They have no more
information than they had then.
There
is not placed before us to-day one statement of fact that was not before both
Houses last year. What did they say last
year? I am going to cite to the House a few of
the remarks made by the Minister of National
Revenue, speaking for the Government of the
day-the same Government that is now in
power.
That Minister said, among other
things:
I believe it is literally impossible for a wet
country to lie adjacent to a so-called or ostensibly dry country without a flow of liquor proceeding from the wet te the dry.
Again, lie said-and it is known to-day-that
during the war Canada was dry and the United
States was wet. Liquor flowed freely into
Canada from the United States, and the
Unitied States did nothing to stop it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Were the United States
Government asked to stop exporting from the
United States?
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
I do not know
whether they were asked to stop it or not.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
asked to stop?

Were we

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Nor am I very sure
that we are asked to stop exporting now. I
am not here to defend the Minister of
National Revenue, but I am giving what lie
said a year ago. He went on to say that
after the conference of January, 1929, the
Government of Canada communicated with
the Government of the United States, and
offered to permit customs officers of the
United States to be stationed at the Canadian
docks from which liquor was shipped. The
Minister added the remark that the United
States refused this offer and said that the
only thing that would serve their purpose
would be for the Canadian Government to
stop the issue of clearances. Then the Minister made this statement:
When liquor is destined to the United States
the excise is paid and it is then just as legal
to export that liquor as any other commodity
-boots and shoes, furniture, iron and steel, or
anything else that can legally be exported.
Also this important statement:
The boats that are carrying this liquor to
the United States are almost 100 per cent
United States boats; they are not Canadian
boats at all.
This disposes of the suggestion that we are
carrying on this smuggling. We are net carrying on this smuggling; it is the Americans
themselves who are carrying on the smuggling,
and, as I hope to show later, it is not our
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

duty and responsibility, but the duty and
:esponsibility of the American Government
,o look after their own people.
In other
words, the Minister pointed out that while
they were asking Canada te deny clearances
to these American boats, these same boats
could go in and out of the United States
without let or hindrance, without having to
report, or having to clear the United States
Customs; and I understand the same conditions exist to-day. The Minister of National
Revenue very properly reminded them that
in what they are asking us to do they are
asking for more than they do themselves.
Another statement of the Minister is that
he visited Detroit River district, where liquor
is shipped; that on the river, in a launch, he
could see the United States customs office,
and he was told that the boats frequently
crossed in the daytime. I want to take a few
minutes to read what the Minister said at
page 2696:
The chief export points are the Windsor
district and the Bridgeburg district. I have
said something which may appear a criticism
of the United States. I have no desire to be
offensive, but I think there are some facts
I should place before the House in view of the
stateients made that we are not dealing in a
friendly way with our neighbour to the south.
It bas been stated that these boats go across
at night. That is not entirely true. I took
the trouble last fall to go down to Windsor.
I was offered safe conduet by a liquor exporter
and went out on a launch on the Detroit River.
I could see the United States customs office on
the other shore, and I could also see that it
was not difficult to detect any boats that left
the Canadian shore to go to the American side.
While in Windsor I got into conversation with
a man engaged in the business of exporting
liquor. I asked him, "Do you cross in the
daytime?" He answered, "Yes, quite often."
I said, "How is it they do not get you?" He
replied with a smile, "It just happens that
they are not there when we go across."
Our inspector went to Windsor not so very
long ago. He did not select any special day.
While there, on January 14, lie observed thefollowing vessels cross the river to Detroit in.
daylight with cargoes of liquors:
"Ben," J. King, master,
10 quarter barrels beer
il cases whiskey
"Rat," J. Sales, master,
24 cases whiskey
5 cases wine
1 case brandy
"Rat," A. Jacks, master,
19 cases whiskey
1 case wine
"Rabbi," I. Straight, master,
5 half barrels beer
8 cases whiskey
"Bird," J. Bloom, master,
18 cases whiskey
8 cases Bourbon
1 case Scotch whiskey

APRIL 2, 1930
"«Bar," J. Peters, master,
13 cases wbiskey
4 cases Bourbon
3 cases brandy
That was in one day. Those boats went over
in broad dayiight. I leave members to draw
their own inferences from that state o! affaira.
The Minister of National Revenue left
that point there. The Mini8ter also read a
report which I an going to take the liberty
of repeating. It is a Teport from the Bridgeburg district, by tlie Collector there, to the
Commissioner of Customs:
I wish to give you a short account of the
rum-running at this port, and our procedure
in the matter. There are about twelve boats
plying between here and Buffalo, N.Y., the river
at this point being about bal! a mile wide.
Some days we only have two or three hoate
out, and on other days the wbole fiset wili
make a trip. The liquor and aie are brought
froin the distillery and brewery by truck,
arriving here about two o'clock in the afternoon. The boats are ahl loadsd and clearance
granted about 5 p.m. and they are comipeiled
to isave by 6 p.m. Some o! these boats carry
froin 800 to 1,000 cases, and on their arrivai
on tbe American side it takes from two to
thres bours to unload tbem. No effort as fan
as we can see is made by the United States
authorities to seize any of 'these boats, as the
United States Custome are always notiýfied by
us an hour or two before the boats leave, and
occasiona]ly we notif y tbema as the boats are
leaving, giving thema the naines of the boats
and the quantity of liquor or ale on board.
'We have had high custoins officiais front
Buffalo, speciai agents and officers connected
witb the coast guard corne over to tbe Canadiau aide, watcb these boats ioad and pull out.
Tt is a well known fact that sorne of tbese boats
land within a f ew hundred yards o! the United
States custorns office at the foot of Ferry Street
and uffload witbout beîng disturbed.
Soins f sw weeks ago, no doubt you saw in
the press whers it was stated that a truck baed
drawn out on the Peace Bridge, and unloaded
the aIe down on the bank on the Arnerican aide
by tying a rope around the cases and lowering
thern to the river bank. As a matter o! fact
this aie was unioaded front one o! the mmr
boats plying between bers and Buffalo, rigbt
under the Peace Bridge, witbin a f ew bundred
yards o! the customns bouse.
Our officers wbo cbeck these boats out were
informed by one o! the ruin-runners that tbey
had no trouble in landin their cargo, as tbey
were assisted by the oficrs of the dry squad
on the Amenican side, and it would appear that
sucb mnuet be tbe case wben seven or eigbt boats
wiil leave bere, and land tbeir cargoes, sometirnes taking themn three hours to unoad, without any casuaities.
These bosto are ioaded directly opposite froin
the United States cuatoms office at Black Rock.
l'ou can stand by the window in tbat office and
look acroas, and ses every case that is loaded
on the Canadian side. 1 know if conditions
were reversed that we would bave ail these
boats tied up in less than a week, and if tbe
oficera on the Arnerican side wish to put a stop
to tbis business tbey couid do it in about the
sarne length of tirne.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
year was that?

9
Whst

Hon. Mr. TANNER: May 21, 1l29. That
is the judgment of the Minister of National
Revenue, supported by that special report
from the Collector of Customns at Bridgeburg
to the Commissioner of Customs at Ottawa.
The Minister of National Revenue made a
further statement, namely, that under the
treaty of 1924 the Canadian Government
agreed to give to the United States information of ail clearances of vessais leaving Canadian ports carrying liquor to the Uniited States.
Then hie went on to say:
I arn not going to suggest any reason, but
peculiarly enough we were requested by the
United States Goverment to discontinue the
gving of telephone notices to the collector at
Detroit, and in accordance with that requst
such nties were no longer given at that port.
They asked us then to give them weekly reports
rather than daily reports by telephone, and we
have acceded to their request.
In vjew of what I have just read from the
report of the Collector at Bridgeburg, one can.
easily conclude why the United States authorities did not want notices sent to them-why
they did flot want the telephone information
The gentlemen with whom they were cooperating might be hiindered in their operations if the information were given.
Tie Minister touched upon another aspect
in his statement, de.claring that if clearance
were not granted the traffice would be forced
underground, to the corruption of the Canadian people.
Then the Minister referred to another important point, namely, the question whethez or
not, if legisiation of this kind went trough,
this country would have to undertake the
responsibility of seeing that the law was enforced. In other words, hie discussed the question whether ws should then have to undertake to keep liquor out of the United States
in addition to keeping it out of our own
country. This is what Mr. Euler said on that
subject:
There are those who say-and I have in mind
now particularly a prominent Toronto newspaper-that if we passed a law probibiting the
granting of clearances, we would at least have
washed our national bands of an offence against
a friendly nsigbbour, and that, baving done
that, we would be under no obligation to spend
money or turne to uphold the lams of the United
States. 1 cannot agree with that view. I canflot escape the conclusion that we then assume
a responsibility wbicb now rests upon the
United States. As the matter stands, if there
is any violation o! law it is a violation of
United States law. As it would be under the
new iaw, it wouid bie a violation o! Canadian
customs law. The iaw in the lem, and we cannot sbirk responsibility as readily as that sug-

94

SENATE

gestion would make it appear. If a Canadian
customs law is violated, surely it becomes the
duty of Canadian customs officers to see that
tiat violation is punished. I am not trying to
exaggerate; I do not think I am drawing a
fanciful picture at all, but I say that if we
are under an obligation in the Department of
National Revenue to see that violations of the
law are punished, surely we shall need to estaiblish a preventive force a good deal larger than
the one we have now, which, I may say, is
giving me enough trouble as it is. I am sure
the most ardent prohibitionist will not say that
this country should be under any obligation to
spend large sums of money in employing many
men to sec that that law prohibiting the
exportation of liquor is not violated. Nations
have not yet become quite so altruistic as that.
Besides that, we would not succeed; although it
might be lessened to some extent. After we
had passed a law of that kind and liquor still
continued to flow into the United States I feel
sure thiat our neighbours would yet be much
inelined to criticize and we would continue to
get the blame.
That was the considered judgment of the
Government of the day in 1929, a year ago,
as uttered by the Minister of National Revenue iin another place. And I think that what
he says is elementary, namely, that if we pass
a Canadian law on this subject we are bound
to enforce it, to live up to it, to honour it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will permit me to interrupt himwe are bound to sec that permits are net
issued with the consent of excise offleers in the
distilleries. We stop the distillers from selling
to those who are exporting to the United
States, and thereby we attack the evil at its
source. I admit that the rum-runner may go
to the Provincial Liquor Commissions, but in
doing so he goes beyond Federal jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
I say, honourable
members, that we go further. We have been
led as if we had a halter around our necks,
step by step, as I shall show in a few moments. Once these people get us committed
to this law, there will be other steps, for we
shall be committed to the principle of keeping liquor out of the United States. That
principle is greater than this legislaation, but
it includes this legislation. By adopting this
law we go beyond the legislation itself and
adopt the wide ,principle; and Mr. Euler, who
is a colleague of my honourable friend the
leader of the Government, and who sits in
Council with him to-day, is on record as
recognizing that fact. Surely they do not differ!
Surely they agree! Surely they are of one mind!
They should be. Mr. Euler says-and ho speaks
truly: "Let us adopt this principle and it
will not be long until there is another call
.rom Washington saying: 'We are not satisHon. Mr. TANNER.

fied. You must go a step further. If the
liquor is coming in other ways you must sec
to it that those other ways are blocked up.'"
My right honourable friend who sits next
to the leader (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) was
leading the House on the 23rd of May last,
when this subject was discussed, and he was
no more friendly to the proposition than was
the Minister of National Revenue. He made
some pretty strong statements, which I am
sure hc will recognize when I read them; and
I believe he will stand up for thein to-day,
because hc is not accustomed to making
statements one year and climbing out from
under themn the next. This is what my right
honourable friend said when he was speaking
for the Government in this House on May
23, as shown at page 285 of the Senate
Debates:
I do contend that our friends across the line
are more eager to co-operate when they w-ant
something than they are when we want something.

A very truc statement in!deed.
At page 286 ho said:
So long as the United States continues to
select men to carry out the provisions of such
measures as the Volstead Act from a party and
political standpoint, it cannot hope to succeed
thoroughly in their enforcement.
Also a very truc statement-as truc to-day as
it was last year.
Again at page 286 hc said:
I am told also that a very large percentage
of the men engaged in rum-running are Amerii-an citizens. American officials could locate
those men and could take them in charge as
soon as they reached American territory, if
tlhey really wanted to enforce the Act.
That also is seilf-evident.
Then my right honourable friend, like the
Minister of National Revenue, went on to
give a little of his personal experience. He
said:
Several years ago, being a representative of
the county of Essex, I was moving in and out
along the border for some years, and what I
saw led ume to the conclusion that the attempted
enforcement of its ou-n laws by the United
States was worse than a joke. The customs
authorities on the other side of the line, not
very far froin a big city, would watch certain
fellows start out with a boat load of liquor,
and when they thought the boat was sufficiently close to the American side they would
find it convenient to disappear. What would
be the use of notifying those officers, except
to tell them when to get away from their posts?
I am not exaggerating at al]. Any person who
knows the conditions on the border will thoroughly agree with me.
I think every honourable member of this
fHouse will agree with the right honourable
gentleman.

APRIL 2, 1930
A further rernark was this:
Why cannat the United States do the same
with regard to its own tonnage and its own
sailors? They corne into our territory, and the
American Governrnent knows that they are
coming into our territory to violate the law of
the United States. Why does it flot take charge
of that tonnage and confiscate it, and punish its
own citizens?
That also is a very reasonable and proper
suggestion.
Then my honourable friend said:
But this 1 do say, and I say it holdly, that
in my humble judgment tl4e United States ought
to be more in earnest, more practical and les
political in its enforcement of the Volstead Act
before calling on any sister nation ta do rauch
more than we have done.
And he added this little lesson ta our neighbours across the Uine:

Fonr a lime. you wjll remember. we were very

dry, particularly in Ontario. During that time
we never had any aid or sympathy from the
UJnited States in stopping the flow of liquor
from the other side. I arn mentioning this just
to show the attitude of rnany of aur people.

Then my right honourable friend said:
Many of our druggists to-day huy alcohol at
a very low price hecause it has been smuggled

in from the UJnited States.
Another statement which I should like ta
put on record is this:
What 1 want to impress on honourable gentlemen is that the United States, in wishing
us ta, go f urther than we have gone, ta go
further than Great Britain has gone, should at
least do her very best ta enforce her own law.

If she wants us to do something, she should
recipracate, and reciprocate very heartily.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: 0f course the honourable member knaws that the quantity of
liquor taken into the United States decreased
fifty per cent last year. I have the figures
here and can give themn if you will allow
me ta, read them.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do nat think it is
very material at this stage. My hanaurable
friend can make his speech later an.
I have endeavaured ta, give, as briefly and
accurately as passible, a bird's eye view of

the convictions of this Government, as vaiced
by the Minister of National Revenue and
my right honaurahie friend opposite, one year

ago.

I cail them convictions, because I pre-

sume they were very sincere.

They gave their

reasons. They had ail the facts befare them.
Now, I arn submitting that conditions ta-day
are exactly the same as they were a year aga,
and I want ta knaw, if that was the considered judgrnent of the Gavernment only
twelve months ago, its members having before
themn every fact relative or pertinent ta the
matter, why arc we to-day aBked ta take

95

the step that we are asked to take? What
warranty have we that those honourable gentlemen who change their rninds so quickly
without giving reasons and without stating
grounds will flot do so again? I have no
fundamental complaint about a man changing
his mind if he gives me his reasons and states
his grounds, but we are asked to, do something without any explanation except that the
Prime Minister saw a light sornewhere. H1e
rnay have seen the wrong kind of light. How
do we know? H1e saw a light of some kind
in October, and behold! what was dark twelve
months ago is 110w fully illuminated to my
honourable friends opposite; but not to us.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAH1AM:
in the dark.

You are stili

Hon. Mr. TANNER: We ask for a cornmittee in order that the light may be brought
to us. We have just as rauch right as honourable members opposite to know about this,
because we have to exercise our judgment,
we have to decide by our consciences whether
we are doing right or doing wrong. As I have
already stated, if we pass this Bill we have no
guarantee that six or nine or twelve months
hence the Government will not come ta us
and say: "We were wrong and we want to
reverse our judgment now. We have no reason
to give; we can say only that we were wrong."
Therefore I repeat, honourable senators, that
now, while honourable members of the Government are swithering, is the time to get
down to fundamentals. We should find out
whether the Government's opinion in 1929 was
a sound one, and, if not, why it was not. My
honourable friend who leads the Governmcnt
in this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made a
speech yesterday in support of the Bill, but
-I say it with ail respect-he gave no reasans
wby we should vote in favour of the measure.
Honourable members who refer to, his address
in Hansard will find that no0 grounds are stated
as to why there should be a change now;
everything my honourable friend said yesterday might have been said twelve months ago
with just as much force and truth; not a new
thing was disclosed. Why should we flot have
this committee? If there is aomething that
has not been exposed, let us sc if a special
committee can reveal it.
What is, in substance, the story of this
affair? We followed the example of the Mother
Country in agreeing, at the request of the
United States Government, that vessels might
be searched within twelve miles of the
American coast. That was the first bendiug
of our knees at the dictation of Washington.
Next, we undertook ta give notices concern-

96

SENATE

ing shipments and the sailing of vessels. Our
third concession was the setting aside of a
certain number of docks, so that there could
be no doubt as to the places from which. the
vessels sailed. Then we tendered to the
American Government the right to send
officers over to Canadian docks, to enable
themn to sec the liquor being loaded, and if
they so desired, to signal across the river to
their own customs officers. That was a generous
offer on our part, but it was not accepted.
We are now asked to go further and enact
legisiation that would resuit in a heavy loss of
revenue, the sacrifice to some extent of what
is a legal and legitimate business in this
country, and, as the Minister of National
Revenue made clear, the establishment of a
much larger preventive force than we now
bave, at correspondingly greater expense.
It hias been pointed out by both the
Minister of National Revenue and the Acting
Minister whose remarks 1 have qUoted, that
thle vessels engaged in the carrying of the
liquor are American-owned and manned by
United States citizens. Therefore, the American
Governmcnt bias jurisdiction over the ships and
their crews. As our Collector at Bridgeburg
said, if our neighbours wanted to stop the
traffie they could do so iii a week. The situation is easily visualized: each shore of the
river is visible from the other side, and the
vessels cross in broad dayligbt. Wby were
American officers not 121aced on Canadian
docks su that they could signal necessary information to their colleagues on the other
side? The inevitable conclusion is the one
to which my riglit bonourable friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) came, that the
responsible American authorities Ere bluffing,
ind that tbcy are endo.avouring te save their
own faces by making i t appear that wc in
Canada are wholly responsible for this illegal
traffie. It is impossible to believe that the
United States Government could not crush this
traffle if thcy wanted to, when they have the
power to seize the vessels and make prisoners
of the crews. I submnit that the American
Goverument do not want to enforce the law.
I should like to draw the attention of
honourable members to the fact that at tbe
conference hcld in Ottaiva last year between
representatives of the United States and of this
country, it was admitted by one of the
American delegates that 98 per cent of the
liquor consumed in bis country is cither manufactured there or imported from places other
than Canada. In other words, only about 2
per cent of the intoxicating heverages that
the American people drink come from this
country. It is estimated by some persons who
bave carefully inquired irito the situation, that
there are annually made in the United States
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

over one thousand million gallons of liquor
for home consumption. The other day I was
reading in a United States paner that in
Chicago tbey manufacture tbeir own beverages
and put Canadian labels on the botties. An
American who thinks lie bias purcbased
Canadian rye whisky, for instance, may in
reality have got noth:ng more than home
brew.
It is my belief that the mal ority of the
people of the United States are opposed to the
Eighteenth Amendment. The Literary Digest
is at present engaged in taking a polI on
prohibition. I understand sucli affairs are
given serious consideration in that country,
because in the last two presidential election
campaigns that publication forecast the results
with a higli degree of accuracy. Up to the
5th of April, I observe, out of 2,000,340 votes
recorded in the present polI. the results were:
for enf orcemýent of the prohibition law, 553,337;
for repeal, 848,751; for modification to permit
the sale of beer and liglit wines, 598,252. The
vote for repeal and for modification being
ndded together, the mai ority against prohibition to date is 893,666. Any honourable member wbo travels across the border can observe
that there is a growing b ody of opinion opposed to the enforcement of the present law.
I have in my hand an eddtorial that appeared
'on Maroi 12, 1030, in the New York Times,
which is recognized as one of the Ieading
newspapers of the world. The writer was
commenting on an extraordinary -vote by the
National Republican Club of New York, which
is the centre of the Republican Party's
activities in that State. A year ago that Club
went on record as favouring the Eighteenth
Amendment, but in Mardi of this year it
voted 461 to 347 in favour of repeal. The
editorial reads in part as follows:
With events at Washington* and evidence
coming from many parts of the country, this
unexpected vote of the National Republican
Club cannot fail to bie beld indicative of a
rising revoit against the extremes to whicb
prohibition lias been pusbed. It is not an issue
made by politiciang. They have been afraid of
it, and still wish to avoid it. Nor is it, as Mr.
Hughes indignanitly termed it in the presidential campaign of 1928, "a sham issue." It
springs from the fundamental convictions of
citizens who have become persuaded that a
terrible mistake was made by the ratification of
the Eighteenth Amendment. The demoralization
and mniseries whichi it has dragged in its trail
have become so conspicuous and repulsive that
an immense resentmnent hias sprung up. In the
presence of sucli a demonstration, parties and
politicians cannot longer bide themselves in the
dark. They must come out into the liglit and
take their stand. As for New York Repulilicans, they must now see that the issue is irrepressible. They will bave to do their best to
meet it, in the knowledge that if they do not,
tbey will be broken by it.

APRIL 2, 1930
The Government of the United States are
aware of the existing situation; they lcnow of
this popular revoit; they are nlot ignorant of
the fact that powerful interests in that country
are opposed to the present prohibition law.
Knowmng that their politicai lives are in the
balance, they are see-sawing on the question
af enforcernent of this law. They are heid
back from enforcernent by the fear of political
influences. And what do they want to do?
What are they doing? They are painting ta
Canada as if Canada were the one source frorn
which liquors were beîng supplied ta the people
af the United States. Our characters are being
blackened by the propaganda carried on in
the United States by the politicians, and the
newspapers supporting certain classes of politicians. We are being represented ail over
this worid as if we supplied 100 per cent af
the liquor consumed in the United States,
and I say that this Goveriment are assisting
those gentlemen by the action they are taking.
The very statement that my honourabie
frîend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made yesterday
supports their contention. Did -my honaurable
friend point out that only two per cent af
the liquor in the United States goes fram
Canada?
No anc will fnd. that ini his
statement, but the uninforncd man, listening
te hie speech, and having rea-d the American
newspapcrs and the speeches af those American politicians, and heard about the iniquities
of Canada and, Canadians, wouid be convinced beyond perad'venture that virtuaily
every galion of the liquor that is consurned
by the 120 millions in the United States is'
produced in Canada, and shipped over by this
arrny ai rum-runners an the ficet of slips as
ta which sa many lurid re'marks are being
mnade. We are the offenders, and that is just
the impression that the United States Govcrnment want, because it shields them. They
are pussyfooting because they know their own
nation is divided, and they know that if they
put the law into force their political lives
would probably end. They pussy-foot, and
they hang us up for world ridicule, and we
vcry mcekly bow aur knees and say, "Oh,
ye, we are the guilty people; we are doing it
ail."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Sa it would
appear if we continued, and did nat pass this
iaw.
Han. Mr. TANNER: This Govcrnment
say: "We are doing it ail. We wili do anything yau ask us ta do." And that is what
the Government are doing. We give the
United States authorîties the twelve-mile limit,
and wc scnd them telephone messages, and
wc offer ta let their officers came aven ta the

97

Canadian side and run the business, but they
say that is not enough. The more they get,
the more thcy want; and they want more in
order that thcy may be able ta say, "Oh,
those Canadians are stili drcnching aur land
with liquor-they are still flooding us with
iiquor-they are the most awful people in the
world." They would have the wonld believe
that there is a perfect Niagara of whiskey
gomng over from Canada, and ail the time the
United States themselvcs are making a thousand million gallons a year, and they are not
doing a thiing abouit it. My honourable friends
smile, but I have been over there. Why do
the United States authorities not stop the
illegal manufacture? Because they are afraid
ta go into the mountains in the South. If
their officers went there they would neyer
corne out; thcy would neyer be heard ai
again. *Consequently .the suppiy neyer stops.
Down South evcry man of those prohibitionists who are ciamouring for this law las hie
gallons ai corn whiskey underground, ripening; yet le is talking prohibition, and chailenging Canada, and putting ail the blame on
Canada for the liquar. I knaw that. I have
been down there and have been told by
people who know the situation. My honaunable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
neyer gets into such campany; he is too good.
That is the situation as I sec it. Those
people are in a haie. They dug the hale
themselves, and jumped- inta it, and, now they
are clamoring for us ta pull them aut. Why
can they not pull themselves out?
I arn
mighty sure that if we 'were in a hale they
would not lift their littie finger ta hei.p us
out. They neyer did, andb they neyer will
unleas they get well paid for it. 0f course
if -theyr get enough in return they will do
anything.
I amn not saying that these are not good
people. I am talking particulariy about the
politicians aven there. I say they are dictating
ta us in the matter. They are nat sending us
writt-en orders, but they are doing it by
constant pres5ure. Wýhen we give them saniething they say, "That is not enough; came
across again;" snd we corne acrass with
sornething more. Then they say: "That is nat
enough; corne across again;" and we orne
across very obediently. It cannot be called
dictation, but it is the constant pressure ai the
big brother who feels his stnength. There arc
120 millions ai them, and they think that we
arc a littie afraid, perhaps, ta rcsist them.
Cansequcntly they are applying pressure.
When we said, "Send your officers aver," they
said, "Oh, that is not enough; you muet cut
out the clcarances." When we out out cleanances, do you think they will be satisficd? Io

there anybody foolish enough to dream that
there will not still be liquor over there and
that they will not still blame us? Why, it
would be only next year when they would
want something else; and of course if my
honourable friend's Government is in power,
there is nothing too good for Washington.
They get whatever they ask. No matter how
much the Canadian spirit is humiliated, no
matter how much the Canadian nation loses,
Washington must be satisfied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the Tory
cry of old.

which would be certain to fall upon Canada
if we did not do a friendly act in this regard.
I do not know that I need spend much time
on that aspect of the matter, because since
the statement was made the peril has exploded. In fact there is no peril; it was
only a figure of speech. No one thinks that
the people of the United States are going
to declare war on this country if this Bill be
not passed. For one thing, there are more
Canadians now in the United States than
there are in Canada. I do not think they
would take up arms against us. If I am right,
there are more people in the United States
opposed to this kind of legislation than in
favour of it; so it would be a very divided
country. I think the dream of the Prime
Minister in that regard need not be considered very seriouslv. It was only a dream.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Did you hear it in 1915?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Alvays.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Just by way of a
climax, let me again quote my right honourable friend opposite as to this mockery of enforcement, out of which all their troubles
arise. A supporter of the Government in another place, when he was opposing this Bill,
characterized it as "humbug, cant, hypocrisV."
My right honourable friend opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) said, "The attempted enforcement of its own laws by the United
States is worse than a joke." That is just what

I am saying. He and I are in agreement. He
further said-and I repeat this: "Dur friends
across the line are more eager to co-operate
when they want something than they are when
we want something."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
human.

That is quite

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not know whether my honourable friend opposite will
combat the statements that I quoted from the
Minister of National Revenue, but I want to
emphasize, in a few words, the point that if
this legislation is enacted it becomes a Canadian law and commits us to a policy of provention of the export of liquor from Canada
into the United States, and, as the Minister
of National Revenue and others have pointed
out, we must stand by that policy. It is of
no use for us to say we will not do it; we
shall be bound to do it-bound to sec that
that law is carried out; and that will involve
us in an unknown expenditure. So the Minister
of National Revenue said, and I submit that
his statement is a sound and correct one.
The Prime Minister, in submitting this Bill,
told Parliament and the country that there
was some great impending international peril,
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Hon. Mr. POPE:

A nightmare.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: If we attend to our
business, and they attend to theirs, as they
have the habit of doing, they can save themselves, and we do not need to go to their
rescue.
I am still in favour of the amendment,
and of further investigation and enquiry into
this measure before it is adopted. I may be
wrong, but I sec in this Bill continued subserviency to the United States Government.
I sec in this simply legislation dictated from
Washington, and when I vote for legislation
in this House I want legislation whose genesis
is in Canada, and which is wholly legisLation
for Canada.
The more we give those people, the more
they want. I admire them as a people, not
speaking particularly of their governrments.
As far as their government administration
goes, they are tbe most relentless, selfish
people in the world; and they are right, for
they are looking after their own country and
doing their duty by their own country. I
wonder whether any honourable member of
this House can remember any time since 1867
when, in negotiations between Canada and
the United States, that country made any
agreement that did not give them far more
than they gave to this country. Such is their
history in regard to us, and I say that it is
sound ground for them to take as a nation.
I wish to Heaven we had governments in
this country that would take the same attitude, that would stand up for Canada, and sec
that Canada got the better bargain, instead
of giving it to the United States.
What are they doing now? Are they taking
our interests into consideration in the tariff
that they are framing? Why, we are not

APRIL 2, 1930
considerecl at, ail; they neyer think of us.
How are we getting aýlong about the diversion
of water by Chicago? We have been talking
about that for fifteen or twenty years. Oh,
they are very polite, but are we getting anywhere? How would it be if we wcre 120
millions and they 9 millions? Would thýey
not have be.en 'down the tree long ago? Talk
about friendly relationships and the comity
of nations! There is no such tbing in the
book over there. We have been frigging
around -about this diversion from the Great
Lakes, and we are not baîf an inch nearer a
solution tban we were when Vbey started te
steal tbe water. Tbey are stealing it today, and will keep on stealing it, and they
will give us polite explanations, but explanatiens will not fill many buckets nor raise tbe
water ievepl mueh. What are they doing in
London to-day in international matters? Tbey
say: "Here w*e are. If you gentlemen can
accommodate yourselves to our position we
will make an agreement witb yeu. But you
have to come up to our terms." If England,
France and Italy ehoose to accept tbe terms
laid down lby the United States there may be
a bargain; if tbey do not, there will be no
bargain. That is all thýere io 'to it. As I say,
I am flot criticizing themn; I am admiring
tbemn for looking after their own interestsfor fighting for, and defending, anid esta'blishing their own interests. But I should like to
see Canada take a leaf out of their bookI should like te see Canada take the wbole
book-and stand up for ber rights. Oh, yes,
we sing "O Canada, we stand on guard for
thee," but most of the time we are down on
our knees, facing that way. If there were less
grovelling and more standing on guard, it
wouid be better for this country. These are
My views, honourable members.
I m-ay be wrong, but I should like a cornmittee to look into ahl these matters. I sbould
like to know wbetber Canada is really the
chief rualefactor; I should like to know
wbetber, as a matter of fact, the United States
could save .themselves, or whether it, is
neceSsary for us to go and save them. I think
we are entitled to, a committee. We have
plenty of time. We do flot need to be in a
hurry. My honourabie friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Danidurand) and bis colleagues bave been
five or six years thinking this over. Can
we flot have a few days? Muist we junip
into the hole right away? Wby can we not
bave a week or two to thin~k the matter over
and inquire into it?
In conclusion, 'may I repeat that my honouraible, friend bas demonstrated that we ought
2425--7j

99

to have a committee, so that we cou-Id call
before us gentlemen like the man sitting in
front of him, to answer questions and clear
up doubts in tihe minds of honourable members of the House.
Hon. N. CURRY: Honourable members,
probably 1 know as much as any other member
of the House about the feeling of the people
of the United States in regard to prohibition.
For fifty ypars I have had extensive dealings
with citizens of the United States, and during
the past thirteen years I have had a winter
residence in Bermuda, whcre a great many
American citizens go. 1 have met and entertained many of thern in my bouse, and in
return have been entertained by themn. As a
consequence I know their feelings pretty well.
These people are among the most reputable
citizens of the United -tates. At a dinner not
long ago, in chaffing somne of themn about not
obeying the laws of tbeir country, I said they
reminded me of an old neighbour of mine
in Nova Scotia who came to my bouse one
afternoon. Before he %vent away 1 asked him
if he would have a glass of whiskey with me.
He had a voice that you could hear a mile,
and he said: "I belong to the Good Templars
and to the Sons of Temperance, but I neyer
refuse anything good to drink." So he had a
big "snifter." When 1 told thema about this
man these people said: "You cannot affront.
us by saying that. The shoe fits, and we put
it on. We in the United States feel somewhat
as you do about prohibition, and we are going
to fight it until it is killed."
This was true of the ladies as well as the
gentlemen. One lady said that before prohibition came into force she neyer thought
anything about liquor, but that as soon as the
order went out, "You cannot do this," or "You
cannot have that," she started in to make wine
froma currants and gooseberries and cherries.
She even went so far as to make P'ynthetic gin.
These people also referred to the Union
League Club, which was referred to by the
honourable member wbu h as just taken hi3i
seat (Hon. Mr. Tanner). That Club, as
probably most honourable members know, was
formed during the American Civil War for
the purpose of keeping the Union entire, and
it has been regarded ever sinoe, I thînk, as an
institution that has done more than any other
to mould public opinion and kepp legislation
in the proper channels. That Club by a very
large majority bas expressed itself as opposed
to prohibition, and wishes to have the Eighteenth Amendment either repealed or declared
a dead letter.
The honourable member who has juat taken
his seat (Hon. Mr. Tanner) spoke also of the
percentage of liquor that goes into the United

SENATE
States from Canada. His figures, I think,
are as accurate as any that can be secured.
Now, if Canada withholds lier two per cent
of the liquor that goes to the United States
it will not make a particle of difference in the
quantity consumed there. The man who is
drinking liquor to-day will not miss one glass
in a year, because the other nations and the
moonshiners will readily make up the deficit
and supply a great deal more. So the question all boils down to the moral aspect of the
case, and if we do not prevent the people of
the United States from drinking as much liquor
as usual, what shall we be accomplishing?
The average man in the United States to-day
thinks no more of having his own bootlegger
than lie does of having his own doctor. When
lie wants something to drink, all lie has to do
is to telephone his bootlegger, who will deliver
anything lie wants to his house. The passage
of this Bill will mean simply that the Government of Canada will lose about $10,000,000 in
revenue, and that the distilleries and brewcries in this country will lose a similar amount.
In other words, we are giving up about
$20,000,000 a year for absolutely nothing. The
change in the moral standard would be infinitesimal; it would be as a fly compared to
an ox.
At the present time a number of very prominent legal lights in the United States are
studying the legality of the Eighteenth Amendment with a view to having it declared illegal.
The Tenth Amendment, which was passed
many years ago, was to give greater liberty
to the subject. The Eighteenth Amendment
takes away that liberty, and there is a very
strong feeling that in the very near future it
will be declared illegal.
Therefore, considering the remarks that have
been made, and the evidence that has been
submitted, I feel justified in stating that I
cannot and will not vote for this Bill.
Hon. JOHN LEWIS: Honourable members,

I am of the opinion that this Bill might be
selected as an example of the type of Bill
which ought not to go to a committee. I am
rather confirmed in that view by the speech
of the honourable member from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner), who instanced the action taken
in regard to the Pensions Bill. The Pensions
Bill is not only unlike this Bill; it is its
exact opposite. It is the kind of Bill that
ought to go to a committee. The reason is
this. Everyone in this House and the other
House agreed that something should be done
to amend the Pensions Act and to make
it more liberal, but there was disagreement
as to the method. Therefore the Bill, very
properly, was sent to a committee in order that
Hon. Mr. CURRY.

what was desired might be accomplished. Here
we have exactly the reverse. We have a Bill
as to the principle of which we disagree. The
speeches that have been made from the other
side of the House have been directed against
the principle of the Bill, not against its details or towards providing that more care
shouid be taken in its f.raming. This is a Bill
of the simplest character, covering but one
page and consisting of about three hundred
words, which could be read in two minutes;
and neither the mover nor the seconder of the
amendment, nor the honourable member who
last spoke, has suggested that there is anything
obscure in the Bill or that tbere is any
necessity to send it to a committee to lie
remoulded.
The honourable member for Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) gave what appeared to be one
plausible reason for the appointment of a
committee, when lie said that there was an
official of the Civil Service sitting on the
floor of this Chamber and giving certain information to the honourable leader of the
Government here (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). But
the information lie is giving is not with
regard to how far the Bill would,be workable
and how it could be most effectively carried
out, but as to what occurred in the past-a
matter of history which, however interesting
it may be, has nothing whatever to do with
the Bill now before the House. I do not care
what has happened in the last four or five
years. Things may have been done which

should not have been done, and perhaps mistakes have been made, but all that is irrelevant.
It is said that a special committee could discover what loss of revenue would result if the
Bill were put into effect. That could be discovered in five minutes if this Bill were sent
on for consideration by this House in committee.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Why does not the honourable gentleman give us the information
now?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I am not bound to
give that information at the present time.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The honourable gentleman knows what the information is. Why does
lie not give it to the House now?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I do not say that I am
able to give the information; I say it could
be ascertained in a few minutes by any honourable member who wanted to get it.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I think the honourable
gentleman is in the same boat as the rest of
us. We do not know what the facts are.

SENATE
going to call large numbers of witnesses before a special committee in an effort to dotermine whether or not the Government is subservient to the United States? Is it nocessary to have witnesses examined upon stale
political cries of which, I think, everybody
ought to be tired by this time?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: The honourable member for Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) made some
allegation of an attempt to choke discussion,
which I thought was rather an unfair comment
on his part, in view of the fact that he had
been allowed to speak for about two hours
without interruption. But honourable gentlemen who are in favour of the Bill, instead of
trying to prevent discussion, are rather supporting a wider discussion, because instead of
relegating the whole question to a small committee where a lot of outsiders could air their
opinions, we are trying to confine the debate
te this Chamber, where every honourable
member could be heard. In this way every
member of the Senate would be kept informed of the situation, and I think this
would be preferable to sending the Bill into a
sort of lethal chamber.
I put my support of this Bill upon one
simple ground, and that is the maintenance of
the self-respect of Canada. The honourable
gentleman froin Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
made reference to what he called our subserviency to the United States, but I do not
know of anything more humiliating to this
country than that it should continue to feed
the business of bootlegging. It is immaterial
to me whether the proportion of Canadian
liquor consumed in the United States is only
2 per cent of the whole. I think as a matter
of fact the proportion is small. I must say,
by the way, that although J read American
papers very closely, I have never seen any
suggestion there that the bulk of the liquor
used in the United States came from this
country; nor have I ever heard of any
offensive or threatening remarks towards us
on the part of the United States. I have read
a great deal of criticism passed by Americans
of their prohibition law, but that criticism
is directed against their own Covernment and
institutions, and their own lawbreakers. It
may be that in some isolated case a newspaper
over there has gone beyond this in criticizing
us, or that some congressman or senator has
made unflattering remarks about us, but so
far as my observation goes, their attitude
towards Canada has been the reverse of
threatening-it has been exceedingly friendly.
Hou.

Mr. LEWIS.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Has the honourable gentleman read the remarks of an American college professer to the effect that they
ought always to use the big stick with Canada?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Well, that is one of the
isolated cases to which I referred. The Literary Digest reviews public opinion as expressed through the press all over the country,
and I must say that the general tenor of their
remarks concerning Canada has been extremely
friendly, as it ought to be. I agree that we
have donc nothing that we need be ashamed
of, and what we are doing now I regard net
as an act of subserviency, but simply one of
self-respect, an attempt to wash our hands of
an undesirable business, so that no longer
may there be any bliame attachable to us for
giving a sort of legal sanction te an illegal
trade. What our neighbours may do after
that is none of our business. Whether or net
they enforce their law, or whether the expert
from Canada is a very small proportion of
their consumption or net, is a matter of no
concern to us. Once we have eut ourselves
off from giving an appearance of legality to
what is a wholly illegitimate business, I think
that our duty will be done.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
members, time will not permit of any long
discussion, but I have a few observations I
should like te make in faveur of referring
this Bill to a committee, on grounds that seoni
apart from anything I have heard voiced here
as yet. My arguments arise out of the fact
that after this Bill was discussed in another
House, within the last few weeks, on its
second reading, it was intimated by the Government that they thought favourably of
suggestions that had been made, and that on
March 22 negotiations were opened with the
United States Government, through its Canadian Legation, for the purpose of working out
an amendment to the existing treaty. In
my humble opinion, if we are going to negotiate a treaty with our neighbour successfully,
it must be on a reciprocal basis, and if ho is
asking us for anything, we have a right to
ask him for certain things. So I believe it
would be the part of wisdom to refer this
Bill to a special committee, giving that committee certain directions as to what duties it
was expected te perform, and giving it a
little time te get the necesary information
and complote its work. If the negotiations
were speeded uip meanwhile, as perhaps they
ought to be, in view of the seriousness of this
subject in the estimation of the Prime Minizter
of Canada, an amendment to the treaty that
would probably be satisfactory te both courn-

APRIL 2, 1930
tries might very wed'l be negotiated before this
session of Parliament is over. The result
would be that this Senate, by having wisely
taken the action suggested in the amendment

now before us, would have rendered useful service to Canada and its peop'le.
Time does not permit one to go into the

details of this to-night, and I beg leave to
move the adjournment of the debate for today, but I give honourable gentlemen this
brief outline of the reasons that I intend to
advance in support of the amendment to refer
this question to a special committee in order
to obtain certain information.
One thing I should personally like to know
is, what evidence there is, if any, of any
serious calls from the United States for this
legislation. On looking at the records we sec
that the exportation of intoxicating liquor in
1929 was less than in 1928, and that in 1928 it
was less than in 1927. What is the crying need
that has suddenly sprung up for this action on
Canada's part? Then I should like to knowand it is only from experts, such as officials of
the Departments of Justice and of National
Revenue, that we can get this informationis it truc, or is it not, that Canada will be
definitely committed to the enforcement of
the law, and be responsible for its enforcement
and for all the expenses thereby entailed,
which the United States under present conditions must bear if it is going to keep liquor
out.
Several other points, perhaps, quite as relevant, will come up in the course of our discussion. It seens to me there is no justification for dealing now with a matter that
has been before Parliament since 1924. In
1925 and 1926 treaties were negotiated. In

1926 the Customs Inquiry Committee and the

Royal Commission followed. Recommendations were made by the Committee and by
the Royal Commission appointed by the
present Government; and if the recommendations of both these bodies had been carried

out they would have rendered this proposed

legislation unnecessary to-day.
Years have gone by since that time, and
now, by reason of the present discussion, the
Government have set out to negotiate certain
amendments to the treaty. Let us not, as the
Senate of Canada, put an obstacle in the way
of the Government's success in negotiating a
treaty that will be beneficial to the Canadian
people.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, the debate was adjourned.

PATENT BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 14, an Act to amend the Patent
Act.
He said: In moving the third reading of
this Bill I desire to place on Hansard the
answer that I had promised to the Hon. exMinister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
when we were in Committee on the Bill:
There are no reciprocal rights concerning the
grant of patents between different countries.
It is not known that any country refuses to
grant patents to citizens of Canada. A Canadian citizen may obtain a patent in any country
on compliance with the laws of that country.
(The refusal by a foreign country to grant a
patent to a Canadian citizen could not affect
his right to make an article in Canada for use
as part of a machine constructed in Canada.)
Canadian citizens are not refused patents by
Germany on the ground that they are Canadian
citizens.

Canada 'does not grant more privileges to

citizens of other countries than are granted to
citizens of Canada in any other country.
Moreover, under the terms of the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, of which Canada and some fifty
other countries are members, Article 2 provides
that:
"Persons within the jurisdiction of each of
the contracting countries shall, as regards the
protection of industrial property, enjoy in all
the other countries of the Union the advantages
that their respective laws now grant, or may
hereafter grant, to their nationals, without
prejudice to the rights specially provided by
Consequently they
the present Convention.
shall have the same protection as the latter,
remedy against any inand the same legal
fringement of their right, provided they
observe the conditions and formalities imposed
on nationals."
Germany being also a member of the Union,
it follows that a Canadian citizen who obtains
a patent in Germany is given the same legal
remedy to protect his patent rights in that
country as is given to citizens of Germany, and
the same is truc of all countries of the Union.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

EXPORT BILL (INTOXICATING LIQUOR)
SEOIND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend the
Export Act, and the amendment thereto.
Hon. GIDEON D. ROBERTSON- HIonourable members, during the closing moments
of yesterday's session 1 outlined briefly the
line of thought that I wished to present to
this flouse for consideration, particularly in
support of the amendment moved by the honourable leader on this side of the flouse. 1
do not intend to go into any great detail in
discussing: the Bill itself, except to conneet it
up with the thoughts I have in mind.
Bill 15 is an Act to amend the Export Act,
and the proposed amendment that it be referred to and eonsidered by a spe-cial committee of this flouse before being en-acted into law
is, I think, quite relevant and proper. Several
questions have arisen in this House wîthin the
hast forty-eight hours which indicate quite
clearly the desirability of pursuing such a
course. It has developed that the honourable
gentleman who leads this House so efficiently
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is not himself in possession of important information that the
House desired, and it bas been necessary for
him to obtain the assistance of an official of
the Department of National Revenue. I
think it is highly desirable that not only the
gentleman who was here yesterday, and who
bas an extensive knowledge of operations
under the Customs Act and of the excise
duties, but other officials, fromn the Department of National Revenue and the Department of Justice, shouhd be available to a committee in order that they may discuss these
matters freely. They cannot do so in the
flouse, where they have no rîght to raise
their voices, but can only answer in a whisper
the queries of the Minister. Entirely apart
from that, there are other reasons why I support the proposaI to appoint a committee.
Please be assured at the outset that I am
not intending in any way to oppose the Bill
itself. So far, at least, I do not intend to
oppose it; but I do think that there are considerations which ought to be seriously studied
before any action is taken.
The object of this Bill, whioh has come
from thé flouse of Commons, is to amend the
Export Act, chapter 63 of the Revised Statutes, 1927. To my mi, the provisions of
that Act have considersble bearing upon what
would happen if Bill 15 were adopted. Chapter
63 provides that export duties may be imposed by proclamation; that is, by proclamation of the Government, without a revision

105

of the tariff by Act of Parliament. Section 3
of the Export Act provides that on certain
articles-on nickel contained in matte, on
ores which contain copper, on lead ores, and
on lead and silver ores--the Governor in
Council may by proclamation published in
the Canada Gazette impose, remove and
reimpose certain export duties. The Governor
in Council may also authorize the export of
deer killed in this country. Section 4 of the
Act reads:
The export duties provided for by this Act
shall be chargeable after the publication of the
proclamation by which they are declared
ehargeable or imposed.
Now, by Bill 15, which will become a section of the Export Act, if passed, it is proposed to add to the articles on which the
Goverament may by Order in Council and
proclamation impose or remove export duties,
and I think it is important that men who
have had more experience than I in the understanding of the law and how it operates should
give some attention to what effeet this will
have. It miglit be that the Goverament of
the day-probably not this Governmentwould then have power to impose an additional
export, duty, or to remove the duty, without
consulting Parliament or any person interested.
That, to my mmnd, raises another question.
We see in the return issued by the Department of National Revenue each month a
sumnmary of the revenues collected, under the
heads of customs duties, excise duties, and
excise taxes. That raises the question, under
which of these headings is the revenue to be
classed that now flows to the Government
from the export of liquor from Canada, which
is referred to in Bill 15. I think it is true
that under the regulations now existing, which
regulations, I believe, were enacted by the
Government without the authority of Parliament, that not being. neeessary, $9 a gallon
of duty or tax is payable before liquor can
be relcased for export. If by any chance it
were possible to class that revenue as a duty
and not a tax, it would open up great possibilities. There, I think, is a point that merits
careful consideration by the flouse or by a
special commibtee. With millions of gallons
of intoxicating liquor in Government stores,
upon which the present regulations require
the payment of that large tax or duty, whichever it may be legally termed, the raising of
that tax or duty for a litthe while miglit have
far-reaching and important consequences. I
.just mention that in passing, because it occurs
to me that such action might be taken without
the consent or knowledge of Parliament.

SENATE

106

Now, honourable gentlemen, reverting to
the Bill itself and to the antecedent legislation
and treaties that have a bearing upon it, one
is impressed wiýth several rather outstanding
facts that may or may not relate directly to
the Government's policy and intention in
bringing in this Bill. It is certain, and it has
been amply demonstrated, that the exportation of liquor to the United States, where its
importation is unlawful, bas occupied and
excitcd the public mind of this country for
several years; and when one reviews briefly,
as I hope to do without wearying you, the
progress that has been made in the attempt
to stop the flow of that illegal traffic during
the past six years, one is rather skeptical that
the utmost effort bas been put forward by the
Government.
In 1923, which is the first year for which
I have a record of this matter, the exportation of liquor from Canada to the United
States was not excessive, amounting to 28,506
gallons for the entire year. However, the
authorities in the United States seemed to feel
that that was too much. The quantity corning in from Canada was snall as compared
with the quantity coming in illegally, or at
least irregularly, frons other places. The
United States, properly, I think, turned their
attention first to the stemming of the tide of
importations from those other sources. In
1924 they negotiated with Great Britain a
treaty to regulate the traffic and reduce the
flow of illicit liquor into their country. Canada ratified that treaty in the 1924 session of
Parliament-on March 21 of that year, I
think. The flow of liquor from Canada was
apparently not seriously retarded by it, for the
United States in the same year negotiated
with us for a treaty for the suppression of
smuggling between the two countries, and
such a treaty was made that year by the
Minister of Justice on behalf of the Dominion
and by the proper American authorities. One
would suppose that after the treaty with the
British Government and that with our Government, in particular, the United States
would find theiselves posessed of sufficient
safeguards to inable them to enforce the
Fightecnth Amendment.
Concurrently with the signing of these two
treaties the export of liquor from Canada to
the United States was increasing. The quantity exported rose from 28,000 gallons in 1923
to 244.000 gallons in 1924. It is truc that the
treaty with Canada was not concluded until
June 4 of that year and was not ratified by
the Canadian Parliament until June of 1925.
There may be some force in the contention
that its effect would not be felt until perhaps
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

the end of 1925. I have already retnarked
that the exportation in 1924 amounted to
244,000 gallons. In the year 1925, the year in
which the treaty was ratified by the Parliament of Canada, the exportation of liquor
increased to 415,000 gallons.
By this time it had become quite apparent
that the American treaties with Great Britain
and Canada were not having the expected result of suppressing smuggling, and public
opinion became aroused to such a degree that
there were reverberations in another place,
and a parliamentary inquiry into the situation
was instituted. I well remember the very
considerable discussion that followed the
presentation of the report of the special committee, which was composed of members of
the three political parties in the other Chamber. Only one memsber of that large committee dissented from the report. It had considerable influence in another place and on
honourable members of the Senate. At that
time the Government promised a tightening
of the Customos regulations, and I am sure
the hope was entertained generally throughout the country that a real reduction would
be effected in the quantity of illegal liquor
shipped from Canada into the neighbouring
country; but the fact is that from the figure
of 1925, which, as honourable members will
recall, was 415,000 gallons, the exportation
rose in 1926 to 794,000 gallons.
In 1926 there was an election, and in addition to promises which the Government made
to Parliament, they pledged themselves to
the people that if they returned to power
they would sec that the recommendations of
the special parliamentary committee were
enforced. The Government were returned and
they were charged by the people with the
responsibility of honouring their pledge, and
I am sure that throughout the country it was
hoped that there would be a substantial
lessening of liquor exports from that time
on. By 1927 the Government made a further
show of seriousness in this matter by appointing a Royal Commission to examine into the
whole question again. The parliamentary committee had confined its sittings to Ottawa and
its work to the taking of evidence from persons who were thought te be able to give
information. The conmittee's report did not
seens entirely sa.tisfactory to the Government of the day; so a Royal Commission
were sent out to rove over the whole country.
I think they sat in every province and probably every city from Halifax to Vancouver,
both included. They concurred in the recom-

APRIL 3, 1930
mendations of the parliamentary committee,
as stated in tbe following extract from tbeir
report:
We also express our entire concurrence in
the recomniendation of the special commrittee
,of the House of Commons as contained in paragraph 10 of that committee's report. An
effective maethod of carrying out the intent of

the treaty referred to would be to prohibit
clearances to vessels or vehicles of ahl kinds
carrying a cargo of liquor to the United
States, contrary te the laws of that country.
That was in 1927. After that it was thought
there would surely be a distinct falling off
in tbe exports of alcoholic beverages to the
States; but we flnd that the volume in 1927
amounted to 1,163,000 gallons, in spite of the
existing treaties and of the reports of the

parliamentary committee and the Royal Commission.
In the following year nothing was done
axcept to, exchange correspondence between the
Canadian Legation or the British Embassy in
Washington-I do not think our Legation was
in existence the wholc of that year-and certa-in American authorities. That correspýondence
is famuhiar to any honourable members who
bave rcad the documents that were presented
in another place. In 1928 there happened to be
a decrease in the volume of experts, but in
1929, as a result of the correspondence to
which I have referred, a meeting was held at
Ottawa between representatives of the two
Governments for the purpose of diseussing
ways and means for tigbtening up'the treaty
se that it would be mutually satisfactory.
There was submitted to that conference at
Ottawa a certain proposaI, which the United
States authorities considered would meet witb
their requirements, but to which the Canadian Government apparently were net wililing
te agree at tbat time. I shahl read but one
paragrapb of the proposai as submitted by
Secretary Kellogg. H1e suggested the insertion

oif the following words as an amendment to the
treaty:
The high contracting parties agree that clearances of shipments of merchandise by water,
air or land froni any of the ports of either
country to a port of entrance of the other
country shall be denied if such shipment comprises articles the introduction of which is
probibited or restricted for whatever cause in
the country to which such shipment is destined,
provided, however, that such clearance shahl
net be denied on shipmaents of restrictive
mierchandise when there bas been complete
compliance with the conditions of the law of
both countries.
After several days the cenference came te
an end witheut reaching any agreement. So

f ar as the public know, there were no further
negotiations. According to the records, there
was a further decrease of liquor experts in

107

1929. About the lst of October of last year,
accord-inýg to information given to this Chamber by the honourable gentleman who leads
the Government here (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
the Prime Minister announced througb the
press that effective steps would be taken to
suppress this so-called evil, and special legislation would be introduced at the present
session of Parliament. The form this proposcd
legislation takes is Bill 15, which goes farther
than Secretary Kellogg's proposai in the matter
of meeting the desires of the United States
authorities.
One cannot help wondering why this question suddenly became so important in October
of last year, and why there has been such
an acceleration of activities as is evidenced
in the speeches made by the leaders of the
Goverument in both flouses. The right
honourablc the Prime Minister bas clearly
indicated his unwillingness to continue the
administration of the Department of External
Affairs if this legislation is not passed, and
the honourable gentleman who leads the Government in this House has been similarly
strong in bis advocacy of the Bill.
When looking at the figures of the export
shipments I became curious as to the extent
to which this country and the Government
of this country have been instrumental in
debaucbing the people of the United States.
In tbe year 1929 we exported to the neighbouring country 1,126,000 gallons of liquor. As
1 have had to do a -little accounting in connection with railway business>-and railway
companies have a reputation for demanding
accuracy in these things-I d'ecided to comnpute the quantity of liquor that our exports
would average for each penson in the United
States, and 1 found tbat if there were an equal
distribution of our 1929 experts, it would
amount to sligbtly less than one-thirteenth of
a pint for each American citizen. That is the
serious business that bas caused the Prime
Minister to contemplate wîthdrawing from the
responsibilities of bis exalted office. I wonder
whether our people wbo have considered the
question at ail 'believe that the supplying
of an average of one-thirteenth of a pint of
liquor annually to the people of the United
States is siich a serious question as the Prime
Minister would have us believe.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is not the
question. Whether we are sbipping one gallon
or a hundred thousand gallons, the principle
remains the sanie. The question we are asked
to decide is whetber the Government, who
represent the Canadian people, should act as
a go-between-as a link between the distiller
and the rum-runners. The quantity of liquor
involved is immaterial.

108

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am quite in
accord with what my honourable friend says,
and I think he will appreciate this as I go
along. The question before the House at the
moment is: Shall Bill 15 be referred to a
special committee for examination and consideration of what the effect would be if it
were to become law? The Governmnnt insist
that the Bill should be passed through without
inquiry, and there is some objection to that in
this Chaimber.
On March 22 the Government, for some
reason best known to themselves, opened
negotiations with the United States Government through the American Legation at
Ottawa for an amendment of the treaty of
1924, which treaty was asked for by our
neighbours and was made to please them.
The proposal that Secretary Kellogg submitted
to the conference at Ottawa, to which I have
already referred, was that the two countries
should be equally responsible for prohibiting
the transportation from one country to the
other of contraband goods, whether liquor,
tobacco, drugs or other such things, and this
should be agreed to by treaty. I hold that
both Governments will be in a far better
position to negotiate a fair and reasonable
treaty concerning these goods if this Bill is
not given the Royal Assent until we are at
least near the end of this session of Parliament,
because thon our Governmcnt would net be
embarrassed by the passing of this legislation.
I agree with my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that there is a principle before us
for consideration, but I hold that this principle
bas already been endorsed by the existing
treaty, which pledges the Governments of this
country and of the United States to endeavour
to suppress smuggling.
The Department of National Revenue publishes each month a pamphlet showing the
duties collected, the value of the trade, the
various expenses, and so on, for the month.
I hold in my hand the Department's bulletin
for March. On page Il appears a photograph
of containers of alcohol, 80 gallons altogether,
confiscated by the Canadian preventive officers
at Heminingford, Quebec, I think. The picture
shows the automobile and the sixteen cans,
each containing five gallons. The preventive
officers happened to see a fellow smuggling
into Canada those eighty gallons of alcohol
manufactured in the United States. If both
countries now agree that the existing treaties
are not working satisfactorily, and now propose to remedy the situation, would it not
be fair to provide that clearances shall net
be granted for the export into Canada of
alcohol manufactured in the United States?
Should not the Government of Canada be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

quite as interested and enthusiastic in having
the United States agree to impose restrictions
on shipments into this country as they are in
trying to prevent even a drop from going out?
The more one inquires into this question the
more one appreciates the necessity for deliberate action. Why should we want to rush
through a Bill that is enýtirely one-sided and
that will take away from Canada millions of
dollars of revenue and throw out of employment many hundreds, maybe thousands, of
workers? One million gallons for one hundred
and twenty millions of people, or onethirteenth of one ipint per person per year, is
Canada's contribution towards this great debauchery of our friendly neighbours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman forgets the principle.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am more than
ever fixed in the belief that there ought to be
a special committee appointed te deal with
this subject, and that it should be given time
te sit down and carefully survey the whole
situation.
Now, honourable members, I want to go a
step further and refer to a few things that I
think ougbt to be considered by the Government in negotiating the amendments to
this treaty. Here is an opportunity that has
not corne te Canada since 1924, te negotiate a
treaty with our neighbour that will be satisfactory to, both and will operate fairýly between them. Surely the parliamentary inquiry of 1926 demonstrated very clearly to the
people of Canada, net only that improprieties
were going on in the handling of liquor, but
that large quantities of silks and other dutiable
articles were being smuggled into Canada,
with the result that the loss of revenue to
Canada was serious indeed. Parliament in its
wisdom at that time appointed a large committec, which made an exhaustive inquiry,
lasting over several weeks; but as it was impossible to survey the whole field, a Royal
Commission was appointed. They both did
v ery good work, and I may say without hesitatien that the gentleman who acted for the
Commission did his work diligently and sincerely. The recommendations of that body
indicate that the Commission concurred in the
recommendations of the parliamentary committee. What did the commissioners find, and
what did they, directly or by implication, recommend? They recommended a ceonsiderable number of things that are not dealt with
in the treaty, the ratification of whilch was
prior te the making of their recommendations.
Now that the two Governments are negotiating to amend the treaty of 1924, it must
surely be in order to suggest that certain

__7
APRIL 3, 1930
things 8hould be con&ide.red in their negotiatiens. Liquor is flot by any means the only
thing to be considered. 1 do flot suppose
many honourable me-mbers ýhad the time, or
took the time, to peruse the 42,000 pages of
evidence taken before the Cuetoms Coinmittee in 1M, 'but there is a record that will
prove to the satisfaction of any fair-minded
man that there are other articles of merchandise passing 'back and forth acrose tihe
international boundary in violation of the
treaty, and that they should receive some
consideration.
I should like to mention brie-fiy just two or
three. The-re i~sone item that I amn particularly interested in, drom -the standpoint, flot
of personal profit, but of my interest in the
working people of the Dominion of Canada.
It is true, as honourable gentlemen who sat
on the Pomamittee of inquiry in 1M2 know,
that h'undreds of thousands of 'dollars' worth
of merchandise mnade ini the United States by
prison labour came into Canada and was sold
in the open -market to Canadian purchasers
in competition with the produets of Canadian workmen. I say to the Gove-rnment and
to the Hlouse that that is a matter that ought
to receive the attention and consideration of
the Government idfthey have any thought of,
or sympathy for, t'he hundred thousand workmen in Canada who are to-day out of employment. Now that the United States want
soiething from Canada, is it not opportune
that we ehould say to thein: "If we are ta
grant -the favour that you are asking in connection with some of theee things that are
troubling you, the .least you can do ia to give
us something in return, and one thing you can
do is to dispose 0f your prison made goods in
you.r own country"?
As honourable gentlemen may be aware,
nearly every state in the country to the south
of us has certain laws prohibiting making over
oId mattresses and that sort of thing, putting
new cases on themi and reselling them.* If
honourable gentlemen could follow the buis
of lading and the way bills they would find
that carloads of that sort of stuif, which cannot be sold to the people of the United States,
are being shipped here and sold ta -your
family and ta mine. Who knows but that
you may to-night be sleeping on a mattrees
on the stuffing of which some smallpox patient
may havedied? These are things that demand
and deserve the attention of governments
when they are negotiating on treaties concerning matters of vital importance ta their
people.
May 1 refer ta, another matter? Honourable
gentlemen will recail a long drawn out discus-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, and vice

and suppressed. The newspapers told us only
the week before last that the President of
the United States was about to designate highways along the international border over which
international traffic might legally flow. Io
not that a question of interest ta Canada?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The

Hon. Mr. ROBEiRTSON: Those are, I hold,
some of the things that ought ta be discuesed
and consideredj I think that this Houise might
very well either postpone the final consideraton of thbe legialation till a later date in the
session, or, better stild, appoint a special eommittee that couki. examine, among other things,
whîle Parliament is still in session, the details
of the few matters I have mentioned.
The debate to-day is upon the amendment
of the honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), and I have
tried ta advance some reasons why I regard
as important, not so much the Bill itself as its
connection with the Export Act and the
possible effeet an the administration of that
Act of adding te it., wibhout due thought, the
provisions of this Bill. I do think the Government would not have introduced this legislation if the treaty negotiations upon which, the
Government have set out had heen coinmenced before Parliament met. Therefore, it
seems ta me that it would be wise for this
House, and for my honourable friend leading
this House-a gentleman for whom I have
the greatest respect-to agree ta the appointment of a special cammittee, or in any event
ta a postponement of the final decision on the
Bill until further progress has been made with
the treaty negotiations, which, perhaps, may
be concluded before Parliament prorogues.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable members,
the honourable gentleman who lias just taken
his seat lias Riven some figures as ta the
quantity of intoxicating liquor exported
during the past three or four years. I do not
know where hie secured his figures, but I have
obtained from the Commissioner of Excise-

SENATE

110

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The figures were
all taken from the address of my honourable
friend the leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) as recorded in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I was going to say
that I have obtained figures which are to
this effect: the auantity of domestic liquor
entered for consumption and exported in
bond, respectively, during the past three
yearsHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

In bond?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Where to?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

All countries?

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I will give the figures.
In 1927-28 the consumption was 1,896,357
proof gallons. The quantity exported in bond
was 579,420 proof gallons. In 19 28-29 the'
consumption was 2,016,802 gallons, and the
quantity exported in bond, 1,143,176 gallons.
In 1929-30 the consumptionHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
domestic consumption?

ras
sumption. The 1929-30 consumption
1,814,351 gallons in eleven months, and the
quantity exported in bond, 1,421,687 gallons.
Of the 3,144,000 proof gallons of liquor exported in bond, it is estimated that 75 per
cent, or 235,800 proof gaillons, were exported
to Kingston (Jamaica), Nassau (Bahamas),
and the Islands of St. Pierre-Miquelon. These
figures would tend to show that the quantity
exported to the United States during those
three years was not very large.
The honourable member for Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) is supporting the amendment,
which asks that this Bill be referred to a
committee, on the ground, as I understood
him, that the committee should inquire into
these things. Yesterday the honourable gentleman made these remarks:
In my humble opinion, if we are going to
negotiate a treaty with our neighbour successfully, it must be on a reciprocal basis, and if he
is asking us for anything, we have a right to
ask him for certain things. So I believe it
would be the part of wisdom to refer this Bill
to a special committee, giving that committee
certain directions as to what duties it was
expected to perform, and giving it a little time
to get the necessary information and complete
its work.
The honourable gentleman did not state,
and I should have been interested to learn,
what duties would be assigned to the committee.
Judging from his general remarks,
it would be duties having regard to the
changes that should be made in the existing
treaties.
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I thought I
stressed that point at the beginning of my
remarks bv indicating the necessity and desirability of having a clear interpretation and
understanding of what effect the passing of
Bill 15 would have upon the Export Act,
chapter 63 of the Revised Statutes. That is
a thing which such an able gentleman as
my honourable friend might very well make
clear before a committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The meaning of the
treaty?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And the interpretation of chapter 63, to which this Bill is
an anendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am sure the Bill in

clearances or the making of entries for goods
of a certain type for expert to any country
where liauor is prohibited. That is clear. We
need not send the Bill to a committee for
the purpose of ascertaining its meaning.
I hesitate to
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
interrupt my honourable friend, but I should
like him to be clear on that. Bill 15 is a
proposal to add certain provisions to section
7 of chapter 63 of the Revised Statutes.
Chapter 63 permits the Government, by Order
in Council and proclamation, to impose or
withdraw export duties upon the articles
named in the Export Act. This Bill would
bring liquor into the same category. That is
what I had in mind.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The Bill before us is
clear. It is merely amending the Act mentioned by the honourable gentleman to this
extent:
8. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any
other statute or law or of any regulation made
thereunder or of any bond, agreement or other
instrument relating thereto
(a) no intoxicating liquor now or hereafter
held in bond or otherwise under the control of
officials of the Dominion Government under the
provisions of the Excise Act, the Customs Act
or any other Statuîte of Canada, shall be
released or removed from any bonding warebouse, distillery, brewery or other building or
place. in which such liquor is stored in any case
in which the liquor proposed to be removed is
destined for delivery in any country into which

the importation of such liquor is prohibited by
law;

(b) it shall be unlawful to grant a clearance
to any vessel having on board any intoxicating
liquor destined for delivery in any country into
which the importation of such liquor is prohibited by law;
(c) it shall be unlawful to make any entry
for

exportation

of

any

intoxicating

liquor,

destined for delivery in any country into which
the exportation of such liquor is prohibited by
law.

APRIL 3, 1930
I have neyer seen a fairer Bill than this,
and it is confined to a single subi ect, the
authorization of Government officiais to refuse
to release liquor from bond and refuse to
grant clearances Vo vessels witb liquor cargoes
in cases where such liquor would be consigned
to a country into which the importation is
prohibited by its own laws.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: WilI the honourable gentleman permit me to ask him a
question?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Does my honourab]e friend agree that if Bill 15 is paased,
chapter 63 of tbe Revised Statutes, the
Export Act, will be made to include anotber
article, namely liquor, and that the Governof
in Council will then bc empowered to place
an export duty upon liquor, at will, or Vo
remove at will any existing duty, without con3ulting Parliament?
Hon. Mr. BRIQUE: That refers to a point
'bat is foreign to the Bill and would be matter
for another amendment. I amn dealing witb
the position taken by my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Robertson). He is supporting the
amendment to refer the Bill to a special committee, and I amn trying to findi out the reason
for bis attitude. If the Bill were referred to
a special committee, wbat could tbat committee do except, as the honourable gentleman suggests-at least, as I understand himto inquire into tbe changes wbich would result
in the existing treaties between Canada and
the United States. I understand that was the
ground upon whicb the honourable gentleman
supported the amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Yes, largely
upon that ground.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Then I should like to
ask the bonourable gentleman a question.
Does hie consider that the making or amendment of treaties is a matter that can be
initiated by Parliament? Does the initiative
not rest entirely with the Government? Can
either House of Parliament deal with such
matters except upon a Government BiH-? The
honourable gentleman has had a long experience in parliamentary affairs, and, I arn sure hie
will not assert that Parliament bas any such
initiative power. Therefore, I submit, in eo
far as the treaties are concerned, a special
comrnittee would be powerless.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Surely we might
state certain limits beyond whieh. the Government could flot go in negotiating a treaty.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: You could not du that
in dealing with this Bill. As I have said, Par-

liament has no initiative in respect to treaties
and can deal with themn only Vhrough a
Government Bill. Tbat is the point I am
making.
While listening to the honourable gentleman
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and some
other honourable gentlemen, yesterday, it
occurred to me that tbey were forgetting that
several provinces have had a formn of prohibition until recently. Ontario dLid not do
away with prohibition until June 1, 1927.
Quebec has had the Liquor ýControl Act since
February 25, 1921, and I am not referring
so, much to that province. The dates when
the -other provinces dispensed witb prohibition
are:
New Brunswick, April 20, 1927.
Manitoba, February 7, 1928.
Saskatchewan, January 16, 1925.
Alberta, April 12, 192.
Pritisb Columbia, April 2, 1921.
I think the honourable gentleman was a
prohibitionist in bis own province-I speak
subjeet to correction-and I must confess that
I was somewhat surprised to hear from a new
convert on that question, as hie is, a lecture Vo
the United States because tbey have a prohibition lýaw.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would the honourable gentleman quote from any remark of
mine to wbich hie has reference?
Hon. Mr. BRIQUE: I amn speaking of the
honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner). I hope honourable members who
are not disposed Vo agree witb the Bill will
refrain fromn criticizing the legislation of
foreign rountries. We sbould limit this discussion to our own affairs. IV is a matter for
the United States Vo decide wbat kind of legislation tbey shaîl ndopt in regard Vo liquor, and
so far as I arn coneerned, I shall not bave anytbing ýat ail Vo say about their laws.
The Bill would noV place this country in
any new position. The Canadiýan Government, acting under the autbority of Parliament, bas already Vaken a stand on this question of liquor exports, in accordance witb the
treaties. The treaty of 1924 reads:
Being desirous of avoiding any difficulties
whieb migbt arise between them in connection
with the laws in force in the United States on
the subjeet of alcoholie, beverages;
That was tbe objecV, Vo avoid difficulties
which might arise between the two countries.
That treaty was made beVween Great Britain
and the United States and was ratified by the
Canadian Parliament. By Article II it was
provided that Americun officers could board
private vessels under the British flag outside
the limits of territorial waters for the purpose

SENATE

112

of ascertaining whether there were on board
any alcoholie beverages destined for the
United States. In 1924 there was drawn up a
treaty between the American and Canadian
Governments, and it received the sanction of
this Parliament in 1925. Article I reads:
The high contracting parties agree that
clearance from Canada or from the United
States shall be denied to any vessel carrying
cargo consisting of articles the importation of
which into the territory of Canada or of the
United States, as the case may be, is prohibited,
when it is evident from the tonnage, size and
general character of the vessel, or the length of
the voyage and the perils or conditions of
navigation attendant upon it, that the vessel
will be unable to carry its cargo to the
destination proposed in the application for
clearance.
The intention of the two Governments was
clearly enunciated. They agreed upon adopting means to prevent the importation of intoxicating liquor from Canada into the
United States. The object of the -present Bill
is the same: it is merely to facilitate the
carrying out by the Canadian Government of
its treaty obligations.
I should like to ask the honourable leader
on the other side of this Chamber (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) a question. If Great Britain
were to pass a law prohibiting the sale and
importation of liquor within the British Isles,
would he consider it proper for the Canadian
Government to permit their officers to release
liquor for exportation to the British Isles or
to issue clearances to vessels engaged in such
an export trade?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No; I frankly
say that I should not be agreeable to that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am sure my honourable friend would take the same attitude if
such prohibition legislation were passed by
any other European country; France, for
instance.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have declared
myself not against the existing law at all,
but on the modus operandi which is before
us.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I repeat that we are
dealing with a question that is exceedingly
simple. If it would be our duty towards the
Government of Great Britain to prevent Canadian officers from releasing liquor or issuing
clearances for liquor destined to the British
Isles, surely we are likewise in duty bound to
take the same attitude toward the United
States. In fact, we have stronger reason here,
because we are under special treaties. Therefore I am at a loss to understand why it should
be thought necessary to send this Bill to a
special committee to go into that question.
Hgn.

Mr. BEIQUE.

I repeat, the proposed legislation is intended
merely to prevent Canadian officers from
assisting in violating American law and the
letter and spirit of treaties between the two
countries.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am not going
to anticipate what other honourable gentlemen will say, but I do not think there is any
necessity for the present system of clearances
and the giving of Government authorization.
I tlbink that the Government should not have
introduced this system of clearances at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
have it on our books.

It is the law.

That is the law as we

That system
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
was intended merely for statistical and revenue
purposes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
purpose, it is the law.

Whatever its

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, that is the law,
and it is because there is such a law
that it is necessary to pass further legislation
to prevent clearances for the United States.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
gentlemen opposite are not satisfied with the
law and they want to change it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The law as it stands
on the Statute Book has been abused by smugglers and possibly by distillers, and the Canadian Government is desirous of putting an
end to that sort of thing. It has been abused
to the extent of facilitating the exportation
of liquor from Canada to the United States
in violation of the treaty. Now, is it suggested
that in the face of its treaty obligations the
Government should allow the abuses which
have obtained for several months, or possibly
for years, to continue? Is it not the duty of
the Government to close the door to those
abuses so far as it is in its power to do so?
That is the only question, and I say the Government has that duty under the treaties of
1924 and 1925.
Some honourable gentlemen seem to be
concerned with the consequences of the passing of this Act, or to fear that it will entail
a very large loss of revenue. As far as I
am concerned, I do not think that if the
Government has a duty to perform towards
a foreign country the question of whether
there is a loss of five or ten millions should
eut any figure at all. I say that the Government should discharge its obligations irrespective of the loss which may be sustained. I
doubt very much, however, and in this I am

APRIL 3, 193011
agreed with the honourable leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), whether
this measure wiii prevent liquor from being exported to the United States. It is my opinion
that the distillers wili very iikely arrange
to ship their goods to Jamaica, Cuba, and
St. Pierre-Miquelon, and then the Canadian
Govereiment will not be concerned.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Why not? If
you have a strong suspicion that it is going
there, why not?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The Bill is not intended to prevent that. Under this Bill it
will be open to the distillers to export their
goods to England or to any European country, or to St. Pierre-Miquelon, Jamaica, Cuba,
or any other îsiand not coming within the
category described in the Bill. I am quite
sure-and the honourabie gentleman expressed
the saine opfinion-that these people wili find
some way of seliing thcir goods, and I think
he will find that instead of this legisiation
depriving the country of revenue it will very
iike]y have the contrary effect. I think the
distillers wili psy the $9 per Imperial gallon
instead of exportîng the goods under a bond,
because the moment the $9 is paid they can
dispose of their goods as they see fit, provided
they do not, to the knowledge of the Canadian officers, send their goods to the United
States or to, any prohibition country.
I think it is incumbent upon the Government to diacharge its full duty in the matter.
It is a question of propriety or impropriety.
It wouid be improper on the part of the
Canadian Government not to introduce, and
on the part of this honourabie House not to
pass, this legisiation, which is as ciear as it
can be made, and which has received the
almost unanimous approval of the membera
of the House of Commons. It wouid be improper to show any indication that the members of this House are disposed to support the
smugglers or to heip the distillers or anybody
else to introduce intoxîcating liquor into the
United States in violation of the treaty.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: May I ask
the honourable gentleman, as a distinguished
iawyer, whether he is satisfied that there was
any obligation to come to Parliament for this
legislation? I know it has been stated elsewhere that it couid be regulated by Order in
Council. Has the honourable gentleman given
that any personal consideration?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I mnust confess that I
have flot considered the matter at ail; but
whether or not what is desired cou Id be

accomplished by Order in Council, there is
nothing to prevent its being done by Act of
Parliament. We have an Act of Parliament
bef ore us.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honouiraible members,
this House is asked to pass this Bill, No. 15.
It is a simple Bill, in very few words, and
might have gpasseci, without much comment
but for the speeches which accompanied its
introduction in another Chamber and in this
House. Those speeches were of an alarming
nature. There are no alarming symptoms in
the Bill, but in view of the serious situation
suggested in the speeches to which I have
referred, the curiosity of the House and of
the country has been attracted to this question, and everybody is asking what it is al
about.
In introducing the Bill in this C1hamber
the honourable leader of the Government in
this House was apparently flot at ease, as hie
usually is. It is always a great pleasure to
see him handie legisiation here. He does it
Bo weil, so logically, with such ease, and with
such a thorough knowledge and grasp of his
subi ect that when hie gets through there is
usually very little left to be said. But I
thought that in his presentation of this
Bill I discovered a seniblance of labouring. I know not whether he did not have
ail the information at his disposai, or whether
his conscience was pricking him a littie.
It might have ooeurred to, him that he
was putting the coldi steel into friends of
the party he represents, which friends were
certainly friends in need in the year 1925. The
services of those friends were very welcome
in that year, but appaxently they are flot so
welcome at the present time. Possibly it was
the knowledge of the disastrous effect this Bill
might have upon erstwhile friend-4 which acted
upon the mind of the leader of the Government when hie was presenting the Bill.
The honourable member from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner), who followed the honourable
leader of the Government, openly admitted
that he did not have the information necessary to enabie bim to give an intelligent
vote on this question, and consequently hie
supported the amendment of the leader on
this side of the House asking that th-3 Bill be
referred to a committee so that information
could be seeured upon which to base an
intelligent judgment. That honourabie gentleman pointed -out that when hie asked for
certain information from the leader of the
House, the leader himself was apparently in
need of information, for he had to seek it from
a depart-ment official and oniy after having
carried on conversation with 1dm for some

time was he able to give it second-hand to the
House.
honourable gentleman from
Then the
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis) came to the
rescue in support of the Bill. But he openly
admitted that he did not have the information necessary to warrant his giving a vote;
and the best evidence of that fact was that
when he was asked how much displacement of
revenue there would be under the proposed
Bill, he innocently read a paper handed to
him by somebody else, which simply stated
the amount of revenue for the last five fiscal
years, without any regard whatever to the
question of displacement.
In view of this general lack of information,
I felt that in order to form an intelligent judgment, I must try to get the information for
myself. As a result of the researches which I
have made I find that this question dates back
a number of years. Without labouring it at
any length, I intend to refer to one or two
incidents in its history. Apparently it arose
out of the customs inquiry of 1926, when a
recommendation was made that clearances of
liquor to the United States should be discontinued; but although the present Government
bas been in power since then, no apparent
action was taken on the recommendation of that
committee. In 1929, some three years after,
we find that a conference between the representatives of the United States and Canada
was held here in the city of Ottawa. That is
the first action that was attempted after the
report of the committee of inquiry.
Now, as a result of that coming together of
the Canadian and American representatives,
the Canadian officials agreed to make certain
concessions and to facilitate our American
friends' enforcement of the iquor law on
the other side of the line. Apparently, however, they did not agree to go to the extent of stopping clearances to the United
States. As I say, that was in January, 1929,
and we heard nothing further of the matter
until April 20, 1929, when the United States
officially communicated with the Dominion of
Canada asking that their request be implemented.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my honourable friend is in error. I put on Hansard
yesterday a report of an interview with the
right honourable the Prime Minister on the
2nd of October, in which he said he had consulted the law officers of the Crown, who had
informed him that he could not proceed under
Order in Council, but would have to move
for legislation; and this would be announced
lIon. Mr. LAIRD.

in the Speech from the Throne. That was the
first of October, but the action of the Prime
Minister as to his right to proceed under
Order in Council was anterior to that date.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I was referring to the
representations made by the Government of
the United States, and I think I am right in
stating that the first representation made by
them was dated April 20, 1929. That was a
statement made by Mr. Phillips, the accredited American representative, and it reads
as follows:
While the Government of the United States
appreciates the gracious offer of the Canadian
Government to permit American officials to
transmit information of this kind from Canadian soit, it remains convinced that the only
effective means of dealing with the smuggling
problem along the border is the conclusion of
a treaty amending the convention of June 6,
1924. to the end that clearance be denied to
shipments of commoditiesNow, note this:
-- from either country when their importation
is prohibited in the other.
His suggestion is reciprocal.
Now, apparently there was no action taken
upon 'that request of the American representative for a whole year. The official correspondence was brought down, and a close scruitiny
shows no aotion taken on that application from
the United States. Then this Bil appears,
and it seems that a desperate situation has
arisen in the meantime, and a proposal is made
to stop clearances fonthwith. It is not, mind
you, a proposal for a reciprocal treaty, for
stopping smuggled merhandise frotm passing
from one country to the other: it is a onesided proposal to stop the clearance of liquor
from Canada to American soil.
In presenting the Bill the Prime Minister
used some very strong terms. I. cannot
remember any other occasion w'hen the Prime
Minister was so intensely in earnest in presenting a proposal to Parliament. He evidently
had a very strong opinion upon this question,
and in order that you may be able to observe
the emphasis of his contention, I purpose
reading whait he said on Ma.rcb 14 in introducing this Bill. He saiýd:
The Government is taking this step because
it feels with respect to its own officialsYeu wil'l notice that in his correspondence
he pays a great deal of attention to the
officials of the Canadian Government; he has
great consideration for them.
-it feels witi respect to its own officials that
it should net countenance on the part of the
cnstoms and excise officials, any procedure,
bowever legal or innocent, that would cause it
to appear that the Government is facilitating
the work of rum-runners and smugglers.

APRIL 3, 1930
And biter, at page 637, he says:
That this country should countenance anything of that kind along its borders, that it
should lend assistance through the instrumentalities of government to the people who seek
to make money in that way, or to facilitate
their activities by actions, however innocent,
of its own officiais is something too abhorrent
to contemplate.
And later, on the eame page:
A frightful Nemesis would certainly await a
nation that was indifferent to the moral right
or wrong of a situation such as is involved in
a procedure of the kind.
Those -are pretty strog statemenlts, but,
strong as they are, the Governmemt, leuder
in th'is House is equally strong. As hie wound
up his speech, on page 87 cif Senate Hansard,
he .hâd this to say:
That is why 1 say that ail through the transaction our employeesNotice the great empliasis hae bas laid upon
the emnployees--now that it is a monstrous deception. They
ail know that they are being made parties to
the trade that is heing carried on by the
siauggler, the rum-runner and the criminal on
bath sides of the rivers and lakes.
The bonourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Lewis), in supporting this case,
was equally strong in bis statement. After
four years of inaction by the Government bie
wants to "maintain bis self-respect." After
four years of accumulation of dirt be wants
to "wash bis bands" of the wbole transaction,
to use bis own words. So, to recapitulate,
and to use the words of these gentlemen themsalves, the Government proposes to stop
clearances, first, on bigh "moral grounds";
second, ta proteet tha officials from. practices
"too abhorrent ta contamplate"; third, ta
avoid a "dreadful Nemesis" wbich, gbostlike, is f ollowing them; fourtb, to stop a
"monstrous deception"; fifth, to rastore aur
"self -respect," whicb bas been trailed in the
mud for four years; and, sixtb and finally, to
"wasb our bands" of the four years' dirt, and
enable us ta assumne our natuml complexion.
Now, this is evidantly the terrible situation
that is confronting tbe Government. It impressed me as sucb, and no daubt imprassed
many others in this Chamber, until my
bonourable friand from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) addressed this Huse yesterday and
put the question from. a diffarent angle. Ha
said all this talk was a bugaboo. He suggastad that thare was an elaction in sigbt,
and that instead of this being a great "moral
question," it was proposed to be used as an
election cry. I bad great confidence in my
friend from, Pictou, and still bave great confidence, but in view of important statements
2425--U

made by tha leader of the Govarnment, and
tha very strong language hie used, I was not
disposed ta taka my friend's interpratation of
Sa I
it until I got furtbar information.
decided to pursue my investigations still
furtber.
On looking at a map of the Province of
Quebec I see down in the GuIf of St. Lawrence
two little islands called St. Pierre and Miquelon, and tbey belong ta France. I also sea
some islands down on tbe eastern coast of

soutbern United States, the West Indies, wbare
there are some British islands, some Dutch
islands, and somne French islands. Taking this
little island of Miquelon first, wbat is there
an it? Nobody lives there; thare is no in-

dustry thare. The only signs of life on the
whole island are some vary large warehouses
and some docks. Ships came there flot only
from Canadian distilleries, but from ail parts
of the world, ta unload liquor by the sbipload.
The same tbing cau be said about the Weist
Indies: at each of tbese national ports there
are large warehouses and docks, and ships came
thare from. ail aver the world and unload
cargoes of liquor.
Now, as sensible men, let us ask, wby is tbis
liquor going to the island of Miquelon?
Nobody lives there; s0 it is obvious that those
sbiploads of liquor cannot be consumad there.
Why do they go there? Everybody knows
that they break bulk there and are taken in
smaller coastakl vessels and peddded along the
eastarn caast of the Unitad States, and trickle
inta the United States in that way. The same
thing takes place in regard ta, t)he West InjZn
Islands. We know that for liquor brought from
ail parts of the world ports in the West Indies
are used as stopping places, and the liquor is
taken in smaller vessels and trickles into the
United States, as it daes from Miquelon.
We propase hy this Bill to stop clearances
ta the United States, and ta do it an bighly
moral grounds and on the ground of good
neigbbourlinem. We want ta live an good
terms witb aur American friands and assist
them whoiebeartedly in enforcing their prohibition law. Sa we are stapping clearances
direct to the United States. But we are not

stopping clearances inta Miquelon, though we
knaw that the liquor is going inta the United
States, probably the next day. We are not
going ta stop sbipmnents ta the West Indian
Islands, aitbougb every honourable gentleman
in this House knows that the liquor soaner
or later finds its way into the United States.
If we are sa consoientiaus in this matter
and want ta pratect aur officiais and flot put
tbemn in the invidiaus position of giving clearances wbicb tbey know are given for impraper

SENATE
purposes, why are we prepared to allow them
to give clearances to Miquelon when they
know that the liquor is going to the United
States the next day? Why are we perfectly
wliing to allow those officials to give clearances to the West Indian Islands when they
know that the liquor.is going into the United
States? After al, if it comes to a matter of
conscience, principle and high moral conduct,
and if we take the stand in one case of
stopping direct cleurances into the United
States, how can we allow clearances of liquor
which we know is going there by an indirect
route?
In view of all these circumstances the confidence I first had in the strong appeal made
by the Prime Minister and by the honourable
leader of the Government in this Chamber
received somewhat of a shock when I found
that they were prepared to debauch the people
of the United States via Miquelon and the
West Indian Islands, but were not prepared
to debauch them by means of direct shipments.
It looks to me that this Bill is straining at
the gnat and swallowing the camel. We want
to stop the small amount that is now being
sent into the United States from Canada,
but we are prepared to swallow the principle
of unlimited quantities being shipped the next
day from other ports to the same destination.
Thus, instead of "washing our hands," as our
honourable friend from Toronto suggested, I
submit that by stopping these clearances we
shall not wash even the tip of our little
finger, but shall leave our hands still soiled,
as be suggests they have been during all these
years.
My honourable friend from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) read at some length the statements made by the Minister of National Revenue in another place a year ago, in which
he defended the action of the Government at
that time in refusing to stop these clearances.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: He says he is
of the same opinion still.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: My friend from Pictou
read the statements made by Hon. Mr. Euler,
Minister of National Revenue, and it is not
necessary for me ta repeat them. We all
know them. We remember hearing him make
the statements during the last session. They
have been quoted all over the country ever
since, and I think they were received with
great unanimity, not only in the House of
Commons of Canada, but throughout the
country generally, because at that time he was
standing up for a strong Canadian principle.
Well, a year ago the honourable leader of the
Government in this House was a colleague
of that Minister in the Government, and on
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

the principle of collective responsibility I
imagine he is equally responsible for the statements of the Minister at that time. That
was before Nemesis became active; but the
obher day, after hearing the strong speech
made by the Prime Minister when introducing
this Bill, the Minister of National Revenue
made another statement. No-te that this was
not a year ago; this was only three or four
days ago. I find at page 968 of the Commons
Hansard, a'iomst at the very time that our
friend was raýising the question in this House,
Mr. Euler spoke as follows:
I have no intention of speaking at any great
length. sir, and at the outset of ny few remarks
I mnay say that I have no apologies to make for
anytbing I said last yaar with regard to this
question of liquor elearances. The views I held
then
awere
leld honestly; I hold themi to-day.
So that not only were all these statements
about injustice to the United States, and the
claims or requests that these clearances should
be stoppcd, repudiated in this manly fashion
by the Minister of National Revenue a year
ago, but he added, "I make no apologies for
having made those statements, and I am of
the same opinion now as I was then."
Later on he said:
I an not going to take refuge behind those
renarks; as I said before, I have no apologies
whatever to offer for what I said last year.
The views I then held I hold now.
Now, four days ago the Minister of National
Revenue was a colleague of our friend the
leader of this House. I ask the honourable
gentleman how he reconciles his statements
with those of his colleague in the other House.
As a member of the Privy Council, the Minister
of National Revenue had access to the same
documents, papers and information that my
honourable friend had, and yet he has nothing
to complain about; he says he takes exactly
the same position this year that he did last
year, and he has no apologies to make for it.
He goes on to say:
While I still believe there will be great
difficulties in the carrying out of the teris of
this Bill, J will say frankly that if there are
other considerations-and I am not saying that
1 express any adherence to those considerations
-if there are other considerations of national
importance which outweigh the objections which
I raised last year, then surely I am justified, as
a ienber of the Government of Canada, and
especially when backed up by the unanimous
opinion of the members of this House, in yielding to the will of Parliainent.
It will be noted that he says, "if there are
other considerations.'' He does not say that
there are other considerations. If there were
other considerations that he knew of-and he,
being a Minister of the Government, would
certainy know if there were other considera-

APRIL 3, 1930
tions--then bis course might be different. He
says, if there are; flot that there are; and bis
course bas not cbanged; so, apparently, there
are no otber considerations.
He voted for
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tbe Bill.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Yes, be voted for tbe
Bill, but 1 ask my bonourable friend bow be
can possibly reconcile tbe position of bis
colleague in tbe Government in making the
staternent that be did, and at tbe sarne time
voting for tbat Bill.
The bonourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able the Minister of National Revenue saidI arn subi ect to, correction as to tbe words,
but I know what tbougbts be conveyedtbat be invited tbe views of Parliament on
this -matter; he wa.s desirous of being enligbtened by tbose views and would welcome
discussion and expressions of opinion. I
understand no voice was raised on eitber side
of the Commons at that time in the way of
criticismn of the statements tbat be was making, or in the way of offering him advice.
The Government, looking at tbe events as
tbey developed, decided during tbe summer
tbat a stop should be put to the practices that
were then prevailing.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 0f course if tbe Minister invited expressions of opinion on tbe part
of tbe House, be was ratber late in tbe day
in doing so, as it was just after the conclusion
of bis speech tbat a vote was taken.
Now the situation resolves itself into tbis.
I arn confronted at this moment, first, by tbe
fear and foreboding of the Prime Minister
and tbe leader of tbe Government in this
House. I am confronted, secondly, by 'tbe
statements of tbe Minister of National
Revenue, tbat be is not scared a bit. I am
confronted, thirdly, by the absence of representations in tbe correspondence from tbe
United States as to no action being taken on
the part of the Dominion of Canada. And 1
amn finally confronted by the surety tbat the
traffic wiR' continue as in the past, via Miquelon, even if this Bibi is enact'ed.
We are asking for information. Wby should
we not get it? Tbis Bull is one of tbe most
important items of proposed legisiation tbat
bave corne before this Ch-amiber in years, yet
we are expected to deal with it in an off-hand
fashion witbout availing ourselves of facts
wbicb could be placed at our disposai. Tbe
bonourable leader of tbe Government in tbis
House cannot help us, nor can my bonourable
friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis). In
tbese circumstances, surely tbe logical course
is to bave a committee where tbe wbole tbing
could be gone into thoroughly.

117

I think tbat it is fair tbat bonourable members wbo are opposed to tbe amendment
sbould ask, wbat information we require
which could not be given in Committee of
the Wbole House. I will now attempt to outline tbe things we sbould like to know and
the information wbicb can be given only
through a special committee.
First, honourable members sbould be informed bow mucb revenue will be lost to the
country by the operation of tbis law if it is
passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
known.

That is already

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I presurne tbe facts to
wbicb tbe bonourable leader of the Government refers are those whicb were read by the
bonourable member frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Lewis) yesterday, whicb merely stated what
the revenue was in the last five years. But
we are anxious to know wbat revenue will be
lost to the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the bonourable gentleman anticipating t-hat the business
will expand and that there will be a corresponding growth in the revenue? He must
realize that we can give him nothing but the
facts; not an estimate, of tbe aictivities of
bootleggers on tbe Detroit River. I wonder
what information we could be expected to, give
beyond the facts.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I wonder too, and so
do oCber bonourable members. However, 1 have
stated the first thing we want to know, and
now I will enumerate some other things.
Second, what would be the effeet on employment generally?
Third, what amount of invested capital is
affected directly or indirectly by tbe proposed
Bill?
Fourtb, is the present enforcement law satisfactory and adequate, and will the proposed
Bill make, enforcernent easier or muore difficult
in tbe future?
Fiftb, what is tbe cost per capita for enforcing the present hiquor law in the United States,
and what would be the cost per capita to tbe
Canadian people for enforcing the proposed
law on the Canadian side?
Sixtb, tbe leader of tbe Government says
tbat tbe need for this legishation originates in
an Act called tbe Volstead Act in the United
States, and we sbould know what is being done
by tbe Government of that country to enforce
its own law.
The curiosity
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of my bonourable friend is too great.

118

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I am not through yet;
I have not shown all my curiosity yet.
And the seventh item on which we should
like to be informed is: Are we justified in
giving away our hand by means of the proposed Bill, and, after having done so, entering into a treaty with the United States covering other items, not nearly se important?
That, I think, is an outline of information
which this House should be given. Certainly
it would not do us any harm to know these
things. It is all very well for my honourable
friend from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique)
to proclaim that his conscience will be satisfied
bv withdrawal of permits for direct shipment
to the United States, and at the same time
his conscience will be satisfied if the liquor
is shipped to the United States via St. Pierre
and Miquelon. I have very great admiration
for my honourable friend and for his opinion,
and I was a little surprised to hear him make
that statement.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I beg the honourable
gentleman's pardon. I think he is not quoting
me correctly. I said that no clearances or
releases should be given by Government officials if they had reason to suspect that the
liquor in question would be exported to the
United States.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The honourable gentleman is a lawyer and knows that this Bill
would bind clearances to the United States
only, and that there could be no interference
with clearances to countries that have net a
prohibition law.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
If my honourable
friend will refer to the figures which I received
from the Commissioner of Excise and gave
to this House, be will find that 75 per cent of
the liquor exported went to the British Islands
and to St. Pierre and Miquelon. The Government had no reason to suspect that these goods
were not intended for the destinations stated.
Can the honourable gentleman state what
quantity of liquor is consumed in Cuba? How
could the Government determine the quantity
that should be allowed to go to Cuba or to
any other place where importation is net
prohibited? It is not the duty of the Government to act as a detective agency in tracing
liquor te its final destination.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I think the honourable
gentleman must have misinterpreted what I
said, and in order that there may be no mistake I shall repeat it. I ask him, in view
of his attitude against direct shipments of
liquor te the United States, how he can conscientiously justify the export of ýliquor to St.
Pierre and Miquelon when he knows that it
will be sent from there to the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He does not
know that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not know that.
If this Bill passes, clearances can be made for
shipments to England, to France, or toHon. Mr. LAIRD: Or to the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
United States.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
States.

No, not to the

Not to the

United

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Yes, from these other
places te which it is shipped from this country.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have no means of
knowing what quantity of liquor may reasonably be consumed in St. Pierre and Miquelon,
or in Cuba. Of course, if the quantities being
sent fýrem this country to those places were
obviously excessive, it would be, I think, the
duty of the responsible Canadian official to
whose attention it came to refuse te issue
clearances for such obviously excessive quantities. But if the quantities being exported
to Jamaica or to Cuba or elsewhere were
within reasonable bounds, I do not consider
it would be the duty of the Government to
prevent clearances.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: If my honourable friend
f'rom De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique) is ot
the opinion that none of the liquor which we
ship to the West Indian Islands and to St.
Pierre and Miquelon is re-consigned te the
United States, I will venture to say that hc is
the only honourable member of this Chamber who tlhinks so. I should not like to suggest that that is the honourable gentleman's
opinion, because ie bas one of the keenest
minds in this House, and I have the utmost
confidence in bis judgment. I should be very
much disappointed if my honourable friend
were to say that his conscience would bc appeased by the prevention of direct shipment
of liquor to the United States while nothing is
donc to stop the flow into that country via
Miquelon and other places.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If the honourable
gentleman wil.1 allow me, I will reply to him
in this way: I consider that my duty as a
member of Parliament is to help the Government to discharge its obligations, and not
to inquire low they are discharged. I take
it for granted that Government officials will
act honestly.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Now, let me go a step
farther in regard to these clearances. The
Government appa.rently have satisfied their
conscienccs in preventing officials being placed

would be if the United States next year were
to ask us flot to grant clearances for the shipment of liquor to Miquelon. I say that the
United States could flot ask us to, take that
action without askting ail other countries
concerned. 1 would point out that the first
request by the United States for co-operation
in the enforcement of their demestie laws
was made to 'Great Britain, and that request
ivas responded te without hesitation and witheut any apparent fear of subserviency. For
the last fifty years a favourite argument of
a certain party on the hustings has been that
Canada is subservient to the United States.
My honourable friend knows that very well.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I neyer heard of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:
The United
States asked Great Britain to agree to the
extepnsion of the territorial waters from three
to twelve miles, and Great Britain did agree.
It wvas understood that that was for the purpose of helping in the enforcement of the
Volstead Act.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I think I arn safe in
saying that a very large body of public
opinion in this country would not be surprised
if the United States made sncb a request at
seme time in the future, and they are very
much in doubt as to what repiy would be

Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
I amn very near the
conclusion of my remarks. I want to close
by a reference to a suggestion which I think
is desirable and which is called for by this
amendiment.
I have suggested information
along several d]fferent lines. I submit to the
leader of the Government that it is desirable
to have this information; I submit that it is
necessary for us to have it; I submit that it
would flot do any of us any harm to have
this information, and that it is only such information as we have received in other cases.
When there was a lot of doubt and discussion
with regard to the potentialities of the Hudson Bay and the construction of the Hudson
Bay railroad, this House appointed a special
cornmittee of investigation and heid numerous sessions and published the results of their
work in pamphlet form. The work done by
that committee formed the basis of the
authentic information appearing in the newspapers, and of arguments pro and con on the
public platform, and was the so-called bible
on the sub.ject of the Hudson Bay and its
possibilities. That was a great work done by
this House. Another great work done by this
Huse ivas accomplished by the St. Lawrence
Waterways (Semmittee, headed by the honoiirable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), a year or two age. I also, recaîl
lengthy sittings of the Banking and Commerce Committee upon the subject of the
National Railways, and the very interesting
proceedings in that committee and the volume
of valuable information acquired at that time.
1 have often heard my honourable friend himself (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) say that he was
proud of the committees of the Senate and
the work thioy do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Quite se.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Thcn why does net the
henourable gentleman exercise- bis pride by
having a committee appointed to do the
research in this instance? There is ne question that the information is desirable; there
is no question that a special committee of this House is best qualified to get this
information, because it can neyer ha forthceming in Committee of the Whole. Under
the circumstances, and in view of the fact
that we have ample time, I appeal to my
henourable frie*nd te grant us the concession
asked for in this amendmneit. I think such

the duty. He pays the duty, the charges the
Government impose on liquor that is not
exported. What is going to happen in the
future? That man will take the liquor out,
deciaring that it is going to St. Pierre, and
the Government will ask him for a bond.
Then he will take the liquor to St. Pierre and
bring back with him a certificate of landing,
and he will get back his bond, and the liquor
will go to the United States. We shall lose
the duty which we should have got if he had
told the truth, namely, that it was destined
for the United States; because, as he could
not get a certificate of landing in the United
States, he would have been obliged to pay
excise. If he takes the shipment to St. Pierre
he p9ys no excise at all. That is where we
lose on the transaction, and if we lose on that
transaction and the Americans do not gain
from it, why on earth should we pass the
Bill?
Everybody knoxs-at least, everybody says
he knovs-that the export will go on. It will
go via St. Pierre rather than across the lake,
and eventually the merchandise will land in
the United States. The gentlemen engaged in
this business will be put to some trouble. It
is niuh easier to run it across the river and
land it among the complacent officers at Detroit than to take it away off to St. Pierre
and then land it at some other plare where
the officers are equally accommodating. Possibly these gentlemen will not sell as much;
but they can afford to sell less, because they
will not pay the excise, which I understand is
$9 a gallon. If they sold half as much by
taking it to St. Pierre, I should think they
would be money -ahead. So, as far as I can
see at the present moment, nothing will be
gained by the Bill, but it will work an injury
to is.
If it can be shown that I am in error in that,
if it can be shovn that the liquor that goes to
the United States directly will not go there
indireetly, that will certainly remove all the
objections I have to the Bill. But I am sincerely impressed with the fact that this legislation is futile and is a mere gesture; that it
will be followed by a large loss of revenue upon liquor which we manufacture and send to
the United States anyway. It seems to me
that the argument advanced by the best
authority on the Government side, the Minister of Inland Revenue, is convincing proof
that the legislation will be ineffective, and it
follows that no benefit will be done to the
United States and that great injury will be
done to us and to our business.
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

Now, I want to make just a few criticisms
of the wording of the Bill. Some day some
person will say that this Bill was drawn by an
Irishman.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No Irishman ever made such a bull as is in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

not come from an Irishman.

(c) it shall be unlawfu to make any entry

Will anvbodv tel me whether that is
Choctaw or English?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is a
clerical error, which can be corrected at the
Table. The importation is prohibited by law.
I should have drawn the attention of the
Senate to the fact that there is a clerical
error there.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Did not

The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. RUFUS H. POPE: Honourable members, I have been connected with this House
for a number of years, as everybody knows,
and I never anticipated that the Government
would bring in a public measure affecting
the revenues of the country, affecting the

APRIL 3, 1930
industries of the country, and affecting the revenue authorities. without first appointing a
committee of investigation, so that we might
be able bv searching for information to find
out what effect the proposed legislation is
likely to have throughout Canada.
As to prohibiting liquor from going into

United States. In that locality there is a
hotel, half of which is in Compton County
and half in Vermont. Compton County has
had the Scott Act for about fifteen or twenty
years and that hotel, situated on the boundary line, bas had a wonderful experience. It
used to have a reversible bar: when the
American officers came up the bar was in
Canada, and when the Canadian officers went
down the bar was in the United Sta.tes of

same hour-which was very unkind of themthe poor old bar could not turn from one to
the other, and it was closed up. I was there
about six weeks ago, and I found a first-class
bar which is entirely on the American side.
You can get any kind of liquor you want
there. The alcohol was made in the United
States. It is cheaper. Many of the hotels
in the communitv in which I live use alcohol
made in the United States, because it is
cheaper; for they avoid the payment of excise
duty on it. There is plenty of liquor of
every variety in my locality, and, so far as I
can ascertain from those visiting different
parts of the United States, all that I have
said of that locality applies also to the United
States of America, from the north to the
south.
If we could do anything for temperance,
there would be an entirely different story to
tell, but the day when anything could be
done for tenperance has gone by. When I

temperance, but an extreme, and intoxication
is the other extreme. I take a drink occasionally. and I do not believe in either one
extreme or the other.
If we intend doing temperance work by
having our officers assume the responsibility
of prohibiting liquor from going to the United
States. when the United States officers themselves cannot keep it out, I have no hesitation in saving that we are wasting our energy
and our time, and complicating rather than

123

simplifying matters. The troubles between
the United States and Canada will be intensified if this Bill is passed. The enforcement
of the law will be costly for us, for we shall
have to pay for the machinery of enforcement.
Shortly after the opening of this session
I inquired whether the Prime Minister had
made statements to certain newspapers or persons concerning this question, and the reply I
got was that lie considered as strictly confidential many of the communications that he
had had on the subject of liquor clearances
and he was not prepared to disclose the correspondence. As a member of the Senate of
Canada, which is an independent House, and,
I hope, not under the influence of any outside
organization, I feel that in dealing with
questions of international importance that are
laid before us we are entitled to the complete
correspondence and other documents which
will show what led up to the introduction of
legislation that is proposed. But in this instance we are denied those things. I have
pages of stuif here dating back five or six
years; we all have read it, but there is nothing
in it to explain why we should charge ourselves with the responsibility implied by this
Bill. And when we say that we want to look
into the question and ascertain what is involved we are told that it is not in the interest of Canada that we should make inquiries.
I have already said that I believe the passing of this Bill would be detrimental to the
Province of Quebec; that it would lose a
couple of million dollars in revenue. I am
not acquainted with Hon. Mr. Taschereau; I
never saw the gentleman; but I know he is
Premier of that province and I sent him a
telegram inquiring what effect this Bill would
have on the Liquor Commission down there.
I have his reply, which is as follows:
Impossible to say now what effect proposed
legislation would have on business of our Liquor
Commission.
He does not say that the legislation would
have no effect on the Commission, but he is
unable to make a forecast. In my opinion, this
Bill if passed would result in a serious
depreciation of revenue in every other province except Prince Edward Island, which has
no liquor control Act. I have discussed this
question with many honourable members on
both sides of this House and I have been
unable to find one who could elucidate the
situation satisfactorily. I am at a loss to
know why we should assume the responsibility
of making this Bill into law while we are in
such complete ignorance of the whole question.

124

SENATE

Some honourable gentlemen may say that
polities is at the root of the division of
opinion in this Chamber, but is there any
justification for coming to that conclusion? Is
it true that we in this buse have drifted so
far away from independenoe that we are controlled by political agitation or partisanship?
We have heard rumours of caucuses in another
place, where pressure bas been brought to
bear with a view to whipping members into
line. If there is any truth in those rumours I
say that that is another reason why we should
have an investigating committee to get at the
real facts.
This Bill would be a serious blow to the
industrial and economie situation in this
countrv. 1 have been handed a memaorandum
which shows that in 1922 there were 69 brewcries and 10 distilleries in Canada and these
have increased in number fromr year to year
so that there are now 86 breweries and 27
distilleries.
A large number of people are
employed in these businesses, and shareholders are scattered throughout the Dominion.
Is the Senate of Canada going to have a hand
in destroying the investments of our people?
I realize that there are some honourable gentlemen who have not put their money into
distilleries, and I may say that I have neyer
investcd any that way, but still I think we
owe a duty to those who have donc so. Distilleries are legal industries and as such are
worthy of our support. Thcy have become
established in conformity with the law of the
land, like other enterprises, and I think that
we are entitled to know to what extent
the industries concerned would be affected by
this Bill.
The honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Lewis) bas said that he is very
proiid to belong to the Liberal Party. Well.
1 think if I came from Toronto and were a Liberal I should be proud too. It is a matter of
distinction up there, where there are so few
inembers of that party.
When. honourable members on the other
side of this Chamber say that we on this side
are anti-American and extremely British, that
is a compliment which I accept to its fulcst
extent. No one can confer higher praise upon
nie and the party te which I bclong than to
say that we have always stocd for the Union
Jack, for Canada, and for this country's independence of the United States and other
places. The Conservative Party bas taken
that stand in the past and wvill continue to do
s0 in the future, and we were neyer incre
united in this connection than we are to-day.
If the Stars and Stripes is going to be hung
up in this Chamber-I do not say it isHon. Mr. POPE.

it will have to be put on the other sida;
we absolutely refuse to have it over here.

Whenever there bas been any weakening on
the part of this country towards the United
States, it bas flot been the fault of the Conservatives. I have in mmnd an occasion whcen
I was a member in another place and we were
told that if we dared to put an export duty
on logs destined south of the border wveshoiild
not he allowed to run a train on any track
in American territory. When the Conserv-

atix e Party came into power the duty wvas
put on, and the trains continued to run the
same as before. If we want our neighbours
to the south to respect us--and I am sure we
do-we should stand firmly on our feet, and
show our determination to protect Canadian
industry, and seek to improve the employ-

ment situation in this country so far as we
can. If this legislation is going to have a
very bad affect upon our industries and the
employment of labour, then I think that we
should be given the fullest opportunity of investigating the present situation and the
future probabilities. I may say that I have
attempted to study this question froma both
the viewpoint of the provinces and the
broader outlook of the national interest, and

I fail to understand why honourable members on the other side are afraîd of a special
committee. I would ask the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
why ha is afraid of such an investigation? Has
anything happencd in the past that he fears

to have investigated?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is nothing
to investigate.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Is the honourable gentleman fearful lest something will ha dug up
concerning money that was taken from the
people in 1926?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

APRIL 3, 1930
Hon. Mr. POPE: Then why can we not
have a committee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is that what the
honourable gentleman wants to investigate?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I want to investigate the
whole thing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are drying
up the source of political subscriptions.
Hon. Mr. POPE: We are drying it up?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Then why not let us investigate and find how dry it is going to be?
That is a new idea. Does the honourable
leader of the Government not know that the
liquor that leaves this country destined for
St. Pierre and Miquelon and islands to the
south is really en route to the United States?
That is common knowledge. The liquor will
be placed on boats that ply on the St. Lawrence River and some Yankees will come
along and take the cargoes to their own
country. How can we stop them? We might
attempt to put a stop to that sort of thing
and cause a lot of friction between the two
countries, and run up a big bill of expense for
ourselves, but that is all we can do.
Would the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman allow me to ask him a
question?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Certainly; two.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honourable gentleman think it is the proper thing
for this country to put its seal of approval
upon cargoes of liquor destined directly to
the United States of America, when we know
that it can only be taken into that country in
violation of their laws, through the activities
of smugglers and rum-runners?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I am not discussing that
at all; I never have discussed that, and I
have not said that that would be proper. What
I said was that the liquor we export elsewhere
will find its way to the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is something else.
Hon. Mr. POPE: It will find its way to the
United States in spite of any legislation that
we pass, but we shall have the expense of the
preventive force. If the honourable gentleman cares to make inquiries he will find that
most of the bootleggers are American citizens.
That was not so ten years ago. Our people
have got sick of American jails and they no
longer run the risk of being put into them.
The Yankees come close to the Canadian
border and take delivery of the liquor. How
can we stop that sort of thing?

125

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At least we will
not tend any assistance to the carrying on of
that traffic.
Hon. Mr. POPE: But you do take the
excise duty and it forms part of the revenue
of this country. You cannot stop the export
of liquor. Is the Government going to put a
preventive force along the whole international
boundary of three or four thousand miles?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is on the
general question of smuggling.
Hon. Mr. POPE: There is smuggling of
liquor into the United States and that is what
you want to try to prevent. The Government
are not endeavouring to ship liquor south of
the border. Even my right honourable friend
the junior member from Ottawa (Rt. Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) would not make any
such statement. Everybody knows that we
are not going to lower ourselves to that degree.
But I submit that if this measure is passed it
will be necessary to have a corps of preventive officers the entire length of this country,
paid by the Dominion Government, and the
liquor will still get through to our neighbours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me to make a statement?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Certainly.
The GovernHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment of Canada will. not do anything of the
kind. The Government will not put an extra
man on the border nor elsewhere to help the
United States enforce their own laws. We are
desirous simply of cleaning our hands of the
business.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Then I tell the honourable gentleman that American citizens will
come over to this side and if they cannot find
liquor anywhere else they will grab it out of
the Provincial Commissions' warehouses during
the night and transport it across the border.
They will go that far and farther, because you
cannot stop a large percentage of the 120
millions of people over there from drinking
whisky.
If the Government do not intend to carry
out the provisions of this legislation, if the
whole thing is a farce, then I say that is an
attitude unworthy of the representatives of
this country. The honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has said that the Government are not going to do anything; they are
not going to increase the preventive force;
they want the Act passed and then will have
the Royal Assent given and no further action
will be taken. That is exactly what was done
in connection with the Scott Act all over this
country. The Act was passed and councils
voted in favour of it, but the people continued

SENATE
to drink whisky. And now apparently it is
intended that this Act should be passed and
handed over as a present to the United States
with this message: 'Accept this as a gift from
us. Now take care of yourselves. We will
have nothing more to do with your liquor
problems." Does the honourable gentleman
think that legislation founded upon that
principle is sound? I submit that the Goverriment will have to do their duty, whether they
want to or not, and that will inelude something more than the signing of a piece of

will say, "Nice people up there."
Now, I presume we are not going to be
allowed to have a committee; I presume that
it is going to be refused to us; I presume that
the vote in this House is going to be against
it. As far as I am concerned, until a committee shows me some reason for being in
favour of the Bill, I can sec nothing in it to
attract me as a Canadian. I am opposed to
it. But, as everybody knows, I am in favour
of investigation, and if in the committee any
good reason were shown why what is proposed
in this Bill should be done-that it is national
or international, and not political-I should
be disposed to support it. But I will not do
that without investigation. I regret that we
are refused the opportunity to investigate
this question. I do not think it is fair that
we should be refused that opportunity. Unless you give us an investigation, you cannot
escape the slur on the street. The slur on
the street says there is boodle money, and
that if an investigation takes place we shall
find out about the money the alcobol people
gave you in 1926.

that we may walk in; dare net let independent, honest, patriotie people walk into a committee to see what is happening in matters
of this kind. When the flow of liquor goes
one way it does not go the other; and I am
quite sure that what flowed into your barre]
did net flow into ours. How I should love
to have that committee investigate and vindicate your position of purityl Nothing would
give me greater pleasure than to discover that
the publie life of Canada, on both sides, was
as pure and white as the driven snow.
I am net going to detain you longer. A
man could continue almost without end on
this subject, producing facts and figures, but
honourable gentlemen who preceded me have
cited. figures and there is no need for me to
give those figures again. I am opposed to the
principle of net having a committee of investigation on an important question that comes

to the Senate from another place. I repudiate
that principie; and if the opportunity is given
me, I will vote against it. That is all I can
do.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members,
I do not intend to speak at length, but will
give a few of the reasons that induce me to
vote as I shall. I desire to bring to the attention of this House a few facts which will
demonstrate why, notwitstanding the lengthy
utterances to which we have been listening
during the last two or three days, there is
still a strong suspicion in my mind as to the
alleged necessity of referring this question of
liquor exportation to a special committee of
this House. Why, my honourable friends are
so conversant with all the aspects of the
problem that there seems to be hardly any
room left in them for additional information.
I purpose also to draw the attention of this
House to a few contradictions which I have
noticed while patiently listening to the numerous arguments put forth by honourable gentlemen opposite.
There is one question which I should now
like to ask my honourable friends. A decision
bas already been given elsewhere in regard to
this matter-an almost unanimous decisionand I ask what induced the political cousins
of the honourable members opposite to take
the stand which they did. Was it that the
Tory press throughout the length and breadth
of this country failed to convince them as
to what was the proper stand to take, or
was it that the soundness of the Liberal arguments convinced them? What was it? Was
it the fear of public opinion? This would not
be sound reasoning on their part, because
they have stated here many a time that
public opinion in this country is opposed to

APIL 3, 1930
this legislation. 1 repeat, what induced the
political cousins of the honourable gentlemen
opposite ta take an almost unanimaus stand
on this issue in anothcr place?
I for one, bonourable members, think that
the question at issue now is not a temperance
question. The main ground upon which I
base this contention is the fact that gentlemen
elsewherc, covercd with the glory which they
won ini a recent provincial election, have taken
such a radical stand witbin a vcvy few months
after their triumph at the polis. I arn referring of course! ta the Ontario members. The
stand which they have taken here might be
regarded as a "dry" stand, which is absolutely
astounding on the part of people who were
such enthusiastie supporters of tbe very
opposite policy in the provincial arena.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Would the honourable gentleman speak a littie louder? We
cannot bear him.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I beg ta remind the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg that the
first compliment I received, wben I entered this
Chamber was that my vaice, was strong enough
ta be heard by anyone here, even the oldest
member, and I was encouraged along that line
by anc of bis most venerable friendis. If my
honourable friend finde that my arguments
are tao strong for him, I sincerely apologize,
but he will have ta digest themn just the
ame.
I maintain that this question is a commercial, moral, and international question. Let
me draw the attention of the House ta a
few points, or objections, which were raised
against the enactmnent of the proposed legislation.
First, it is claimcd here and there that we
shahl be responsible for a tremendous lass in
our revenue. How can my hanourable friends
aceount for that argument wben tbey say that
the Bill will not affect exportation at ail?
Here is a littie contradiction which I find in
their own words, and which. I ask thern ta
explain. As a matter of fact, I think that
the abolition of the export trade in liquar
will give a tremendous impetus to tourist
trade in Canada and that taurists will icave
muoh mare money in the country wbile they
are here.
Secondly, this new legisiation will prevent
wbat I may cali back-smuggling. By that I
mean-and I know for a fact, because I happen
ta live in a district where smuggling is donc
every day-that when loads of liquar go aver
ta Detroit, for instance, the boats come back
full of goods smuggled fromn the United States,
and thus our country is deprived of a legitimaite source of revenue. On tbe ather hand,
I admit that the Province of Ontario wiil be

the greatest sufferer by this change of legislation, because the law in Ontario does not
permit the different brands of beer to be
advertised. But I appeal to Mr. Ferguson to
accommodate lis legisiation ta the new regulations and to give the Province of Ontario
a liquor policy more or less in accord with
the principles of the law in operation in the
Province of Quebec. Then you wili sec the
good friendship which the Americans will
show, in spite of taking the risk of becoming
the victims of the wrath of the honourable
member from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope). I
like to cali them my friende anyway, and
sympathetie neighbours of this country.
In regard to investments, it is claimed that
this legisiation wiil materially affect the
amount of money invested by the distiliers
and brewers of this country. That may be
so, but only to a certain extent. My honourable friend fromn Winnipeg must check me if
I arn speaking too loud.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Go on; you are
doîng very wel..
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is the first eandid
opinion we have got from across. From my
own investigation 1 know for a fact that in
some cases, if not in ail, 75 per cent of the
money invested in the manufacture of liquor is
American money. I have figures here pointing
ta that. Anyway, 1 can safely make that
declaration so, far as my district is concerned.
On a stretch of possibly fifteen miles on the
Essex b>order we have five breweries and one
distillery, and I know that at least 50 per
cent of the money invested there is American money. This afternoon I heard that
those investments would be badly treated by
the proposed legisiation, nearly ail the shareholders having been induced ta invest on
the representation that the investment was safe.
Well, I believe that tbey have had fair warnings. A year ago they had a warning from, the
Prime Minister. I believe the incident of
the I'm Alone was also a fair warning ta them.
The more recent pronauncements from the
Prime Minister gave them another warning,
and I think that if they bad anticipated that
they could not induoe honourable meinhers
opposite ta block this legisiation, they would
not have invested so much money in the
game.
I should like ta make a reply ta one more
question. We have noticed that bere and
there huge profits have been made by the
good friends of my honourable friend from
Bedford-the bootleggers. What has become
of that maney? I happen ta live in a district
where there is a large number of bootleggers,
and I arn nat -at ail the richer for it. In other

2425-9
REVISED EDfITION

SENATE
words, a large proportion of the money made
in that game was never used for the benefit
of this country at large, but was carried back
across the border and spent in the United
States, in excursions to Florida and elsewhere.
Now as to employment, having made a personal study of the situation in my own district, I know for a fact that the enaetment of
this Bill will mean the throwing out of cmployment of possibly 200 persons, and I am
very sorry for that. I sympathize with those
families, but on the other hand I contend that
all trades and businesses built on a wrong
principle eventually lead to false prosperity,
and that artificial prosperity is one of the
many reasons explaining to some extent the
relative stagnation of business at the present
time.
It bas been argued again and again that
the Prime Minister of the country is giving
one more proof of his good feeling, his excessive feeling of friendship, if I may put it that
way, towards the United States; and one of
the expressions used by my honourable friend
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) yesterday
was, " Nothing is too gond for Washington."
On the other band, it has been declared here
by the same speaker that most of the people
in the United States are not in favour of the
measure. How can those two statements be
reconciled? I grant that my honourable friend
may be right once, but he cannot be right
twice, when one statement is in contradiction
Nsa' also that. already we
nyf the other. I may
have felt the benoficial result from this proposed legislation, because only a few days ago
the ban against Canadian employees in the city
of Detroit was lifted by the civic authorities of
that city. That is an expression of good feeling
on the part of Americans towards Canadians,
and I think that we should reciprocate in
sincere friendship, and continue to be proud
of the peace that has existed for a hundred
years between these two countries, which is a
unique example in the history of the world.
It bas been said also that the people of the
United States have not so far given us
sufflcient proof of their real and earnest desire
to enforce their own laws. That may be
true in some instances, but I should like to
ask my honourable friends opposite whether
our Canadian police officers should not cooperate with the American administration in
trying to stem the increasing wave of crime
in this North American continent, in spite of
the fact that the criminality here and there
along the line, in Chicago and elsewhere, is
continually growing.
I will take this Chamber into my confidence for a few more moments and declare, in
Won. Mr. LACASSE.

all sincerity, that as a Canadian citizen, as
the father of a family living on the border, I
have misgivings at the thought of possible
international complications. I know that my
honourable friend from Bedford has large
armies to draw upon. I know he is ready
to do his part always-to wave the flag
in time of peace. But think, for instance, of
this possibility, which any day may become
an accomplished fact. Take the case of a
good Canadian citizen, a British subject living
on the shore of the Detroit River. After
supper ho sits on his verandah and reads
bis newspaper in bis own country while his
cbildren are playing in front of his porch.
At the same time smugglers and rum-runners
are taking a cargo over to Detroit, and the
minute they leave Canadian waters a bullet
from the other side, aimed at one of the
smugglers, happens to bit one of the children
Thus Canadian blood is
of that citizen.
shed, and for this an official bullet from Uncle
Sam is responsible. What are going to bc
the consequences? Suppose I am the father
of that child. ENen if I receive excuses and
apologies from Washington-cven if the President himself sheds regretful tears-a human
life is gone forever, a Canadian citizen is
killed by the official bullet of a friendly
nation. Now, this is not only a possibility,
but it is an actual fact, for a few days ago
a man happened to be shot on the Essex
border by an American bullet. He was taken
to the hospital and fortunately survived. Today, to my great astonishment, members of
this Parliament are opposing a measure which
is a preventive against a repetition of such
sad incidents. I will go further and, say that
one member in particularHon. Mr. LAIRD: I would ask His Honour
the Speaker if that is in order.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I am referring to
an accomplisbed fact. If this is not in orderHon. Mr. LAIRD: I submit it is not in
order, because it is a criticism of a member
of the other Chamber, and such criticism is
not in order in this Chamber.
I
The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER:
think my honourable friend had better not
discuss that subject.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I will cheerfully withdraw these last remarks if they are not in order,
although I have not gone to the extent of
calling my honourable friends across the floor
a set of dummies. I will refrain from adding
anything further to this discussion, for fear
I may be out of order again. If I have

APRIL 3, 1930
been out of order it is because I have followed
the bad example set by my honourable friend
fromn Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope), who is a
rnuch aider member of this Chamber.
Hon. ARCHIJ3ALD B. GILLIS: Honourable members, I have just a word or twa to
say. I arn sure it is somewhat af a disappaintment to, almost ail the members of
this Huse ta find at this stage that we are
re'fused a cammittee ta investigate this very
important matter. 1 do flot think there bas
been a single occasion since I have been in this
Hanse where a matter of such importance as
this was flot referred, to either a standing or a
special committee ta ascertain ail the details
in cannection with the Bill. In view af the
very pointed statements made by the honourable senator from Bedford (Han. Mr. Pope),
I can scarcely see haw the hanourable gentlemen can very well ignore them, and persist
in reiusing- a cammittee ai this Hanse ta
investigate these things, and aksa ta secure
information in cannection with the praposed
legislation.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely my honourable friend must have naticed that a large
part of that speech by the honourable member
fram Bedfard was in a jacular vein.
Han. Mr.,GILLIS: Nevertheless the statements were uttered, and, they wilI remain. on
aur Hansard for ail time ta came, and they
cannot very well be ignared.
Hon. Mr. DANDJJTRAND: But they are
nat serions. We aIl knaow that they are not
serions, and my honanrable friend himseif
knows that they are flot serions.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: But where are yon gaing
ta discriminate? Where are yau gaing ta draw
the line between what is serions and what
is jacular? Yau shanld draw a distinction
somewhere, and as far as I can see, it wili be
ntteriy impassible ta do sa in the statements
made by my honourable friend fram Bedfard.
But my particular object in rising was ta
ask a question. As ta the effect of this Bill
when it beconies law, ta what extent will it
curtail the shipments ai liquor ta the United
States? It is true that if this measure cames
into farce no clearance will be granted ta any
vessel that is supposed ta go ta any part oi
the United States. Take a cancrete example
af what may happen-what is bannd ta
happen. A man cames ta a distiliery and
wants ta buy, say, 100 cases af liquor, and he
has ta get clearance. He gaes ta the officer
who wiil grant that, and the offioer asks him,
"Where are yan gaing ta send this liquar?"
The answer wiil be, "To the United States,"
2425-9 j

ta which the afficer will reply, "We cannat
grant yau a clearance for the United States."
Then the exporter wili decide ta ship ta the
United States via Miquelon, and clearance wiil
be granted at ance.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Oh, noa; that is hardly
a fair statement.
The Covernment officiai
wouid nat grant a clearance if the destination
were declared ta be the United States.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I think my honaurabie
friend misunderstaod me. I did. not say that
the true destination wvauld be declared, but
the exporter would say he was gaing ta ship
to Miquelon and clearance would be promptly
granted. Sa it follows that there wili be no
reduction in the qnantity af liquar that han
been gaing acrass the border within the past
few years, but the Dominion treasury will bc
very much the poarer if this smnali Bill hecames law.
Much lias been said about neighbaurliness
in this discussion, but it is quite clear irom
the attitude ai the Senate and the Hanse of
Representatives ai the United States that they
are gaing ta bnild a higher tariff wali against
everythini we produoe. If we are faced with
a duty ai 42 cents a bushel on the wheat we
shonld like ta seil ta that country, why should
we go ont oi aur way ta heIp them enfarce
their laws? Surely if they are mot able ta have
their own regulatians respected, we shouId flot
be asked ta go in and assist them, as this
Bill contemplates, when in any event we conld
nat hope ta accomplisha very mnch.
Some Han. SENATIORS: Question!1
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is evident
that a large number ai honourable members
are absent to-night, and I shonld be sorry ta
see the Bill advanceKd ta third reading withont
their having an appartunity ta express themselves if they sa desire. I am willing that the
amendment should be recarded as rejected on
division, and that the Bill should be given a
second reading without division and go inta
cammnittee to-night, if in retnrn the honourable leader ai the Government wonld agree
ta tbe pastponement ai the third reading until
aiter the Easter recess.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Can the hanourable gentleman give a reasan why the third
reading shonid ba postponed sa long?
Han. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have given
a reasan. Several honourable members on
this side ai the Hanse are absent, and some
ai themn did nat anticipate that the question
would bc caming up at this stage. Not one
ai the senatars iramn British Columbia on this
side of the Chamber is present, and I have had

SENATE

132

telegrams stating that some of themn wouid
like to participate in the debate. There are
a number of other honourable gentlemen who,
I feel sure, wouid like to express their views.
1 think that honourable members present will
be willing to give those who are absent an
opportunity of taking part in the discussion
of the third reading. I dare say there are
some honourabie members absent from the
other side of the House who would like to
be present before the debate ends.
1 have no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
objection to Iistening to tbe views of any
honourable members of this Chamber, but I
sbould not like to leave this piece of legislation suspended during the Easter recess unless 1 were assured tbat honourable members
on the opposite side would regard tbe second
reading as a gîiarantee that the Bill wouid
be given the third reading. There may be
pre~sent a majority of bonourable members
who are in favour of the Bill, but we are
wiliing to bave the bells rung se that ail wbo
are in tbe building may record their votes.
If we are to be faced with a solid resistance
from the other side of the Huse wben the
motion is put for the second reading, I do
not tbink it is fair that we should be asked
to postpone the third reading until a time
when many of the supporters of the Bill wbo
are now present may not be bere and more
opponents may be in the Cbamber. If my
honourable fricnds who have been supporting
th-, amendment would give me an assurance
that tbey will not objeet to the third readin-, I should then ho disposed to agree to tbe
bonourable gentleman's suggestion.

There is no

nie would takze the same stand as the honour-

be agrecable to the postponement.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: XVe miglit as weli proceed with the third reading at once as give
that assurance.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Can the honourable leader of the Government depend on al
on bis side of the House to vote for the
motion?
I think that
Hon. Mr. DA«ND'URAýND:
the honourable members on tbis side who vote
for the second reading this evenîng wouid
vote for a third reading after tbe Enster
reccss. Can my honourabie friend froma Colchester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield> say the same
thing?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: 1 can say that if
the honourable members who are on the
same side of the bouse as the bonourable
leader of the Government vote for third readîng, there need bie no fear about tbe passing
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The honourabie leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
bas net yet stated wbetber he refuses to agree
to tbe appointment of a special committee. I
should be sorry to know that be bas made up
bis mmnd te that extent.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It is always the privilege of any legislative body to take any stand
it desires on the third reading of tbe Bill.
You cannot deprive us of tbat rigbt.

stated several reasons why there should be a

APRIL 3, 1930
postponed until new any remarks that I have
feit like making. I wanted to learu, if possible, what arguments, if any, I would consider of sufficient weight to lead me to vote
to send this measure to a special committee.
As an old parliamentarian and rather close
observer of parliamentary procedure, I do
nlot consider that this measure is, or that any
similar measure under sirnilar circumstances
would be, a proper subject for a special comnmittee. A spe-cial cornmittee such as bas
been moved for by the honourable gentleman
to my right (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) would
have a tremendous amount of work to do if
it proceeded to gather ail the information
,which some of my honourable friends on this
side of the House have demanded. To go into
the economic conditions of Canada, the national situation, the international relations,
and se on, as each of these subjects would be
affected by this Bill, would require the sitting
of a conimittee over a very long period, and
on that account it seerns to me that the
amendment was rather in the nature of a
dilatory motion than of one which, if agreed
to, would result in securing useful information,
Therefore I was, and still arn, opposed to the
arnendrnent.
I want this measure, which has been brdught
down by the Government five years later than
it should have been brought down, voted upon
and passled. I have very 'good reasons, I
think, for my attitude, although-I have not
obtruded those reasons upon honourable
gentlemen. I have been lis!tening attentively,
and have derived a great deal of cornfort as
well as information.- Sometimes when I look
at my honourable friend fromn De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Beique) and think that be and
other old campaigners and workers in public
life, including myseif, are reaching a tirne
when we shaîl be obliged, whether we like it
or not, to pass our work over to others, a
feeling of sadness cornes over me at the prospect that our country will be bereft of the
services of my honourable friend-I arn not
speaking of rny own now-and I wonder
wbether publie life wiil not be very much the
poorer when such a one finishes bis work. I
am led te tbink of wbat will become of the
country wben lie passes and wben I pass, as
I soon rnust. Well, I bave derived wonderful
cornfort from. this debate, because I bave
found on botb sides of the House young men
of etrong physique, of bright intellect, Who
know so much and are so positive in their
knowledge that I begin te look upon my departure witb fewer misgivings for the country.
And when I consider further that, despite ahl
their positive knowledge of subjects over a
wide area, they have a voracious appetite for

still further information, I feel that I shaîl he
able to pass away by and by with the assuran-ce that our country's future is in good
bands.
My beart-otrinýgs had heen touched a little
as I bad been led te cosisider wbat is te
become of the poor brewers and distillers when
this legislation passes. But I derived cornfort
from. my bonourable friend from Regina (HIon.
Mr. Laird), wbo tells me-and I tbink bis
statement bas been reiterated by others--tbat
tbe liquor wbieh we prevent from. being exported from. Bridgeburg to Detroit will be
shipped through St. Pierre-Miquelon, the West
Indian Islands, Mexico and South Arnerica.
What do the brewers and distillers tbink about
the situation? Tbey say: "It is ail the sarne to
us; one way is as9 good as another. If we
cannot sbip through Detroit we will sbip
tbrough St. Pierre." My bonourable friend
can bardly take the two propositions and bold
by botb.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: In one case the country
gets the excise duty and in the other it does
not.
Rigbt Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Yes,
but it is the brewers and distillers that I arn
looking at. And wben I feel assured that they
will scîl just as rnucb-and rnaybe rnore, because the spout wil be larger down at St.
Pierre-wby, I confess that rny bowels of
sympathy for the brewers and distillers bave
rather drîed Up.
I stiil feel that arnongst all this exuberanoe
and strength and power, and future promise,
I owe a little bit of duty to two sections of
the Canadian people. I owe a duty to the
Governrnent tbat is in power at the present
timne. Then I feel that it is rny duty to people
outside of this House, in Canada, atnd maybe
to a section of people outside of Canada, to
put my views sornewbat to the front so that
they rnay be cornpared, with the views that
bave been so carefully and sbrewdly and skilfully advanced by honourable gentlemen on
both sides of me. That duty I want to perform. I feel it my duty also to administer a
proper cbastening to the Governrnent sorne

Chamber. The question is as to when that

advanced by rny honourable friend to rny rigbt
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby), the third reading is
lef t until after the House meets again, I shahl
then take the opportunity of discharging that
duty.
I arn going to vote for this Bill. Every
criticisrn that I bave beard-and criticisms
bave been well applied in ainother part of this

building, and to a large extent in this Chamber
also-every criticism, while in most cases justly
deserved by the Government and its adherents,
is a reinforced argument for affirmative action
on this Bill at the present time. I think the
gentlemen who have very strongly criticized
the delays of the Government have thereby
put themselves in a position where they should
grasp at the chance of standing by this legislation now that it has come before them.
Therefore, if it is of any assistance in coming
to a conclusion along the lines which have
been proposed, I may say that my vote is
certain for the measure on the second reading,
in committee, and on the third roading.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I may say to
the honourable leader of the Government that
the conclusion of the proposition he has made
is hardly fair to me or to this side of the
House. I do not want to have any strings
attached to the third reading of the Bill. I
can sec that the amendment would be defeated to-night. and therefore I ask, "Why
vote on it?" The honourable gentleman has
a perfect right to call for a vote if he wishes.
I am not ashamed of my vote. I am willing
to concede the principle of the Bill, and to
go into committee to-night, but the third
reading will have to proceed in the regular
manner.

gentlemen who are facing me, or some of
them, an appreciable number of them, state
their views as to the principle of the Bill, se
that I may know where we shall stand when
we come to the third reading? That seems
a fair proposition. I owe it to my friends
who have been put to considerable inconvenience in remaining here to let them know.
I simply expressed a desire to know whether
honourable gentlemen opposite, having accepted the principle of the Bill, would endorse it on the third reading. Of course they
could onlv bind themselves individually. I
did net ask the honourable gentleman to
speak for the Conservative party, which he
represents in this House so satisfactorily; I
simply wanted to know that honourable gentlemen in voting for the second reading were
not saying. "We will let the second reading
pass, but will vote against the third reading."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
time is enough.

One thing at a

Hon. Mr. MICHENER: Had a vote been
taken I should have liked to express my views,
but there has already been considerable time
consumed in the discussion of this question.
If a committee were appointed, I should have
no objection; at the same time I should not
like my vote to be interpreted as meaning

that I am oooosed to the Bill.
entire accord with the Bill and think it is
high time it was passed. I quite agree wi.th
all the arguments advanced by the leader of
the Government. If it is any comfort to him,
I can assure him that he will have my support in connection with the Bill, and I think
I am exoressing the views of some of my
friends when I sav that they will follow the
leader in that respect.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Inasmuch as I
discussed this question this afternoon, I presume that mv honourable friend's remarks
are directed at me. I intended to make it
clear that I am not opposed to the principle
of the Bill, but that I am of the opinion that
it would be well to have the final passage
of the Bill delayed as long as possible this
session in order that we may get the greatest
advantage from the negotiations now pending
with the United States in regard to the
amended treaty. It is not, and never has
been, my intention to oppose the Bill on
the third rea-ding; but it i.s my desire te do
as much as I can to give Canada at least an
even break in the negotiations which the
Government has asked the United States
Government to consider. I do not think I
can put my position more clearly than that.
I intend to vote for the amendment moved
by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), because I believe it is in the best
interests of all that the Bill should not pass
at this time; but I have no desire to see it
defeated.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not want
to make any unfair proposal. I am ready to
accept the judgment of my colleagues as to
my constant desire to do the fair thing. The
honourable gentleman who closed the debate
'ast evening (Hon. Mr. Robertson) asked this
ifternoon if there would not be some advantage, in case we rejected the proposal to
appoint a special committee, in adjourning
the third reading till after Easter. Well, I
simply put this question, which my honourWill the honourable
able friend answered.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I stated a few
moments ago that I had no objection to the
proposal which came from my honourable
friend that the amendment be rejected on
division, that the second reading and the committee stage be taken to-night, and that we
postpone the third reading until we meet
again, in order that members who are now
absent may have an opportunity of expressing their views on the Bill. I indicated, however, that I wanted to know where I should
stand. I am responsible for the Bill in this

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

APRIL 3, 1930
House. I am ready to accept the declaration
of honourable gentlemen opposite that when
they vote for the second reading of the Bill
they accept its principle and will not retrace
their steps upon the third reading.
The suggestion which the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
has made -is one which I cannot reconcile with
the action of the Government in bringing this
Bill before this House. The question of principle is one thing, and the question of freeing
ourselves from the responsibility of joining
hands with the bootleggers at the frontier is
another. The negotiations carried on do not
alter the situation, and we want to be prepared to meet it by means of the present legislation.
This being said, I desire to place upon
Hansard a record of what has been done so
far with the American Government. I read
first a letter from Secretary of State for
External Affaira dated March 22, 1930.
Sir,
I have the honour to refer to Mr. Phillips'
note No. 349 of April 20, 1929, with regard to
measures under consideration for the further
control of smuggling operations along the border
between Canada and the United States, and
particularly te Mr. Phillips' statement that the
Government of the United States was convinced
that the only effective means of dealing with
the smuggling problem along the border would
be the conclusion of a treaty amending the Convention of June 6, 1924, te the end that clearance be denied te shipments of commodities
from either country when their importation is
prohibited in the other.
The Canadian Government has been giving
further consideration te the question in the
light of experience in Canada as well as of
developments in border enforcement by the
authorities of the United States, and has
reached the conclusion that further action is
desirable as regards both the special problem
of the smuggling of intoxicating liquors and the
general problem of commercial smuggling.
As to the expert of intoxicating liquors from
Canada, which involves the use of governmental
agencies in the release of liquors from bond as
well as in the issue of clearances, it has been
considered advisable that action should be taken
forthwith by Dominion legislation. A bill has
accordingly been introduced into the House of
Commons te amend the Expert Act, the main
purpose of the amendment being te require
officials of the Dominion Government having
charge of liquer in bond and the granting cf
clearances te vessels te refuse te release such
liquor or te grant such clearances where the
granting of such release or clearance in any
case would facilitate the introduction of intoxicating liquor into a country where the importation of such liquor is forbidden by law. This
measure has received second reading in the
House of Commons and is now being considered
in detail in committee. It will be observed
from the copy of the bill which I enclose that
it is general in its terms, applying te export
te any country where the importation of intoxicating liquor is forbidden by law.

135

As te the general problem, it will be recalled
that in discussing the holding of a conference
te consider the various proposals put forward
for further action te ensure the prevention of
smuggling, the Canadian Government indicated,
in February, 1927, its desire that the discussion
should net be confined te the question of the
smuggling of liquor but should cover all forme
of commercial smuggling from each country into
the other. The Canadian Government believes
that the present would be an opportune time
te conclude with the United States a treaty as
suggested amending the Convention of June 6,
1924, te provide on a reciprocal basis for the
denial of clearance of shipments of merchandise
by water, air, or land from either country te
the other when their importation is prohibited
by thé latter, and for such further reciprocal
measures for the suppression of smuggling as
may be found feasible.
The Canadian Government would therefore be
prepared to take the necessary steps at an
early date for the conclusion of such a convention.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my
high consideration.

of Commons are coming back on the 24th of
April. I told this Chamber that I was entirely in its hands-though I did not need
to tell the Chamber, because it goes without
saying-as to the question of adjournrnents.
My idea was that since the Commons would
return on the 24th of April, in view of the
length of tirne spent by that House i the
discussion of questions that corne before them,
I thought it would not scandalize or hurt
the feelings of the members of this Chamber
to suggest that we should corne back on the
6th of May instead of the 24th of April.
That is, we might take the whole of the
following week. If nobody dernurs on this
adj ournment, I will have the third rcading
of this Bill put down for the 7th of May.
Before this question is put, I should like,
speaking in the naine of the Senate, to emphasize the remark I bave already made, that
some of the statements of my honourable
friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) were
certainly made in a jocular vein. Hie has
been an old campaigner, and sornetimes he
draws largely on his imagination. I feel that
I arn somewhat responsible for the ethics i this
Chamber, and I think 1 should be remiss in
rny duty if I did not say that there are sometimes expressions which should be challenged
at once. When they are uttered at the rate
of 300 words a miute it is rather difficult to
challenge them, but I arn sure that I arn doing
the fair thing by rny honourable friend i sugge.qting to him, and he would be doig the
same by himself in accepting the suggestion,
that rather than allow sorne of his remarks
of this evening to go on Hansard he should
revise his manuscript.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should like, in that
connection, to say that I hope that very suggestion of my honourable friend will be applied
to the remarks that were rnade by the other
side to-night, which should also be elirninated
from Hansard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would say, like-

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: During the debate an
honourable senator raised a question about
the word "exportation" in the twenty-seventh
line of the Bill. My honourable friend the

PERMANENT COURT 0F INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
0F

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND rnoved the following resolution,:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Declaration under Article 36 of
the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, signed at Geneva in respect
of the Dominion of Canada, on the 20th day of
September, 1929, and that this flouse do
approve of the same.
He said: Honousble menbers, the purpose of this resdlution is the ratification of
the signature by the Dominion. of Canada to
Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent

138

SENATE

Court of Internationcal Justice. This clause
of the statute, commonly calied the optianal
clause, bocause it need not be subs;cribed to,
should be termed rather the ohiigatory clause.
When the Versailles Treaty was drafted the
League of Nations xvas organized with a view
to elimintating wair in the sett.lement of international differenices, -and substituting the
principle of arbitration.
The sections of the Covenant that deal
with the settiement of differences by arbitration, to insure peace, i-un from il to 17. I
wiil content myseif with reading but two,
articles 13 and 14. Article ý13reads asi follows:
Tbe Màembers of the League agree that whenever any dispute shail arise between themi which
they recognize to be suitable for submaission to
arbitration and which cannot he satisfactorily
settled by (liplomacy, they wiil submit the
wbole subjeet-matter to arbitration.
Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty,
as to any question of international law. as to
the existence of any fact which if estahlished
woui1d constitute a breacli of any international
obligation. or as to, tbe extent and nature of
the reparation to be made for any sncbl breach,
are (leclare(l to be among those which are gencrally siiitable for suhmission to arbitration.
For the consideration of any such dispute the
court of arbitration to which the case is
referred shall be the court agreed on by the
parties to the dispute or stipulated ia any
convention existing between tiemi.
The M4embers of the League agree that they
will carry out in full good faitît any award that
may lbe rendered, and that they will not resort
to war against a Member of the League which
complies there-with. In the event of any failure
to carry ont snch an a3vard, the Council shall
propose w-bat steps should be taken to give
effect thereto.
Article 14 reads:
The Council shaîl formulate and suhmait to
the Memibers of the League for adoption plans
for the establishment of a Permanent Court of
International Justice.
The Court shaîl be
competent to hear and determine any dispute
of an international chiaracter which the parties
thereto subinit to it. The Court nîay also, give
an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the
Assenîbly.
Hononrable gentlemen who have followed
the efforts made prior to the war to bring
about a better nnderstanding among nations
and to establish the principle of arbitration
throughout the world will rememfber that
there were two great international conferences
held at The Hague, one in 1899 and anc in
1907.
At those conferences were convened
representatives of aIl the nations of the world.
I cannot at this moment recolleet the exact
number of nations representcd, but there were
delegates from the Governments of probabiy
forty or fifty nations, inclnding ail the great
powers. They were agreed upon the necessity of an international court, and they conHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

stituted a tribunal of arbitration, with pancls
composed of delegates from various countries.
Yet this wvas not a Permanent Court of International Justice, and at the second meeting,
in 1907, they devoted arduons efforts to the
establishment of such a court.
They made
considerable headway, but adjourncd betore
thcy had succeeded in fanding a method of
selccting the judges. In that respect there
remained considerable difficulty ta be surmounted, some nations or groups of nations
fcaring that they would neyer be able to
cbtain representation in the court. Howcver,
thougb tbey went no furtber that year, nil the
nations recognized the principle that a Permanent Court wvas necessary.
Seven years later came the war, and it was
not until 1920, wben peace had been restored,
and the League of Nations organized under
Part 1 of the Versailles Treaty, that the Permanent Court of International Justice was
established.
As honourable gentlemen may
have noticed, Article 14 of the Covenant declares tha7t the Council shahl formulate and
submit to the Members of the League for
adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice; and
the Assembly, at its fl-st meeting, set about
creating that court. Upon report from the
Council the court wvas created and the difficulty whicb was met witb in 1907 as ta the
selection of memnbers of the court wvas overcame. Sa for the last ten years that tribunal
bas been fuinctioaing with a fuîll membersbip,
appointments having been made frora time ta
times as vacancies occurred through death or
resignation. At the last Assembly a work of
considerable importance w-as donc in remodelling the formation of the court, and I expeet
ta lay before the House later a report on that
work.
Fifty-two nations signed the protoco] of
the Permanent Court of International Justice
and some forty have officially ratified it. They
rccognize the court and adhere ta it without
l)inding thcmselves ta refer ta that tribunal
any differences that may arise between themselves and any other member of the League.
Those countries simply express their adherence.
But in the statute of the court there was a
provîso that members might make it abligatory
îîpon themnselves to submit ail disputes of a
justiciable nature to the court. Clause 36 of
the statute of the court contains that proviso,
which I shall nowv read:
Tbe jurisdiction of the Court comprises ail
cases wbich tbe parties refer ta it and al
matters specially provided for la Treaties and
Conventions in force.
Tbe inembers of the League of Nations and
the States mentioned in the annex ta the
Covenant may, either when signing or ratifying

APRIL 4, 1930
the protocol to which the present Statute is
adjoined, or at a later moment, declare that
they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and
without special agreement, in relation to any
other Member or State accepting the saine
obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in al
or any of the classes of legal dispute concerning:
(a) The interpretation of a treaty;
(b) Any question of international law;
(c) The existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation;
(d) The nature or extent of the reparation
to be made for the breach of an international
obligation.
The declaration referred to above may be
made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain Members
or States, or for a certain time.
In the event of a dispute as to wbetber the
Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be
settled by the decision of the Court.
Several States have expressed adherence to
this option since 1920, but none of them, were
The
what are known as first-class powers.
greater nations remained aloof, and it was
not until 1924 that two of the first-class nations,
Great Britain and France, declared their willingness to sign the optional clause, when the
Covenant was amended by what is called the
protocol of 1924. The purpose of this amendment was to fill up the loopholes through which
it had been possible to declare war. It was
declared that the members signing the protocol
would bind themselves to sign the compulsory
clause now under review, clause 38, which I
have read.
For the first time, I believe, in the history
of the world two nations of the front rank
agreed to a status of equality before the law.
I wish I had as thorough a command of the
English language as some honourable members
of this Chamber, in order that I might describe
the enthusiasm with which this action by
Great Britain and France was received and
acclaimed at the Assembly of 1924. To formi
some idea of the significance of the action of
those two great powers one has only to remember that out of the fifty-odd nations which
send representatives to Geneva more than
forty have no naval or military force for the
defence of themselves, or for purposes of
aggression to obtain what they consider to be
their rights. So those small nations felt that
for the first time they were really being given
a cound basis of security for the maintenance
of their rights. They rejoîced because at last
any differences as between them and any other
member, great or smail, of the League of
Nations, with respect to a treaty, would be
decided flot by the sword but by a learned
and peaceful tribunal. So it is little wonder
that the Assembly shook with the acclamations
of the delegates when it was reported that the

139

protocol had been unanimously adopted by
the two commissions, known as the First and
Third Commissions, which had to deal with it.
Unfortunately, an election took place in
Grent Britain; I mean, unfortunately for the
success of the movement to which I have
referred. Far be it from me to express an
opinion as to the domestic policy of a sister
nation. The Government that then came into
power decided, for reasons which to it
appeared valid, to reject the protocol, and
even to go farther, for it pronounced against
the underlying principle of cornpulsory arbitration, which was the foundation of the
whole structure of the protocol. The high
hopes of the Assembly were shattered, and
despondency followed. For four years the
Assembly virtually markcd time. The only
steps towards peace that might be mentioned
were the original agreement made and signed
at Locarno for the maintenance of peace on
the Rhine, and the attempt to insure peace
on the other side of Germany, betwcen
Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Serbia and Raumania on the one hand and the Central
Powers on the other.
It was in 1924 that the protocol was signed,
and in 1925 that it went by the board. For
four years, as I have said, no real, substantial
gain was made by the Assembly. Then it
sa happened that by a turn of the wheel of
fortune the MacDonald Goverument, which
had proposed compuLsory arbitration, was
returned to power. The situation at Geneva
changed. In September last the British Prime
Minister, in pursuance of the principle that
had guided himi in 1924, brought to Geneva
the acceptance of Great Britain. The effect
on the Assembly was magical and instantaneous. The British Prime Minister then
suggested that those members who had not
yet signed the protocol providing for the
compulsory reference of disputes to the Hague
Tribunal should by a conoerted move be induced to sign at that meeting of the Assembly.
Perhaps it would be well to place on Hansard a reference that was made to the influence
that the domestic policies prevailing in England exerted upon the progress of the League

In the first place, since the League of Nations
can make progress only by the voluntary

natural that eacb country should consider as

greatest power in the League. Each country is

so long is a similar tendency encouraged in the

the desire to subscribe to it was ready to
manifest itself. All those-and they are many

I might say here that in the winter of 192425 Canada, with Great Britain, rejected the

compulsory adherence to the Court of International Justice, Canada declared that it was

its view in a despatch dated March, 1925,
which I have had occasion to read to this
Chamber.
In 1926 the Imperial Conference was convened, at which it was agreed that none of
the Governments belonging to the Commonwealth would take action towards the acceptance of compulsory arbitration without some
further discussion. Such discussion was begun
by the Canadian Government in February,
1929, wi.th all the members of the Commonwealth, and continued till it reached its conclusion in Seetember at Geneva.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

When we reached Geneva a special committee of the Canadian delegation was formed,
at the request of the other members of the
Commonwealth, to discuss the form that our
adherence would take, and the conditions
under which, by our signature, we would agree
to the clause. All the members of the Commonwealth concurred in the view that disputes arising between members of the Commonwealth should be settled by other means
than by an appeal to the International Court.
The Canadian Government would have preferred to make a separate declaration of
policy on this point, without an express reservation, but a strong desire was expressed
that Canada should join with the other
members, and we concurred.
The Irish Free State signed without any
reservation outside of the two mentioned in
clause 36-reciprocity and the limit of time.
Great Britain, Canada,
Australia,
New
Zealand, South Africa and India signed
separately the following document:
On behalf of His Majesty's Government in
Canada and subject to ratification, I accept as

36, paragraph 2, of the statute, for a period of

of the present declaration with regard to situations or facts subsequent to said ratification,
other than:
disputes in regard to which parties have

other method of peaceful settlement, and
disputes with the Government of any other
member of the League which is a member of
the British Commonwealth of Nations, all of
which disputes shall be settled in such manner
as the parties have agreed or shall agree, and
disputes with regard to questions which by
international law fall exclusively within the
jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada,
and subject to the condition that His
Majesty's Government in Canada reserve the
right to require that proceedings in the court
shall be suspended in respect of any dispute
which has been submitted to and is under
consideration by the Council of the League of
Nations, provided that notice to suspend is
given after the dispute bas been submitted to
the Council and is given within ten days of the
notification of the initiation of the proceedings
in the court, and provided also that such
Euspension shall be limited to a period of twelve
nonths or such longer period as may be agreed
by the parties to the dispute or determined by
a decision of all the members of the Council
other than the parties to the dispute.
This was signed on behalf of the Domin-ion

APRIL 4,1930
There was, however, one very remarkable
event that occurred after 1924, which it is
well for us to bear in mind, and that was the
inclusion of Germany in the League of Nations
in 1926. When that took place it meant not
only that the greatest anti-allied power of the
war was added to those which then and thereafter were to co-operate with one another on
the lines of peace, but that there was another
great power and an effective worker added to
the ranks of adherents to Article 36 of the
protocol; because Germany intimated at once
its intention to adhere to the compulsory
clause and exert its weight and influence in
favour of pacific and judicial settlements of
international disputes.
Although Great Britain, for reasons which
were quite apparent and were in a certain
sense entirely justifiable, felt that it could not
at that time go as far as to ratify the protocol,
it did take a distinct line of action which
ultimately resulted in the negotiation and
settlement of the Locarno pacts. The onus
was thrown upon Great Britain, if it could
not sec its way clear to fulfill the purposes of
the protocol of 1924, to suggest some other
method which would lead to progress towards
the ideals which it was not able to realize
fully at that time. The method which was
taken resulted in negotiations being successfully concluded in what we call the Locarno
pacts; that is, Great Britain, together with
Italy, became the guarantor of the security
of the western boundary lines between Germany and France, and that led to the conclusion of those pacts under which both France
and Germany obligated themselves never to
go to war in an attempt to settle disputes
concerning that western boundary and all
other differences that might arise between
them. The guarantors, Great Britain and
Italy, undertook to see that those obligations
were carried outHon. Mr. GRIESBACH: By force.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: By
whatever methods were necessary, but if force
became necessary force would have to be
applied.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The words are,
"will come to the aid."
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Exactly, "will come to the aid." But will come
to the aid in what way? There are, of course,
different methods by which force may be
applied towards accomplishing the end in
view. If Germany or France were to violate,
or to show any tendency towards violating, the
obligations which they mutually undertook
for the preservation of peace, the respecting
of existing boundaries and the settlement of

any differences by judicial methods, then Italy
and Great Britain would use their influence
and power against the aggressor and in favour
of the victim; and whatever means were
necessary-diplomatic,
economie, financial,
or, if it were impossible to avoid it, as a last
resort, the force of armament-whatever means
were necessary to take would be taken. That
is, these obligations were meant to be carried
out, and a violator of the pact would encounter the united resistance of Great Britain
and Italy.
While the guarantee was absolutely positive with regard to the western boundary,
it applied in a modified way to the eastern
boundary along the line of Prussia and
Germany; and Germany practically obligated
itself never to seek by force a change in the
eastern boundary; but it did not agree never
to urge the concession in whole or in part of
any rights to which it might conceive itself
entitled in that respect, under the article of
the League of Nations Covenant which provides for such a readjustment in the course of
the operations of the League from year to year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Clause 19.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, that was a very notable and beneficial
step in addition to what had gone before, and
in substitution, for the time being, of Great
Britain's inability to rise to the full height of
the ideals which were held aloft in the protocol
of 1924.
It might be well for us to consider for a
moment here what was the primary difficulty
encountered by Great Britain when it came to
the point of considering the enforcement of
what we call the sanctions against an aggressor.
These sanctions were of differing natures.
Diplomatie pressure might be applied. Diplomatic pressure is a strong force when backed
by influential Powers, and in matters arising
out of a threatened or real violation of the
obligations of members of the League of
Nations, such pressure would probably generally effectuate the purpose. If diplomatic
pressure were not sufficient, it would be
followed by economie or financial pressure,
and one can easily sec what an important and
effective agency that is for the peaceful settlement of disputes. If all those methods proved
insufficient, then came in the sanction of actual
force. Important cases might arise in which
this force would be best exerted by blockade,
through the medium of naval operations, to
prevent, if possible, intercourse between the
citizens of any nation in the League that was
not a party to the dispute, and the aggressor
nation violating its obligations with respect to
another member of the League.

144

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What about those
who are outside the League?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
When you come that far, it becomes very
plain what nation would have to shoulder
the great responsibility of a naval blockade
to make effective the economic and comnercial sanctions. It would be Great Britain
herself, and the British fleet would be the
chief factor and agent in making effective
ibat final exhibition of force necessary to
discipline the recalcitrant power. The very
moment that the British Government, with its
fleet, should undertake to make good that
sanction by means of a naval blockade, there
w ould arise the question as to the attitude of
countries not belonging to the League of
Such countries, having given no
Nations.
mandate to the power that is carrying out that
final sanction, are not under obligation to
support it. The great outside country always
in view is the United States of America.
Those of us-and I think there are several
in this Chamber-who are conversant with
what took place between 1914 and 1917, before
the United States made its entry into the
war, know just how difficult was the role of
Great Britain, as a great naval power, in
enforcing the blockade against the enemy
nations. They know, as well, how tense was
the situation, and bow strong were the influences that United States commercial interests brought to bear upon it, and they
know what regard must be had to any such
situation in the future. If the United States
were itself a member under the obligations
of the League, it would have to be a supporting power; but the fact of the United States
being outside, and having a tremendous commerce and interchange with other nations, or
with the nation that might be under blockade,
indicates with what caution Great Britain
must act before undertaking such an immense
burden of responsibility. Whilst it was fair
to suppose that the peace proclivities and the
peace tendencies of the United States are on
a high plane as regards abstinence from war,
and the use of peaceable means for the absolute and final settlement of differences, yet
ber possible action in any given case was never
known. The United States herself had never
said, and bas not yet said, what her attitude
would 'be if, in such a case as I have nentioned, Great Britain as chief naval power
undertook to apply the sanction. The United
States has not indicated what in such a case
would be ber attitude, and whether or not
she would make it difficult, and perhaps impossible, for Great Britain to carry out the
sanction in a full and complete manner.
R.glit Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

My honourable friend behind me (Hon.
Mr. Mitchener) has spoken with reference to
the pact, and that has also been alluded to
by my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). The ,pact itself is a most excellent declaration of peace intentions, but
after it bas dedilared its two principles-first,
that no nation that signs it shall have recourse
to war as an instrument of nationail policy for
the settlement of disputes with other nations,
and, secondly, that no other than pacifie
means shall be adopted by those who have
signed the pact for the sebtlement of their
disputes-there the pact ends. There is no
machinery provided by which, if one of the
sixîty nations that have signed that pact
violates the obligation, and threatens or enters
into war, the other signers of the poet may
take action. But in the League of Nations
there is a perfected machinery, and just now
the most powerful nations of the world are
trying to adapt this machinery to the purposes of both pact and League. The League
of Nations, with a view to bninging the ideal
obligation in both League and pact to the
common high level of the abrogation of war
in all cases, is seeking a common formula of
mutual understanding, so that in the 'last
instance, where force becomes absolutely necessary, there may be no danger of clashing
interests rendering common action impossible
or ineffective. That formula bas, I believe,
been settcild by the committee which was
appointed by the Council of the League of
Nations to arrive at a method of procedure
which should, so to speak, equalize the ideals
and ultimute obligations of both the pact
and the League of Nations and provide for
common action.
In London to-day we see the spirit and
tendency of the pea.ce-loving world as
grouped in the League and as signers of the
Peace Pact. It is that some method shall be
found to remove all doubt, that when the
obligations of either the League of Nations or
the Paris pact are threatened or violated by
one of its signatories, the powers both of the
League itself, with its membesrship, and of
the Briand-Kellogg pact, with its membership, shal have unity of purpose and action
towards the would-be aggressor or brigand.
That is the ideal solution, and when that is
reached-as there is every ground for believing it will be reached, wvith patience and good
will and the vast moral sentiment of humanity
behind it-there will be practically no further
difficulty with reference to the discipline of
recalcitrant nations from time to time,
although Russia still remains out of the
Lea.gue. The difficulty is as to the attitude

APRIL 4, 1930
of the United States, and not so much as to
the attitude or influence of Russia as a naval
and commercial power.
I do not know whether I have answered to
the idea that I had in view, which was to
say that I should not like anyone to have
the impression that when my honourable
friend referred to the stand-still years in the
League, he referred to anything else than the
progress along the line of participation in the
World Court in regard to justiciable matters
of dispute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman is quite right. My view
was limited to that sphere.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think it is a wonderful thing, after ten
stormy, hard years following a four-years war
of unprecedented scope-unprecedented destruction of human life and of material wealth
-that amid ail the burdens which were
thrown upon the League-which were no
product legitimately belonging to it, but were
left to it by this vast cataclysm to which I
have alluded-to-day we have an institution
so universally respected, so world-wide in its
activities, so strong in its influence and character, and so successful in the lines of its activities, that it has conquered the scepticism of
the world, and, what is more, won the admiration, the fealty, the respect and loyalty of
humanity itself.
Oh, no, the League of Nations has not revolutionized humanity, but let us ask ourselves, if we will: if there had been no League
of Nations, no opportunity for the delegates
of fifty-four representative Governments to
meet together every year and for three or
four weeks to sit down with one another and
lcarn one another's circumstances and points
of view, and day after day and hour after
hour consult with one another, 1become
acquainted and friendly, and in an atmosphere
of peace and tranquillity as opposed to war,
cultivate relations, bring about agreements,
and remove prejudices and rising dissensions,
what would have been the condition of Europe
to-day, and the condition of the world?
Let us be reasonable, but let us be generously appreciative. Against the custom of
thousands upon thousands of years, when
nations had no other line than war as an ultimate resource, no other custom prevalent and
constant, it was a stupendous undertaking to
reverse the engine, so to speak, and set the
train in an entirely different direction upon
the rails of peace and good-will, judicial process, arbitration and conciliation. World mentality had to be absolutely reversed, and
directed towards another goal, and according

145

to other ideals. That so much has been
reached-is a matter for wonder and for congratulation; and instead of putting even a
single objection, other than by way of suggestion as to what remains to be done and
what appears not to have been effectually
accomplished, we should incline all our energies to develop the League's activities along
the line of encouragement and optimism with
reference to the future, based upon what has
been attained in the past. And no small
part of that great progress has been achieved
during this last year, under the leadership
largely of our own Motherland and sister
Dominions. That progress has been made
towards facilitating the reference of ail
possible disputes to this judicial tribunal
appointed by the nations, which tribunal has
overcome the scepticism and won the respect
of the entire world and is now regarded as
a court of vital power, a body with adequate force behind it. This is a great
achievement, and Canada has taken an
honourable-I am not going to make any
further claim-an honourable and active part
in bringing it about.
Hon. H. S. BELAND: Honourable members, I shall not take very much time with
the few remarks I have to make. Having
first listened closelv to the able presentation
made by the honourable leader of this House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) of the case of Canada
with regard to the Permanent Court of International Justice and particularly to the optional clause, and then having heard the
brilliant dissertation by the right honourable
member from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster), one of the most experienced, if
not the most experienced, of the parliamentarians of Canada, I cannot fail ta express my
satisfaction at the prospect of another debate
in this Chamber in the near future upon
perhaps a wider subject connected with the
League of Nations. To-day I shall content
myself with a few words about the World
Court, usually designated as the Hague
Court.
My honoumble friend (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
who asked a question of the leader of the
House a few minutes ago, desired to know
how the court was constituted.
I do not
presume to give that information; that is a
matter to be dealt with by the honourable
leader; but perhaps I may be allowed to
state what is common knowledge, that the
court comprises eleven fully qualified judges,
elected by the Assembly and Council; which
I assume means that to be elected a judge
of the court a candidate must have the approval of a majority of the members of both
branches of the League of Nations.

Visualizinz the Hague Court from the

the main service whieh the court xviii render

deiay in threatened international hostilities
is of the hiehest importance.
If honourablo senators will cast their minds
a short distance into the past, they xviii remember that about a quarter of a century
ago there was introduced in another place a
measure which became known, after its
passage through Parliament, as the Industrial
Briefiy stated,
Disputes Investigation Act.
what was the p)urport of that legisiation? 0f
couirse, the wor(l "arlI)itra;tion' wvas nientioned.
Necessarily a board xvas te be appointed in
order to investigate conditions betwcen both
parties to, a dispute in the industriai worldthe industrial world in such instances being
confined to what is known as public utility
services. Was it expected that after the Act
came into force the differences between employers and employees would flot be as bitter
as before? Certainly flot. The chief purpuso
of the Adt was to say, in effet, to employers
and employees: "If you hav e a disagreemient
which is likelv to bring about either a strike
or a loekout, you shal flot resort to either
of those means until the State lia interi ened. Voit wiIl, as it were, lay down your
weapons, and you ivili wait until the State,
through its Government, has intervened, appoiuted a board, made an investigation, rendered an award; and when that is done, if
you, the employer, or you, the employees,
are flot :zatisfied. you can, if you se choose,
resort to the strike or to the lockout."
I take that to rocan dclav. And what did
delay dIo in nuniberless cases wvhich occurred
after the passinz of the Act? What happened? Passions which in the first place were
aroused to a very high pitch of intensity could
not find expression in inimnediate action. They
had to w~ait, and they waited. And whilst
the board was appointed, and whilst it was
investigating, the press of the country, the
public speaker, the man on the street, gave
publicity tu the main points of the dispute,
and the result ivas that there wvas created and
moulded a public opinion which in time-in
lion. Mr. BELAND.

the course of the weeks or months occupied
by the investigation-was brouglit to bear one
wv or the other.
Public opinion is very seldom mistak-en.
There is, as we know, a philosophical thesis
which says that the consensus of opinion is
the criterion of truth. The Industrial Dislputes Act bas resulted in the settlement of
hundreds of disputes between the tîvo agencies
of the industrial world; disputes which otherivise would have resulted in strikes or lockouts and very serious inconvenience to the
public generally.
It is my impression that the World Court
will bave about the samne offect, though honourable gentlemen may think that there is
a wide difference between disputes between
nation antI nation and disputes between employers and employees in the same country.
There is ne doubt that there is some difference, but there is throughout the world, and
cspecially in Canada, an bonest press, whirh
is irabued with the desire and the determination te keep the publie rightly informed. There
ar*e nunierous papers in Canada which, in case
of international comnplications, would flot
hesitate at aIl to souind a note of warning to
the powers that be, if they tbought the position of Canada was not tenable. That may
not ho donc the first day; it may not be done
the first week; but if a dispute arises-I understand it must be of a justiciable nature before
it can be referred to the World Court-during
the investigation of the court public opinion
will formi in aIl countries not dircctly interestcd, and will ho brought to bear uipon the
parties to the dispute, and that. more than
the award itself, wvill resuit in a peaceful
settlement.
I confine my remarks to this to-day, and
I am extremely happy as a humble member
of this House to be able to support the adheronce of Canada te the optionai clause of the
MWorld Court.

ince of Manitoba in the northwest angle
inlet of the Lake of the Woods.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill
is for the purpose of transferring ta the Province of Manitoba two and a half acres contained in the northwest angle inlet of the
Lake of the Woods, jutting across the uine into
the Province of Ontario. It cornes as a
resuit of a treaty entered inta between Canada and the United States concerning the
boundary line, which followed the meridian
ta the northwest angle inlet of the lake.
Later, when a survey took place, that point
was moved a considerable distanoe south,
where a monument was set up, and Canada
came into possession of those areas jutting
inta the Province of Ontario. The Bull provides for their transference ta the Province
of Manitoba, and hais the approval and consent of the Province of Ontario. The schedule
describes the two parcels of land, which I
thînk represent about two and one-haif acres.,
No objection has -been taken ta this procedure. The land for a long time was thought
ta belong ta, the United States, but the survey
revealed that it was part of Canadian territory. The only question was in what province it should be included, and Manitaba is
the favaured one.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May 1 inquire
from my honourable friend whether the people
who are living on this territary are ta be
transferred and ta become Canadian citizens?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: How many

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The transfer of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know

declaration as ta where the uine passes, if
there are any they are supposed ta be ini

INDIAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 22, an Act ta amend the Indian Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill contains a number of amendments ta the Indian
Act. The principal amendments include an
extension of the school age of Indian children
by one year, and a provision that the Superintendent General may direct that a child be
detained in a residential school under certain
circumstances until he or she is eighteen
years of age. Provision is made ta prohibit
Indians of the Western Provinces from selling
their cattle without the consent of the Indian
Agent; and ta enable the Superintendent
General ta operate farms on Indian reserves
for the instruction of Indians in farming and
the supplying ta themn of seeds. Section 105 haa
been given by the courts an interpretation
that was nat generally understood, and the
abject of the amendment is ta make the section clearer. The provision in the Act with
regard ta the seizure of vehicles, vessels, and
other conveyanoes used in the liquar traffie
has been extendcd ta apply ta motor cars and
other means of transportation. Owing ta the
tendency of Indians ta squander their time
and rnoney in poolrooms, provision has been
made for bringing Indians before a public
magistrate, stipendiary magistrate, or Indian
Agent, or two justices of the peace, and the
court may forbid the persan who owns or is
in charge of a poolroomn ta allow an Indian
who has been found ta be a frequenter ta

PERMANENT COURT 0F INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
REVISION

STATUTE-RESOLUTION
APPROVAL

0F

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I desire to lay
on the Table a copy of the protocol for the
revision of the Statute of the Court of Inter-

149

national Justice, signed at Geneva, in respect
of the Dominion of Canada, on the 14th of
September, 1929; and I give notice of the
following motion:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the protocol for the revision of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, signed at Geneva, in respect
of the Dominion of Canada, on the l4th of
December, 1929, and that this House do approve
of the same.
W'ith the leave of the House, I would submit this as a motion now, in order that 1
might at the same time present the facts
relating to this matter and to another
protocol, which will follow; so that the discussion of which notice bas been given by
the right honourable gentleman frorn Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) may cover
the resolutions for the acceptance of the
optional clause and tef ratification of the
protocols which I have in ha.nd.
The protocol of signature of the Statute of
the Permanent Court of International Justice
was executed at Geneva ten years ago, in
1920. We may say, therefore, that the World
Court of Justice has already existed for something like a decade of years.
The original suggestion concerning the reexamination of the Statute of the court was
put forward by the French
Government.
They thouglit that it would be desirable, after
eight or nine years' experience, and in view
of the general re-election of the judges that
would take place in 1930, Vo consider whether
certain improvements should not he made in
the Statute of the court, without affecting
the essential framework, and without dlaiming to reverse any of the pninciples by virtue
of which the court had received almost universaI international recognition.
The French Government submitted its proposaI to the Assembly,' which adopted it unanimously. The Council was requested to
organize the work, and for that purpose constituted a committee of junists or legal experts, and, in conformity with the Assernbly's
wishes, invited a representative of the United
States Covemnment to participate.
Mr. Elihu
Root, a United States jurist of world-wide
reputation, Vook part in the revision of the
Statute, which increased the possibility of
American approval. The United States have
recently signed: (1) the protocol for American adhesion; (2) the protocol of signature
of 1920, and (3) the protocol for the revision
of the statute, which. I arn now suhmitting
Vo this Chamber.
This comrnittee of jurists met ait Geneva in
Mardi, 1929. Their report, which contained
a draft proposal relating to the revision of the

SENATE
Statutc, ivas afterwards (l2th June, 1929) submitted by the Council to a conferesice of
statcs parties, to the Statute of the Permanent
Court, which met at Geneva on September 4,
192, for the purpose of examining the amendments of the Statute and the recommendatiens formulated by the committee of jurists.
The conference gave a very full and thorough
consi(lcration to the whole matter. I may
say here that the right honourable the
junior member for Ottawa (Righit Hon. Sir
George E. Foster) participated in this work
n a elanner which did honour to Canada. The
conference adopted and approved a draft
protocol, which was flnally approved by the
Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations
at its meeting on the l4th September. The
protocol wvas signcd by myself on behalf of
the Dominion of Canada.
The amendments to the Statute are cmbodied in the annex to the protocol, and it
may flot be necessary to deal with themn in
detail. It may suffice to say that the Asdid flot contemplate recasting comnsrimll
plctely the Statute of the court, and bad
in viewv mierely the possibility of supplementing or improving the Statute in the light of
the exprrience already acquired. It is in this
spirit that the work which bas resulted in
these amendments bas been accompli.shed.
According to recent information, flfty nations have signed this protocol. We have aise
been informed that the instrument of ratification by Bis Majesty in respect of the
United Kingdom was deposited some weeks
ago.
The present protocol is subject to ratification, if possible, before the lst September,
1930, and shall enter into force on that date
provided that the Council of the League is
satisfled that those signatories whose ratifications of this protocol have net been received by that daite have ne objections te the
ceming into force of the amendments te the
court Statute therein set forth.
The substantial changes in the Statute of
the court as set forth in the annex te the
protocol are as follows (the references are te
the Articles in the original Statute):
Article 3.-The court shalh consist of fifteen members instead of eleven full judges and
four deputy judges as at present.
Article 4 is amended te provide for the
participation of States, net members of the
League but adhering te the court, in the
election of judges.
Article 8 is amnended te bring it into conformity with the change noted in Article 3.
Article 13 is amended te define the procedure te be followed in the case of the
resignation of a member of the court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Article 14 is amended te define the proccîjre te be followed in fllling a vacancy in
the court.
Article 15 in the present text is the second
sentence in the former Article 14.
Article 16 is amended te prohibit a member
of the court fromn engaging in any work of a
professional nature.
Article 17 is amended te bring it into conformity with the change noted in Article 3,
Article 23 provides that the court shaîl
remain perniancntly in session cxccpt during
the ludicial vacations, wbich will be fixcd
by the court. Hitherto the court session bas
begun each ycar on the istb âune. In view
of the change, provision is mnade for special
leave for ju(lgcs froni non-European countries.
Article 25 provides for the internai ordering of the court.
Article 26, previding for the optional hearing
of labour cases by a special panel of the court,
is amended by deleting the third paragraph of
the present article, and by providing for recourse te the summnary proceedings defined in
Article 29.
Article 27, providing for the optienal bearing of cases relating te transit and communicatiens, is amended in the sanie sense as
Article 26.
Article 29, previdin.- for suminary procedure
with a viow%te specdy despatch of business,
is arnended by inecasing the number of
judges in the special chaniber fromi three te
five.
Article 31 is amended by deleting the references: te deputy judges (abolished by the
protocol), and by adding the provision for
representation of interested nationals, ivhich
is transferred te this Article fromn Articles 26
and 27.
Article 32, relating te the judges' indemnity,
is slightly modified.
Article 35 is amended te provide fer the
adherence te the court of states net members
of the League.
Article 39 is slightly altered by providing
that the court may, at the request of any
pýarty, authorize the use of a language ether
than English or French.
Article 40, providing for the notification of
cases, is amcnded te mcct tbe situation arising wvhen states net members of the League
adhere te the court.
Article 45.-The English tcxt is slightly
cbanged; the Fýrench text remains unaltered.
A new chapter, Chapter IV. is added te
the Statute of the court, setting forth in
Articles 65, 66, 67 and 68 the procediire te be
follewed in the case of advisory opinions,
along lines already indicated in the memoran-

APRJL 8, 1930
dum on the protocol concerning the accession
of the United States of America to the protocol of the l6th De-cember, IWO0.
Lasit week, when 1 presented the protocol
for ratification of the optional clause, I was
asked how juýdges were appointed to t1hat
court. I will answer that question now. The
national groups nominating candidates for the
Permanent Court of International Justice are
constituted along the lines laid down in
Article 44 of the Hague Convention No. 1 of
1907. This article provides for the appointment by each State of four persons at the
most, of recognized oompetence in questions
of international law and of the highest moral
character, who may or may not be its own
subi ects. The maximum number of candidates
which any group may nominate is four, and
of these two only can be of the nationa2ity of
the group.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: lIt is from those
four they pick them, is it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Every oountry
may send four names, but the number of the
judges to be elected in Sepytember next is
Iimited to fifteen.
I was also, asked what were the emxoluments
ottached to the position of a judge of the
International Court. Under the resolution of
the First Assembly of December 18, 1920, the
judges were Vo receive 15,000 florins as annual
salary, 100 florins per day as duty allowance,
and 50 florins a day as allowance for subsisrtence for days spent at The Hague. Calculated
on the basis of 200 days Vo be spent on duky
in each year, the allowances amounked Vo
30,000 florins maximum. The oommittee of
jurists therefore suggeted a flxed malary of
45)
-florins for each judge, and an additional.
special indemnity d 15»(X0 florins for the
President, and a special allowance for the
Vice-President. This suggestion was approved
by the Supervisory Commission and by the
Tenth Assernbly. The judges are paid in
florins because they sit at The Hague.
I will mnove the resolution for the adoption
of this protocol.
Hon. Mr. POPE: What is that in dollars
and cents?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That salary represents $18,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Will the honourable
gentleman state for what period the judges
are elected?
Hon. Mr. ÇA.SGRAIN: Nine years, is it
flot?.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes, nine years.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: IV would be very
interesting to hear fromn the honourable gentleman what reservations the United States made
before joining that court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shaîl inform
my honourable friend in a moment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am going to,
deal with the subject in a few minutes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable gentleman desire Vo have his motion put?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then we ouglit
Vo have a message to send with this down to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not prepared to sta.te that we shall proceed by a
message, because there may be a separate
motion in another place. I do noV intend Vo
press for the adoption of the resolution at
this sitting of the House. The debate on the
motion may be adjourned until Vo-morrowthough, of course, I 'have no objection te tihe
immediate adoption of the motion.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senM>ors, I adjourned. the debate at the lasV

SENATE
PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
ACCESSION OF THE UNITED STATESRESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I desire to lay on the Table a copy
of the protocol relating to the accession of
the United States to the protocol of signature
of the Statute of the Permanent Court of
International Justice, signed at Geneva, in
respect of the Dominion of Canada, on the
14th September, 1929.
With the leave of the House, I move the
following resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the. protocol relating to the accession of the United States to the protocol of
signature of the Statute of the Permanent
Court of International Justice, signed at
Geneva, in respect of the Dominion of Canada,
on the 14th September, 1929, and that this
House do approve of the same.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I should like
that to stand over in the same way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will give my
explanations now, so that they may go on
Hansard, for the information of the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudiere (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain).
The history of this protocol is largely connected with that of the other, relating to
the revision of the Statute of the Permanent
Court. This protocol provides for the adherence of the United States to the Permanent
Court of International Justice.
It may be recalled that on the 24th of
February, 1923, the President of the United
States transmitted a message to the Senate,
accompanied by a letter from the Secretary
of State, dated February 17, 1923, asking the
favourable advice and consent of the Senate
to the adherence on the part of the United
Sttes to the protocol of December 16, 1920,
which created the Permanent Court. A resolution was adopted by the Senate on the 27th
of January, 1926, expressing the consent of the
Senate to the adherence of the United States,
without acceptance of the optional clause for
compulsory jurisdiction, and subject to five
reservations.
A conference was held at Geneva in 1926,
at which the United States were not represented, and at which a draft protocol was
agreed to, which was unacceptable to the
United States.
Fortunately, in 1928, the United States
again took up the matter, and did so at the
very moment when the committee of jurists
was meeting at Geneva for the revision of
the Statute of the court. Mr. Elihu Root,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

who had been invited by the Council to participate in the re-examination of the Statute,
was entrusted with the duty of bringing a
letter from the United States Secretary of
State asking that the negotiations in regard to
the accession of that country to the Statute
of the court might he re-opened. On the
19th of February, 1929, Mr. Frank B. Kellogg
wrote to the Secretary of the League, explaining the position of the United States.
A similar communication was transmitted to
each of the signatories of the protocol of
1920. The committee of jurists had thus a
double task. It had first to re-examine the
Statute, and subsequently to consider the
letter from the United States Government.
The second part of the work was dealt with
in a report prepared by Sir Cecil Hurst, to
which was attached an important document,
namely, the draft protocol concerning the
accession of.the United States to the Statute
of the Permanent Court. The work was considered by the conference of States parties
to the protocol of signature of the Permanent
Court, which was held early in September,
1929, and the draft protocol prepared by Sir
Cecil Hurst was adopted without alterations
by the conference.
I may explain that that conference of
States was composed mostly of members of
the League of Nations. but its work could not
be confined exclusively to them, because there
were States which were not members of the
League, such as the United States of America
and Brazil, who had delegates at that conference.
The protocol was finally approved by the
Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations at
its meeting on the 14th of September, 1929.
It was signed by myself in respect of the
Dominion of Canada. Some fifty-one nations
have signed it. The instrument of ratification
by His Majesty, in respect of the United
Kingdom, had already been deposited.
On the 9th of December, 1929, the United
States signed the protocol of signature concerning the Permanent Court, of 1920; on the 14th
of September, 1929, the protocol concerning
the revision of the Statute; and on the 14th
of September, 1929, the protocol relating to
their accession to the protocol of signature of
the Statute.
I will now give an abstract of the protocol
concerning the accession of the United States
to the Permament Court of International
Justice.
Article 1. The states signatories accept the
five reservations requested by the United
States Senate in 1926, upon the terms set out
in the following articles:

APRIL 8, 1930
Article 2. The United States shahl participate in flic elect ion of the judges of tihe
court on equai terms with the Stafes members
of the League.
Article 3. No amendruent of the Statute
of the Court may be made without the consent
of ail flic confracting States.
Article 4. The court shall render advisory
opinions in publie session after notice and
opporfunify for hearing.
Article 5, set fing forth procedure in the
matter of advisory opinions, is the kernel of
the agreement. If provides that "with a view
to ensuring that flic court shall not without
flie consent of the United States enterfain any
rcqucsf for an advisory opinion fouchîng
any dispute or question in whicli the United
Stafes lias or dlaims an interest," the SecretaryGeneral shail inform the United States of
any proposai before fthe Council or Assembiy
for obfaining an advisory opinion, and thereupon, if desired, an exchange of views as to
wheflier an interesf of the United States is
affected shahl proceed "with ail convenient
specd" befween fthc Coundil or Assembly and
flic United States.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Is that Article 5
that my honourablie friend. is reading there?
If is not like the text.
No; if is a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
paraphrase of the text. When a request for
an advisory opinion cornes before the court,
flic Registrar will notify flic United States,
as lie now notifies the members of flic League.
If difficulties deveiop, proceedings may lie
stayed until an adequate exehange of vîews
between the Concil or Assembly and the
United States fakes place.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is flie
Council of the League of Nations?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Council of
the League of Nations. If, after the exchange
of views above provid-ed for, it appears that no
agreemnent can be reaclied, the United States
can witlidraw fromn the court without "any
imputation of unfriendliness or unwiliingness
f0 co-operate generally for peace and goodwill."
Article 6 provides that the provisions of this
protocol shaîl have the same force and effect
as the provisions of flic Stafute of the court.
Article 7 states that this profocol shaîl be
ratified, and shahl corne into force as soon as
alI States signatories to the protocol of Dccember 16, 1920, have dcposited their ratifications.
Article 8 provides: (1) That the United
States may at any time withdraw from tlie
court. If and wlicn the United States exerciscs its riglit of withdrawal, this protocol
ceases f0 lie in force. (2) That ecd of the

153

other contracting States may at any time
notify thec Secretary-General that it desires
to withdraw its acceptance of these special conditions attached to the United States' adherence to the protocol of December 16, 1920.
If and when two-thirds of the States signatories shall have notified the SecretaryGeneral to this effect, this protocol shall cease
to be in force.
The fifth reservation of the American
Senate is substantially embodied in Articles
4 and 5 of the present protocol, which provides
that advisory opinions shall be rendered in
public hearings after due notice, as the S-enate
demanded. Its further requirement, that the
court should flot, without the consent of the
United States, entertain a request for an
advisory opinion touching any dispute or
question in which the United States lias or
olaims an interest, has been met hy the procedure worked out in Article 5.
*Hon.: Mr. CASORAIN: Have the other
countries the same rights?
The other
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
countries have hound themselves by their
adherence to the court as then constituted,
and the protocol which. is now subm.itted has
for its object tlic obtaining of tlic adhere«ice
of the United States of America f0 the court
and its cominc under the jurisdiction of that
court. The main objection of fthc United
States, contained in fthe Fifth Reservafion
which it made, is f0 the faot fliat the Council
can ask the court for advisory opinion; but
it has not vet been decided wlietlier the
Council can ask for sucli opinion by a maj ority decision of ifs members. The Unifed
States feit that it would be handicapped if
if agreed f0 advice being asked by the Council on matters which mighf affect the United
States, and the whole discussion that has
taken place within the Unifed Stafes and
between the Council of the League and representatives of American public opinion has
borne upon this point.
Now I mav read the statement of Mr.
Politis, who was the Rapporteur from the
Council to flic Assembly. He said:
No difflculty lias at any time been feit with
regard to the acceptance of the conditions laid
down by the United States in the Senate
resolution of January 27, 1926, except in so
f ar as they relate to advisory opinions. A
simple solution of these difficulties would have
been found lied it been possible f0 agree that
the system of asking the court for an advisory
opinion upon any particular question should be
abandoned altogether. So drastie a solution,
however, is not at present f casible. Tlie
oystem of asking the court for an advisory
opinion lias proved to be of substantial utility
in securing a solution of questions which could
not conveniently be submitted to the court in

154

SENATE

any other forni.
It lias also on occasions
enabled the parties to a dispute to asik for the
submînission of tieir differences to the court in
the forms of a request for an advisory opinion
when they were for varions reasons unwilling
to submnit thiem in the form of international
litigation.
Another method by vhich satisfaction might
easily have been given to the conditions laid
lown by the United States would have been
tiat of adopting a rule that in all cases a
decision on the part of the Council or of the
Asseiiibly to ask for an advisory opinion fron
the court must be unanimous.
If that rule had been laid down, the United
States, having the same right as any member
of the Council to express an opinion, could
have vetoed the decision to ask for advice.
As was pointed out in the Final Act of the
Special Conference of 1926. it is not possible
to say with certainty whetlher a decision by
a majority is not sufficient. On this point, all
tiat is possible is to guarantee to the United
States a position of equality witlh the States
wlici are represented in the Conneil or the
Assembly of the League.
This is effected by the procedure adopted,
which satisfied one of the main framers of
the Statute of the court, Mr. Elihu Root, and
aIse, J believe, the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs of the United States.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? When the
Council applies to the court for an opinion,
are the parties convened before the court
and given an opportunity of expressing their
views before the court gives this advice to the
Council?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, yes, the
parties are called. My honourable friend will
find thatHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
that.

It

does not say

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In clause 2 of
the protocol I have a full answer to the
honourable gentleman's question.
The U-nited States shall be admitted to
participate, througlh representatives designated
for the purpose and upon an equality with the
signatory States Memubers of the League of
Nations reps esented in the Council or in the
Asseibly, in any and all proceedings of either
the Council or the AssembilyHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
to the selection of judges.

That is confined

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
hlie Court shall render advisory opinions in
public session after notice and opportunity for
iearing substantially as provided in the now
existing Articles 73 and 74 of the Rules of the
court.
I will read the Rules.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

I have looked for

that, but have not been able to find whether
the parties are represented or not.

Hon. Mr. DANDUDAND:

I have here

Rules 73 and 74:
The Registrar shall forthwith give notice of
the request for an advisory opinion to the
smemobers of the court, to the members of the
League of Nations, through the SecretaryGeneral of the League, and to any States
entitled to appear before the court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is merely the
communication of the request. I want to
know whether the parties have an opportunity to be heard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
Membeus, States, and organizations having
presented written or oral statements or both
shall be admsitted to comment on the statements
made by other Members, States, or organizations in the form, to the extent and within the
time limits whiich the Court, or, should it not
be sitting. the President, shall decide in each
particular case. Accordingly the Registrar shall
in due tine comnmunicate any such written
statemcents to Menbers, States, and organizations huaing subiitted similar stateients.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
That does not
make it clear to me.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
debate was adjourned.

mîotion of Hon. Senator Logan. That in the interests of Canada. the British West Indies, and
the iritisi Emmpire as a whole, Canada should

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have been
asked to say, on behalf of the honourable
gentleman from Pietou (Hon. Mr. Tanner),
who is unable to be here to-night, that he
would like this debate adjourned until after
the vacation, and I would so move.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I wonder whether that
could not be changed to Thursday.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have just
delivered to the House the message the
honourable senator gave ne. Whether the
matter is pressing or not, I do not know.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: The honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) writes
me:
I only received the statistices froms the Bureau
to-day. and in any event I want to go through
them care.fully. Perhaps it is best to let the
smatter stand until after the recess.

But 1 want te impress upen yeu that this
matter shouid be discussed before the Budget
is brought down. The information that we
bave froin another place is that it will le

The Order was discharged, and was piaced

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Bill C, an Act respecting the capital stock
of the Ottawa Electric Railway Company.Hon. Mr. Belcourt.
INDIAN BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill à2 an
Act te amend the Indian Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
Sections 1 te 8 were agreed te.
On Section 9-amusements on the Sabbath:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourabie members, at first bluali I am net disposed te support thia proposai without some explanatien.
I cannot very weii sec wliy Indians shouid
net be aliowed te take part in public games,
sports, races, atîletie contesta or ether sudh
amusements on the Sabbath. I shouid like
te know the reason for this provision.'
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 was in the
same position as my honourable friend, but
by giving a few heurs te an examinatien of
the discussion elscwhere, I was able te get
considerable light on the aubjeet. I think
my henourable friend wiil find the reasen in
a few werds in tlie aide-note:
Serious compiaints have been made with
respect te the assemabling of boisterous and
undesirabie crowds on Indian Reserves on the
Sabliath te attend public games and conteste

155
155

sich as football, baebali aud herse-racing, etc.
These games attract especialiy the undesirable
elements frorn the adjoining tounicipalities.
This amendment wiil enabie a band that lias
been afflicted iu this way to make regulations
to provide for the situation.
We are authorizing the chiefa of the band
in counicil to protect the members of the band
again,4 a very unhealthy condition. A similar
power is given to miinicipalities throughout
the land. It is needless te say that if the
basebail gaine or football gaine is net for
meney it will hurt only the participants' sense
of Sabbath observance. It has been remarked
elsewhere that somne people who go to churcli,
as well as soine who, do nlot, have ne hesitatien
in playing golf on Sunday, and their case would
be parallel with that of a crowd of young
men or boys playing basebail on that day
However, there have been serious complaints,
and the Departrueut think tbat the band
should be given soine authority for their own
protection.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII: What day is the
Sabbatli? la it Saturday or Sunday?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That raises the
further question: what about the pagans in
those bands, who do not recognize any Sabbath? 1 think it may well be left with the
Council to decide what is best for the maintenance of erder among the band.
Hon. Mr. BBLCOURT: Would my honourable friend read section 101 of the Act? This
is an addition to that clause. We do not
know what is the purpose of section 101. It
is not given here in the notes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
Indian Act at -band at the moment.
Section 9 was agreed te.
Sections 10 to 16, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 16-Indian wasting lis time in
a poolroom:
.Hon. Mr. FORKE: I aliouid like te aay,
in regard to that section, that 1 know of instances where Indians spend ail their money
and ail they have in poolrooms, and 1 think
it weib that they sh'euld le prohi-bited, if possible, from entering them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Dees that cover
aise the half.4breed?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: 1 am speaking about
the Indians. There is a reserve near my home
at Pipeatone. The practice is a great detriment te the Indians.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In the West it is
liard te tell whether a man is an Indian or a
half-breed.

156

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend's remark reminds me of a somewhat
humorous occurrence. Mr. Monk was member for Jacques Cartier county, which faces
the Caughnawaga Reserve, on the opposite
side of the river. One day he came to my
office to tell me that two of the best citizens
of Lachine, local hotel keepers, had been sent
to jail for three months for giving a glass
of whiskey to two Indians who resembl.ed
white men, and that it was heart-breaking to
sec the wives and children who were present
when those two honest citizens were hauled
to jail. Mr. Monk wanted to know whether
he should not write te the Prime Minister,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who happened to be
acting Minister of the Interior at the time. I
told him he should. Two days later he came
in with a letter from Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
which said: "At lasti at last! I understand
why the people of Jacques Cartier prefer you
to me: they cannot distinguish between an
Indian and a white man. I will have those
two innocent men released."
Section 16 was agreed to.
On Section 17-control of public games on
the Sabbath:
Hon. Mr. FORKE: What is the difference
this section and section 9? It will
be observed that the wording of the sidenotes is exactly the same.

between

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
to different things.

But they

refer

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Different sections
of the Act.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: But the amendments
are made for the purpose of accomplishing
exactly the same thing. There is some reason
for it, no doubt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As far as my
recolleetion goes, this section is intended to
keep the white man off, while the other one
was to control the Indians within.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
I do not think se.
The two sections accomplish exactly the same
purpos'e.
There must be .a reason for the
same language, or surely it would never pass
the House of Gommons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was a
discussion on it in another place, and from
that it is clear that one section relates to
the outside people who attend those games,
and the other section adds to the power of
the Council itself to contro the games.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
There are two
distinct purposes.
Section 185 gives the
Council power to control by by-law, and in
the other case section 101 deals with the chief
or chiefs, who are the fathers of the Council.
Probably that is why there is need for repetition.
Section 17 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.

PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
COMPULSORY ARBITRATION-RESOLUTION
APPROVAL

OF

The Senate resumed from April 4 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand for the adoption of the following
resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Declaration under Article 36
of the Statute of the Permanent Court of
International Justice, signed at Geneva, in
respect of the Dominion of Canada, on the 20th
day of September, 1929, and that this House
do approve of the same.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I was taken somewhat by surprise
The honourable leader of the
to-night.
Government introduced a motion for the
ratification by this House of his action in
signing the protocol on behalf of Canada, and
also addressed us on the American ratification. I did not like to interrupt him, but I
felt at the time that the whole procedure was
out of order, and I think so still. The subject
was not on the order paper at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend failed to notice that I asked leave

IN

of the House to change my notice of motion
into a motion, in order that in this connection
the members of the Senate might have the
advantage of being able to read in Hansard
to-morrow the statements of fact relating to
the protocols. My only idea in submitting as
I did the two statements that are now before
the House, for consideration to-morrow or
another day, was that this procedure would
give my honourable colleagues more satisfaction and less work than the more formal
procedure. The questions involved can be
discussed intelligently to-morrow or at an
early date.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I did not
notice that the honourable gentleman asked
leave of the House. Speaking for myself, I
certainly would not have refused it, but I did
not observe that it had been asked. Obviously, in matters in which there is no dispute, and perha.ps no different point of view
on this side of the House, and particularly
with regard to the League of Nations, we are
always glad to hear the honourable gentleman.
The remarks I intended to make were to be
brief, and for the purpose of being precise and
not yielding to the temptation to wander all
over the lot, I had committed most of my
remarks to writing. The honourable gentleman dealt with the adhesion to the Permanent Court of International Justice by
Canada and by the United States. I may in
the course of my brief remarks touch upon
one or two other aspects, though perhaps
what I have to say would have been more
novel if my honourable friend had not made
his antecedent statement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my honourable friend intend to refer to questions
which are not already before the House?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think I should
be perfectly in order in doing so and in moving the adjournment of the debate.
The adhesion by Canada to the Permanent
Court of International Justice is undoubtedly
approved by the people of Canada. All questions relating to the League of Nations and
to the said Permanent Court have been given
much attention by at least two honourable
members of this House, namely the leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
who has held the highly honourable position
of President of the Assembly of the League,
and the right honourable the junior senator
for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster),
who has been in this Chamber the foremost
advocate of the League and the exponent of
everything relating to its establishment and
work.

158

SENATE

I shall attempt not to generalise, but rather
to confine my remarks to specifie matters.
The subject of the International Court has
had some interest for me, as perhaps it has
for all members. I have been more or less
familiar with it for some years, as well as with
the efforts made by the Hon. Elihu Root, of
the United States, for the establishment of the
court, and with the campaign of education
carried on by the Carnegie Foundation for
Peace and by other institutions.
But for the advent of the League of Nations
and the Covenant therein relating to the
settlement of disputes by court methods
and not by war, the court, I believe, could
never have been successfully established. Before the League
of Nations came into
existence, all attempts to get such a court
with membership extending over the civilized
world proved to be barren.
In this connection we are at all times reminded of the difficulty arising from the fact
that the United States is not a member of
the League of Nations. Fortunately for the
world, that country has seen fit to become a
member of the court. Public attention was
drawn to the fact recently by the selection
of Mr. Justice Hughes for membership in the
court, which position he was obliged to
relinquish on his appointment as Chief Justice
of the United States.
The qualifications for appointment to the
court are properly placed on a very high
plane. Article 2 requires that the Permanent
Court of International Justice shall be composed of a body of independent judges,
elected regardless of their nationality from
amongst persons of high moral character who
possess the qualifications required in their
respective countries for appointment to the
highest judicial offices, or are jurisconsults of
recognized competence in international law.
The court consists of eleven judges and
four deputy judges, with provision made in
Article 3 of the Statute for the organization of
the court that such number may be increased
to fifteen judges and six deputy judges.
Article 4 provides that such judges shall
be elected by the Assembly and the Council
from a list of persons nominated by the national groups in the Court of Arbitration;
and provision is made for the representation
of members of the League of Nations not
represented in the Permanent Court. The lists
of candidates shall be drawn up by national
groups appointed for this purpose by their
Governments, under the same conditions as
those prescribed for members of the Permanent Court of Arbitration by Article 44 of the
Convention of The Hague of 1907 for the
pacifie settlement of international disputes.
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

The members of the court shall enjoy
diplomatic privileges and immunities when
engaged in business of the court. There is a
unique provision in Article 24, that if the
President considers that for some special
reason one of the members of the court should
not sit on a particular case, he shall give him
notice accordingly; and in the event of a
disagreement between the President of the
court and the member of the court as to such
sitting, the court shall decide. If any member of the court feels that, for special reasons
disclosed by him, he shoulýd not participate in
the hearing of the case, he is to so inform
the President.
Provision is made by Article 29 for the
speedy despatch of business by the formation
annually of a chamber composed of thce
judges, who, at the request of the contesting
parties, may hear and determine cases by
summary procedure.
The jurisdiction of the court, under Article
36, comprises all cases which the parties refer
to it, and al i matters specially provided for
in treaties and conventions in force. Article
42 provides that the parties shall be represented by agents and may have the assistance
of counsel or advocates before the court; and
the procedure will consist of written or oral
arguments, or both, on behalf of the parties
appearing. Article 55 states that the question
shall be decided by a majority of the judges
hearing the case. In the case of an equality
of votes, the President or his deputy shall
have a casting vote.
Article 56 provides for giving reasons for
the decision, and the names of the judges
who took part in the decision; while, under
Article 57, dissenting judges have the right to
deliver a separate opinion.
Under Article 59 there is a provision that
would not be applicable to civil cases in the
ordinary way in the courts of a country,
namely, that no binding force, except as between the parties and in respect of the particular case, shall be given to the decision.
That, of course, is quite a reversal of the
ordinary principle, that decisions are based
on precedents. Article 60 provides that there
is no appeal. There are many other provisions
in the Statute creating the court, to which I
shall not refer.

SOCIETY

DISCUSSION

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER rose
in accordance with the following notice:
That he will draw the attention of the
Senate te the progress and present position of
the League of Nations Society and the participation and standing of Canada therein.
He said: Honourable members of the
Senate, it would probably not be questioned
if I were to assert that the one great, unique
deveiopment of the period since the conclusion of the war bas been the instit ution which
we are about to discuss in this Senate, the
so-called League of Nations. No one will
deny that within this period 'there has been
developed a new spirit, which is mnore or, less

dominant in the operations of the different
communities of humanity united in the form
of nations. Neither, I thinir, will it be denied
týhat that deveiopment is one to be welcomed
in the interests of the progress not only of
individýuai nations but of humanity as a
whole.
It is beneficial and entirely useful that
advantage be taken of periods of growth in
the deveiopment of any line of activity, and
it is peculiarly advantageous at the present
time to take advantage of the tenth year in
the bistory of the League of Nations to
make a fairiy compact presentation of what
have been its course and accomphishments. I
ipyseif bad the privilege and the advantage,
which I must always consider it to be, of
attending the Peace Conferenoe itself, and
the inception of the League of Nations, in so
f ar as its covenants or articles of association are conoerned, and of being prese2t
at the League's flrst annuai assembly. Afterwards I attended other meetings of the
Assembly, and hast year I was at the tenth
and latest annual sssembhy. Therefore it is
somewhat competent for me to pass a judgment upon, or to maire a presentation of the
history and the accomplishments of, the
League durîng the first decade of its existence. But it must be evident to honourable
members of this *Chamber that I ar n ot
capable, eitber physically or otherwise, of
attempting a close and detailed statement of
ail the operations and developments of that
institution during those ten years. That
would require vasthy more time and more
ability -than I amn able to give to the subject,
and more time than you couhd reasonably
grant me.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We will grant you
ail the time you want.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
So that what I say wihl be necessarihy siretchy.
I arn not going to taire up any time in detailing the difficulties and the mistaires, if there
have been any, of the League. I start with
thýs simple assertion, that I do not tbink even
the most enthusiastic adherent of the League
of Nations has ever been, or is now, of the
opinion that the goal aimned at, the ideal hehd
up, bas been even approximateiy reached, or
that it will be reached within thre lifetime of
any who are now listening to me. It may
be that the uhtiinate goal will not be attained
for many generations to corne. But I will
leave thre presentation of that aide of the caue
to those who constitute themselves sipecial
crîties of the League. A beginning has been
made, the road has been siretched, the goal
bas been set in the far distanoe, and we are

making appreciable progress towards ultimate
realization of the great objective at which we
are aiming.
I will make a few remarks first as to the
entity of the League itself. Ten years ago,
in.the office of the Foreign Minister of France,
in Paris, there assembled representatives of
eight nations, with about half a dozen of more
or less prominent members of the Peace Conference, and there was held the first council
of the League of Nations, which was participated in by the representatives of France,
Great Britain, Italy, Japan and some other
countries. The work of that meeting of the
Council was limited to the election of a
President, Léon Bourgeois, and a General
Secretary, Sir Eric Drummond, who had been
appointed by the Peace Conference itself as
the General Secretary of the coming League.
Lloyd George, Lord Curzon, Sir Edward Grey,
and a few others were at that assembly as
spectators and as sympathizers. That was
what might be called the birth of the League
of Nations. Its habitat was confined and
restricted; it was a moneyless being at that
time, and a claimant for charitable shelter
first at Paris, then at London, to which its
first meeting was adjourned, and afterwards
at Geneva. The only business done after the
election of officers on that 16th day of
January, 1920, was the appointment of the
commission to take charge of the administration of the Saar. The meeting then adjourned,
to resume in London. Well, that was a very
humble and unimpressive birth for an organization which, from that time until the present,
has been steadily improving and advancing.
It is well for us to take a few minutes to
consider to what extent the League as an
organization has progressed. From a beginning of two men and a handbag it has developed into one of the most extensive and important organizations that have ever existed.
It now has a habitat more worthy of its
importance, and a permanent home is in
course of construction on the shore of the
great lake of the city that has been chosen
as headquarters. Alongside there has already
been erected an imposing building, in which
is carried on the cognate and correlative work
of the International Labour Organization. It
has a Council of fourteen members; not
simply fourteen individuals, but fourteen
nations. We must always bear in mind that
when we count heads, either in the Assembly
or in the Council, we are numbering not
merely individuals, but the nations that these
delegates represent for the time being. Five
of the Council of fourteen are permanent
members, representing the Great Powers, and
nine are appointed for terms of three years

each and represent the whole body of the
association collectively. I might state here
that the Council, to whose first meeting I
have already referred, has up to the present
met fifty-eight times, the fifty-eighth council
having been convened in January of this year.
That is an average of a little more than five
council meetings a year. The Assembly is
made up of a possible delegation of about
160 members, each nation being represented
by three delegates. There again we must not
forget that these delegates are not merely
individuals, but in each case represent a national government and a more or less powerful administration. Working in and through
and with those two bodies there is the Secretariat, which now numbers about 600 persons
and is probably one of the most select, capable and experienced secretariats that the
world has ever known. I have given a brief
outline of the generaI contour of the organization.
But we do not get an adequate idea of the
organization which is there working out the
ideals and principles of the League of Nations
unless we take into consideration the fact that
there are at least eighteen or twenty great
committees or commissions, which are nominated, appointed and controlled by the Council and the Assembly. In every chancellery
in every country of the world these committees have members or correspondents who are
carrying on research, gathering information,
exerting influence. and they form a highly
important part of the working body of the
institution itself. It might be well for me
to mention a few of those committees or
commissions.
There is, for instance, the Preparatory Disarmament Commission, which consists of
thirty members chosen from twenty-nine different countries, in which the United States,
Russia and Turkey are also represented. The
research work of that commission is extensive,
technical and complex. Information is being
gathered preparatory to that convention of
the world which will sit sooner or later, and
which will come to conclusions based on the
work of the present Preparatory Disarmament
Commission, as to what the world will ultimately do in the matter of disarmament.
Then there is the Economic and Financial
Commission, which is made up of 204 members and divided into twelve committees.
These are dealing constantly with fiscal and
economic questions, such, for example, as the
reconstruction of Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, and the repatriation of Greek refugees
and exiles from all quarters of the world. That
commission has a tremendous influence and

APRIL 9, 1930
scope of usefulness. It represents all the
different nations and is consequently in action,
not simply sitting at Geneva and enjoying
the reputation of working with and for the
main institution, but always seriously at work
on various problems of world-wide importance.
Another very important branch deals with
health. This organization consists of 213
members from all countries of the world, and
is divided into 22 subcommittees. It deals
with general health, infant welfare, tuberculosis, cancer, smallpox, sleeping sickness,
malaria, standardization of sera, plagues and
epidemics, the opium question, leprosy, and
venereal disease. It is conducting research
in every part of the world where the necessary information is available.
Then there is the very useful Committee
of Communications and Transit, consisting of
220 members representing all nations. It is
d.ivided into subcommittees which are dealing
with Ports and Maritime Navigation, Inland
Navigation, Rail and Road Traffic, Buoyage
and Coast Lighting, Maritime Tonnage,
Measurements, River Law, Transport Statisties,
Aircraft Landings and so forth. No one who
thinks for a moment of the condition in which
Europe, to go no further, found itself at the
end of the Armistice and the beginning of the
peace era, or who has the least idea of the
divisions, rivalries, jealousies and fierce
natianal-istic antagonisms which existed between countries, and of all the hindrances and
difficulties which they placed in the way of
communication and trade, can minimize the
useful and unceasing work of that great commission in mitigating such differences and in
developing between nations a reasonable,
humane and human method of transacting
business one with another.
Then there is, to take a different phase, the
Committee on Intellectual Co-operation. Outside of material interests, there are also the
great spiritual and intellectual forces which
make for unity among the nations of the
world, the intermingling and cohesion of which
play an important part. So this Intellectual
Committee of 130 members, divided amongst
all the different nations forming the League,
is dealing with university relations, science,
bibliography, arts and letters, intellectual rights,
instruction of youth in the aims of the League,
the interehange of teachers, gifts of books to
what may be called indigent universitiesfor there were many such after the warand so on.
I will not take up time in going through ail
these different commissions. There are about
twenty of them which are incessantly and constantly at work.
2425-11J

There you have a picture, very inadequate,
it is true, of the present organiZation of the
League contrasted with that of ten years ago.
That contrast is undoubted, and constitutes
a veritable fact, and so far as growth and progress are concerned, is properly conducive to
an optimistic feeling as to the work of the
League of Nations.
Now, having touched upon the organization, let me call the attention of my fellow
senators to the activities and achievements
of the League of Nations. I could, if I had
time and you had sufficient patience, take
each one of these separately-first the activities, and afterwards the achievements in each
activity-but I shall treat them very briefly,
massing the two together.
What have been the activities and the consequent achievements of the League of
Nations within ten years? Those activities
can be roughly, though not quite accurately,
divided into political, financial and economic,
judicial, humanitarian-which include a large
group of related subjects and organizations-and intellectual activities. The political
adtivities are very often linked up with the
financial and economic, as a matter of course,
and less often with the judicial, the humanitarian, and the intellectual.
It is well for us to keep always in view the
fact-I do not know whether we do so or
not, but for fear that we do not, I will mention it-that when the institution of which
we are speaking was established, a new principle was imported and infused into international relations. In 1914 Austria placed her
ultimatum befîore Seiibia. Whether it was
based upon a desire to obtain the territory of
Serbia, as she had obtained, a few years before, the territories of Bosnia and Herzego.
vina, or whether it was due to a desire to asist
her ally in an eastward march, or whether it
was purely ipunitive for the death of the
Archduke, who had been assassinated in Sarajevo, makes no matter for the purpose I have
now in view. The doctrine of the nations of
the world at that time and from time immemorial was: " Hands off ! When two
nations are trying to adjust a dispute it is
contrary to international custom to initerfere;
it is the sovereign right of nationhood for
one power to adjust claims with another
nation on entirely independent grounds." It
is, I think, the general opinion of statesmen
and publicists that if at that time there had
existed an organization such as we have today in the League of Nations-as broad in
character, as strong in power, and as swift
in action-and it had been set in operation
when Austria showed her designs on Serbia,

SENATE

164

the war would have been averted. But such
was not the case, and a world war resulted.
The new principle that has been imported
is this: that the adjustment of a dispute
between two nations, A and B, is not solely the
concern of those nations. It is no longer
claimed or conceded that the other nations,
either by comity ýor by international custom,

are precluded from interposing.
principle now prevalent and dominant is that
there is a third party in every one of such
cases, and that third party is the rest of the
world. How far from possible it would have
seemed, when Austria preferred her ultimatum
te Serbia, that as a result of that ultimatum
and whatever might follow it as between those
two countries a million British people should
bite the dust, and millions in ;the British Empire should become widows and orphans!
There is an instance of the interest of the
third party. That interest is the dominant
spirit which to-day guides international relations. It is no longer considered impertinent or obnoxious for outside nations to
say, when difficulty has arisen or is threatening between two other nations: "Come
now! We have some interest in this as well
as you. Implica'tions and consequences, more
complex and more certain to-day than ever
before in the his;tory of the world, make it
possible that such a dispute, if not settled in
a peaceable way, will result very much to our
disadvantage and hurt." The League of Nations is built up upon that principle, and it
is the duty as well as the right of any nation
-a right which is no longer questioned--to
call the attention of its fellow members and
of the League itself to any disturbance which,
in this age of intertwining interests in international affairs, is likely to have a detrimental
or injurious effect upon any of the nations
of the world.
So one of the strong lines of political
action has been the prevention of war by the
settlement of disputes such as, under the old
:egime, would have led almost inevitably to
,var. There are no water-tight compartments
in the world to-day. War is very different

of learning about them you can, for a few
cents, provide yourself the information in
much better form than I could give it to
you.
Along the line of political activity the
League goes farther. There is the question
of reparations. Although that was and is a
financial question involving an immense
money indemnity and very large and widely
distributed payments, it is also a political
matter. The Peace Conference was not able
to set a figure. The question of fixing the
amount of reparations was left over to a
Reparations Commission, and then was
handed down, with all its heartburnings and
difficulties, to the League of Nations, which
was supposed to mollify the feelings of
different nationalities hitherto adverse to one
another. Although the Reparations Commission was not appointed by the League of
Nations, yet it is true tihat the different
amendments and ameliorations in that connection really had their birthplace in, and
received their impulse from, the spirit and
work of the League of Nations itself. Se we
have, through a tortuous series of years and
negotiations, the indemnity pared down to a
fraction of what was demanded in those
exuberant and antagonistie days when war
fever was high in the blood of nations, and
when reason, in many cases, had to take an
inferior place. The Dawes Plan, the Young
Plan, and the agreements which have arisen
out of them may fairly be attributed to the
League, its desire for peace and its endeavours
to calm and mitigate the differences between
nationalities.
I should be led a long way if I were to
follow this matter out. The Locarno Pact
also was one of the political results of the
spirit of the League.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: The offspring of
the protocol.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Out of the Locarno Pact came the consequential agreements along the line of conciliation, arbitration, and judicial process,
until on the 31st of December, 1929, there
were 130 bilateral agreements for the settlement by such methods of disputes between
nations.
Last year witnessed the notable
progress made in the adoption of the compulsory clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.
At
this date 24 nations have ratified and are
bound by this clause, 15 others have promised
speedy ratification, and 41 have declared
aoceptance.

wrong. How can one of them return home if
he is defeated? Public opinion has not yet
been developed in all European countries to
a sufficiently high standard 'to ensure the
view of such matters from a strictly judicial
standpoint. Failing to agree before Council,
they agree to the friendly suggestion: "Here
is our court. Why not submit the mat|ter to
it, and if the court decides that you are right
and I am wrong, then we can go back-you
to no triumph, because you have simply got
what is your right, and I to no defeat, because
I have ben denied by a court which we both
have helped to constitute and to which we
both have appealed?" It is because of the
prompt and facile working of the court in
the matiter of advisory opinions that the
League of Nations was unable to accept the
Fifth Reservation of the Senate of the United
States, for such a reservation would have
resulted either in absolutely barring or in
delaying the handing down of advisory
opinions of the court; and it is necessary that
an advisory opinion should be obtained
quickly and applied promptly, in order to
prevent disputes growing to wars.
Not one of the decisions of the World
Court has been disputed. Every decision
which it has made has been heeded and
respected. The other day I read in an
American paper a statement which was made
by the late William H. Taft, an ex-President,
and an ex-Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States. He stated that there was
crying and vital necessity for such a court
in international relationships, and Se ventured
the opinion that it was only a matter of time
before it would become dominant and permanent. He thought that probably some
international force would be required in order
to make the decrees of the court effective.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: And
that was the outstanding objection to the
institution of that court by the League.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, facts are stronger than theories, and
facts are still stronger than estimations which
rest on very poor theories. The fact that
the court has handed down so many decisions
which have received world-wide approval goes
to show that there is an innate desire and
willingness on the part of human beings, however they may be congregated into nationalities, to honour the decrees of a court which is
properly constituted and which has the necessary ability and experience and justifies its
decisions. In some of those cases first-class
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

powers were opposed by small nations, by
what are called third-rate powers and even
fourth-rate powers, but in every instance the
decision of the court was respected and obeyed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The weakness, as some people might say, of
the League of Nations from its inception, and,
to a certain extent, of the court, has been
that one of the greatest nations of the world
has so far declined to become a member.
Well, while we will concede a certain amount
of weight to that, I for one am not prepared
to go so far as to say that the League or
the court will die of inanition, even if one
very great power is outside of one or both
organizations. The prestige and influence of
either organization would undoubtedly be increased if that great power were a member,
but humanity will not be kept from its onward
march along the road of reason and right
because one or more nations may not at a
certain time see fit to give co-operative aid
in the great work. But there has been a great
change in American sentiment. I read the
other day in the New York Times some
reminiscences of one of its old correspondenits,
who stated that in an interview the late
President Harding-he was not President at
the time of the interview, but he was on the
election boat-was asked what Se thought of
the League of Nations and what effect it would
have in the elections. Mr. Harding put his
hand on the shoulder of the interviewer and
said, "Friend, the League of Nations is dead."
He made a similar assertion after the election, and I am not sure that a diligent searcher
could not find remarks of the same tenor made
by men very high in the official counsels of
the United States. But the League of Nations
is not dead. The man who made that assertion-fortunately or unfortunately-has passed
away, but the League of Nations still exists,
and' is robust. To-d-ay not only is the great
majority of public sentiment in the United
States of America favourable to the ideals
and the work of the League of Nations, but
officially that country is very much more
favourably inclined towards the League.
I happened to be on the committee which
in 1926 took into consideration the reservations made by the United States, and after
a series of sessions, extending over some ten or
fifteen days, we came to certain conclusions,
recommended the adoption of all the reservations but one, and practically the adoption of
half of that one, and set out a certain method
by which there might be a reconsideration as
to that fractional part of a reservation by
the United States in order that a basis of

APRIL 9, 1930
compromise and settlement might be reached.
Three years ago it so happened that I was
in Geneva and sitting upon a similar convention where the whole matter was discussed.
After a jurists' commission had looked into
the matter, with the assistance of the counsel
of Elihu Root, who pretty well understood
the attitude of official United States, a modus
operandi was agreed upon. That modus
operandi is embodied in the three protocols
which have been signed by President Hoover
and which will, I have no doubt, be adopted
by the Senate of the United States. That
marks a progression that is grateful to us all,
not only to those of us who find that our
past ideals have not been wrong and that in
the march of progress the United States have
come to a reasonable settlement of the difficulty.
I hope that after the end of this year we
shall see two things: one, a World Court
made more permanent and more effective by
the exclusion of deputy judges, and the bringing of the tale of full-fledged judges up to
fifteen. For what reason? Because the work
cf the court demands it, and consequently
full time bas to be given by the fifteen judges
to the preparation and conduct of the judicial
work which, in ever increasing volume, is
coming before them. I hope also to see on
the roll of judges presiding at that great court
a representative officially recognized by the
United States of America, to take the places
se worthily filled by Basset Moore and Charles
Evan Hughes. This is within view, and one
cannot but be very well pleased at suoh a
probable result.
Now, I have pretty well tired myself, and I
have probably sent half of you on the other
side to sleep.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Consequently I am not going to prolong my
remarks. Those that I do not utter are
as good as those that I have uttered; in
fact, I am inclined to the belief that they are
still better, and I am sorry that my abstention
must doom to disappointment an eager and
expectant audience.
I wish in closing to touch two points. First
I desire to draw attention for a moment to
the difference in atmosphere-ehall I call it?
-the difference in atmosphere which surrounds the work of the League of Nations
to-day and that which surrounded it ten
years ago. Then the caution of certain governments impelled them to touch the League
of Nations in its inception, not as an unclean
thing, but as something to be waited for in
a spirit of calm reserve, to see how it would

167

develop in its early youth. France herself
was officially skeptical; Germany was antagonistic to a degree; the United States
treated it officially with contemptuous indifference, refusing even to answer correspondence from it. Amongst its more ardent
defenders were Great Britain, the British
Dominions, Japan, -the small Scandinavian
and middle European States, and the States of
South America, whose ideals are always pitched
high, and who welcomed the appearance of
a world organization for peace with fervour
and zeal. But we did not find any premiers
at the first assembly; we did not find any
foreign minister at the first assembly. We
found delegates of ability, it is true, but the
official atmosphere was rather depressing.
What is the situation to-day? At the
League of Nations to-day we find scores of
foreign ministers, premiers and ex-premiers.
The very best that a nation can give is not
considered too good; and the nation that
sends an inferior delegation must make up
its mind to take a back seat at the League
of Nations Assembly and Council.
W'hat is the situation in Europe? We find
there that the most vexing questions have
been settled. Take the question of reparations, which, from the basis of a forced signature to an illogical and unreasonable instrument-under which were the old war furies
and hates and distrusts-was brought down to
a reasonable basis -to which nations could voluntarily agree. That question carried with it
the old sores of the occupation of German
territory, of military supervision, of administration by foreign methods and foreign parties
upon the soil of the Fatherland. There were
discussions of questions the existence of
which had in them the seeds of continuous
discontent. But now they have been settled.
The attitude of one nation to another is very
different. The atmosphere is full of ozone,
oxygen to the nth degree-all that is necessary
for vitaiity and strength and persistent endeavour.
How about Canada? Canada helped to win
the war, disastrous and unnecessary as that
war appears te have been, so far as necesjl
accomplishment is concerned. Canada héI
to make the peace. Canada was one ofUè
builders of the League of Nations, and 'bt
an inefficient or unintelligent constructor and
mechanic. Canada has stood by the League
loyally, without fee or reward, and she has had
the advantage that comes from that connection.
Is it not clear that it was not alone Canada's part in the war, with all the devotion
and heroism shown by Canadians, and it was
not her part in making the peace-and that

SENATE
was a great and admirable part-that gave to
Canada the place in the family of nations
which has been accorded to ber? Another and
a vital factor bas been ber membership and
co-operation in the League of Nations itself.
It was that which raised to a maximum Canada's acquaintanceship with the nations of
the world, and all over the world, from Liberia
to Japan, from Norway to India, because of
her association in that great international
undertaking, men know Canada in person and
in nationhood as they never else would have
known ber. So Canada owes something to the
League of Nations for the position which she
occupies, and for the recognition and admiration that she receives. She owes to the
League of Nations her opportunity to step up
little by little from the lower flights of municipal and provincial and national politics into
that wider and higher region of international
politics and international life. Her national
life loses nothing thereby; it gains in real
worth and intensity. The higher the atmospbere, the wider the horizon of our publie
men, publicists, thinkers, and the great mass
of our people. That is a boon for which we
are not sufficiently thankful, and for which
we can never be too thankful.
Now, one last word. Canada bas a responsibility. She bas to carry out ber undertaking
in reference to the League of Nations in accordance with its ideals and in consonance
with her professions. And she bas a duty to
perform at home, as well as abroad. What is
that duty? It is, by precept, by example,
by assistance, to spread that information and
cultivate that public sentiment without which,
every one of our statesmen bas declaredand the world knows it-the League of Nations cannot be upheld in permanency and in
strength. By assistance? Yes. By assistance
other than the hundreds of thousands of dollars
which go for the support of the outside work
of the League; by assistance towards cultivating a sentiment of deep conviction and active
sympathy and co-operation with the designs
and ideals of the League. And by precept?
Why, and for how long, are we going to keep
irýpur Estimates an item of $22,000,000 for
wYtraining, if we are honest in saying that
we do not want war and believe that we shall
have no war? Of all dispiriting and demoralizing influences the worst is to be set at work
with no goal before one. I can hire a man and
set him at digging holes for twelve hours,
and then set him filling thern up again; I
can continue that for the time of his natural
life-which will not be very long if be bas any
spirit. Why, then. if we are going to have
no war, do we use our money and our manhood in the production of war paraphernalia,
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

in equipment and exercise, and in the study
of the destructive methods of war? What
war can Canada have? Honest Injin, what
war do we contemplate or are we able to
undertake? And why, as Canada bas given
one great earnest of her policy, ber pride,
and her ideal, in the way in which
she carries on, and bas carried on for one
hundred years, with her neighbour to the
south, should we not transfer abroad to
other parts of the world a policy equal to
that shown to our neighbours south of the
line? Why, and for how long, are we to keep
on increasing our expenditure in this regard?
Has not the time come when we should
commence our own disarmament? I am not
unreasonable, not unduly in haste. But, for
the sake of our own reputation and the cause
that we have at heart, let us make a beginning.
The time is coming when the strong analytical
brains and ingenious minds of our people will
no longer be exercised and their energies
expended on the useless work of digging holes
and fl]ling them up again, or of carrying on
years of research and then, instead of reaching
an accomplished end, marching up a blind
alley and failing to apply what we have at
such cost fitted ourselves to perform. Keep
to what bas been decided as the necessary
basis to ensure national law and order.
Gradually put into operation your precepts
by practical example. Get rid of the waste
of money and the waste of brains and of
nanhood now used in perfecting an art never
to be applied.
There are other lines of
endeavour equally honourable, and far more
useful than the profession of war. The call
to the youth of to-day is to a service nobler
than any warlike service, calling for the
butchery of human beings, and the waste of
productive power, and the destruction of
material wealth. All about us there is a waste
of material, of mentality, of moral and
spiritual fibre. Let us inflame the minds of
our youth with a desire to enter these fields
where no drum beats, where no flag flies
flauntingly to lure them forward, but where
a sense of duty and a high estimate of what
is worth while will be transmuted into the
progress, mental and spiritual, of the country which we all love so well.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, I had intended to offer some
remarks in reference to the notice which bas
been placed on the Order Paper by the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster). It is
usual under the circumstances for the repre-

APRIL 9, 1930
sentative of the Government to close the
debate, but, as there may be other honourable
members who desire to make some remarks in
support of the principles so brilliantly laid
down by our friend, I hesitate to proceed now,
and will postpone what I have to say until
the honourable the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) and others who wish to do
so, have spoken. And, I desire to add, I think
we might well leave for a few days the
remarks of my right honourable friend in order
that they might penetrate the whole length
and breadth of the Dominion of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beloourt, the debate
was adjourned.

PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
REVISION OF STATUTE-RESOLUTION
APPROVAL

OF

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for the adoption of the following resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the protocol for the revision of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, signed at Geneva, in respect
of the Dominion of Canada, on the 14th of
December, 1929, and that this House do approve
of the same.

SENATE

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, 1 understand that my honourable
friend the leader on this side of the House
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby), wbo is absent for tbe
moment, in bis address last nigbt made the
remarks wbich be had intended to apply to
this order and the foilowing one. Therefore
the motion of my bonourable friend the
(Hon. Mr.
Government
leader of the
Dandurand) may proceed, se far as we are
concernied.
The Hon. the ýSPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, before putting this motion I sbould
like to point out that the procecdure that bas
been followed in this case is somewhat peculiar. The motion refers to the approval of
Parliament, but if it is passcd it will express
the approval only of the Senate. I understand
that if the motion is agreed te, the benoiirable leader of the Government in this Chamber (Hon Mr. Dandurand) purposes to make
anotber motion for an addres.ýs to the House
of Commnons, informing that buse of what
has been donc by tbe Senate. I think that tbis
is a formn of procedure that bas been followed
only once before in this House, namely in
1919, and I do not tbink that tbe House was
quite seized of what it was actually doing at
that time. That was in connection with tbe
Versailles Treaty, whcn a resolution was
moved in tbe saine way as tbis bas been, and
notbing furtber was donc concernlng it. My
view of the situation is that, by proceeding
in tbis way, if the motion is agreed te we
saal be doing notbing more than passing a
resolution of approval by tbe Sonate; tbat
would not amount to an approval by Parliament, and, in my opinion, would not really
bc a ratification of tbe treaty. I bave made
this statement because 1 tbink the bonourablo
senators sbould understand what tbey are
doing in the matter.
Hion. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I asic tbe Hon.
the Speaker how we are geing to ratify it?
The Hon. tbe SPEAKER: I think the honourable gentleman wbo moved tbe motion
w'ill reply te tbat question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know te
wbat extent it is proper for a member of tbis
House to go in expre.,sing acquiezacence in an
opinion gix en by lis Henour tbe Speaker.
Generally speaking, I would say tbat a dccision of bis is final and precludes furtber discession; but if it be permissible for me te
say se, I sbould like te state that I entirely
agree witb bim in the opinion be bas cxpresscd.
The ratification of a treaty is a matter fer Parliament, and net merely for one Heuse; tbere
must be joint action by tbe twe Houses. RatiHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

ficatien by the Sonate alene weuld net be a
ratification of a treaty, and in tbe samne way a
ratification by tbe otber House would net be
a ratification. It seems te me that tbe procedure tbat sbould be followed in this instance
is tbat tbis House sbould take wbatever
action bonourable members tbink proper on
tbe question of tbe ratification of this protocol, and tben advise tbe othor Heuse cf
wbat action bas been taken bere. If tbis
ýCbamber appreves of tbe protocel, and if tbe
otbcr Hoiise, after baving bcen adviscd of tbh'
action of tbis Cbamber, takes exactly tbe
samne action, tben tbe protecol xviii be ratificd.
Otberwise it xviii net be.
Hýon. Mr. CASORAIN: Perbaps it is impertinent for a land survayor te talk on a
subject of tbis kind, but in my bumble
opinion we bave a Parliament cemposed of
tbree brancbes: tbe Governer General, the
Sonate and tbe Heuse of Gommons. I bave
always understood tbat nothing was finally
approved until tbe apprevai biad been signified by tbloso tbrec brancbes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, tbc procedure that bas been followod in submîtting these tbree protocois te
tbe Sonate is tbe samne as tbat wbicb ivas
foiiowed in -the sbort session of 1919, wben
tbe Versailles Trcaty Ivas submitted te tbis
Cbamber. The submission wvas made in tbe
very terms of tbe present resolution, and concurrentiy tbe otber House proceeded te deal
witb a similar resolution. On tbe adoption
of tbe resolution by tbis Cbambcr tbere was
ne message sent te tbe otber Huse respecting
tbe action tbat xvas taken bere, nor did the
etber Heuse, wben it approvcd of tbe treaty,
communicate in any way wi'tb tbis Chamber.
I tbink my boneurable friend fromn Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Beiceurt> does net realize tbat tbe
Parliament of Canada is net ratifving tbesc

motion is: "That it is expedient tbat Parliament do approve ...
Yes. If my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
benourahie friend xviii allew me te finishHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Ratification and
approvai bere are synonymous terms.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, they are
net synenymeus ternis. Tbe ratificatien is
effected by an instrument cmanating frem. His
Majesty tbe KCing. In Great Britain treaties
arc net submitted te Parliament. One was

171

APRIL 9, 1930
submitted, the Treaty of Versailles, but it
was expressly declared that that was flot to
be taken as a precedent. The signing of a
treaty is considered to be a ministerial act.
The poliey of the present Governmesit of this
,country has been to su'bmit ail treaties to
Parliament for endorsation. The Government
now cornes to, both buses of Parliament and
asks each for its approval. of the signing of
the protocol. The adoption of this resolution would. fot be even an authorization to
ratify. The motion reads:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the protocol for the revision of the
'Statute of the Permanent Court Mf Internation-al Justice, signed at Geneva, ini respect,
of the Dominion of Canada, on the 14th of
December, 1929, and that this House do approve
of the oame.
Now, if the Senate refused to approve of the
protocol, but the other Huse, by a separate
resolution, did approve, the Government might
welI decide to advise His Maj esty to ratify,
or the Government mnight refrain fromn taking
such action. It is not necessary that approva]
should be given by the two Chambers. That
is why the Government in 1919 simply submittedHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me to ask him a question?
Suýppose both Houses refused to approve,
what then?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If both Houses
refused to approve, then the Government
would be bound by the opinion of the two
Houses. But if there was a differenee of
opinion, if the Senate aipproved and the other
bouse rejected, I should take it for granted
that the Government, which is but the execut-ive of Parliament, and especially of the
other Huse-mn fact, the Government's vory
life depends upon securing the confidence of
the mai ori'ty of the members of the other
House-ivould refrain fromn following the advice of the Senate.
bon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no, no.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Did he
sign the protocol in the name of Canada? If
so, does he hold that the signature affixed by
him in the name of the country is now valid,
or does ho think that an Act of Parliament
is required to ratify it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My answer is
in the negative. An Act of Parliament is
flot neede4 to validate that signature.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Then the signature is valid? It requires no ratification?
Hon. Mr. DANIXJRAND:
Oh, no. It
requires the ratification of His Mai esty the

King, on the acivice of bis Council; but there
is the intervening proceduro, which the Government deems proper, of consulting the two
branohes of Parliament. The British Government does not bind itself to submit ail its
treaties to Parliament for approval. It signs,
and it obtains ratification by the King. As
I have said, there was one great exception, the
Treaty of Versailles, but it was stated that
that shouId not be taken as a preced'ent.
At ail events, thore is now just a question
of procechire. I bave presented this resolution
for approval by the Senate. The bouse of
Cominons bas on its Order Paper a sirnilar
resolution to be approvecd by that bouse.
"Parliament" is not the Parliament composed
of the three powers that my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) bas mentioned, but is
simpiy the Houses of Parliament, which are
asked to give their adiherence to the procedure
taken and to the signature given. Now the
question arises: Shall we send a message to
the House of Commons? My own opinion
was that it was flot nocessary, because the

this is so, ratification is a privilege of the
Crown; and if it is a privilege of the Crown,
then we can only say that we concur in the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend would have no objection, I suppose,
to this part of the resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do approve of the protocol for the revision of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, signed at Geneva in respect of
the Dominion of Canada.
If you approve of the signature it is an approval of the protocol.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I still maintain
that the position I have taken is the correct
one. What is the motion? It is that Parliament do approve. I submit that Parliament
can approve only by a joint act of the two
Houses.
Parliament is composed of two
Houses, and certainly one House cannot give
the approval of Parliament. If, as was suggested by the honourable member from Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke), one House were to
vote for approval, and the other against if,
the result would be the very reverse of approval. To me that is as plain as the nose
on one's face. The two Houses must be parlon. Mr. DANDURAND.

approval; and it is proper practice and procedure for this House to let the other House
know that we have approved.

all the authorities say that once His Majesty
lias given approval to a treaty, that is final.
So all of this talk is of no use.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Practice, Thirteenth
May's Parliamentary
Edition, page 607:
Communications are aiso made to both Houses
by mem'bers of the royal family, which are
either delivered by members in their places,
or conveyed to the House by letters addressed
to the Speaker.
Such being the direct and formai communications between the Crown and Parliament, it
may be added that the presence of ministere
in both Houses maintains the closest relations
of the Crown with the legislature. The representation of every department of the state in
Parliament, and the principles of ministerial
responsibility, long since established in our constitution, bring the executive government and
the legislature into uninterrupted intercourse
and combined action. Where no formai communication between the Crown and Parliament
is technically required, the introduction of a
measure by his Majesty's ministers attests the
royal approval.
So when a minister in this Chanber or the
other moves a resolution there is an implied
authority which allows him to speak with the
consent of His Majesty.

That is one of

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That has nothing
to do with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That does not
answer the point raised by my honourable
friend, but I am coming to that.
The practice that has been followed in recent
years. in order to obtain parliamentary approval of treaties, is to present the treaty before the two Houses of Parliament after signature, but before ratification, and to obtain
resolutions from both Houses recording the
approval of P.arliament.
The forn used indicates an approval by Parliament. It is as follows:
''That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the
treaty signed at
on the
of
which was signed on behalf of Canada by the
Canadian representative acting under fuH
powers issued by His Majesty:
"And that this House do approve of the
same."
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: What is my honourable friend reading from?

APRIL 9, 1930
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A memorandum
received from the legal adviser of the Department of External Affairs. I give it only
for what it is worth in logic.
It bas been suggested that this procedure is
not parliamentary approval, but simply approval by two cf the Houses of Parliament
without the concurrence of the Governor General or Crown.
The object of the procedure is to enable the
two Houses of Parliament to supervise and
control the exercise of the treaty-making power
by the Crown. In a strict sense it is not
parliamentary approval that is required, but
approval by two parts of Parliament ta the
action of the third part.
It would not be proper to adopt any form of
procedure that involved the approval by the
Crown, because the Crown cannot be expected
Further, it
te approve of its own action.
would not be desirable that the Governor
General as such should approve, because it
would be improper for the Governor General
ta express approval of action by the Crown.
It might be suggested that the word "Parliament" should be omitted from the resolution,
and that instead should be substituted some
other phrase, such as "the Senate and House
of Commons"; or, "both Houses of Parliament."
It is submitted that this change is net necessary.
The word "Parliament" is uµed in two senses:
(1) In the striét and technical sense, as defined by the British North America Act, Parliament means the King, Senate and House of
Commons. (2) The word "Parliament" has in
common usage another meaning, when parlamentary action or parliamentary control or
supervision by Parliament is concerned. Common usage justifies such phraseology when it
refers ta control or supervision by one or both
Houses of Parliament over the executive. Consequently, it is quite proper ta speak, in Great
Britain, of parliamentary supervision over the
Government, or cof the British system as a system of parliamentary government: or ta refer
ta the responsibility of the executive ta Parliament, or the control of the executive by
Parliament. Therefore, common usage would
justify the use of the terni "that Parliament
do approve," when the approval is of an act of
the Crown and where the approval is expressed
by one or both of the Houses of Parliament,
without any express action by the Crown itself.
Apart from common usage, there is a series
of precedents in Canadian parliamentary practice extending from 1871 ta date. Resolutions
of the House referring ta control or supervision by Parliament have been construed and
acted upon as meaning control or supervision
by the two Houses of Parliament without joinder of action by the Crown.
The 1923 precedent is anomalous and could
nat be followed to-day, as it is inconsistent witb
the present day practice relating ta ohannels ôf
communication between this Government and
the Crown. It might not have been objection.
able in 1923 ta accept a resdlution requiring
transmission of parliamentary resolutions by the
Governor GeneTral to the King: to-day it would
not fit in with the present machinery. Further,
it may be suggested with deference that the
question of transmission of advice ta the Crown
in relation te ratification is a purely executive
function, and that transmission of the resolution itself by the direction of the Houses of

17b

Parliament would not be in accord with modern

is submission of advice to His Majesty by His
Canadian Ministers ta the effect that His
Majesty should ratify the treaty. The advice
might or might net, in the discretion of the
Ministers, acquaint His Majesty with the fact
ai parliamentary approval, but it would be unfortunate ta establish precedents controlling the
manner of, or nature of advice ta be tendered
in relation ta the ratificaition of treaties.
I have no objection to modifying the two
resolutions that are before us by striking out
the word "Parliament" and inserting the words
"the Senate" and I would ask His Honour
the Speaker if that would conform to what
he believes ta be the proper form to be
adopted.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am asking His

Honour the Speaker.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

That would be

a better form.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I conferred with
His Honour the Speaker more than once in
regard ta this matter, but I hesitated to accept his advice because the resolution approv-

ing of the Optional Clause, and containing the
word "Parliament," had already been adopted

in this House; and the notices that are on
the Order Paper of the House of Commons
make use of the word "Parliament." I thought
that inasmuch as the notices regarding the
three protocols now being passed by this
Chamber, and ta be moved in the other
Chamber, make use of the word "Parliament,"
we might pass them in that form and at the

same time register our reservation as to the
procedure to be followed in future. I see the
force of the statement by His Honour the
Speaker, that, since this is a resolution of
the Senate, which is ta be transmitted te the
other House simply for its information
and not with a request for its approval, we

should substitute the word "Senate" for "Parliament." But my difficulty is that a resolutien bas already been passed by this Chamber
in the ternms of the two which are under con-

sideration now.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I make a suggestion to the honourable leader of the GovIf he hesitates to change the
ernment?
wprding of the resolution to such an extent

that it might not appear to express the approval of Parlament, then perhaps the wording
could be changed to read:
Resolved that the Senate believes that Parliament should approve. .
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no, no.

174

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If that were done,
it would be possible to get an expression of
the Senate's approval. That is all that can
be obtained.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I un-derstand that
wording to imply subservience to the other
House.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Not at all. The
only thing we can express here is the opinion
that Parliament should approve, and the only
approval we can give is the approval of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: In what particular
language? Will my honourable friend explain
that?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In the language
that I have just used. The Senate can do no
more than what I suggest there.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: In what language?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: "The Senate expresses the opinion that Parliament should
ratify-"
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is not what
the honourable gentleman said before; he
said "believes" before.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The resolution
states, "that Parliament do approve." As my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) bas pointed out, it would be necessary to have the resolution voted upon by
both Houses in order to obtain the approval
of Parliament. It is quite evident that there
is no intention to have both Houses express
approval.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, yes there
is. The other House is moving on the same
lines.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But that is not
the way to secure the approval of Parliament.
That is the way to get an expression of opinion from each House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From the two
Houses of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, an expression of
opinion separately by each House; but that
does net mean the approval of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable senators, it would seem that we have been playing a sort of foolish game. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) tells us that
the approval of Parliament is not at all necessary. Then, why has it been asked? Why has
the matter been discussed? I do net think
that that is a fair position to take in this
House, or that it would be fair in the other
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

House.

The approval of this Chamber is
either necessary or it is not. If it is not
necessary, this motion should not have been

made. I think my honourable friend is wrong
when he says that it is net necessary to have
the approval of this House. Strictly speaking,
that may be true, but according to practiceHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
According to
the policy of the Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: According to the
universal practice, not only in this House,
but, I think, in the Imperial Houses as well,
it would be necessary to have approval. However, my honourable friend completely removes the objection which I raised, if he
confines his motion to the action of the
Senate, and says so in so many words. My
objection was that the motion asked for the
approval of Parliament. Now, if it is only
the approval of the Senate that is to be expressed, however perfunctory it may be, and
if the Senate alone is made to act in the
matter-that is, if the word "Senate" is substituted for the word "Parliament"-my ob-

jection will no longer hold.

But I must

express my view that it is a rather extra-

ordinary thing that we should be asked to
approve of this, and then at the last moment
be told that our approval was not necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not knov
who made the statement to which my honourable friend is referring, that it was net
necessary to have the approval of this House;
but I have told my honourable friend that
it is the policy of the Government to submit
all treaties to both Houses of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But my honourable friend distinctly told us that our approval
was unnecessary, because the Crown alone has
the power to ratify or net to ratify.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The only thing
that the honourable leader wants is the moral
approval of this House; nothing else.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The moral
approval will become formal by the passing
of the resolution.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: It has been suggested
that if the other House approved of the
protocol and the Senate refused to concur,
it would be open to the Government to go,
even to the length of advising His Majesty
to assent to the ratification of the treaty.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend let me say that it would be equally
truc if both Houses refused, according to
the honourable gentleman's (Hon. Mr. Dandurand's) interpretation.

APRIL 9, 1930
Hon. Mr. BELAND: 1 arn surprised at
the stage we have reaehed in the development
of the Constitution of this country. I had
understood that beyond the voting of supplies
to His Majesty, any matter of publie interest in this country in wbich the Government
was concerned had to, be approved by both
Houses. I should like to be shown where it
is stated in the Constitution-not in the English Constitution, for that is not written, but
in the Canadiasi Constitution-that a treaty
of 'peace may be assented to by Bis Mai esty's
representative in Canada without the concurrence of both Bouses of Parliarnent.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot intend
to go îarther in the expression of opinion on
theory, beyond what we have before us. The
Government is submitting a similar resolution
to each Bouse of Parliament separately, for
the approval. by each Bouse of the signature to
these three protocols, and will be governed by
the treatment these resolutions receive. I do
not know what would be the action of the
Government in the event of some things
happening which have been suggested. I have
given my personal view as te the discretion of
the Government if there should be a divergence
of opinion between the two Bouses on such a
resolutionHon. Mr. BELCOURT: If both Bouses
refused to approve, what then?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then that puts
the thing at the discretion of the Government.
Bon. Mr. BELAND: Then you place this
Chamber in a condition of inferiority?
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Well, I cannot

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: if the honourable rnember will allow me, I would say that I arn under

under that
That is the

Bon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is the British
practice. -Now, I would side very strongly
with my honourable friend from Lauzon (Bon.
Mr. Beland> in this respect, that if that theory
is not well founded, then the consent of
Parliarnent would be necessary, and there

would have to be the consent of both Bouses.
I doubt very much that it would be proper for
the Crown, acting on the advice of the Cabinet,
to disregard one branch of Parliarnent.
Bon. Mr. BELAND: May I submit a concrete case? Let us suppose that both Bouses
refused to approve the protocol. According to
the declarations we have heard frorn the
bonourable leader of the Government (Bon.
Mr. Dandurand), it would be comnpetent for
the Government to advise Bis Majesty to
assent to the ratification. Suppose further that
to-day the ýGovernment advised Bis Majesty
to approve of the treaty; that to-rnorrow there
should be a motion by a iMinister to go into
Committee of Suppily, and that a member of
the other Bouse should move in amendment
that the Gov-ernment was wrong in advising
Bis Majesty to approve of the treaty. If that
amendment were supported by a mai ority in
the other flouse, would Bis Majesty ratify
the treaty then?
Bon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Government
woukl go out cf office, and that is ail there
would be te it. A Government that could
not get a treaty ratified would have lost the
confidence of Parlýiament and would have to
give way te another Government.
Bon. Mr. BELAND: I askeci the honourable leader cf the Governent what would
happen.
Bon. Mr. WI7LLOUGBBY: The honourable leader lias already signed on behaif cf
Canada?
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Bon. Mr. WILLOUGBBY: I think that
ail this Bouse can do is to approve of that
action. The Crown doca the rest.
Right Bon. G. P. GRABAM: Bonourable semators, I think we have been discussing
something that is in the air and nowhere near
at hand. We have been conjecturing what
miglit happen if something else happened.
There -have been suggestions of what would
take place if one Bouse approved and the
other Bouse did not, or if both did or did
not approve cf the protocol. These tbings
migli be deait with when we corne to them, if
we ever do. In my opinion, we are discussing
a hypothetical case-a situation that lias not
arisen and may net arise.
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is the wording
cf the motion that bias brought about the discuasion.
Bon. Mr. BEIQUE: You are setting a
precedent.

176

SENATE

Rig-ht Hon. Mr.,GRAHAM: For years we
had nothing but secret treaties made by the
Government, without any authority from Parliament to sign, and without any ratification.
1 think that, with the approval of everybody
in this country, the Prime Minister announced
a few years ago that any treaty made by
Canada would be submitted by the Goverament f0 both flouses. That is the procedure
that bas been followed~ in this case. Now,
the Government, or any member cf the
Goverement, would not likely have signed the
treaty unloss if was considered highly probable that the treaty wouid be approved by
Parliament. We are Iooking for trouble that
is nof even in the offlng. Let me get into the
realm of imagination, foc. My honourablo
friend (Hon. Mr. Boland) gave us a hypothetical case. Well, if 1 were fAhe Prime Minister
and one cf my ministers haci signed a treaty
which was rejectod by Parliamont, I would
appeai te the country and~ ask the people
what they thougbt about if. Under our
system tbere is a quick way cf dealing with
such a situation. In the United States the
Government stays in power until a dellnite
period expires, whot-her ifs actions meef wîth
the approval cf the people or not. I repeat
that if I were Prime Minister and a treaty
wero rejecfed by Parliament, I would appeal
to fhe people cf the count.ry and, ask fhom
wbethor or not the Governmnent acted rightly.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: So far as I amn concorned, I arn quit o prepared f0 withdraw the
objection I made, in view cf the amendment proposod by the honourabie leader.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I amn nef proposing an amendmenf.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, you are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

would be the better practice. fis Honour the

by the other flouse, but ýthere was ne message
from one Cha.mber te the ether in either case.

SPEAKER OF THE SENATE
Hon. A. C. HARDY, having taken the
Clerk's chair, rose and said: Honourable members, I have the honour to inform you that
a Commission bas been issued under the Great
Seal, appointing me Speaker of the Senate.
The said Commission was then read by the
Clerk.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

The Honourable the Speaker then took the
Chair at the foot of the Throne, to which he
was conducted by Hon. Messieurs Belcourt
and Willoughby.
Prayers.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Your Honour,
your colleagues offer you their congratulations
upon your elevation to the speakership o?
this honourable House, and their very best
wishes as well. We all hope that you will
enjoy the exercise of your high function, and
we assure you that you may always count
on our loyal assistance and co-operation for
the maintenance of the honour, dignity, and
integrity of this honourable House.
The office of Speaker of the Senate is one
which has always been very highly regarded
and much coveted. By rule and practice the
appointment is one which belongs to the
Government and is not, like the Speakership
of the House of Commons, left to the suffrages
of the members. In your case it must be
especially gratifving, since your appointment
was based on the selection of your Senate
colleagues. In the name of all I extend to
you our hearty congratulations and cordial
good wishes.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
members, I rise to voice my entire concurrence,
and, I an sure, that of every honourable
member of this side of the House, in the
felicitations that have been so happily expressed towards His Honour the Speaker.
Your Honour, you are not as old a member
of this House as some of us-and in that you
are fortunate-but you have been a member
of this Chamber long enough to appreciate
our mode of doing things, and I know that you
have always been a highly interested participant in the work that has made a particular
appeal to you. I am sure that you will have
the support of every member on this side of
the House in your high office. Fortunately
we are a body that is very easy to control.
We do not try to find fault with the Chair.
We had nothing but commendation for everything that the late Speaker did. I am sure
that Your Honour's tenure of the office will be
one of profit to the House and of pleasure to
yourself.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, very briefly I wish to thank the
honourable leaders on both sides of the House
for their kind words, and particularly for their
promise of co-operation. Perhaps it is not my
place to say anything in reply, but I do wish
to make one statement. As I think all honour-

able members know, I have taken this Chair
under a personai physicai handicap, and if
I arn ta give satisfaction ta the Sexiste it can
oxily be with your assistance and, I may say,
with your indulgence; and I crave that indulgence now. I would flot have ventured to inpose myseif on. this Chamber had I not known,
what is common knowiedge, that the session
is iikely ta came ta an end in the near future,
probably withixi a very few weeks. That is
my excuse. Otherwise I would not have piaced
myscif ini a position where it would be necessary ta ask for your indulgence. I have been,
of course, as ahl honourable senators are, attached ta anc side of this Chamber, but I can
assure honourable memibers, and especiaily
those ta, my left, that during the time I have
the honour ta occupy this Chair I shail not
know sides, I shall not know any division or
line in this House; and I hope ta co-operate
in every way with ail honourabie senators.
SUSPENSION 0F RULES
Hon. Mr. BEIJOU1RT, with leave of the
Senate, moved:
That from and inclusive of to-day uxitil the
end of the Session Ruies 23 (f), 24 (a), (b),
(d), (e) andI (h), 63, 119, 129, 130 and 131 be
su&pended.
He said: Honourable members, bef are this
motion is put, I should like ta say that I have
communicated it ta my honourabie friend the
leader on the other side of this Hanse, and I
amn making the motion with his consent. By
way of explanation may I say that because of
the desire ta proceed with the work on hand as
speedily as possible, in view of the probability
of an early termination of the session, it has
been found advisable to suspend these miles,
which have reference ta deiays between different rcadings of bis, for posting af notices,
and s0 on. 1 may add that a similar motion
has been adopted in another place.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E.
What is the generni effect?

FOSTER:

Hon. Mr. BELCOIIRT: The gencrai effeet
is ta do away with certain deinys between
readings; for instance the deiay for posting, or
the dclay after petitians have been considered
by the Committee an Standing Orders. Saimetimes, I think, under the miles, a whole week
must clapse after the Standing Committee has
reported on the petition, before a Bill can be
presented.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Would it permit the three readings and the
passage of a Bill at one sitting?

X*

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT Yes. I quite understand that there may be Borne occasions when
it may flot be convenient or desirable that
some of these miles should be suspended, and
I arn quite sure that ini cases of thaýt kind we
shall be able to agree upon the question
whether the ruies should 1,e followed.
The motion was agreed ta.
EXPORT 0F LIQUOR FROM GREAT
BRITAIN TO UNITED STATES
INQUIRY

Hon. R. H. POPE inquired of the Goverument:
1. Does a ship's nianuifest, sailing fromn Great
Britain to a United States port and carrying
intoxicating liquors, show an entry of such
on the manifest?
2. Is there any prohilbition by Great Britain
on the shipment of alchoic liquore into the
United States?
Hon. Mr. BELCOUERT: I have these
answers from the Department of Externai
Affairs:
.The reply from London io to the effect that,
in regard ta the second question, the position
is that there is no prohibition on the exportation of intoxicating liquor from Great Britain,
but that xin practice intoxicating liquor is neyer
exported ta the United States. lIn regard ta the
first question, it is atated that the practice of
ship owxiers ie to enter in the ship's manifest
particulare of ail cargo carried. The manifest
carried on au outward bound ýhip ie not, however, an official document and the Customs iaw
doce not prescribe the particulare ta be sho'wn
thereixi, but in view of the fact that, as stated

above, intoxicating liquor is not in practice
exported ta the United States, the question of
manifest is not consi*dered ta be of material
importance.

TRIBUTES TO DECEASED SENATORS
THE LATE

HON. MESSRS. DESSAULLES
BOSTOCK

AND

Hon. N. A. BFLCOURT (translation): Since
our recent adjou.rnment death has claimed
from the Senate, where it so often performs its
sad function, two distinguished victims.
Hon. Mr. Dessaudles had an exceptionally
long life, having attained the marveollus age
of 102 years and some months; and it was a
life remarkally well filled. For ten years alderman and twenty-four years mayor of his
native city, always elected by acclamation; for
four years representative of his constituency in
the Legislative Assembly, and for twenty-four
years a senator, Hon. Mr. Dessaulles devoted
nearly sixty-three years of his life to the service of his fellow citizens and his country. In
the course of his brilliant and fruitful career
he witnessed the political development of the
Dominion at all stages, from its inception to
its present state of full expansion, and towards
its steady social, economic and national advancement he always contributed to the
utmost of his ability. The public confidence
and esteem which he earned while still a
young man he succeeded in retaining by constant devotion and unfailing dignity.
Four generations have been aided by his
counsel and splendid example. He was the
friend of all the political leaders from the time
of Papineau to the present day, and was intimate with most of them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Throughout his life he went about doing
good, quietly and without ostentation. Now
that he is dead, it may well be said of him
that he has merited in an eminent degree the
title of "vir probus." His name and his fame
will endure, and will often be cited as an
example for future generations.
We ask the family of our late distinguished
colleague to accept the tribute of our ardent
admiration for him, and to them we tender
the expression of our most profound symnathy.
(Text) The Ester holiday of the session of
1930 will be long and painfudly re'membered,
because of the passing from our midst of our
venerable and distinguished centenarian dean
and of the admirable and universally esteemed
Speaker of our Senate.
In the case of the Hon. Mr. Dessaulles, our
grief is somewhat mitigated because of the
marvellous age at which he had arrived. In
the sudden and wholly unexpected demise of
the Hon. Mr. Bostock we are profoundly
shocked and grieved. Only a month ago he
was here with us, apparently in good health,
performing with that very dignified and courteous manner the functions of his high office.
Those of us who were present during the last
hour which preceded the Easter adjournment
will remember the ability, impartiality and
firmness with which he maintained the application of our rules of procedure.
His loss is a great one to the Senate, nay,
to Canada. Our late Speaker furnished a

with the work of the Senate. I have known of
Speakers-I will not say here in Ottawa-who
have seemed to take pride in checking up the
little slips made by new members. If it ever
became necessary for the late Speaker to
correct a member, he did it not in a tone of
reproof, but rather by way of gentle reminder.
I saw our late Speaker even later than did the
honourable gentleman who has just spoken. It
was necessary that I should remain here four
or five days after the House adjourned, and
I had the privilege of attending the reception
given by Senator Bostock to the English public
school head masters who visited this country.
He was looking then just as we had always
been accustomed to see him. He did me the
honour of introducing me to the leader and
some other members of that delegation. All
the members of this House, and their wives
and friends, have been on innumerable
occasions the recipients of the kindly hospitality of Senator Bostock and his family.
He will be greatly missed, and his successor in
office will find it difficult indeed to surpass him
in the performance of his duties.
I was astonished when a gentleman in my
own city, who had known the late Senator
Bostock in the early days, when he first went
to British Columbia, informed me that he
had always had the idea that the Senator
was subject to such an illness as that which
carried him off. I never suspected, and I do
not know that any other member of this
House did, that he was suffering from any
malady that would shorten his life. His
sudden death came as a tremendous shock
to us all. Fortunately, more than one gentleman on this side of the House was able to
attend his funeral, and I am sure that it
would be interesting to hear from any of those
honourable members.
Hon. S. J. CROWE: Honourable members,
I had the honour of being one of the representatives of this House at the funeral of
the late Speaker. The funeral was largely
attended by people from all over his province, especially from the riding which he
represented. Men drove from one hundred to
one hundred and fifty miles to attend the
services. The funeral of our late Speaker
was one of the most unique funerals I have
ever attended, and if the Senate will bear
with me for a few moments I will endeavour
to describe it.
The service was held in a little chapel on
a bluff just above the railway station at
Monte Creek-a chapel which was built by
the late Senator in memory of his son who
was killed overseas. The service, which was
most impressive, was conducted by the curate,
and the Bishop of Kootenay came a long
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

distance to be present. After the service at
the chapel, the body was placed on a farm
wagon and escorted to its last resting place
by men who had been in the ernploy of the
late Senator on his ranch. The casket was
covered with the flag of his country, the
Union Jack. The wagon was hauled by a
pair of old horses which had been great
favourites of his, to a plateau surrounded by
pine trees, high above his recent home, and
there, in his own land, he was buried. It
was apple blossom time, and the trees were all
in bloom, and after the service at the graveside was over, Mrs. Bostock and her daughter
covered the casket with blossoms from a large
basket. It was a very touching scene, one
which I shall never forget, to see the wife
of this gentleman, with whom she had lived
so many years, placing these apple blossoms
on his casket.
There were five Senators present, two from
Alberta and three from British Columbia.
After the burial we were invited to have tea
at the home of Mrs. Bostock, and to meet
her there. When we had expressed our sincere
sympathy in her great loss, Mrs. Bostock
very touchingly asked us to convey her thanks
to the Senate, and to the Senators, who had
sent wires of condolence and letters of
sympathy, and to express her appreciation of
the many kindnesses that she and her husband
had experienced at the hands of the members
of this House. After we had our tea, Mrs.
Bostock's daughter shook hands with every
person who had entered the house. I heard
it stated by more than one that the late
Senator was a perfect English gentleman-as
high a compliment, I think, as could be paid
to any man.
Hon. E. MICHENER: Honourable members, as one of the members of this House
who lived near enough to the country home
of the late Speaker to be present on the sad
occasion referred to, I with the honourable
Senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
was privileged to represent the Province of
Alberta. The leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) has expressed the sentiments
of love, respect and confidence which we all
felt, and the leader on this side of the House
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has emphasized the
fact that few men have such qualities of
heart and mind as were possessed by the late
Speaker-qualities which commanded the respect and confidence of all, irrespective of
creed, party or class.
He was evidently a true lover of nature. His
comfortable ranch home stood beside a beautiful stream, sequestered in the mountains,
where he could enjoy the silences and the
grandeur of the natural surroundings. The

MAY 13, 1930o
bome itself was characteristic of the late
Speaker. He lived there, by a beautiful billside, among bis gardens and the flocks that
roamned the ranch. That is the place he loved,
and that is wbere be died.
The bonourable gentleman from. Burrard
(Hon. Mr. Crowe) bas described some details
of the funeral, wbich indeed was very impressive. It was grand in its simplicity: the
littie cburcb on the bill, the simple service, the
flag of the Empire covering the casket, over
wbicb were strewn brancbes of cherry and
apple bloom, the banlis of flowers sent from
f ar and near, and the cortege to the burial
ground on the bilîside of tbe late Speaker's
farm. The body was borne by labourers on bis
ranch. The love, sorrow and sympathy expressed by aIl classes formed a trihute such as
is rarely paid to the memory of any man.
Ahl seemed to mourn the passing of tbe f ormn
that would neyer again travel those slopes,
the voice that would neyer again be beard in
that beautiful setting. The body lies near a
cluster of pines overlooking the old farmbouse,
surrounded by f ootbills and the larger bilîs
in the distance, a fitting resting place for him
who was our late Speaker.
I said te bis belpmate ini life, "The
Senate to me will not be just the same witbout the Hon. Mr. Bostock as its Speaker." He

that great change; be bas passed tbrougb that

he was laid in the grave. As the bonourable
leader of the Senate said a few moments ago,
the family of Mr. Dessaulles was among the
most distinguished in the Province of Quebec.
He was the nephew of one of the giants of
our history; of a man who has left in Canadian annals an indelible mark; of a man whose
ideas and principles I amn far from sharing,
but whose career has left a himinous trail in
the parliamentary annals of Canada,--Louis
Joseph Papineau, the great tribune of one of
our saddest and most dramatic periods.
Mr. Dessaulles was the nephew of this great
tribune of the people. The honourable leader
of the Senate, a few moments ago, sketched
in an eloquent manner the different phases of
bis career: first, member of the Municipal
Council of the city of St. Hyacinthe for many
ycars, then for twenty-four years, I tbink,
mayor of bis native town, afterwards member
of the Legislative Assembly of the Province
of Quebcc, and finally for twenty-five years
member of this Chamber.
Mr. Dessaulles, apart from bis family relations, had a remarkable personality, wbich
won the esteem and admiration of all who
came in contact with him. He was a representative of that old school which we bad in
the Province of Quebec, now unfortunately
tending to disappear, but of wbich we stîill
possess, thank God, some splendid examples-of that old political school, disinterested and
patriotie, devoting itself te the public weal;
and as we contemplate the career of our honourable colleague, covering a whole century
and extending to the venerable age of 102
years, we mourn at tbis tomb that bas just
been closed.
Honourable members, it is not my desire to
pronounce over this tomb a funeral oration.
I wisbed simply to cail tbe attention of tbis
Chamber to the eminent qualities tbat distinguishcd the noble personality of Mr. Dessaulles. He bas been in tbe full sense of the
word a great citizen, a great patriot, a parliamentarian worthy of the respect of al] his
colleagues. His death bas caused universal
regret. The most sympatbetic and most sincere tributes bave been paid to bis memory.
It is in fulfilment of a special duty tbat in
the name of tbe senators fromn the Province
of Quebec I place upon bis grave tbe tribute
of our respect and our admiration.

Hon. THOMAS CHAPAIS (translation):
Witb the leave of my honourable colleagues
I would add a few words to tbe tributes tbat
bave just been paid tbe two bonourable members of the Senate wbo bave passed away
since our last adj ournmen.t.
During the few years I sat ini the Senate
wîtb Hon. Mr. Bostock I learned to respect
and admire him i a very apecial manner.
Mr. Bostock represented among us the best
British parliainentary traditions. As a citizen
and public man be was above reproacb.
May I also. in my turn, express the sorrow
hat we ail feit at the death of Hon. Senator
Dessaulles. His fine personality I regarded
with real veneration, and I am happy to associate myself with my bonourable colleagues
in this Chamber in laying upon. bis grave tbe
flowers of remembrance and regret.

VEHICULAR TRAFFIC BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of Bill 21, an Act to provide
for the regulation of Vehicular Traffic on
Dominion property.
He said:
Honourable members, I might
explain that in 1928, I think, the Government passed Orders in Council regulating
traffic on Dominion property. There was a
good deal of complaint. It was found that
while it could pass Orders in Council and
regulations, there was no way to enforce these.
So a Bill bas been brought in to give the
Government certain authority to handle the
traffic on Dominion property. The Bill provides only for that, and therefore I am asking
that the Bill be referred to Committee of the
Whole and put through to-night.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
No; and there
was no way of imiposing a penalty. Anyone
who broke the regulations could not be
brought before a court.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I think this Bill is
a very good one. As I understand it now,
the matter will be placed in the hands of the
Governor in Council; that is, the Government
will make regulations and will have the power
to enforce them, which they have not now.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They will be able to
prescribe penalties.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I hope that when the
regulations are made people who bring cars
up on the Hill here will not be divided into
two classes, as they are at present. That is
to say, the common man is required to park
his car in a space that is allotted for parking,
but a Cabinet Minister can park his car in
front of the steps that lead up to the Senate.
I am at a loss to understand why a member of
the Covernment, who drives a publicly owned
car, should disregard the regulations at the
presant time. i should think a Cabinet
Minister should be a light before al the world
and an example for everyone. But the practice
right along has been that cars occupied and
used by Cabinet Ministers are parked in front
of the steps leading up to the Senate Chamber.
I have seen a row of seven, eight or nine of
them there myself. If I bring up my car I
am told by a policeman to take it to the
parking space. If Cabinet Ministers want to
park their cars in front of the building, let
them take them over to the entrance to the
House of Commons. I hope that when these
regulations are made there will be no distinction drawn as there is now, and that Cabinet
Ministers will be placed on a level with
ordinary men who own cars, and we shall all
be treated alike.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They had not

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: You have parked in

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I might perhaps
add this exiplanation, that the difficulty was
that, although the Governor in Council had
power to pass the regulations, there was really
no sanction.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think the
measure is a good one, and that every member of this House will agree that some regulatien is needed to control the traffic. The
Government is empowered under this Bill to
appoint officers to see that the regulations are
carried out, and power will also be given to
enforce the regulations.

MAY 13, 1930
Hon. Mr. BELAND: In this connection 1
might say that sometimes a disagreeable situation develops. On days when the .Senate is
flot sitting-f or example, on Saturday afternoon-a member of this Hîouse may drive his
car up on the Hill and leave it, away from
the ordinary route of traffic, in front of the
building. just for the purpose of going inside
and getting his mail from the Post Office. This
takes a matter of from f orty to sixty seconds.
The constable in charge will not permit this;
bie says that hie has instructions to forbid parking of cars in front of the building. An instance of this kind happened to me, and any
explanation on my part was useless. I disregarded the constable's orders, went inside to
get my mail, and proceeded away when I
found that I had a registered letter-but without mnoney. I came back later and left my car
at the samne place, entirely clear of the ordinary
route of traffic. It was near the entrance to
the basement, where it could not cause any
annoyance whatever to anyone. I went
into the building. When 1 came out,
the constable threatened me with ail kinds
of dire punishment if I repeated the deed.
I remarked to him that that was flot parking;
that any regimlation should be intelligently
interpreted and carried out, and that some discretion was required on the part of the officer
in charge. He said hie could not permit it
any longer, or at any other time. So now a
Senator who is a little older than I am, and
who may have some difficulty in waling, if hie
drives bis own car and stops to get bis mail,
will have to park, not in front, where the Ministers' cars are parked, but on the east side,
and hie will have to walk ail the way to the
Post Office and back again to, bis car. This
is, of course, a very trifling matter, but it
seems to me that some intelligence should be
displayed by the constables who have to carry
out the regulations.
The motion was agreed to, a.nd the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Graham, the
Senate went into Committee on tbe Bill.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the chair.
The Bill was reported witbout amendment.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved tbe
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 35, an Act to amend the Insurance Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is it
about?
Hon. Mr. BELCO URT:- This Bill adds new
paragraphs to section 120 and section 126 of
the Insurance Act. As honourable members
are aware, insurance companies from time to
time have to deposit with the Receiver General
securities as guarantee for the due fulfilment of
their contracts of insurance. Sometimes these
companies are liquidated, cither voluntarily
or under the Winding Up Act, and in several
instances the liquidator bas been prevented
from getting possession uf tbe securities in
order to, realize upon them in the liquidation
proceedings. Honourable members will see
how difficult it is to liquidate unless the
liquidator is in possession of these as well as
the other assets of the company, and one of
the obj ects of the Bill is to enable him, on
application to the court, to get these securities
for liquidation purposes.
Section 126 of the Act is intended to limait
the distribution of assets by way of dividends
during the early years of a company's
existence, and in the case of companies wbîch
have a large capital it bas been found that
this provision is somewbat emnbarrassîng. The
purpose is to release these comnpanies fromn the
provisions of that section.
Tbe other sections of the Bill are consequential upon those amendments. 1 do not
insist upon our going into the Bill this evenîng,
but shaîl simply move the second reading.
The motion was agreed Vo, and the Bill was
read the second time.

POSTPONED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the
Right Honourable Sir George Foster:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
to the progress and present position of the
League of Nations Society and the participation and standing of Canad-a therein.-Honoarable Senator Belcourt.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable mcmbers, 1 have prepared some observations upon
this subject since the debate was adjourned,
but I do not know whether 1 should take up
the time of the House in making a speech,
because there may not be much time for
anything but the strict business of the House.

SENATE

Some other members may wish to speak on
the subject, and I would ask that this Order
be postponed so that it may be taken up tomorrow or some other day.
Hon. Mr. BELAND:

Thursday.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We will leave it
on the Order Paper, and if the opportunity
arises I shall make my observations. It may
be that when the Estimates are taken up
again in the other House there will be ample
time to discuss a subject of this sort. I repeat
that I have gone to some little trouble in
the matter and should like to make my speech,
but shall only do so if it will not interfere
with the real business of the House.
The Order stands.

PATENT BILLS
SAVING

CLAUSE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE presented the Report of
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill B, an Act respecting a
certain patent of the R. M. Hollingshead
Company.
He said: Honourable members, every session
we have a number of Bills to empower the
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Commissioner of Patents to revive applications, some of which have been forfeited for
as long as two or three years. This particular
case goes back to 1927. The Committee has
deemed it advisable to adopt a standard saving
clause to be inserted in all Bills of this kind.
It is intended to protect, in reasonable measure,
the public or manufacturers who have commenced to manufacture when an application
bas been forfeited. The clause reads:
If, during the period when the application
was forfeited and before the date of publication of the notice of the petitioner's intention
to apply to Parliament for the passing of this
Act, any person bas acquired any right in
respect of the inventions to which that application had reference, then, in the event of the
Comnissioner of Patents making, as provided
for by section one of this Act, an order restoring and reviving that application, every such
right shall be deemed to have had and to have
the saine force and effect as if this Act had not
been passed; but nothing in this section shall
be deemed to derogate from the provisions
contained in sections seven and eight of the
Patent Act or to deprive the applicant of any
benefit therefrom.
The clause has been fully considered by the
Law Clerk and myself, and we are both
satisfied that it is a proper one to be inserted
in Bills of this kind. I give this explanation
so that when the law is being interpreted by
the courts it may be better understood.
In the present instance the last portion of
the clause would be unnecessary, but we have
included it in order that the whole clause may
be applied to future Bills. The clause is intended, as I have stated, to protect a man who
has commenced to manufacture, and who has
established a business while he was entitled
to do so because no patent had been issued
covering the manufacturing rights of the article
in question, or because the application which
had been maide had lapsed or been forfeited.
The last part of the clause is to protect the
inventor. Under the Patent Act the inventor
bas a right to stop the manufacture if he
applies for his patent within the time mentioned in sections 7 and 8 of the Patent Act,
or within one year, if his patent has been
issued in a foreign country.
The Report was concurred in.

and to a certain extent the quantiity of the

been suspended-I do not know wby, and in
my opinion it should be proceeded wit.h or
dropped, because lying behind it, there are
other cases which, according to a first-class
legal authority, would also have to be settled.
Doôes the Alberta Government know what; it
is iniheriting? Does it know that these lands
were res,-rved for special puirposes? That is
the information 1 desire. I sbould like to
know whether the real layout of the situation
bas been placed before the Alberta. Government, and whether any reservation haa ben
made for national purposes within this grat
coal area.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable members, 1 do flot know that the slight information which I bave is absolu'tely accurate. 1
have heard that a settlement was made with
the Hawaiian. Trust -Company, which, I think,
was the trustee or executor of Isenberg. 1
cannot give that information as being absolutely correct, and I am not in a position to,
ans-wer -the other question, as to whether the
whole situation bas been disclosed to the
Government of Albeirta. I shail cominunicate
the inquiry of the honourable gentleman to
the Denartiment of the Interior, and shal
endeavour to procure the information that he
wants.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I should like to know
whether that suit bas really been withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I understood that the
Isenberg interests wanted a fiat fromn the
Government, but were neyer able to secure
it.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I understand that they
obtaîned it, but neyer proceeded with it. It
may be that the matter bas been settled. If
such is the case. the public should be aware
of it, because other people are interested. I
have no interest in this matter but the national value of the property.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My information
is that the Government. of the day acted on
the suggestion that came from this House,
ud that the matter was settled for the amount
my honourable friend mentioned a little wbile
ago.
ESCAPES BY FLIGHT
INQUIRY

Beforc the Orders of the Day:
May 1
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ask the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) a question? I might ex-

plain that last session I introduced a Bill to
amend the Criminal Code so as to make it
unlawful for a police officer to shoot a person
endeavouring to escape from custody, or a
person endeavouring to escape being taken
into custody, and thaf. the honourable leader
of the Government in this House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) asked me to, withdraw the Bull
for the session because the Government intended to make inquiries fromn the AttorneysGeneral of ail the provinces as to their views
upon the proposed legisiation.
I notice in the Vancouver Province an
editorial protesting against the action of
police officers in Vancouver wbo recently shot
and killed a man, and in another case shot
and wounded a man. The man who was
killed had been charged with operating his
car at an unlawful speed; the other man was
looting a grocery store, and a policeman, who
saw hlm through a window, fired at him and
wounded him.
I should like to know whether the Government has taken any action or not, and whether
or not any replies have been received.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I may say to
my honourable friend that several amendments to the Criminal Code are now before
the other House. Tbey have flot yet been
taken into consideration. It is possible that
the matter to whieh hie refers is being deait
with. I would suggest that he look over the
Bill now before the Commons to see whether
some provision bas been made in regard to the
point hie raises.
EXPORT BILL (INTOXICATING

THIRD READING PQSTPONED

Hon. Mr. BELCOTJRT moved- the third
reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend -the Export Act.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Bas my honourable
friend any statement in regard to the matter
that I submitted to him yesterday?
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: I must say that
I have not. To be perfectly candid with my
honourable friend, I am a little doubtfui
whether I am going to get anüy real information. My honourable friend must remeiibe.r
that treaties of that kind are flot generally
negotiated in a public place, and that if
negotiations for such a treaty are now being
carried on, it is flot likely that we shaîl be
told at this moment what they are, or that

SENATE
information of any consequence will be disclosed before the negotiations have proceeded
for some time. I am certainly not in a position to give any information to the honourable gentleman at the moment.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I quite understand
that it would not be proper to bring down
documents or to relate in the House the
contents of correspondence, but my honourable friend will observe that all I asked was
whether or not progress was being made in
the matter. In the first place my honourable
friend might tell me whether negotiations are
still going on or not. It may be that they
have been broken off. Fundamentajly, I
should like to know as to that. Next I should
like to know-that is, if the G.overnment can
give the information withou't disclosing exactly
what has happened-whether or not in the
Government's view progress has been made
towards a reasonable and proper treaty.
That is all I asked my honourable friend to
tell the House. Of course I should not want
him to go any further than that just now.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
other effort.

I shall make an-

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Does my honourable
friend intimate that he is not going to give
the information?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: On the contrary,
I have said that I shall make further inquiries
and shall endeavour to obtain some information.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I was under the impression that this Bill might not be proceeded
with to-day. Some returns were brought
down, I think, which relate to the subject
matter of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The inquiries have
been met.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Has my honourable
friend any objection to letting the Bill stand
over for two or three days? There are some
things that I personally should like to know,
and I think other members on this side of
the House are in a similar position. We are
not treating this as a party matter, for there
are members on this side of the liouse who
are going to vote for the Bill, but I think
we have a right to sufficient time to consider
the returns that have been brought down
to-day and will be in print to-morrow. I do
not think Parliament is going to blow up
right away. I suggest that my honourable
friend let the Bill stand for a few days. We
are not in a factious mood, nor are we fighting this merely from a desire to fight.
Hotn.

Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would support the view taken by the honourable
gentleman who has just spoken.
My own
attitude towards the Bill is already a matter
of record. I think it is desirable that the
inquiries should be fully answered, and that
an opportunity should be given to peruse the
answers. I think it is desirable, too, that the
honourable leader should be in a position to
say whether or not the negotiations have
actually reached such a stage that a statement can be made to the Hoiuse. So far as I
am concerned, and, I dare say, so far as
everybody on this side of the House is concerned, there is no desire to evade a vote or
to protract the discussion unduly; but I do
not think that two or three days' delay would
interfere with the passing of a Bill of such
importance.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It will be remembered, of course, that this Bill was on the
Order Paper for third reading before we
adjourned.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Quite true.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And it is only
because there is a great deal of work to be
donc that I thought we might dispose of this
Bill now and get it out of the way. However,
in viîw of the request of the honourable
gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Tanner), I am
agreeable to the third reading being postponed
until, say, Friday.
The Order stands.

BILL

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Belcourt, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 35, an
Act to amend the Insurance Act.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I should like to inquire
whether this Bill was referred to the Banking
and Commerce Committee, and, if not, why
it was not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This is a Government measure.
My honourable friend will
agree with me that the practice is to refer
Bils of this sort to Commit.tee of the Whole.
No special reason was advanced by anyne,
nor was any request mhade, for the reference
of this Bill to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.

ALBERTA NATURAL RESOURCES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 17, an Act respecting the
transfer of the Natural Resources cf Alberta.
He said: Honourable members, the brief
observations which I wish to submit to the
House on this Bill are applicable equally to
the Bill referred to in the next Order on today's Paper, an Act respecting the transfer
of the natural resources of Manitoba, and also
to Order No. 14 on to-day's Paper, an Act
respecting the transfer of the natural resources
of Saskatchewan. I might go further and
say that my remarks will be found more or
less applicable to one of the Orders of the
Day for to-morrow, No. 3, an Act respecting
the transfer of the Railway Belt and Peace
River Block. These four measures are practically of the same nature, and, with the permission of the House, in referring to the one
Bill I shall have in mind the other three.
I shall not deal with these separately unless
I am specially asked to do so.
I think it is unnecessary to make a lengthy
statement in regard to these Bills, because I
imagine that every honourable member has
read them, the agreements upon which they are
founded, and probably the discussion in another place. Anyone who has taken the
trouble to scrutinize these agreements must
have been struck with the very apparent
motive that inspired the Government of the
day in dealing with these important matters.
It is evident from the beginning to the end of
the agreements that the Government has dealt
generously with the three Western Provinces
concerned. It would seem to have been the intention of the administration to treat Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba in the same

IW

way as the Maritime Provinces, for the
methods adopted in implementing the promises
contained in the Duncan Report have been
applied in the transfer of the natural resources
to the Western Provinces.
Each of these agreements has been a family
agreement, if I may so call it; an agreement
between members of a family who are fully
aware of their common interests, their mutual
I
obligations, and their interdependence.
think the agreements show in each and every
case that both sides realized the intimate connections and interests and the solidarity existing between the respective provinces and the
Dominion. The desire is manifest therein to
clothe the provinces with as large and ample
power and jurisdiction as it is possible to
give them, consistent with the scheme of
Confederation. I think that everyone must
be impressed with the spirit of liberality, of
give and take, which animated the Federal
Government and the Governments of the respective provinces.
Honourable members will recall that when,
in 1905, Alberta and Saskatchewan were
created provinces, the title to their natural
resources was continued in the Federal Government. The transfer of these resources was
seriously and lengthily considered and the
conclusions arrived at were carefully canvassed, with the result that agreements which
were apparently quite satisfactory to both
sides were concluded. We are now asked to
ratify those agreements.
It is somewhat different in the case of
Manitoba. Honourable gentlemen will remember that Manitoba became part of the
Federation in 1870. and that its natural resources were continued under the control of
the Federal Government for a number of
years. During that interval a subsidy, which
was from time to time increased, was paid to
the province in lieu of the control and possession of those natural resources.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to interrupt him? He
said that the agreement with the Manitoba
Government differs from that with Saskatchewan and Alberta, inasmuch as it refers to the
time when Manitoba came into Confederation.
I would inquire from the honourable acting
leader whether one of the main points at
issue between Saskatchewan and Alberta, respectively, and the Federal Government, is
not the question as to when those two provinces came into the Union, the provinces
claiming that it was in 1870, the same year
in which Manitoba was created.

zou

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What I intended
to point out, for the moment, was the difference between the methods of arriving at agreements with Alberta and Saskatchewan on the
one hand and Manitoba on the other. In
the case of Manitoba, as I think my honourable friend will remember, a Royal Commission was named by the Government at the
request of that province, the whole question
was submitted to the Commission, and upon
its report was based the agreement that was
finally accepted by both parties. It was in
that regard only that I wished to point out
the difference between Manitoba and the
other two provinces. The question to which
my honourable friend refersiwas dealt with
by the Royal Commission and subsequently,
when the points of the agreement were being
considered. With regard to all three provinces-and. I may say, with regard also to
British Columbia in connection with the Belt
lands-the relevant matters were fully discussed and we have complete and definite
agreement with respect to them.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: But there still remains
at issue the question as to when Saskatchewan
and Alberta entered Confederation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That has all been
settled by the agreements. I do not think it
is a question for Parliament to consider, except as an incident of the respective agreements. We are concerned only with the question whether we will ratify the agreements
arrived at between the respective parties.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I intend to make but very limited
remarks a.propos of these Bills, because we are
confronted with agreements that have been
executed between the Dominion Government
and the respective provinces and that presumably were in each case mutually satisfactory.
The legislation of 1905 was unsatisfactory to a
large number of people in Alberta and Saskatchewan. I speak more particularly of Saskatchewan, for J know more about it. But
the Governments of these provinces have now
made their own agreements with the Dominion, and on the whole I think the agreements are reasonable, the terms made by the
Dominion with the provinces being neither
too generous nor too parsimonious. Although
I corne from a province that is particularly
concerned with one of the Bills, I feel that in
this Chamber I am a representative of the
country as a whole. I think, too, that the
provinces were well able to look after themselves in their negotiations writh the Federal
authorities.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

Saskatchewan insisted upon a clause, which
is in the agreement with that province, providing a modus operandi for the determination
by the Supreme Court of Canada or, if necessary, by the highest court of the realm, the
Privy Council, of the important question as
to when the province entered the Union,
whether it was in 1870 or in 1905, and of the
rights that will result from the fixing of the
date. The contention has been advanced by
the Covernment at present in power in Saskatchewan-and it is a contention that at
the time the Western Provinces were formed
was made by the Government in power
in the Northwest Territories, headed by the
present Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, Mr.
Haultain-that the rights of Saskatchewan
should beh based on the principle that it
entered into Confederation in 1870. I am informed that after Alberta had concluded with
the Dominion Government an agreement satisfactory to that province, it learned that Saskatchewan had made provision for keeping
open the question of the respective rights of
the Dominion and the province before the
Ist day of September, 1905, and the Alberta
Government requested that it should be
allowed to do likewise. That privilege has
been granted. So it is now open to those two
provinces to make any representations they
desire in order to have their rights date from
1870.
If the Privy Council should hold that the
rights of Alberta and Saskatchewan date frorm
1870, the decision would be a very important
one for those provinces, because from that
time to the present the Dominion Government has been administering the natural resources of those provinces, not as a trustee,
but as the owner, and has been dealing with
them as it saw fit. I will not say that it did
not deal with such resources in the interests
of the provinces, generally speaking, but the
fact remains that it acted as owner and not
as trustee. It is admitted by those in Saskatchewan who say that the rights of that
province date from 1870 that the case of
Manitoba is different, from a legal standpoint
at any rate, because the Manitoba Act was
confirmed by an Imperial Act.
However, as this is a subject that I discussed
at various times, before the agreements were
made, I am going to follow the example of the
honourable the acting leader of the House
in declining to enter into matters that are no
longer pertinent. It is not the habit of
members of this House to indulge in speeches
simply for the purpose of being heard, or of
having them given out to their constituents.
Manitoba having accepted the report of
the Commission, and Alberta and Saskatche-

MAY 14, 1930
wan the agreernent, with certain reservations
for the protection of their rights, I do not
think that any of the Prairie Provinces hais
any reason to object to the course now taken
by the Qovernment. I think the Government. bas adopted the proper attitude in
taking cognizance of the constitutional proposition so long contended for. I dare say
there are yet many persons who do flot
accede at ail to the proposition that the entry
of the two more westerly Prairie Provinces
into Condederation dates from 1870. There
are two schools of thought on that question,
and I think the right method of procedure
has been adopted in referring it for determination to the highest court in the realrn.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I understood the honourable leader of the
House to say that this debate would cover
the four Bills.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I said that my
observations were such that practically ahl of
them would be applicable to the four Bills.
If any honourable member desires to have
these Bills taken up and discussed separately,
it is quite open to hirn to have that done.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The few words that
I have to say will be equally applicable when
we corne to the Bill relating to the resources
of Saskatchewan. I desire to make a few
observations in this connection, flot because
1 wish to oppose the measure in any f orm, but
merely to show the effect of what is known as
the Saskatchewan Autonorny Act.
I happen to have had the privilege of being
a memnber of the Territorial Legisiature for a
number of years, as well as a member, of the
Saskatchewan Assembly.
During the earlý
days in the Northwest Territories we were a
somnewhat happy family. Political lines were
not sharply drawn in those days. From the
very early days of the Northwest Council
the dlaim for hetter treatment in the matter
of money to carry on the affairs of the
Council was urged session after session, and
a similar dlaim ivas continued after the LegisEvery year resolutions
lature was formed.
werc passed and memorials forwarded to
Ottawa, outlining what we regarded as our
rights.
In looking over. some of the papers the
other day I came across a very excellent
speech made, I think in 1898, by the worthy
Senator from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Ross),
who was then Territorial Treasurer. At that
time hie was very clear in demanding for the
Territories their absolute rights; not only
the control of the public domain, but compensation for lands alienated for railways or

201

other purposes. The Regina Leader came out
in sornewhat glaring headlines as follows:
TerriThe public lands will be claimed!
torial Treasurer Ross announces the Governnient's proposition relating to, provincial establishment. Right to ownership of the public
domains. An amount on account of lands alienated will be asked and the remaining public
lands to be demanded for the Territories-and so on.
I have traced up the Journals of the Legislature, and even of the Council, and they
show resolution after resolution demanding
all their rights. Our leader at that timne,
now Sir Frederick Haultain, with the assistance of others in the Legislature, drafted
what is known as the " Bill of Rights." This
" Bill of Rights,"' which was taken to Ottawa,
contained a demand for ahl our natural
resources, and compensation for every acre
of land that was alienated. Mr. Haultain
with others presented this dlaim in Ottawa in
1905, wheii the Northwest Territories were
formed into provinces; but, unfortunately,
when hie arrived at Ottawa he found the
Sornething had transscene had changed.
pireL. The dlaims that hie adva~nced and
the rights that he pointed out were practically thrown to one aide, and what we got
in lieu of them was contained in the terms
of the Saskatchewan Act. 1 need not refer
to them. The utrnost that we could receive
in lieu of the land grant would be $1,125,000. The "Bill of Rights" was rejected
by Parliament, and the Autonomy Act was
brought into force.
It seems extraordinary that there stepped
into Mr. Haultain's shoes the man who had
been his strongest supporter for many years:
I arn referrîng to Mr. Scott, who so ably
Even after he was
edited his newspaper.
elected to Parliament Mr. Scott was just as
strongly in favour of these demands as before.
He claimed that we were entitled to every
acre of land, to ail resources, and to compensation for every acre of land alienated.
But with the position of Prime Minister of
Saskatchewan dangling hefore his eyes he
underwent a change.
I will read some of the statements made
by Mr. Scott in 1901. Speaking in the House
of Commons Mr. Scott made this staternent:
I may say that what the people of the
Territories will expect, and what 1 think they
have a right to expect-and that is really the
point to which I wish to call the attention of
Parliament-is that they will be deait with on
exactly the sanie basis as the originally confederated provinces. If the proper principle is
adhered to, if the principle of absolute equality
is observed, if Parliainent places the new provinces upon an equitable basis, the local Government will bie given a grant for government, also
the per capita grant, and be given anything

SENATE
that may be show n to be due as the deht allowance. And they will be put in possession of
the public resources, lands, timber and minerals
in the saie way as the other provinces were
put in possession of their resources.
That was the statement of Mr. Scott in
1901, when he was a member of Parliament.
Again in 1903 he continued the agitation,
and made the following sta-tement in Parliament:
I believe that MIr. Haultain's proposals are
approved with practical unanimity by all the
people of the Northwest. The voters of the
Northwest approve the details of Mr. Haultain's
draft bill.
Then we come to the year 1905, when the
provinces were being formed, and, as I have
stated, he changed his mind completely. This
is what he said in 1905:
31y view is that this Parliament bas the
discretion ta give such constitution to these
provinces as it chooses to give.
Previously. both in his paper and in Parliament, he had been contending that we were
entitled to everything demanded in the "Bill
of Rights." Then te made another somewhat
extraordinary statement. The people of the
Northwest Territories were unanimously in
favour of the "Bill of Pigts." He said:
"An J going too far wlen J suggest a doubt
as to the sanity of any Saskatchewan man who
complains about our land teris?"
Now let us see just how these new terms
have worked out for the Province of Saskatchewan.
Mr. Haultain's administration came to an
end before the Autonomy Act was brought
into force. He had been looking after the
affairs of the Northwest Territories for many
years, and had laid the foundations of our
institutions. The amount of money at bis
disposal was comparatively small, yet he
manged to carry on the business of the
Territories very well, and we find that at the
end of his term of office the Territories, instead of being in debt, -had a balance on hand
of nearly half a million dollars. That, of
course, was divided between the two provinces
of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The people of Saskatchewan were told-and
I suppose a similar statement was made in
Alberta-that the terms of the Autonomy
Bill were so generous, the money grants so
large, that the province would not require to
go into debt or to impose additional taxation
upon the people for many years to come.
That argument was a great factor in carrying the election in 1905. It is true that, as
eompared with the previous meagre income,
the terms of the Autonomy Bill appeared
favourable, but notwithstanding what we were
told by the Liberals of Saskatchewan-and
Hon. Mfr. GILLIS.

I presume this applies also to Alberta--what
did we find? The gentlemen who went around
giving that song and dance were not in office
more than two or three 3-ears before they had
imposed direct taxation on the people of Saskatchewan by way of a supplementary revenue tax. the exact amount of which J forget.
A little later that was changed to what
was called the "Revenue Tex." and last year
the people of the Province of Saskatchewan
paid $1,G75,000 under it, notwithstanding the
wonderful terms of the Autonomy Act.
As I bave said, we were told also that it
would not be necessary for us to go into debt.
Wtat do we find to-day? After twenty years
of Liberal rule, Saskatchewan tas a debt of
nearly seventy million dollars, and very little
to show for it-a few public buildings, a crazyquilt system of roads here and there, because
the money was voted en bloc and not for
specific sections of road-and interest on the
publie debt of the province anounting to

83,605,952.
During Mr. Haultain's regime the taxes
were very light, not exceeding five or ten
dollars on every quarter section.
To-day,
notwitthstanding the huge provinciail debt, notwithstanding the revenue tax, the people have
to pay ifrom $40 to $100 on every quarter secThat is the position under the
tion.
Autonomy Act.
I do not think there is any question of our
right to the public domain. I do not think
there ever was a serious question as to that.
And if we were entitled to the public domain,
surely we were entitled to compensation for
the lands taken from us for railways and other
purposes. If we were entitled to those lands,
and if the resources had been turned over to
us in 1905, as is being done under these Bills
to-day, what position should we be in now?
If you take up the correspondence bet;ween
the Provincial and the Federal Governments
in respect to the Bills before us you will find
that, according to Sessional Paper 281, the
lands granted to railway companies on land
subsidy account by the Dominion Government previously to 1905 amounted to 8,968,071
acres, and that subsequently to 1905 lands
granted on the same account amounted to
6,118,378 acres. making a total of 15,086,449
acres. Reading on in this same paragraph,
you will find that railway companies sold 21,804,966 acres of land, for which they received
$187,268,182, or an average of over $8.50 an
acre.
The Hudson's Bay Company sold
during the same period 3,602,990 acres. and
they received over $12 an acre for it. If we
place a conservative valuation of $5 an acre on
that- portion of our domain which was given
for railway purposes alone--and I may say

MAY 14, 1930
that some land in Saskatchewan has sold for
as much as $100 an acre-we shall get some
idea of what we should have received had we
been treated as we should have been in 1905.
I want to emphasize that $5 an acre is a conservative estimate, compared with what the
railway companies received for the land they
sold, but if we had been given compensation
for those 15,000,000 acres on the basis of only
$5 an acre, we should have received over
$75,000,000, and to-day we should have a
credit of $29,000,000 or $30,000,000 over the
actual indebtedness of the province.
Instead of that, because we were treated
unfairly in 1905, we have in the province a
condition that is not at all desirable. I am
not pessimistic and I do not want to cast
s.lurs upon our province; for, alithough Saskatchewan may not be the wealthiest province of Canada, it is tlhe banner province from
an agricultural stan-dpoint.
Unfortunately,
during the last three or four years our people
have had a partial crop failure, and in consequence our farmers are not in a flourishing
condition. The taxes to which I have referred
are a burden uipon the people, who, however,
have not given up hope that better times
are coming. We believe that our difficulties
will be overcome, particularly because of the
concession of our rights granted under this
Act. I am satisfied that in the course of a
few years the people of Saskatchewan, under
a business Government and not a political
machine, will fully recover from the present
unsatisfactory condition, and we shall be able
to point to general prosperity instead of a
big debt. I am gratified that I have had an
opportunity of sayin a few words here in
support of this Bill, the object of which is to
grant to the Province of Saskatchewan the
rights of which it has been deprived for so
many yeara I am confident a judicial tribunal will give full constitutional rights to
Saskatchewan.

DIVORCE BILL (ONTARIO)
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS moved the second
reading of Bill 20, an Act to provide in the
Province of Ontario for the dissolution and
the annulment of marriage.
He said: Honourable senators, the abject
of this Bill is merely to confer divorce jurisdiction upon the Province of Ontario, to give
to the courts of that province the power to
try divorce cases, similar to the power possessed by the courts of every other province
of the Dominion with the exception of Quebec. I suggest that if there is any debate on
this Bill, honourable members who are
opposed to it, on conscientious or other
grounds, should confine their remarks to the
ýubject of the Bill itself, and thus prevent a
discussion on the whole question of divorce.
I think I may say with absolute certainty
that the only effect of the Bill on divorce cases
will be to provide a proper place in which
they may be heard. The Bill has passed this
House on four different occasions, in 1920.
1927, 1928 and 1929. It has been discussed
extensively on the floor of this Chamber and
elsewhere, and I am sure that all honourable
members are thoroughly acquainted with all
the arguments, pro and con, which have been
made with regard to it.
Perhaps it is unnecessary for me to repeat
the reasons that have been urged in favour
of the Bill, but I will go over them briefly.
I think that our present system of divorces
being granted by Parliament is unjust, because, in the first place, the petition has te
be advertised and the evidence must be

SENATE
printed and distributed. Then, no provision
is made for alimony, and we have no power to
make an order in regard to custody of
chiildren. Further, we have no jurisdiction
over the costs of the suit; nor can we take
evidence by commission. If the Committee
recommends the granting of the petition, the
divorce comes into effect immediately the Bill
becomes law, whereas unider English law,
after a case is heard at court, a decree nisi
may be granted and the divorce may not come
into effect until six months afterwards, or such
further time as the court may decide. This
delay gives an opportunity for the third parties
to intervene. In cases where there is collusion, in England, the King's Proctor can
step inHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
permits reconciliation.

That

system

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
In that way perhaps a good many reconciliations may be
brought about, which are not possible at all
under our system. I should like to lay stress
upon another objectionable feature of our
present system, and that is that it creates an
opportunity for lobbying. In a case in which
one or more of the parties are wealthy, if our
Committee recommends -the petition and a
Bill for the relief of the petitioner is passed
by this House, there is sometimes an inducement for the starting of a lobby. I have no
hesitation in saying that I have personally
known of a very strong lobby being undertaken and carried through before a Bill has
been passed by the other House. That is a
procedure which, I think, is extremely injurious and detrimental, and should not be
permitted to exist. Of course, such a thing
could not be done with a case that was being
tried in court.
It has been contended that divorces are
increasing, and that has been advanced as ode
of the reasons why this Bill should not be
passed. I think that argument is not well
founded and that it has been pretty well
disposed of. My opinion is that the increase
in di1vorces has been caused, to a very large
extent, by the emancipation of women. In
former days when a woman was married she
was totally dependent upon her husband for
the support of herself and her children, if
any. But conditions have changed. To-day
many a woman can earn as much as a man,
and a wife is no longer dependent upon her
husband in the old sense. For that reason
there is more frcedom, and if a man does not
behave as he should his wife is likely to apply
for relief.
A large proportion of the petitions that
,ome before the Divorce Committee are from
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

people in poor financial circumstances. I asked
the Chief Clerk of Committees to give me
some figures, and he assured me that at least
30 per cent of the petitioners for divorce were
not able to afford the fees; so that from nearly
one-third of the total number of petitioners
we have applications for refunds. Each application is given full consideration, and if it
is well founded we may order a remission of
all fees above the sum of $50. In numerous
cases where the petitioner is earning a small
wage it develops that one or two dollars
have been set aside weekly for three or four
years until enough money bas been saved
to defray the expenses of coming to Ottawa
and presenting the petition. This is particularly truc in the cases of women who are
making around $10 or $12 a week, and who
perhaps have a child to support.
It might be interesting to observe that prior
to the year 1857, in England, only a rich man
could get a divorce, because in the first place
it was necessary to sue the co-resipondent
and prosecute an action for damages against
him, and if a verdict was obtained an apiplication would have to bo made to the Ecclesiastiral Courts for a divorce a mensa et toro;
and after all that, the petitioner had to go
to the House of Lords and ask for relief, so
that he would be enabled to marry again.
I should like to read a short statement from
the judgment of Mr. Justice Maule, in a
case prior to the Divorce Act of 1857, in
sentencing a poor man who had been convicted
of bigamy. The prisoner's wife had robbed
him and had run away with another màn,
with whom she was living, and in these
circumstances the prisoner had married again.
You should (said Mr. Justice Maule) have
brou ght an action and obtained damages which
the other side would probably not have been
able to pay, and you would have had to pay
your own costs, perhaps an hundred or an
You should then
hundred and fifty pounds.
have gone to the Ecclesiastical Courts and
obtained a divorce a mensa et toro and then
to the House of Lords, where, having proved
that these preliminaries had been complied
with, you would have been entitled to marry
again. The expenses night amount to five or
six hundred or a thousand pounds. You say

you are a poor man. But I moust tell you that
there is not one law for the rich and another
for the poor.

I think it is unnecessary for me to take up
the time of the House any longer.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: The subject
of this Bill has been well presented by the
honourable gentleman, the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. MeMeans).
As honourable members know, I was for
soin tine Chairman of that Comnmittee. For
a number of years before that, I was a mem-

MAY 14, 1930
ber of it, and during absences of the Chairmnan-at one time the late Senator Sir James
Lougheed, and, during another period, the
late Scnator Proudfoot-I frequently presided
at the Committee. I do flot intend to discuss
this Bill thoroughly, because anyone who is
interested in my opinions may refer to what
I said in the debate on the previous Bill.
I arn going to point out only two or three
things that may be of some interest, in
connection with the history of the Bis in
this House.
The honourable gentleman has referred to
the Bill of 1920. At that time Hon. Mr. Ross
,'as leader of this side of thie House. There wero
two proposais, Bill A and Bill f. One of those
was a measure very much on the lines of the
one now before us; the other was somewhat
similar to the Bill, which is coming here,
relating te the domicile of thie wi'fe. Mr. RossQs
Bill of 1920, which passed this Huse, provided
for the establishment of divorce courts in the
Province of Ontario and the Province of
Prince Edward Island. The other Bill of that
year deait generally with the law of divorce,
including among other things a provision giving men and women an equality in the matter
of domicile when coming before the court to
be constituted. There is before the House at
the present time a Bill dealing with divorce in
the Province of Ontario, and there is coming
to us another Bill, dealing with domicile,
sixnilar to the measure that was introduced in
the other bouse last year, and came to us,
but failed to pass this buse. That Bill was
not very happily drafted. The one submitted
this year is slightly different. I arn not going
to discuss it any further than to state that it
provides that as against the husband who has
abandoncd hier the woman shahl have a riglit
to acquire a separate domicile in the place of
his original domicile if she continues to reside
there for two years.
Hon. Mr. BEIkOOURT: Is it the opinion of
the honourable gentleman that under the law
a separate domicile might not be obtained on
application to the court?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
what jurisdiction the court would have.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If this Bill passes,
would not any wife be enabled to obtain a
separate domicile by application to the court?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Apart from the
application for divorce? For ail purposes, by
virtue of application to the court? I would
say that the Bill, as I have seen it, would
give hier that right only for the purpose of
divorce; flot for general purposes.

205

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 amn asking my
honourable friend if hie is not of opinion that,
assuming that the Bill goca through.Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The Bill that is
coming?
Hon. Mr. BELOTRT: Yes. Would not the
wife be enabled to obtain a seipara.te -domicile
by an application to the court?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 do nlot know
of any provision for it. I do not say it does
not exist in the Province of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not that be
somewhat similar to an application for service
out of the jurisdiction? Would not the. inherent power of the court obtain?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I think I can answer
the honourable gentleman. I have nu hesitatien in saying- no, under any circumstances.
However, that does not arise in this case.
bon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 arn glad that
my honourable friend can answer.
bon. Mr. BEIQUE: The Legishature of the
province would have the right to provide for
that.
Hon. Mr. WfILLOUGHBY: The Bill of
1920, to wvhich I have referred, went over to
the other House--some honourable gentlemen
here now may have been members of that
bouse at that time-and the explanation
given to me by the gentleman who had the
charge of the Bill over there, Mr. Boys, was
that hie was absent on some occasion and the
Bill disappeared fromn the Order Paper, and
that a certain gentleman, who is not now in
piublic life, was Minister of Justice, and was
not going to make it any too easy to put it
back on the Order Paper again. For that
reason it did not corne before the bouse.
XVhat its fate would have been had it been
considered, I arrn not prepared to say.
After a considerable lapse of time came
the Bisl of 1927, wbich it was my honour and
prîvilege to introduce in this House. In that
year took place the estabîlishment of thie Aus-tralian capital at Cauherra, and it was pointed
out to me that the Ministex of Justice, as the
d-elegate of Canada to that great firnction,
would be absent, and tihat the-refore it wouýld
be a courtesy not to press the Bill. fi have not
made this statement publicly before, but that
is the explanation as to why the Bill ivas nlot
pressed in the other bouse. The Bill passed
here, and it was left to me to find a proper
person to present it in the Commons, and

206

SENATE

purelly out of respect to the Minister of Justice
tlhe Bill was not presented and pushed there
at that time.
Then came the Bills of 1928 and 1929, which
fell by the wayside in the other House. A.
new objection was raised in the Commons,
namely, that the Bill should not come into
force except on application of the Province
of Ontario. It seems to me most anomalous
and ridiculous that this Parliament, having
full legislative power vested in it under the
British North America Act, should make the
exercise of that power dependent upon the
action of any local legislature in Canada. It
is a manifest absurdity.
In either 1920 or 1927 I dealt rather fully
with what was done by a Commission that
was appointed in England. The appointment
of that Commission, and its findings, first
interested me in the subject of divorce. It
was a very important Commission.
The
warrants that went out t its members were
issued in 1909. Sir Gorell Barnes, afterwards
Lord Gorell, was chairman, and among other
distinguished members of the Commission I
might mention the Archbishop of York,
Primate of England, Lady Frances Balfour,
and May Edith, the wife of Harold John
Tennant. The report may be obtained in
the Parliamentary Library, and I shall make
just a short reference to it. The recommendations as a whole never became law, but some
of them were subsequently enacted, among
them being one giving a woman a right of
action against her husband on the same ground
upon which a man has a right of action for
divorce against his wife. He does not need
to prove cruelty and so on. In the majority
report five other grounds besides adulterythe only one then in force in England-were
recommended, and these were concurred in
by the minority. Let me read them to you:
We concur in the recommendations of the
majority report with regard to the nullity of
marriage in cases (a) of unsound mind: (b)
of epilepsy and recurrent insanity; (c) of
venereal disease;
(d) when a woman is
pregnant at the time of marriage by a man
other than the husband, who is ignorant of the
fact, and (e) of wilful refusal to consummate
the marriage.
The majority made other recommendations,
from which the minority dissented.
Some honourable gentlemen may have read
a very interesting article dealing with divorce
in England, contained in one of the books of
Lord Birkenhead, a man who occupied the
position of Chancellor of England as well as
other high positions. In this article he advocated additional grounds for divorce.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

This Bill does net establish any additional
grounds. As honourable gentlemen know, the
grounds are the very minimum upon which
divorce can be granted. In view of the fact
that the Bill is not in my name, I do not feel
that I should trespass further upon the time
of the House, because I have wearied the
House on former occasions in dealing rather
exhaustively with the matter. I thought, however, that a few observations upon the history of divorce legislation in England might
be of interest.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:
Honourable members, this measure has been so
much discussed, not only in parliamentary
circles but in the newspapers, of late, that I
have no hope of being able to say anything
about it that will be new. None the less, as I
am entirely and strongly opposed to the
enactment of this Bill, I want to say in as
few words as I can what my reasons are for
opposing it altogether.
I cannot see, for my part, any need of it.
I think our present system, with the tribunal
which now exists for the trial of these cases,
is, in the circumstances, the best we can get
for a very disagreeable business. Everybody,
I suppose, agrees that divorce is an evil thing;
that, if it coul-d be, it ought lo be altogether
abolished. The trying of these cases is something like the work of trying criminals. No
judge ever sat, I suppose, who liked the work
of trying a man for his life. None the less,
that is a neces-ary thing, and judges perform
ibeir duty because they have sworn te do it.
Now, in the case of divorce, the work which
our Divorce Committee does is work of the
same disagrecable but necessary sort, and the
only question, to my mind, that arises upon
a consideration of this Bill is whether or not,
in the public interest, that work can be any
better done elsewhere than it is being donc
to-day. On that point my opinions and
convict,ions
have
been
formed
during
thirty or forty years or more, and I say
here without hesitation that I believe our
Divorce Committee, for the work it has te
do, is the very best judicial tribunal that
could be constituted. And of necessity, it
seems to me, it is so. Everybody is agreed
that twelve jurymen of the country constitute
a better tribunal for the trial of questions
of fact than any other that could be got
together. A jury of twelve lawyers learned
in the law and empanelled to try a case would,
I venture to think, never, or scarcely ever,
agree; and if a tribunal composed altogether
of men of any other profession were engaged
in dealing with a professional matter, very

MAY 14, 1930
likely the same result would ensue. But our
Divorce Committee always has been and
always will be, I have no doubt, composed of
a few lawyers, a few medical men-so long
as there are any of either profession in this
House-and a few members whQ are not
professional men at all, but experienced
business men, better qualified than any
other class in the community for finding upon disputed questions of fact.
In our Divorce Committee you have a judicial
tribunal which is at the same time a jury;
you have the same individuals acting in
that double capacity. The Chairman, usuallly is
a îawyer, and if any legal point arises he states
to his colleagues and to the parties present
what the law is; he makes his legal ruling. The
medical men on the Committee have to
deal with medical evidence, frequently so' in
the absence of medical witnesses; they are
required to consider evidence given by
witnesses who are lay people; and in such
cases it is a vast advantage, as anyone looking at the reports of the Committee will see,
that some members of the Committee should
be medical men who are able, by a few pointed
questions, to elicit the truth. And combined
with the professional men you have the remainder of the Committee composed of jurymen, who are certainly and distinctly of a
superior class. We have, in Ontario at any
rate, a jury system under which a special jury
may be demanded in special cases. I have
always questioned whether it is any better
than a common jury, but it is drawn from the
grand jury panel, from those who are considered to be the superior, the more intelligent,
class of citizens. Surely in our Divorce Committee of the Senate we have non-professional
men who are superior even to a grand jury or
to a special jury that might be selected; and
when these gentlemen of the Committee meet
for consideration of the evidence and for a
finding on the facts, in contested cases, they
have the advantage of being at once jury and
judge, of knowing what the law is, and of
being able to apply that law to the special
facts of the case in question.
Has there been, in all the years since Confederation, any public complaint of the working of our Divorce Committees in the Senate?
As I said a moment ago, I was personally
acquainted with the working of the Divorce
Committee at least forty years ago, when
professional business brought me in a few
cases before the Committee as counsel; and
I formed in those days the very highest admiration for the judicial, the thorough and the
just way in which that Committee performed
its functions. Since then, while I have been a
member of Parliament, I have had occasion

207

to observe more closely, even to scrutinize, the
workings of that Committee. Through the
years that I was Minister of Justice I made it
a rule, as we have no such official as the
King's Proctor in this country, to read, myself,
as critically as I could, all the evidence in
every divorce case that came before the House
of Commons. I felt it necessary on a few occasions to oppose the recommendations of the
Divorce Committee of those days; but in reading that evidence, disagreeable as it sometimes
was, and burdensome, I saw for myself how
thoroughly and how well the Divorce Committee was then working. Since I have been a
member of this House I have read occasionally
a few of the cases, where there seemed some
special reason for doing so, and I can say
that I think that in recent years the work
of the Committee has been done as satisfactorily as it ever was done.
What improvement will there be if that
work is relegated to the courts? I think
there will be none. I think the change
will be positively detrimental, for many reasons. I shall endeavour to speak of a few
of those reasons. It is said that the expense
of the present system is burdensome. Well,
if that is so, if that argument means anything, it means that as soon as you transfer
this jurisdiction to a cheaper tribunal you
will increase the number of divorce cases and
you will have the divorce evil emphasized
and made worse than it is at the present time.
But is it a fact that the cost will be less
if the cases are to be disposed of by the
courts? Bear in mind that this measure concerns only the Province of Ontario. One
can understand that it would be extremely
expensive to bring to Ottawa witnesses from
Nova Scotia, or from British Columbia, and
there might be in the case of either of these,
or of any of the other distant provinces,
strong argument in favour of cheapening litigation, of lessening the expense of travelling.
But not so with Ontario. Ottawa is within
Ontario, and it is no more expensive to bring
witnesses to Ottawa than it would be to
take them to Toronto. I do not know whether
anyone contemplates the trial of these divorce
actions county by county, wherever the parties happen to live. It remains to be seen
what will be done in this connection, and that
is one of the objections to this Bill. Nobody
can tell what the future is to be, if this
measure passes. The judges, if compelled to
undertake this work, would of course have to
make regulations and rules under which it
would be carried on. It is to my mind
extremely doubtful whether they would take
these divorce cases at each county assizes,

SENATE
where the court is of necessity public, where
the parties live, where everybody in the community is possibly discussing the scanda], and
where the courtroom. is bound to be crowded
to the doors if the trial is heard there. 1
think it very doubtful that the judges would
ever agree ta such a course of procedure, and
ý,o I think that practically it will he a question, if this Bill passes, where the divorce
court is going ta sit, whether in Toronto, or in
Ottawa, or somewhere else in the province.
And if in Ottawa, the expense, sa f ar as
witnesses and parties are concerned, wuuld ho
exactly what it is to-day.
But thon there are the legal expenses. Well,
I know peuple say this Bill xvil lessen the
expense, but I knuw equally well that most
lawyers favour this measure, and that many
of thema are candid enough ta say it xviii largely
increase legal business. Sa it will, if cases are
more numerous.
I shall not attempt ta go into detail, but
speaking of trial hefore judges, let me say
une other thing. In aur proceedings before
the Senate the evidence and the whuie proceedings are printed.
The witnesses give
their testimony before the Committee, and
the Committee alune; there are no bystanders.
That is a great advantage ta everybody concerned. There is nu publication of the writuten
evidence in the newsp.ipýer or anywhere else,
exccpt ta members of Parliament.
But
the moment you get into court proceedings,
of course the courts have contrai. The judges
may make regulations, but it is a very grave
question of law whether any British court has
a right ta exclude the public from the hearing of cases before that court. Courts were
intended ta be public; courts ought to be
public; the peuple have a right ta know
xvhat gues on within their courts; and
although tbere might be special rules provided
for the hearing of divorce cases, I feel very
doubtfui about it. And similarly with the
newspapers. There are some industrious, enthusiastic nexvspaper reporters who would be
only too woll pleased if they could publish
the ex idence in dix orce cases. And that is a
matter over xvhich, if this Bill is passed,
Parliament at any rate xxould not have the
siighte-st, contraI. The xvhoiie law uf libel,
the law in regard to publication by newspapers, is within provincial jurisdiction. No
mai eau say whether, if this Bibi is pasze.J,
we shouid not bave in a short time puiblication of ail t.he disgusting detals in the local
nexvsiiapers, where it wxould be of greatest
interest.
There is just one romaining point that I
wish ta emphasize, because ta my mind it
cunstitrutes a very graxve objection, to, this
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

Bill. If this measure is passed, divorce becames a matter of legal right. Any man or
xvoman xvho deems himseif or herself entitled
ta divorce, on the ex idence pussessed, would
then have a right ta go ta the court and
demand a divorce, just exactiy in the samne
way that a'man who has a debt owing ta him
may go ta the court and demand payment.
But as it is now, the granting or withholding
of divource is nu matter uf right ta any citizen.
The party who heioves himself aggrieved
cames ta Parliament petitioning for redress,
a suppliant asking a special faveur, the passing
of a private Act ta give relief. That makes,
ta my mind, the greatest possible difference
in the estimation of the public. That makos
the queýztion entirely ane as ta ivheffher a person is asserting a right ur is caming, ex en though
it be at greater expense, ta ask for a special

PROPOSED SMUGGLING TREATY
REPLY TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable members, I am pleased to be in a position to
give some information to my honourable
friend from Pietou (Hon. Mr. Tanner). The
day before yesterday he asked me to furnish
what information I could procure with regard
to the negotiations said to be going on with
the Government of the United States concerning a treaty on the subject of smuggling.
I am now in a position to say that some time
ago a draft treaty was prepared, which received the close attention of the Canadian
Legation at Washington, and of the American
Legation at Ottawa, that substantial progress
has been made in the consideration of the
provisions of this draft treaty, and that it is
hoped that at an early date it will form the
basis of what may be a final discussion; and
it is possible that before prorogation takes
place Parliament will be advised of the nature
and purport of the treaty.

WAR VETERANS' ALLOWANCE BILL
SECOND READING-REFERRED
SPECIAL COMMITTEE

TO

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 19, an Act respecting War
Veterans' Allowances.
He said: Honourable members of the Senate,
the motives that have inspired the Government in submitting this legislation to Parliament are of three kinds: those that arise from
a consideration of the proper treatment of
the veterans, those that relate to social
order, and those relating to the economic
order. The Government felt that the Bill
would do much to solve the problem of unemployment, a problem which seems to be
pretty universal. The Government is evidently
impressed with the necessity of adopting a
different method of providing for the persons

dealt with from that which has been followed,

say, in the United States, where a large
number of soldiers' homes have been established for the purpose of taking care of their
veterans.
In submitting this measure on behalf of
the Government I wish to call the attention
of honourable members to the advisability of
adopting a way that will have the effect,
among others, of preserving rather than disintegrating the family and the home. It is

submitted that it would be far better to allow

veterans to remain in their homes than to
receive them and take care of them in soldiers'
homes or hospitals.
This question has received a great deal of
attention in the past. I have here extracts
from the reports of different parliamentary
committees, dating as far back as 1921. Perhaps I shall be permitted to read a few of
them.
In 1921, when a parliamentary committee
sat, this question of old age disability was
pressed more strongly than in previous years.
The committee stated in its report:
Your committee is of opinion that the time
will shortly arrive when circumstances will
point to the necessity of very serious consideration being given to the soldier without pensionable disability who is unable, through age or
infirmity, to care for himself.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

report was made. In 1928 the Parliamentary
Committee on Pensions reported:
Your committee finds that one of the most
serious situations confronting the Department
and the country generally is that relating to
the employment and care of ex-members of the
forces suffering from disability, broken down
or burned out, who under the present regulations are wholly or in part non-pensionable.
On February 28 in the same year the House
of Commons passed a resolution reading as
follows:
That iýt is expedient to bring in a measure
respecting allowances to war veterans, to provide assistance for certain veterans who are
not in receipt of pensions or who, if in receipt
of pensions, are only partly pensionable, or who
are unemployabIe.
Experience has shown that of those eligible
by age to receive the benefits of the old age
pension legislation in Australia, New Zealand
and British Columbia, forty per cent have
been found to be eligible under the restrictions as to income.
Here I pause to point out that the main
principle on which this measure rests is the
principle adopted and put into practice with
regard to old age pensions applicable not only
to soldiers, but generally.
With Canada's ex-service men, because of
the preference given in positions in the publie
service, and because of pension schemes in
other lines of employment, it is believed
that those found eligible will be less than
forty per cent. Nevertheless, to offset this
there is the fact that veterans are eligible for
the benefits regardless of their age, if they
be permanently unemployable. Therefore, it
being estimated that forty per cent of those
eligible by age will receive the allowance, it
will be seen that the cost will be approximately $2,000.000 for the first year, and will
increase annually to a peak in 27 years' time,
when the annual cost will approximate $18,000,000. Meanwhile Canada's annual pension
bill of forty odd million dollars will have
greatly declined.
After the peak year is
reached, 27 years hence, the annual obligation
under the Veterans' Allowance Act will
diminish rapidly until it totally disappears in
less than 30 years from that time.
I have had placed in my hand a graph
showing the gradual increase until the peak is
reached, and then the gradual decrease until
the allowances to-tally disappear. According
to this graph, taking 60 years as the age,
between 1930 and 1935 the number will increase from 10,000 to 30,000; from 1935 to
1940 the number will increase from 30,000 to
50,000; from 1940 to 1945 it will increase to
close to 70,000; from 1950 to 1967 it will

211

MAY 15, 1930
increase ta 110,00, which wil he the peak.
Then the decrease will be very rapid. From
1957 to 1960 it will come down to 100,000, in
the next five years down to 70,000, and so on,
until in 195 the provisions will cease to
operate.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: On what basis are
those figures worked out?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not in a
position to say. I have the graph in my
hand. I imagine it is a question of age,
expectancy and mortality. As time goes on,
the number of those men must decrease
gradually until they all have attained the age
of expectancy.
The Bill provides a maximum allowance of
$20 per month to a single man and $40 per
month to a married man or widower.
Honourable members will notice from the
Bill that the fund is to be administered by a
committee appointed by the Governor in
Council, with direct liaison with the Department, through its Deputy and Assistant

furnish the personnel to administer the Act,
and it is hoped that the benefits will be
available to applicants by the first of next
September.
I think I 'have said all that I need to say
with regard to age, cost, and administration.
I might add a few words with reference to
what is meant by "permanently unemployable." I will read the memorandum that has
been handed to me.
The legislation provides that a veteran who
is indigent at 60 may receive the benefits of
this Act; it further provides that, regardless
of his age, if he is permanently unemployable
and indigent, lie is eligible.
The question will arise as to what construction can be placed upon the term "permanently
unemployable." This was thoroughly discussed
by the parliamentary committee, and it was
decided that this is a question which is best
left to the interpretation of the committee. If
it is hedged round with interpretations and
definitions in the legislation, a number of
obstacles will be created in the administration.
Permanently unemployable may be said to
mean a man who has reached a physical or
mental condition where in the opinion of the
committee (based upon a thorough investigation
in the region where the applicant lives, and
upon a thorough medical examination) he can
no longer expect to hold down a permanent
position, although he might be capable of
occasionally doing-like all old people-light
tasks lasting for a few hours.
Honourable members will notice that the
allowance is not payable to all veterans; that
in every case in which it is payable the veteran
must be unemployable or indigent. It can be
2425-141

readily understood that many veterans might
be unemployable and yet not entitled to the
pension, because they might be so situated
that they would not require it.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED

TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: It has been
suggested to me, and I think the suggestion is
a very proper one, that we should send this
Bill to the special committee that has already
been appointed by the Senate to sit with
members of the other House for the purpose
of inquiring into soldier problems. After all,
the Bill is more or less technical, and, while
it deals with a class who are not being dealt
with in the other inquiry, it relates to soldiers.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think the
committee was not appointed, but certain
names were mentioned, and it was understood
that the members named would form the committee.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I thought they
were appointed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No. We could
not appoint a committee to consider a Bill
that was not before us.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend moves that the Bill be referred to the
gentlemen named?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The Clerk has
been good enough to point out the names
suggested for that committee. They are as
Hon. Messieurs Belcourt, Black,
follows:
Beland, Blondin, Buchanan, Gillis, Graham,
Griesbach, Hatfield, Laird, Lewis, Macdonell,
MacArthur, Rankin, Taylor, and White
(Pembroke).
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I readily accede
to the request, and move that the Bill be
referred to that committee. I think the
motion should not be put until we are sure
that no other honourable member of the House
desires to speak on the question.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The House is
in session and any member can speak on the
Bill now.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It was intimated
to me that some members wanted to speak on
the question, and I do not want to prevent
their doing so.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I had wished
to make a few observations, but as the Bill
is being referred to a special committee, I will

than in the House.

Manitoba and the other two Prairie Provinces,
I made a slight reference to this Bill, stating
that the remarks I made at that time were
equally applicable to this measure. I do not
think it is necessary for me to take up the time
of the House by saying anything further with
regard to Bill 41. The object of it is merely to
ratify the agreement entered into between the
Province of British Columbia and the Federal
Government. The respective parties have had
this matter under consideration for many years,
I believe, and I do not know that there is
anything I could say which would throw any
new light on the question at this stage.

from the Post Office Act, and are insert'd in

The Bill also provides for the imposition

On section 1-power to examine on oath:
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I should like to ask
the honourable leader of the Government
whether it is the intention under .this Bill
to conduct merely departmental inquiries
amongst the officials, or whether any business
firm can be hauled before the officials of the
Department and made to give evidence on
oath?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Within the wording of the section, an examination may be
conducted under oath by the preventive
officers, but only for the purpose of inquiry.
The preventive officer who carries on the
investigation will have to submit to the Department the evidence he has taken and whatever recommendation lie may desire to make;
but the Department is not bound by that.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD,: This may develop
nto a sort of Star Chamber inquiry into the
ousiness of any commercial concern in the
country.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend will notice that there is nothing new
in this. There has been provision for this in
the Statute, and such work has been carried
on for years. What is now proposed differs
from the present law only in the provision
that the preventive officer may put witnesses
under oa.th.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Without a
charge being laid, he will simply walk into a
factory and demand to sec the books and
everything else, and forthwith institute an
nquiry.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, but lie had
that right before. In this instance lie is given
power to administer an oath to the parties.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And lie may
call witnesses right on the spot. If other
words, lie may hold an inquiry under oath at
the time of his visit.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. I think the
propricty of this disposition is self-evident: if
lie were not able to carry on the inquiry at
that moment lie might never be able to carry

might be made to disappear.

He said: Honourable members, this measure

for its purpose the confirmation of an Order
in Council regarding procedure. The Order in
Council, which was passed on the 29th of
May, 1929, declared inapplicable certain provisions of the procedure in criminal matters
which prevailed prior to the Autonomy Act,
as I understand it. The purpose of Section 2
is merely to make the procedure fit in with
the rest of the procedure in the province.
There seems to have been no discussion about
this in the other House.

MARINE DEPARTMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 126, an Act respecting the
Department of Marine.
He said: Honourable senators, the observations I am about to make are applicable to
three Bills namely, Bill 126, an Act respecting
the Department of Marine, Bill 127, an Act
respecting the Department of Fisheries, and
Bill 128, an Act to amend the Salaries Act.
Honourable members are no doubt aware that
a new Department of Fisheries is created
under these provisions. The Department of
Marine will continue to exist, but certain of
its powers and jurisdiction are to be handed
over to the new Department of Fisheries;
hence Bill 127. The purpose of Bill 128 is
merely to provide a salary for the Minister
of the new department. Honourable members
will see that the salary of the Minister of
Marine is $10,000, and that of the Minister
of Fisheries is also $10,000.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
A department is to be created?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Is
one of the unnecessary old ones to be
abolished?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand,
the old department does not disappear, but
some of its powers are handed over to the
new department, which, I understand, will
be concerned mainly with fisheries questions.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
was mooted in the public press that there
would be an amalgamation of some other
departments, so that there would be no increase in the number.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT As I understand, the
Department of Marine, while deprived of part
of its jurisdiction, is ta be given control over
certain matters that previously were under
various departments. For example, I understand that all dredging will come under the
authority of the Minister of Marine, and
that the Departments of Public Works, and
Railways and Canals, and perhaps another
department, which formerly had certain jurisdiction in this matter, will no longer have
anything to do with it.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I think the statement
was made in another place by the Prime Minister that there would not be an increase in
the number of departments. I think the
Department of Immigration will disappear,
through amalgamation with some other departdment.

215

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But I do not notice any legislation coming
from the Government for the purpose of
carrying out the Prime .Minister's promise. ls
that legislation to be held over for certain
reasons?
Right Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable senators, I cannot interpret that phrase
" certain reasons," which my right honourable friend has in his mind, but it is well
known that the natural resources are being
transferred to the Western Provinces, and the
bulk of immigration matters will be handled
by the provinces. The statement was made
that the Department of the Interior will
probably disappear, by being amalgamated
with some other department, and it is not
probable that legislation will come beforeI imagine I coulýd say before Parliament is
dissolved, but I will say, instead; before
prorogation.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
imagine it would be the part of wisdom to
hold these Bills over till the other legislation
comes forward.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No, I do not
think so. We ought to put the legislation
through now. There is considerable detail
connected with the handing over of the
resources, the transferring of departmental
staffs, and one thing and another like that.
As a matter of fact, the Bills providing for
the handing over of the resources to the
provinces will not become law until they are
signed by His Excellency, but they were
passed here yesterday. In like manner, I
think, we should put through the present
Bills.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
will notice that these Bills are not dependent
in any way upon what may be done in the
way of amalgamating other departments. I
think these measures before us must be considered independently, and I do not see any
reason for delaying the final consideration of
them.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
was just a sfiggestion by way of caution.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A precautionary measure.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there any
objection to the third reading now?

He said: Honourable members, this la a
Bill of some importance, as it deals with the
establishment, control and conduet of national

friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), I
should like te move the second reading now

Committee might immediately report progress and ask leave te sit again, and we could
take it up some other day.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That would be

one, and contains new and drastic legislation.

DIVORCE BILL (ONTARIO)
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 20, an Act to provide
in the Province of Ontario for the dissolution
and the annulment of marriage.
Hon. HANCE J. LOGAN: Honourable
senators, this is one of the rare occasions upon
which I find it necessary to differ from my
distinguished colleague and room-mate, the
honourable gentleman from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth) upon any question before the Senate, but I feel he is wrong in his
ideas with regard te this Ontario Divorce
Bill. It may be that he is net entirely aware
of what has been happening in divorce matters
in the last few years. When there were only
ten or fifteen divorces a year before Parliament the problem was not very serious.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
first two years.

Four in the

Hon. Mr. LOGAN: There were four in the
first two years, the honourable gentleman
says. But this year we have before us 322
applications, of which 271 are from the Province of Ontario, and 178 of those are from
the City of Toronto. We are now faced with
a condition that, I submit, must be remedied
in order that the affairs of Parliament may
be carried on. If the Bill is net passed, we
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

shall probably have 400 or more applications
next year. Where is the thing going te end?
Are we sent here simply to adjudicate upon
some of these miserable divorce affairs, or
are we supposed to legislate for the general
benefit of the country?
I subrmit, honourable members, that it is
not fair that the work of hearing and deciding
upon these divorce applications should be
placed upon a very few members. As we
all know, there are honourable members in
this Chamber who will not sit upon the
Divorce Committee, some because of conscientious scruples, and others for other
reasons.
The work of considering divorce
applications for the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec is handled by five honourable members
from Ontario, four from New Brunswick, one
from Nova Scotia, two from Manitoba, one
from Alberta, one from Saskatchewan and one
from Prince Edward Island.
In the Province of Nova Scotia we have
our own Divorce Court, and the same is truc
of every other province with the exception of
Ontario and Quebec. The members of the
Divorce Committee are compelled to sit hearing cases throughout the session of Parliament, and even during part of the recess.
I was called back a week or more before the
last recess was over, in order that I might
take part in this work.
The honourable gentleman from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) paid a high
compliment to the Divorce Committee. For
this I desire to thank him, on behalf of the
other members of the Committee as well as
for myself. But I suibmit that it is net a
question of the competency of the tribunal.
This Bill or a similar one to give a Divorce
Court to Ontario has passed this House on
four occasions. The present measure was
recently approved in another place, after having been debated almost ad nauseam. Apparently all the amendments that could be
thought of were moved, but in spite of these
obstacles the measure went through. The Bill
was sponsored not by the Government, but by
an independent member, and it was passed
by a non-partisan majority. Now it is sent
te us, in order that we may pass or reject it.
I shall not discuss the Committee; that
would be an attempt to paint the lily, after
what has been said by the honourable member
from North York. But I want te refer to
one or two fundamental matters that I think
are net right, with regard to the present
system. For instance, the ruling of the Chairman of the Divorce Committee upon a question of law is final; there is no appeal when
he decides that certain evidence shall not
be admitted, for example. The happiness of

MAY 15, 1930
one or the other of a married couple may be
marred for all time to come by such a ruling,
but there it is, and no appeal lies. Such a
condition does not obtain in the courts.
I believe that, with the exception of Ireland, there is no other place in the world
where divorce cases are tried by Parliament.
The United Kingdom, from which we take our
parliamentary examples, did away with this
procedure seventy-five years ago. There has
not been any agitation in the Mother Country to restore trial of divorce by Parliament;
it is taken as a matter of course that the
parties in these cases should be heard before
a regular court of law.
There are many serious objections to the
trial of divorce cases by Parliament, but I
shall refer to only two or three of them. In
the first place, I consider that there is too
much publication involved in the present
system. The honourable gentleman from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)
said that there would be more publicity if
the jurisdiction were transferred to the courts,
but I submit that he is wrong there. In the
Province of Nova Scotia, as I have already
stated, we have had a divorce court presided
over by a judge. Cases are tried there in
camera; there is never a word printed. Under
our system of parliamentary divorce we begin by holding a meeting of the Committee,
to which every member of the Senate or the
other House is invited. There at the very
beginning is publicity to the extent of nearly
350 persons. The evidence is taken by shorthand writers and transcribed, thereby becoming known to those who are engaged in that
work. Then the evidence is sent to the Printing Bureau and handed to compositors; and
later it goes through the hands of the proofreaders. We are compelled to print every
word of the evidence, nauseating and disgusting though it often is. Then this printed
evidence is attached to a Bill and put into
the hands of the 96 members of this Chamber
and the 245 members in another place. In
addition, -there are about 50 copies printed
for certain purposes, as a number have to
be distributed among the solicitors for the
parties. In all, about 400 copies of the
evidence are printed in each case. Honourable members can imagine the extent of
the publicity given to divorce cases by this
method of procedure when they bear in mind
that there will be distributed this year 400
copies of the evidence in each of 322 cases;
which will mean the distribution of more
than 128,000 copies.
Some honourable members may say that
they do not read the evidence, but throw
it into the waste basket. They should not

219

throw it away, for it is part of a Bill of Parliament upon which they have to vote. The
procedure of passing these Bills "on division"
is a camouflage that should be done away
with. The Bills should be given careful
attention, in common with any other measure
that is introduced in the House. However
disgusting the evidence may be, it is the duty
of honourable members to read it.
The evidence in these cases is broadcast by
members of Parliament all over Canada. It
cannot be denied that many members give
copies of the divorce evidence to their constituents. Ten or fifteen years from now the
proceedings in some one of this year's divorce
cases may be thrown into the face of an
innocent child of a marriage that has been dissolved. Indeed, the future life of any member
of the families involved might be embarrassed
in this way. Contrary to the opinion of my
distinguished colleague, I consider that the
publicity that results from our present system
is of the widest possible character. 'Contrast
this with the condition that would exist if
the cases were tried in court. There would be
no intention of permitting the publication
of divorce evidence by newspapers, and that
could be prohibited by legislation, if the legislation necessary for that purpose does not
already exist.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is there, all
right.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: It is not intended that
divorce cases should be tried in court in the
presence of numerous bystanders, but, I repeat, if necessary we could pass legislation
providing that the proceedings be in camera.
In a court of law the evidence would be
taken by a judge. There would be, of course,
a stenographer, who would take the evidence,
and the judge would have a transcript made
if he so desired, but that would be the extent
of the publicity; there would be no 400 copies
distributed all over the country.
In the Province of Nova Scotia, with a
population of about 500,000, there are, on the
average, 25 divorce cases tried every year.
Ontario has about 3,000,000 people, and if the
same ratio with regard to divorce cases
applied, there would be in that province only
about 150 cases annually. But, as I have
already said, there are 271 applications from
Ontario this year, and, in addition, there are
a large number of people in Ontario who receive so-called divorces from United States
courts. Hundreds of people are living in
Ontario to-day in open adultery, as a result
of divorces granted in the United States to
persons domiciled in Canada.

220

SENATE

The honourable member from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) stated that the
present system is probably no more expensive
to the parties than a court trial would be.
Well, this year 178 petitioners with their counsel and witnesses have to come from Toronto
to Ottawa, at very heavy expense over and
above the parliamentary and legal fees. It
might be mentioned, in this connection, that
nearly every petitioner has a solicitor in his
or her own city, and is obliged under our
rules to have also an agent in Ottawa, who is
generally another lawyer.
The honourable
gentleman said the situation would be different if the effect of the Bill were to make it
unnecessary for petitioners to come from the
Eastern and the Western Provinces. But the
fact is that it is only about 800 miles from
Nova Scotia to Ottawa, whereas some of the
western parts of Ontario are 1,200 miles away.
The honourable gentleman said:
If this measure is passed, divorce becomes
a umatter of legal right. Any man or wonan
who deems himself or herself entitled to
divorce, ou the evidence possessed, would then
have a riglt to go to the court and deinand a
divorce. just exactly in the same way that a
man who bas a debt owing to him may go to
the court and demuand payment. But as it is
now, the granting or withholding of divorce is
no miatter of riglt to any citizen.
But I submit, honourable senators, that
Canadian citizen has a right to petition
Parliament for relief. So far as I know, there
bas never been, since Confederation, a case
in which a petitioner was refused a hearing
if ho conformed with all the rules. We could
not refuse to hear a petition. but judges could
make very strict rules for the exclusion of
evidence. so that if would be muîch more
difficult for a petitioner to have his application granted. In one province a judge will
not admit the evidence of detectives at all.
Wherever that ruile was applied it would prevent a number of cases from going through.
There are other ways in which the courts
could lessen the number of divorces by tightening rules. But so far as the Senate is concerned. every honourable member knows that
a citizen bas the right to apply for relief by
way of petition.
In addition to the objection as to publicity
there is the objection-and I think it should
appeal to every man in this Chamber, of
whatever sect ho may be-that when a divorce
case cornes before the Senate Committee all
that we can do under the provisions of the
British North America Act is to cut the
knot. Quite often I hear honourable gentlemen discussing divorce. I wish they would
attend our Committee. They would be very

every

peculiar men if, having done so, they were
not cured of some of the ideas they have. I
have seen cases-many of them-of women,
pure women, good women, with large families,
in which, after the marriage was dissolved,
they have had to walk out of our court to
face the world alone and unassisted in their
efforts to secure a livelihood for themselves
and their children. A women comes from, say,
Toronto, and makes an application for
divorce; she proves her case to the hilt, proves
that the man is a miserable reprobate: we
grant ber a divorce, she goes back to Toronto,
and before she can secure any provision for
herself or ber children she has to re-engage
her counsel, or engage new counsel, and start
an action in a court of law, with all the
interminable delays and the huge expense
involved. Is it right, honourable members?
Is it not cruel? Yet this is what occurs under
our present system.
We are asking you to give a court to Ontario in order that justice may be donc,
particularly to the women and children. It is
not right that they should be thrown on their
own resources when the husband will not do
anything for them. In Nova Scotia, under
the law as we have it there, a judge can say to
the guilty man in the case, "You must furnish
a certain amount for this woman by way of
alimony, and you must provide for your
children." That is as it should be. If the
woman is at fault, before the man can secure
a divorce he should be compelled to see that
his children are properly provided for and
given a certain share of his estate. Even then
the divorce is not granted on the spot: three
months must pass before a decision is given.
during whieh time the parties may be able
to get together again.
These, honourable members, are some of the
reasons why I am supporting the proposal to
establish a divorce court in the Province of
Ontario.
We know that in the Province of Quebec
there is considerable feeling against such a
court, but we are net asking for the establishment of a court in that province. The number
of divorces is increasing very rapidly in the
Province of Quebec. Four years ago there
were only four or five cases from that province; this year there are 51. This shows a
very large percentage of increase within a
very few years. Within a year or two we
shall probably have a hundred cases from the
Province of Quebec, which will be quite sufficient to keep the Divorce Committee busy
without hearing 278 or more cases fror the
Province of Ontario. As I say, the proposal is
not to interfere with Quebec, but to leave it as

MAY 15, 1930
it is, and to establish a court in the Province
of Ontario.
If divorces were heard by a court the applicants, either men or women, would go before
a tribunal learned in the law. I do not deny
that our chairman is learned in the law, or
that the deputy chairmen are learned in the
law; but we are not trained in the same way
that a judge is in the matter of receiving evidence. In a court the judge would be controlled by the decisions of other courts, in the
Motherland and elsewhere.* We are controlled
by nobody; we do not recognize any authority; you cannot establish any authority
over us, because it is an Act of Parliament that
is asked for, and we are not bound to recognize
what is done by the House of Lords or any
other court. We may follow their decisions
as a general rule, but we are not bound by
them.
If a court were established there would
probably be a king's proctor appointed. We
have such an official in Nova Scotia. He
stands there to watch the case, even if it is
undefended, on behalf of society and the
public generally, in order to see that there
is no collusion, and that these cases are not
put through in a desultory way.
As I said before, in the courts cases would
be tried in camera, and there probably would
be a delay before the decree issued, which
would allow for the patching up of the
differences between the parties, if that were at
all possible.
I do not know that I need delay the House
any further. I simply appeal to honourable
senators as a member of the Divorce Committee. We are trying to do our duty. It is
not a pastime to preside over or sit as a
member of that Committee. Anyone who bas
been on that Committee knows that the
novelty wears off in about a week, and that
after that it is the old story over and over
again until he is tired of the whole business.
We do not want to hear any more than we
have to; but apparently we are made senators so that we can try these cases instead
of attending to the affairs of the country.
The Divorce Committee bas met throughout the week, even during recesses, in an
endeavour to get through the 322 cases that
have been placed before us this session. Probably we shall succeed.
After we have heard the evidence, what

without consideration. The whole procedure is
a farce. Why carry ·it on any longer? In
doing so we are doing an injustice to a great
many people of this country.
I submit that these are good reasons for
appealing to you to carry this motion to
establish a court in the Province of Ontario,
in this way facilitating the carrying on in a
regular way of the affairs of the country
The honourable member from Toronto (Hon
Sir Allen Aylesworth) said that this court was
not desired. I would call attention to the
fact that the Anglican Church of this province has been an opponent of divorce almost
from time immemorial, but now it has come
to sec the true condition of affairs in this
country and has passed certain resolutions.
I hold in my hand a resolution passed by the
Synod last May.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And repudiated
since.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: It was passed by a
vote of 82 to 12. If it has been repudiated
since, I may say that I have in my hand the
Montreal Gazette of yesterday, containing a
report of the charge delivered by the Archbishop at the opening of the Synod of Huron
the day before yesterday.' The report to the
Gazette reads as follows:
The present system of divorce, the Archbishop said, was open ta four objections: (1)
The hearing body is not trained and qualified
to sift evidence. (2) The members have not
the time, even if qualified, to do this, and take
part in the other work of the Senate, so that
the work is skimped. (3) The present system
simply breaks the marriage tie, and leaves rumin
in its trail; makes no arrangements for the

expensive.
It is proposed to establish a divorce court
in Ontario, to be presided over by a competent
judge, who would be capable of sifting evidence
at leisure, who would have power also to make
some arrangements for the child, and all without extending the grounds for which divorce
can be obtained. The point at issue is not
divorce or no divorce, not the extension of the
grounds of divorce: but simply the transference
of the question from an unsatisfactory committee to a competent judicial court.
Opposition Is Puzzling
"Under such circumstances one cannot well
understand the opposition which the proposal
has encountered," said the Archbishop. "But
now, let me say that the question which has
been agitating us is something like a red
herring drawn across our course. Whether the
divorce is granted by Parliament or by a
regular court of law, would probably make no

222

SENATE

That is the opinion of the Archbishop of
Huron, given within a very few days, and it is
the opinion of the great Anglican Church in

the Province of Ontario.
I only wish to say in conclusion that the
men most strongly opposed to this Bill are
the men who do not sit on the Divorce Committee and who will have nothing to do with
it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
Archbishop says it leaves children and wives
without any protection being given them.
Will they be any better off when they get
to the Ontario courts?
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
no provision in the Bill.

There is

Hon. Mr. LOGAN: No, but the court, if
established, will have jurisdiction to deal with
that matter.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
court will have only the same jurisdiction as
the Committee now bas.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I do not agree with
the honourable gentleman in that. In the
Province of Nova Scotia and in other provinces they deal with those matters on the
spot.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Surely
the honourable gentleman knows that the
court must have that jurisdiction by statute.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: They have it by law.
We are prevented by the British North
America Act from dealing with it in any way.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The English Act
of 1857, which created the matrimonial and
divorce court, conferred very great authority
upon the court-in fact, greater authority than
existed at common law. If this Bill passes,
the Ontario court will have the same powers
as were conferred by the English law of 1857.
If my honourable friend has any doubt about
it, I can refer him to the authorities I have in
my hands.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I should
have no doubt about it if the Bill applied to
Manitoba, or to Saskatchewan or any other
province that subsequently came into Confederation; but no English enactment which
came into force after 1794 applies to Ontario.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But the Bill says
that the English law as it existed in 1870 shall
apply.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Bon. Mr. LOGAN.

It does?

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: "In so far as it can
be made to apply."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That
does not confer the right to give alimony,
and my opinion is that the Dominion Parliament has no power to award alimony to
any wife, either before or after she is divorced.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at eight o'clock.
Hon. T. CHAPAIS: Honourable members,
this Bill is not a new one. It has been submitted to us before. It has been fought in
this House and elsewhere. And those who
are conscientiously opposed to divorce are
bound to fight it again.
The first time that a Bill of this kind was
introduced in this Parliament, eleven years
ago, it was stated very frankly by its promoter, Mr. Nickle, later on Attorney General
of Ontario, that one of its aims was to
"facilitate divorce." That admission can be
read in the Debates of the House of Commons of 1919, page 1662.
An additional motive is now alleged. One
of the main objects of the present piece of
legislation is to relieve Parliament from the
crushing and ever increasing burden of divorce
bills. And, according to its sponsor's declarations, it is also intended to ensure a better
dispensation of justice and of protection to
the victims of family wrecks. I do not question the sincerity of the promoters of this
Bill. But I say that their motives should not
prevail over the great principle involved, over
the urgent duty of preventing the accursed
evil of divorce from securing a legal footing
in the greatest province of this Dominion.
To leave aside all motives and intentions,
this is the crucial point of the question. At
the present moment divorce has no legal
status in two Canadian provinces: Ontario
and Quebec. This B.ill, if adopted, will introduce the baneful principle of divorce in the
laws of one of these; the Province of Ontario,
where now it is not to be found. Batches of
applications for relief from the matrimonial
bond may come year after year to the Senate,
from Ontario. But no citizen of that province
has a right to obtain a divorce a vinculo by
any law enacted therein. If he wishes to
break the solemn contract which links his
course of life to the course of another life,
he is bound to apply to this Parliament for
a private bill. which may be granted or refused. Therefore it cannot be maintained, as
flic promoters of this Bill have attempted to

MAY 15, 1930
maintain, that it involves a mere question
of jurisdiction, and not a question of principle. To make lawful in one province what
lias been heretofore unlawful is not siniply
changing the jurisdiction, but it is changing
the Iaw. The wording of the Bill settles that

point peremptorily.
title: "An Act to provîde in the Province of
Ontario for the dissolution and the annulment
of marriage." Then, Clause 1:
The law of England as to the dissolution of
marriage and as to the annulnient of marriage,
as that law existed on the fifteenth day of
July, 1870, in s0 f ar as it eau be made to apply
in the Province of Ontario . . . . shall be ia
force in the Province of Ontario.
This is perfectly clear and conclusive, and
leaves no room for quibbling nor distortion.
This Bill enacts a divorce law for a province
that has none.
Let us now enquire about the results of
such a change. The result shaîl be undoubtedly and unavoidably to increase the number
of divorces in the Province of Ontario. That
cannot be disputed. The experience of all the
countries where divorce is flourishing is painAllow me to remind you
fully conclusive.
of what took place in England after the
adoption, in 1857, of the Bill to create a
court of divorce and matrimonial causes. A
writer tells us that since that date 6,381 decrees absolute for dissolution of the marriage
tie had been granted in thirty years, while
the total number of divorces by acts of Parliament during two centuries had been only
317. Speaking of the divorce flood which was
loosed by the adoption of the law enacted
in 1857, Mr. Justin McCarthy, in his "ýHistory
of our Own Times," wrote these lines:
The Divorce Act, judging by the public use
made of it, certainly muet he held to have
justified itself in a merely practical sense. It
seems to have been thoroughly appreciated by
a grateful public. It was not easy after a while
to get jiîdicial power enough to keep tbe supply
of divorces up to the ever încreasing demand.
Thirty-two years after the adoption of the
law creating a divorce court in England, Mr.
Gladstone, who had strenuously fought that
legislation, wrote the following:
Unquestionably, since that time (1857), the
standard of conjugal morality has perceptihly
declined among the highest classes of this
country, and scandals in respect to it have
becorne more frequent. The decline, as a fact,

him:

considering it merely as a social question.
(Divorce in America, p. 56.)
Let us now turn to the neighbouring 'country, the United Sitates. We find ini a very
interesting book entitled "Divorce ini America"
these appalling figures:
The following table shows the increase (of
divorces) for fifty years, in ten-year periods.

We have not got the offical figures for the
last two years. But during five years, from 1923
to 1927, the progression has been as f ollows:
In 1923..............165,096
In 1924..............170,952
In 1925..............175,449
In 1926..............180,853
In 1927..............192,037
These figures are taken from Whittaker's
Almanac fur 1930. In the American republie
ail the different states, except one, have their
special divorce courts, and ini a great numIber
of them the ratio of divorce to marriage is
dreadfully disquieting. During the year 1922
Michigan had one divorce to 5.8 marriages;
Kansas one to 5.7; Indiana and Nebraska,
one to 5.4; Montana, one to 4.3; and in
Nevada, the lowest depth was reached with
1,000 divorces to 900 marriages. Having in
mind those distressing figures, we can well
understand this exclamation of Theodore
Roosevelt:
Divorce is a hane for any nation, a curse
on society, and a menace to the homne.
Can the promoters of this Bill make us
believe that, in Canada, the saine causes will
not produce the saine resuits? The situation
is bad enough in our country concerning the
matter of divorce at the present moment.
But, if this Bill is passed, you may take it
for granted that it will get stili worse, and
that we shaîl tumble down the fatal declivity
at a most dangerous speed. Could we not
read in our newspapers, a few months ago,

224

SENATE

a statement asserting that five or six hundred
expectant "divorcees" were waiting for the
adoption of this Bill by the Parliament of
Canada, to .apply for "relief" before the new
divorce jurisdiction? They were biding their
time in the hopeful anticipation that this
benevolent Parliament would adopt the law
te facilitate divorce, to lower the fence, to
open a new and more convenient road, a
smoother and wider highway leading to that
priceless boon: the breaking of their matrimonial vows anl the irretrievable destruction
of their home.
In the Province of Ontario as elsewhere,
you may be sure that a great many people are
not prone to come here and face the parliamentary committees in order to unbosom
their ugly stories in the presence of that
imposing and awe-inspiring array of parliamentary judges. It could be safely asserted
that whole classes of our population as a rule
do not feel inclined to seck in our solemn
halls the redress of their conjugal grievances.
But give them access to their familiar courts
of justice, tell tbem that they can go there
whenever they like to state their matrimonial complaints and you will see the rush.
I venture to assert that within twelve
months, if this Bill becomes law, the two hundred and seventy actual applications for
divorce before this Parliament will have been
disastrously multiplied to the ominous figure
of seven or eight hundred cases before the
courts of Ontario. To use the words of
Justin MoCarthy, it will fnot be easy, alfter a
while, to get judicial power enough to keep
the supply of divorces up to the ever increasing demand. The facilities, I would rather
say the allurements, of the two jurisdictions
are not to be compared. N'o, it cannot be
denied; to enact this Bill is to enact a premium
on divorce. It is te make it more accessible,
more easily reached, more conveniently
obtained, more instrumental in lowering the
social standard.
Of course, if you believe that divorce is a
good thing, that it is an institution conducive
not only to individual happiness but also and
mainly to social progress, I have nothing more
to say, and I can readily understand the
strenuous efforts to bring it nearer the reach
of the masses. But those who firmly believe
that Christ has taught the indissolubility of
marriage; those who have an undying faith
in the dictates of the greates't Lawgiver who
ever came into this world, and in His
omniscient and divine wisdom; those who
acknowledge that marriage is the most sacred
and the most inviolable of human contracts,
and that its desecration and widespread violation would be the death-knell of the family,
Hon. Mr.

CHAPAIS.

and consequently the m'ost powerful agent of
social disintegration; all those would commit
a crime against the seul of the nation if they
should vote for such a Bill.
I need not attempt to demonstrate once
more the dissolvent and deleterious action
of divorce. History teaches us that it was
one of the main causes of the decline of the
Roman Empire. When Rome had conquered
the world, easy and shameless divorce conquered Rome. The breaking of the marriage
fie became more and more generalized, until
the day when a Roman philosopher, Seneca,
could write that some Roman women reckoned
their years not by the number of consuls but
by the number of their husbands. The Latin
poet Martial spoke of a woman "who had
already arrived at her tenth husband." But
the most extraordinary recorded instance of
this kind is related by St. Jerome, who assures
us that there lived at Rome a wife who
was married to her twenty-third husband,
she herself being his twenty-first wife. (Lecky,
"European Morals," IL 303). That scandalous laxity struck a deadly blow at the
institution of the family in the Roman world;
and, in spreading demoralization through all
classes, prepared the decay and the destruetion of that civilization, once so powerful
and se brilliant.
Fortunately the advent of Christianity introduced a new code of morals. The indissolubility of the marriage tie became the law
of the Christian nations who succeeded the
Roman Empire. And during eleven centuries
it stood the test of passion and of conjugal
unfaithfulness. In England there was no
such thing as legal divorce, and it was only
during the seventeenth century, in the reign of
Charles the Second, that the first, bill Cf divorce
was passed. We have seen what have been the
sad results of the creation of the Court of
Divorce and 'Matrimonial Causes in 1657.
In France there was no divorce law until
the year 1792. Then during the frightful and
bloody cataclysm which shook the foundatiens of the State, divorce was introduced
into French legislation. And its evil influence
was immediately felt in the most disastrous
way. Three years after, in Paris, the number
of divorces was greater than the number of
marriages, and a member of the "Conseil des
Anciens" denounced in a speech what he
called "the market of human flesh" created
by the law of 1792. Under the Government
of the Restoration, in 1816, that law was
repealed and during sixty-eight years the indissolubility of marriage was recognized by
the French civil code.
Unfortunately, in
1884, divorce was re-established by the French

MAY 15, 1930
Parliament and the muddy divorce tide was
up again. In 1886 the number of broken
marriage ties was 2,900; thirty-five years later,
in 1921, it had reached the figure of 32,557.
And I have read in a recent book that in one
single day a French judge had rendered
294 divorce decrees.
I have already stated what is the alarming
situation of the neighbouring nation in the
matter of divorce.
It lias inspired in an
American writer the following lines:
We have reached in divorce the unenviable
position of the lowest level of any nation in
Christendom, and as our statisties infallibly
declare, a lower depth still yawning to devour
us opens wide. Serions minded people must
ask what shall be the end for their country ten
years or fifty years from now. Some actually
glory in this "freedom" as "progress." Sane
men eall it reversion to the morale of darkest
Africa. The fact is our national house is on
fire. (Divorce in America, page 45.)
Let us now turn to the history of divorce in
connection with the framing of our constitution and with the various attempts at
legislation on that grave matter in our Canadian Parliament. In 1864, at the Quebec Conference, when the resolutions which were to
be the foundation of the British North
America Act were discussed, the Fathers of
Confederation were faced with the following
situation concerning divorce. In Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick divorce and divorce tribunals were extant. In the united provinces
of Upper and Lower Canada divorce was not
part of the civil laws and those who wanted
to break their marriage tie had to apply for
parliamentary relief through private bills. In
such a situation what was to be donc? The
Province of Lower Canada was against divorce. And it can be asserted that the Province of Upper Canada would not have been
favourable to introducing the principle of
divorce in her provincial legislation. But, all
the same, in two provinces out of five, divorce
was in existence, and that fact could not be
ignored. The members of the Quebec Conference had to acknowledge it, and to decide
where should lie the constitutional jurisdiction
over that matter. After discussion they de-

cided that it should lie in the Federal Parliament. And the following reason was given
by a member of the Canadian Governament
during the debates on the Quebec resolutions.
On the 21st February, 1865, Mr. Langevin,
Solictor General of Canada, made the following declaration:
Let us now examine the question of divorce.
We do not intend either to establish or to
recognize a new right; we do not mean to
admit a thing to which we have constantly
refused to assent. But at the conference the
question arose which legislature should exercise
the different powers which already exist in the

Now
constitutions. of different provinces.
among the powers which have been already
and frequently exercised is this of divorce. As
a member of the conference, without admitting
or creating any new right in this behalf, and
while declaring, as I now do, that as Catholics
we acknowledge no power of divorce, I found
that we were to decide in what legislative
body the authority should be lodged which we
found in our constitutions. After mature consideration, we resolved to have it in the central
legislature, thinking thereby to increase the
difficulties of a procedure which is at present
so easy. . . . . We found this power existing
in the constitutions of the different provinces,
and not being able to get rid of it, we wished
to banish it as far from us as possible. (Debates
on Confederation, 1865, p. 389.)
It was thus decided that the matter of
divorce should be under the jurisdiction of
the Federal Parliament. On the first of July,
1867, the new constitution came into force.
And as early as 1870 this jurisdiction was resorted to. Sir John A. Macdonald introduced
a Bill relating to the Court of Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes in New Brunswick. It
did not aim at creating a new court, but it
was merely intended to provide for a more
convenient organization of the existing tribunal. Nevertheless that Bill raised a parliamentary storm. A motion was made to
abolish the New Brunswick divorce court
instead of providing for its reorganization,
and Sir John Maodonald felt compelled to
withdraw his Bill.
Five years later, in 1876, Mr. de Cosmos, a
member of the House of Commons for the
city of Victoria, proposed the creation of
divorce courts in the provinces. The Hon.

Alexander Mackenzie, then Prime Minister
of Canada, expressed the hope that the member for Victoria would not press lis motion.
He made the following declaration:
It is proposed to establish a court which a
great number of persons are opposed to. And
although I have personally no objection to the
establishment of such courts, at the same time
I do not desire to afford additional facilities
for obtaining divorces, and I hope that the
resolution will be withdrawn.
Following Mr. Mackenzie, Sir John Macdonald, who was then leader of the Conservative Opposition, spoke strongly against the
same motion. He said:
So far as my own personal view is concerned, I would vote against the resolution, for
there is no reason why we should establish
courts of divorce in Canada. . . . . While
divorce is not prohibited in Canada, and while
parties to domestic misery and unhappiness
might obtain relief, nevertheless under the
present system no encouragement is given to
those cases, and I would be very sorry to see
any tribunal established which might be the
means of inviting other dissatisfied couples to
apply for divorce. (Debates, 1875, p. 859.)

REVISE'D EDITION

SENATE

The De CoSmos resolution was rejected by
134 votes to 5.
In 1888, Mr. Joncs, of Halifax, asked
in the House of Commons if "honourable
gentlemen in this House might be brought
to consider the proposal whether the time
had not arrived when it would be better, in
the interest of the country at large, that we
should be able to establish a divorce court
to dispose of thcse questions." Sir John Macdonald once more put himself on record
against such a proposition, and he made this
declaration:
I am opposed to a divorce court. I think it
would be a great misfortune for Canada to
have that established. . . . . Of course, as our
population increases, we have more divorce
cases, but they are very few and far between
as compared with those which would certainly
crowd our court if it were once established.
That has been the experience of England, and
of those who once strongly supported the establishment of that court, and the transfer of the
trial of these divorces from the Legislature to
the court, very many have seriously repented
their advocaey of that measure, because the
number of divorces, the corruption of society
and the number of collusive trials are increasing, to the annually increasing degradation of
the public mind. (Debates, 1888, 11, p. 1414.)
During the same discussion another prominent political man and jurist, Sir William
Mulock, now Chief Justice of Ontario, took
a similar stand. He said:
I think the facility with which divorces are
granted in England and in other countries does
go a long way to interfere with the sacredness
of the maarriage tie. There is no reason that
justifies, in my opinion, the establishment of a
divorce court for the Province of Ontario.
Divorce courts do exist in certain others of
the provinces. If it is sought to harmonize
legislation, that nay be a reason for all these
cases being brought before Parliament, but it
does not supply a reason for adopting the
suggestion made by my honourable friend.
(Debates, 1888, II, p. 1416.)
After a great many years, the question was
brought again-not exactly in the same
ranner-before the House of Commons. In
1914, and in 1916, a noted member, Mr.
Northrup, submitted a resolution in connection with the jurisdiction of Parliament over
And on that occasion Sir
divorce cases.
Wilfrid Laurier made the following statement:
For my part I rather agree with the statement made by my hon. friend the Minister of
Justice that up to this time the law does not
know divorce, and that we had better stand by
that position. . . . . It is true that there may
be an injustice done to somebody by the
procedure that we have at the present time.
There is no law that we can make of any
exceptional nature at all which will not work
some injustice upon some indýividual. On the
whole. however, such laws are for the benefit
of the State, and I believe that it is for the
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

benefit of the State that w-e have no divorce
law. . . . . I believe that we had better remain
where we have been for the last forty years
in this Confederation, and that the Canadian
law should continue to ignore divorce as it has
done heretofore. (Debates, 1914, p. 840-41.)
Sir John Macdonald, Alexander Mackenzie,
Sir William Mulock, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, these
are great names, and the authority of these
renowned parliamentarians is not to be despised.
I need not recall the later attempts, made
during the last decade, to introduce in Ontario a divorce court. They have all failed till
the present day. And a most remarkable
thing is that, save one exception, these attempts never came from the province most
directly concerned, but almost always from
other provinces. For my part I should not
like te participate in such a move. I admire
the Province of Ontario, with her great resources, her thriving population, her splendid
institutions of science and learning, her
flourishing and powerful industries. I consider
that every Canadian should be proud of it.
But the more I admire that great province,
the more I feel that I should betray that
admiration, betray the vital interests of Onto acquiesce in this Bill,
tarie, if I were
which would strike a dangerous blow at the
queen of Canadian provinces.
I will go further. Even if the Province of
Ontario came, and on her bcnded knees asked
for such a Bill, I would refuse to grant the
request, as I would refuse anyone who would
ask me to give him a poisonous fruit, perhaps
beautiful in appearance. but none the less
containing the morbid germis of death.
We are not called, however, to stiffen our
will for such a refusal. The Province of Ontario is not here on her bended knees to ask
for this Bill. Voices are beard to the contrary: voices in Parliament, voices outside.
One of the greatest organs of public opinion
in that province, The Globe, has taken a
decided stand against the proposed legislation.
Allow me to quote a few of its utterances:
Mr. Woodsworth and his associates are
reckoning without their hosts. Ontario is the
province concerned. The great majority of the
people of Ontario have been reared in the
evangelical
of
old fashioned
atmosphere
Protestantism. They will have much to say
when they learn that facilities for easier divorce
are to be foisted upon then at the request of
the Senate and at the behest of radical members from the West.
Then another, newspaper, The Simeoe
Reformer, has made the following statement

in connection with this Bill:
The tendency with the establishment of a
divorce court in Ontario would certainly be

MAY 15, 1930
toward a tremendous increase in divorces. The
question resolves itself into this: do the injustices inherent in the present system of
parliamentary divorce outweigh the inevitable
flood of applications, the consequent lowering
of moral standards, and the breaking of homes
that would follow the institution of a divorce
court? We think not. Whether in Canada,
Britain or the United States increased facilities
for divorce have inevitably meant increased
divorce.
I do not want to detain any longer the
attention of this House. But before taking
my seat I wish to add that I am not
impervious to the argument based on the
great inconvenience deriving from the unwelcome bulk of divorce legislation. I see it,
and I will not attempt to underrate it. On
the other hand, I deem that it would not be
right, that it would not be justifiable in any
way, to remedy an evil by committing a
greater one. In such a matter I have neither
the right nor the duty to prescribe. But I
am convinced that means could be devised to
alleviate, if not to suppress, the inconvenience.
If this Parliament were not willing to shut
the gates, it could leave them less wide open.
This Senate could make more stringent its
rules on these matters.
It could perhaps
revert to the practice of obliging the petitioner
to appear at the bar of the House to be
examined under oath, before the second reading of the bill. Moreover, Parliament could
make less alluring the aftermath of divorce by
prohibiting the remarriage of divorcees, as was
once proposed in the American Senate, some
eighteen years ago. Other restricting devices
could, I am'sure, be found. But at all events,
by the rejection of this Bill, a great legislative error, a great social evil, a great and
lasting wrong against our banner province,
would be avoided.
Honourable members of the Senate, allow
me to repeat now these eloquent words that
were uttered in this House, forty-two years
ago, by a noted senator of that time:
The subject of divorce bas not been unnoticed
in the public press, but . . . . . let us not
slumber under the conscious feeling that no
general loosening of moral restraints is to be
found in this community. Eternal watchfulness
is one of the safeguards of national purity as
well as liberty. Let us take precautions in
time.
We have ample provision to guard
against the introduction of contagious diseases,
and for treatment should they appear. Surely
something may be donc towards public safety
in respect to a virus worse than leprosy itself
regarding its effect on the social condition. It
is the province of law in the national life to
protect and conserve, and the conservation of
morals is a worthy and noble aim. (The
Senate's Debates, 1888, p. 59.)
To sum up these too lengthy remarks, I
beg to say that whereas divorce is the greatest
2425-15à

enemy of the family, and the most dangerous
foe of the State; whereas the institution of
divorce courts would be the surest means of
disseminating the accursed seed of marriage
disruption; the present Bill should not become
law.
I have therefore the honour to move that
this Bill be not now read a second time,
but that it be read a second time this day
six months.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
like many other members of this Chamber, I
am not learned in the law. I am one of the
class that the distinguished senator from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) said yesterday was best qualiýfied to determine facts, and
so I presume it would not be out of place for
me very briefly to express my views on this
matter.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Mr. Speaker, I
rise te a point of order. The honourable
gentleman from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) has moved an amendment that this Bill
be not now read a second time, but that it be
read a second time this day six months. I
think the amendment should be read from the
Chair, so that we may know what the honourable gentleman is speaking on.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, the question is on the amendment,
that this Bill be not now read a second time,
but that it be read a second time six months
hence.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I rise to a point of
order. That motion has not been seconded.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:

I will second it.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: When a Bill similar to
this one was being considered by this House
some one or two years ago, the right honourable senator from Eganville (Rt. Hon. Mr.
Graham) stated that to prevent divorced or
separated people from re-marrying would do
away with 80 to 90 per cent of the applications for divorce. In speaking thus the right
honourable gentleman showed that he understood well the real cause of this great and
growing evil.
I intended te move an amendment to this
Bill that, if adopted, would prevent the remarriage of divorced persons, but the legal
adviser of this House told me that such an
amendment would probably be declared out
of order; that this Bill recognized the principle
of divorce; that to prevent remarriage would
not be divorce, but separation from bed and
board, and that an arnendment destroying
the principle of a Bill, whether said Bill was
bad or good, could hardly be accepted.

expressed by the right honourabie member
from Eganvilie (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), to

I am not in a position to say. But, as we al

statement.
IJndoubtedly there are particular cases whero
divorces should be granted if there is to be
divorce at ail. But, after ail, the number of
people in Ontario-that is the only province
affected-who are interested in this divorce
mess are comparatively few. We are making
almost a national issue out of a matter that

affects a relatively small proportion of the
people of this province, and I arn not very
far nstray when I say that the great mai ority
of the people who are so affected are not of the
best class. We are spending time year after
year in discussing a problein of general legisiation to, affect a few private cases. On that
ground alone it is not good legîslation. But
I ar n ot going to labour that point.
As a citizen of Ontario I want to say that
the mai ority of the people of that province
do not want this legislation. I say that
advisedly.

SENATE

It will be noted that since Mr. Northrup,
a few years ago, introduced his measure,
which, if I remember correctly, received very
little support from anybody, Ontario members
have fought shy of the matter.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Boys.

There was Mr.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That was quite
a number of years ago.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

It was since

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But on this
occasion it was not an Ontario man who
introduced the Bill, and I may say that the
great majority of those who favour this Bill
are not particularly interested in Ontario. So
the reason for wishing to give Ontario this
court is the desire to get rid of divorces
in the Senate.
Now, what will be the effect if a court be
established? One gentleman said to me today: "Immediately the five hundred Canadians
whose applications are pending in Detroit will
appeal to our courts." We have no assurance
of that, and if we had, I am not so sure that
it is an argument in favour of establishing a
divorce court in Ontario.
We were told this afternoon that the divorces
granted in Detroit have no force nor effect in
the Province of Ontario; in other words, that
a decree of divorce granted by a court of the
State of Michigan has no legal effect in Canada
if the marriage was performed in Canada,
particularly if the interested parties were
citizens of this country. It seems clear to
me that if Canadians, after marriage in
Canada, really became residents of the United
States, the dissolution of the marriage in the
States would be perfectly legal; but I was told
to-day by a good legal authority, the honourable member for Cumberland (Hon. Mr.
Logan), that if those Canadians securing
divorces in Michigan come back to Canada
and narrv again, they are living in adultery.
That being the case, I have a suggestion
to make. I made it to one gentleman today, and he laughed at me, but I am
niaking it in all seriousness. We are about to
pass a Bill in Canada, to some extent at the
suggestion of another country, in order to
make the laws of that country more easily
enforceable: we are going to pass an Act
prohibiting the bootlegging of Canadian

and abetting the bootlegging into Canada of
something that is a far greater evil than
whiskey. Some person has said that that
could not be prevented unless the laws of the
State of Michigan were changed. We are
changing our law, and I submit to the Government that in their communication with the
United States they could call attention to the
fact that the courts of that country, in granting
divorces that are illegal in Canada, to citizens
of this country, are conniving at the violation
of our marriage laws.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The cases are
on all fours, but divorce is the greater evil. I
urge in all seriousness that the Government
should consider this proposal.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is still
time. The treaty is not completed yet.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Would my honourable friend suggest holding up the other Bill
until negotiations for a treaty along these lines
are completed?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am dealing
with the bootlegging of marriages, not of
whiskey. In one case we are the receivers,
and in the other we are the deliverers.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We night prohibit the
entry.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am very
serious about that matter, and I think it is not
beyond the bounds of reason that the United
States Government would call the attention of
its State Legislatures to the fact that by the
action of their courts they are corrupting the
morals of our people and contravening our
laws to a much greater extent than we are
contravening theirs through the bootlegging of
whiskey to the United States.
When we start to take this divorce court
around the country and make divorce more
convenient, what will be the result? I cannot but think that the result will be an increase in the number of divorces granted.
Already our divorce cases, or whatever you
may call them, have developed among both
sexes a lot of window-peakers, curtain-lifters,
under-the-bed listeners, and crashers into
private homes. WVe learn from the reports of
evidence how evidence in these cases is securcd. Such evidence should not be accepted

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is generally
known that we make it as easy as we can to
have the applications presented here. It is
not necessary te discuss that part of the question.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Is that not a very
cogent reason for turning the matter over te
the courts?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No. We can
regulate our- own procedure from the inside,
instead of transferring the control te other
authorities.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The right honourable
gentleman had better go on the Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: As the honourable gentleman from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) bas pointed out, a year or two ago
I made the statement that if it were not that
the applicants wished to marry again we
should have very few petitions for divorce.
Surely no one can say that Parliament cannot
remedy that situation. I have on two or three
occasions suggested that steps should be taken
te remedy it, but that proposal bas met with
little svmpatby. Some honourable members
have contended that regulations with that end
in view would tend te increase immorality. I
cannot follow that argument, because it
seems te me that they would have a contrary effert, inasmuch as there would net likely
be so many engagements te remarry pending
the granting of divorce. J do not wish te
labour that point any further, but I will repeat
that the suggestion indicates one method by
which we could reduce the number of divorces.
Being absolutely and unalterably opposed
te divorce, I take this question very seriously.
No one would suggest that I am good enough
te belong te the Roman Catholic Church, and
consequently it will be understood that no
church influence is being exercised upon me.
But I cannot bring myself te believe that marriage is nothing more than a sort of civil or
commercial contract that can be properly and
morally dissolved by any court. If we allowed people te be married here by magistrates, if we had a hit-and-run sort of marriage, then the courts would have jurisdiction.
Of course, I am speaking as a layman. I cannet bring myself te the point of feeling that
a human court can annul a marriage that bas
been performed by a clergyman, who in the
course of the ceremony uses the solemn
scriptural words: "Whom God hath joined tegether let no man put asunder."
By increasing the facilities for divorce we
take away altogether the incentive te forgiveness between a man and his wife who have had
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

a disagreement. A man who "gets on edge,"
as we say, does net need te forgive his wife,
because he can go and get a divorce; and
a wife need not become reconciled te her
husband, because she can get an easy divorce.
The measure tends te the destruction of the
home. I for one will vote against any proposal or measure which, in my opinion, is
likely te facilitate divorce.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, from education and belief I
am absolutely opposed te divorce. Therefore
I an not going te try te induce anyone to
agree with my views. I wish te refer te only
two or three aspects of this measure. The
honourable member for King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) stated that the legal adviser of this
House had told him that it was net within
the jurisdiction of this Parliament te pass an
Act which, while permitting divorces, would
deprive the guilty party of the right of
remarriage.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me? I think lie has miunderstood me. The legal adviser told ume
that an amendment to this Bill to prevent
the remarriage of divorced peojple would be
out of order, and, in his opinion, would be
declared out of order.
Hon. Mr. LYNCIH-STAUNTON:
That is
opinion from which I diffor. We lnow
that this Parliamnent bas the power to sav who
shall and who shall net marrv.

an

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: He did net state,
for instance, that another Bill could not be
passed.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
But 1
moan the principle can be applied in this Bill.
We have legislated in this Ilouso that a man
may marry his deceased wife's sister. There
is nothing to prevent us frou passing a law
ihat a man may not marry his sister, or anyone else within any degree of consanguinity.
We pass through tbis Parliainent hundreds of
bills by which we enact that the applicant
may remarry. Now, why do we pass such
legislation if we have not the right? We
stultify ourselves if we put such enaetnents
on the Statute Book and Parliament bas net
the power. It bas been contended that a man
should not be bound to an adulteress. nor a
woman te an adulterer. But if that argument
is valid, if honourable members sincerely think
that an innocent woman should be divorced
from an adulterous husband, surely we should
not allow such a man te marry another
woman. Surely if it is in the public interest
te dissolve a marriage because of the flagrant

MAY 15, 1930
conduct of one of the parties to that marriage,
it is equally our duty to deny the guilty
person the right to make some other man or
woman wretched or unhappy. I agree with
the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) that it is
our duty at least to prevent the guilty person
from remarrying. If we were to pass legislation to that effect, there would be comparatively very few divorce applications.
Honourable members, this is a most extraordinary fact. If I make a contract with
someone about any of my civil rights, if I
make a contract to buy or to sell, Parliament
has no power or right-I mean moral rightto dissolve that contract.
No one ever
dreams of coming to Parliament and saying:
"I made a bad bargain; I was imprudent, and
I want you to destroy the contract that I
made."
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: He goes to the
courts.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, he
does not. If a contract is legally and honestly
made, a court can do nothing more than
order the performance of it; it never can
amend or destroy it. It is only when a contract is brought about by fraud that a court
can quash it. A contract legally, properly and
voluntarily made cannot be dissolved in any
court in any civilized nation.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Does the honourable
gentleman think no marriage is ever obtained
by fraud?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The marriage contract, in the eyes of Catholics, is
more than, and is superior to, a civil contract.
Right Hon. Mr. GIRAHAM: And in the
eyes of .some Protestants too.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But in
the eyes of the law of this country it is a
civil contract. Marriage is not made by
clergymen or priests-they are only the witnesses to the marriage, according to every
religion and in every country-but it is made
between the two parties. The man promises
to marry the woman, and the woman promises
to marry the man, and all the other persons
present are mere witnesses. The newly married couple do not get anything from the
clergyman or the priest, except perhaps his
blessing. In olden times, in this very country
and in England, a man and a woman would
be considered husband and wife under the
law if it could be proved that they had agreed
between themselves to a union.
Marriage is the only contract of which I
know where the State interferes to the extent
of saying it can grant a dissolution. I say

that Parliament has no right to dissolve a
civil contract, but it undertakes to do so in
the case of marriage. This question of divorce
is of the very first importance, and should be
given the gravest possible consideration. It
is an evil which is interfering with the most
intimate relations in human society, and for
that reason no honourable member should vote
for this Bill unless he can come to the clear
and honest conclusion that he can conscientiously approve of the dissolution.
It is well known that wherever the facilities are increased divorces have multiplied
greatly. Since the gate was opened in England the condition has become scandalous,
and the same thing is true of the United
States.
The right honourable gentleman from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) referred
to the granting of divorces to Canadians by
American courts. I say that judges in Michigan who give decrees to Canadians know that
they are doing an unlawful act according to
the law of their own country. In this respect
the law of the United States is similar to
ours, in that they have no right to grant a
divorce to foreigners; they cannot legally
divorce any person who is not domiciled in
the State where the application is made. Yet,
in spite of that, the judges know that Canadians go to the States with the intention of
residing there temporarily so as to secure the
required decree. There was a case where a
Canadian left this country, resided in the
United States for seventeen years, obtained a
divorce during this time, and later came
back to Canada. His wife sued him for
alimony, and Chancellor Boyd of Ontario held
that, as the evidence showed that he had
always intended to come back to Canada, he
was still a Cana'dian citizen. The alimony was
granted, and the case was appealed to the
Privy Council, which upheld the decision of
Chancellor Boyd. Those judges in the United
States who flippantly grant divorces to Canadians do not appreciate the great responsibility that rests upon them; they treat these
things as they would some petty police court
cases. I am satisfied that divorces granted
in Michigan to Canadians are not valid, and
that it would be so held by our highest
courts if one of these so-called divorces were
ever attacked with a view to proving the
illegitimacy of any children born after the
granting of the Michigan decree. I think that
representations should be made to the proper
United States authorities. that it is contrary
to the laws of their own country that divorces
should be granted to people who are not
ieally domiciled there.

or against divorce. I think that those of us
who are in favour of a divorce court to deal
with these cases are just as strongly opposed
to divorce as honourable gentlemen who are
speaking on the -other side of the question.
Those who are opposed to this Bill have
assumed a high and lofty moral attitude, an
attitude of superiority over those who support the Bill. I repudiate that stand. I think
I am just as much in favour of preserving
the home and the sacredness of marriage as
they are, believîing that the foundation of all
true living depends upon those things. But
we are human; we are very imperfect, and
we have to meet conditions as we find them.
Do honourable gentlemen believe that if they
were to deny divorce, all the evils connected
with marriage would cease, and that people
would live together happily ever afterwards?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, but
the numbers of such people would increase.
Hon. Mr. FORK: My right honourable
friend the senator from Eganvillýe (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) has toLd us about the
evils that would flow from the divorce court.
I live in a province where we have divorce
courts, and I think the people there are just
as moral, and just as attentive to the sacredness of marriage, as tho people in the Province of Ontario, who you are afraid will deteriorate il you change the method of divorce.
I listened to the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes). He quoted Scripture-and with that I quite agree-and he
spoke about Rome, and Sodom and Gomorrah and their downfall; but I cannot help
believing that he is mixing up cause and
effect. Rome and Sodom and Gomorrah fell
because of their w;ickedness and sinfulness,
and it was because of that that the marriage
ties became weakened. The same thing has
taken place today, and honourable members
must realize that there is a weakening of
spiritual authority. The fact is that humanity
to-day is not so much under the control of
what I might call spiritual authority as it
might be, and divorce is increasing, not because facilities are provided to handle it, but
because people are losing their bearings to
some extent and are living in a state of sinfulness even in their married life.
I cannot understand the argument of the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) that a contract cannot be
broken under any circumstances, but must he
lived up to and sustained no maner what
happens.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not my
proposition at all.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: It is a long time since
I was married, and I have forgotten some of
the promises I made at that time, but if I
remember correctly, one of the phrases was:
"You are to love and cherish."
Hon. Mr. TODD:

And obey.

Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not think that is
used now. But surely there are circumstances
under which it is absolutely impossible for a
man and woman to continue to live together,
because, even though they are married, they
are as opposite as the poles, and there can be
nothi-ng but misery and unhappiness for them.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would not that
situation be met by separation, and provision
for the dependents of the family?
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I have some sympathy
with the suggestion that the guilty party
should not be allowed to marry again, but I
do not think honourable gentlemen have
advanced their cause by simply taking the
ground that under no circumstances can marriage be dissolved. I repeat that I am just as
firm a believer in the sacredness of marriage
and in the sacrednes of the home as any member of this House, but I do not think any
such evils as have been mentioned are going
to flow from taking this matter out of the
hands of Parliament and turning it over to
the law courts of the country.
The reason I want to have this matter in
the courts is that I think it would be better
investigated, and that perhaps divorces would
be more difficult to secure than by the present
method. I looked into the Divorce Committee
room the other day, and, however earnest the
members sitting there might be, the idea
seemed absurd that they were going to settle
the future course of individuals in fifteen
minutes. There are circumstances that must
be taken into consideration when we realize
the weakness and the sinfulness of human
nature.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) made the statement that this
Bill was brought in here for the purpose of
relieving the Divorce Committee, and of
ridding Parliament of these applications. If
the right honourable gentleman had sat in that
Committee and listened to the evidence he
would know that the real reason for the Bill
is the desire to do justice to the applicants.
We have case after case in which we can do
nothing for the women or the children. When
these people come before the Committee our
hands are tied, and we can do nothing to
relieve the difficulties under which they are

living. It is in order to meet that situation
that we want this Bill.
The right honourable gentleman does not
seem to have very much confidence in the
judges of his own province. I think we can
trust the judiciary of the Province of Ontario
with this or any other matter. After all,
divorce is a matter of discretion; and if,
whether a case is proved or not, the judges
think it should not be granted, they can
refuse the application and can make provision
for the wife and the children. Furthermore,
by the establishment of a court we shall do
away with certain people who go around
lobbying in the House of Commons, and even
in the Senate, to prevent justice being done.

within this House members who would resien

am one of then, although my reason may
not be the sarne as that of some other honourable gentlemen. Going a step further,
we have a class of members who from religious conviction will vote against every
divorco bill that is brought before us; and
we have still another class who will not vote
at all. This is a court before which people
have to come, and. whether they are right or
wrong, they are acting in accordance with the
law. I should like to sec all divorce business
transferred to a court where the judges are
not handicapped in the way I have mentioned. That is my chief reason for believing
we should vote in favour of this Bill.

difficulty in that connection. In that Act
there was a section which gave the Board of
Railway Commissioners certain jurisdiction in
connection with asking for an arbitration.
It never was intended that when the Board
asked the arbitrators to give a ruling on the
question of compensation they should take
it for granted that there was to be compensation; the idea was that they would ascertain
whether compensation was justifiable, and if
so, how much. The arbitrators have usually
taken the view that when one of these questions was referred to them, the implication
was that compensation should be given, and
that they were required merely to determine
the amount. The Board of Railway Commissioners have asked for an amendment, so
that the arbitrators will have the right to
say whether there is to be compensation, and
if so, how much.

reduce the time for which companies must

the old Act the term was six weeks except
in the case of perishable goods, which were
sold immediately. This Bill fixes a general
term of four weeks for certain things, or
two weeks for bulk goods, like aarload lots
of coal, while on cattle and perishable goods

DIVORCE JURISDICTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS moved the second
reading of Bill 31, an Act respecting jurisdiction in proceedings for divorce.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill is
one that confers upon a woman who has been
deserted by her husband and has lived for
two years in any particular province the right
to bring an action for divorce in that province. A Bill of this nature was introduced at
the last session of Parliament. It was passed
in the other House, and rejected in the
Senate. It gave a married woman a seiparate
domicile, and the right to bring divorce proceedings in the province in which she lived,
irrespective of where her husband was. The
present Bill is quite different, because, so
far as I can see, it is practically declaratory
of the law. If a man marries a woman in
Manitoba and then deserts her and does not
return, and she continues to live in the
province for two years, she is entitled to
bring an action for divorce. The question of
the husband's domicile cannot be raised, and
she cannot be compelled to chase him all
over the country in order to bring her action.
Under the old law, if he went to England or
Seotland or the United States, the woman
would have to follow him. I do not think
that is the law at the present time. Nevertheless, there is some doubt, and if he went
away and she filed a petition for divorce she
would have to allege that the place in which
she filed it was his domicile.
As I say, there is a great difference of
opinion as to the law of domicile. The very
latest case was one decided in the Province
of Manitoba in January, 1930. In that case
the judge refused the divorce on the ground
that Manitoba was not the proper domicile
of the husband. I have the report here, and
it quotes many English authorities, and they
are almost sufficient to convince one that the
woman had no right to file a petition. However, the case was taken to the Court of
Appeal, which promptly reversed the decision
of the trial judge.
When this Bill was under discussion in
another place, the mover cited the case of
a man from the Island of Guernsey who
came to this country and married a girl in
Winnipeg. He then disappeared and went
back to Guernsey, or some other place, and

239

MAY 15, 1930
the woman was left without remedy unless she
followed him to the Island of Guernsey-or
the United States, or the Philippine Islands,
or wherever he happened to be. This Bill
puts the woman on a parity with the man,
in that it gives her a domicile. My own
opinion is that.it is declaratory of the law,
although in the case to which I have referred
the trial judge seemed to have plenty of
authority for his decision. The Bill passed the
other House without a vote being taken,
although the Minister of Justice opposed it.
I think it is a well thought out measure and
should receive the endorsation of this House.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I suppose there
is no danger of getting into difficulties over
the matter of jurisdiction. In the Province
of New Brunswick we have a local Act similar
to this, which gives a woman her own domicile. I do not know whether the Legislature
had power to pass that legislation or not.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The Bill which
came over last year allowed the woman to
choose her own domicile, and to move around
from one province to another, which was
objectionable. Had the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg, the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. MeMeans),
been here, it would have been his pleasure
as well as his duty to introduce it. As he
was not here, it was put on my desk, and I
was left to father it. If I had had any
authority at that time I should have sought
to have the Bill amended; but I had no such
authority, and the Bill failed to pass.
The present law of domicile is a most
difficult one for a judge to apply. Immediately
before coming to Ottawa after the last recess,
I happened upon the reports of two cases in
my own province. In one case the woman
had appealed from the decision of the trial
judge on the question of domicile, and the
majority of the judges and the Chief Justice
of the Appeal Court differed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was that a divorce
case?
It was a
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
divorce case. The question of domicile is
largely a question of intention. I venture to
say that in my own private practice within
the last four or five years I have had five or
six cases in which the woman was trying
to get a divorce from a husband who had disappeared-presumably he had gone to the
United States-and whom she was unable to
locate. In one case the woman thought she
had located her husband, but he had changed
his name, so he could not be pursued.
Now that we have decided to give the
courts jurisdiction to hear divorce cases, it is

only right that we should supplement their
powers and privileges by passing such a Bill
as this. The question of domicile was threshed
out, as some of the legal members of the
House know, in the case of Cooke v. Cooke,
which went from Alberta to-the Privy Council.
It was finalily determined that domicile was
a condition indispensable to the application,
and many cases that were based upon compassionate grounds were overruled. I remember that in the case of Statithos v. Statithos a
great hardship would have been inflicted by
this ruling, but in the last pronouncement of
the Privy Council in Cooke v. Cooke it was
laid down unqualifiedly that the domicile of
the wife is the domicile of the marriage, or the
husband. This is a very vexed question, and
quite recently in two cases in the courts of my
own province the judges have not been able
to agree.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not quite
sure that this Bill is not open ta serious doubt.
As I understand the honourable member from
Winnipeg, the courts of Manitoba have held
that the domicile of the husband, when he
had deserted, was the domicile of the marriage. I take it that that has been decided
largely, if not altogether, by the interpretation of the law of divorce as it existe in
Manitoba. That is the law of divorce as it
exists in England. If that is the case, so far
as Manitoba is concerned, the question is no
longer open to any doubt. The decision of
the Court of Appeal in that province is final
and conclusive, and the difficulty which my
honourable friend wants to get over is no
longer a difficulty there.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. The Court
of Appeal having interpreted the law, that
decision is binding.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Until some case
comes down to the Supreme Court, and the
judgment is reversed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The case has not
been appealed, and the state of law is exactly
what the Court of Appeal has made it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is a matter to
be decided under the law of divorce which
exists in England. It is not a matter for this
Parliament. I am not seriously opposing the
Bill, but I do not see the necessity for it.
It is not a question of substantive right, after
all, but a mere question of procedure.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
But anything

Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Rigbt lion. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: If
I had heard tbe discussion wbich lias taken
part in it, but as I was net in the lieuse when
the discussion began, and have net heard any
of it, I will say very little on tbe subject new.
But I arn bonestly unable te fatbom the
motives or intentions of these wbe bave
drafted this Bill and are promoting its passage.
Wben a similar measure came te this lieuse
last year it was plainly enough dirccted te
the case wbcre a man bad changcd bis domicile
and wherc, as it was argued, there ivas neccssity
for legisiation w'bicb weuId permit a deserted
wife te establish a matrimonial domicile
according te bier choice, in wbich matrimonial
domicile the husband was net te participate.
Tbis lieuse rejected that Bill, and, from tlie
saine sources fromn wbich it came we have a
substitute in tbe form of tbe present measure.
But now there is not one word or suggestion as
to a change of domicile by the husband. The
Bill applies te the case of a husband wbe
remaies in tbe saine province as bis wife; there
is ne provision te make it ineperative if the
deserted wif e is living on the samne street as
bier busband. If that condition of tbings
centinued for some years, tbc wife might at
seme time want te take advantage of tbis Bill.
There is ne need at ail for the legisiation; for
if the desertcd wif e bas grounds for a divorce,
she can go te the court of the province in
wbich she and bier busband are domiciled.
Se, since tbis legîslation attempts to provide, net fer cases wbere there bas been a
cbange of domicile on the part of a busband,
but onîy for cases wbcre a weman bas been
deserted by lier busband and bas remained
desertcd for the -space of twe ycars, I arn
unable te understand wby anyene ceesidcred
it necessary te bave sucb a law on our Statute
Book. Consider the position of a deserted
wife wbo on the day of desertion lias good
grounds for a -divorce. Is she te be required
te dclay bier application fer two years tili sbe
can bring berseif witbin the ternis of this
Bill? Wbat is the necessity of a measure
sucb as this? It applies enly te wives wlio

bas proof tbat lier busband bas cornmittcd

for a divorce te the court of the province in
whicb sbe and lier liusband have been living?

241

MAY 15, 1930
This Bill is not aimed at the object at whieh
it professes to strike. At least, I so infer. Look
at the extraordinary language of it. It has
been redrafted, drawn with great care, to
avoid the pitfalls by reason of which it was
rejected in this House last year. But now let
us see what we have:
A married woman who has been deserted by
her huaband for a period of two years may commence preceedings for divorce praying that
her marriage may be dissolved on any grounds
that may entitle her to such divorce according
to the law of such province.
"According to the law of such province."
At the present time are there different
grounds for the granting of divorce in the
various provinces-or are the provinces to
determine the grounds upon which divorce
may be granted? It certainly looks as though
the framer of this Bill had such a prospect in
his mind's eye. To me the inference seems
pretty plain that this Bill is but the entering
of the wedge, in the hope that in the course
of time divorce may be obtainable by women,
in at least some provinces of Canada, merely
on the ground of desertion, or incompatibility
of temperament, or some other cause that is
not now recognized.

MILITIA PENSION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 43, an Act to amend the Militia
Pension Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of the amendments to thc Militia Pension Act
comprised in House of Commons Bill No. 43
is to rectify the anomalous situation which
exists under the Act in its present form.
At the present time the Act precludes the grant
of a pension to a widow of an officer who
dies in the Service with less than twenty years'
service, although prior to the officer's death
lie had completed sufficient service to make
hii eligible for a pension if he should be
rîetired t cmtpultorilY. On the other hand, had
this officer been retired compulsorilv just prior
to his dtath, and conseqtenftly been granted
a pension, his widow would be entitled to a
pension equal to one-haif of that which had
been gr'anted to the officer on his retirement.
The anomalous situation is, therefore, quite
clear. For example, if Captain A, who is
eligible for the grant of a pensioi after
ten vears' Permanent Force service, dies in
the Service after completing eleven years' pensionable service, this being less than twenty
years. his widow cannot receive a pension. On
the other hand, if Captain B, who was also
eligible for the grant of a pension after ten
years' continuons Permanent Force service and
was retired with a pension after completing
eleven years of such service, dies whilst in
receipt of such pension, his widow is eligible
for a pension equal to one-half of that which
her husband has been receiving.
The widow of Captain A, through her
iiband's retention in the Service uîntil the

243

MAY 16, 1930
date of bis death, is precluded from. receiving
a pension which she would have received had
bier husbanid been retired. It was always the
intention that tbe wid-ow of sucb an omeier
should 'be ,placed in exact-ly the sarne position
as tbe widow of an officer who at the time of
bits death was in receipt, of a pension, but the
Departmient oif Justice has aýdised that tbe
M-ilitda Pencion A.ct in its pres'ent formi omits
to make the desired provision, and bas advised
that such omnission ecau ouly be cureid by adequate legisiation.. This is the ireason for the
amendments eomprizied in the Bill in question.
At the present time there are no persons
specifically affected, nor is it possible to tell
bow many persous will be affected by tbe proposed amendments, as the number of such persons must, obviously, depend on the number
of officers eligible to be retired witb pension
on completion of ten or more years' service,
but witb less than twenty years' service, wbo
die in the intervening period.
I think a reading of the clauses of the Bill
will miake tbat perfectly clear.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

FAIR WAGES AINDI EIGHT HOUR DAY
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved tbe second
reading of Bill 49, an Act respecting Fuir
Wagcs and an Eight Hour Day for Labour
employcd on Public Works of tbe Dominion
of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, tbe purpose
of the Fuir Wages and Eight Hour Day Bill,
1930, now before Parliament, is fourfold: (1)
it gives stututory authority for tbe observance
of fair wages and hours on ahl contracts for thc
construction, remodelling, repair or demolition
of any Federal works; (2) in providing for tbe
observance of current rates of wages on Dominion Government construction contructs
wbicb hav e been applicable by Order in
Council for years past, the important proviso
is udded under section 3 (a) of the present Bill
thut wages shaîl in all cases be sncb as are
fuir and reasonable; (3) it declares that the
hours of work of persons eînployed on Dominion Government construction contracts shahl
not exceed eight hours per day; and (4) it
applies tbe foregoing benefits also to all work2425-161

men employed by the Governent of Canada
on works of construction, remodelling, repair
or demolition, both as to fair wages rates and
the eigbt hour day.
The fair wages policy of the Government
of Canada was based on a resolution of the
House of Commons known as the "Fair Wages
Resolution," wbich was passed in the month
of March, 1900. It reads as f ollows:
That it be resolved, that ail Goverument
contracts should contain such conditions as will
prevent abuses, wbich may arise from the
subletting of sueh contracts, and that every
effort should be made to seeure the payment
of such wages as are generally accepted as
current in each trade for competent workmen
in the district wvhere the work is carried out,
aud that this House cordially concurs in such
policy, and deems it the duty of the Government to take immediate steps to give effect
thereto.
It is bereby declared that the work to whieh
the foregoing policy shall apply includes flot
only work undertaken by the Governiment itself,
but also ail works aided by grant of Dominion
public fund..
Honourable memibers ought to be told, 1
think, that the question of jurisdiction in this
matter wvas raised at one time, but it bas
been set at rest by the Supreme Court of
Canada, wbich bas ruled that the subject
inatter of wages is, generally, within provincial jurisdiction, but that the Dominion
Goverament is competent to deal witb the
question in s0 far as its own works are concerned. This legisiation, therefure, is quite
witbin the jurisdiction of this Parliament. It
may have been noticed that its operation is
entirely confined to contracts for construction,
remodelling, repair or demolition of Governmeut works.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Yes, it would.

Hou. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
tbon.

That is a ques-

Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: Witb regard to
other classes of contrat ts, the fair wages
policy, which ha been in force from 1900,
romnains in force. But this Bill deals exclusively with contracta for Government works,
or with works carried on by the Dominion
Goverument itself. It would not apply, for
instance, to any factory wbich was supplying
miaterial for works of construction; for example, ironwork or window sashes. or things
of that kind; but if a contractor, to suit bis
own purposes, were to establisb at the scene
of the works a factory of bis own for the
production of articles to be uscd in the undertaking, then that factory would come under
the provisions of this Bill.

244

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have no intention of opposing this Bill, but I want to
ascertain whether it applies to the Canadian
National Railways-to what we generally
term the Government railways. I take it that
the Bill would be applicable to them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think it would
be applicable to Government railways.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But it would
-not be applicable to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, of course.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. That would
interfere with provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Quite so. On
that account, it may not work out very
satisfactorily, although it may be that the
Government has gone as far as it can. I may
say that the principle of the Bill appeals to
me personally, but I am not ignorant of the fact
that there is keen competition, however friendly
i may be, between the two railway companies
in the matter of their comparative construction costs. Of course, in the end the Government has to make up any deficiency incurred
in the operation of the Covernment system,
whereas the shareholders of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. as in the case of any other
privately owned railway, are the persons
chiefly affected by any surplus or deficit of
that company. I have had a great many
communications in regard to tfhis matter.
Some of them are concerned with the fact
that in parts of the West the season for certain classes of construction work is comparatively short. It may be that it is equally true
of certain parts of the Maritimes and of
Quebec that it is necessary to proceed with
construction works with more speed than is
usual throughout the greater part of Ontario,
for instance. In a great portion of the prairie
country and northern British Columbia the
short season makes it imperative that men
should work for longer periods each day than
elsewhere. As honourable members know, in
many trades and callings there are men who
are willing to work much longer than eight
heurs a day, if permitted to do so, but it is in
the general interest of labour that we should
regulate the length of the working day. I
do not know whether the honourable the acting leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has had any communications in regard
to these matters.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I suggest that
there is no intention, as I understand it, that
this Bill should apply to the Canadian
National Railways in any way.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
What are the
facts?
The honourable gentleman who is
acting as leader of the House has said that
it does.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think that was
just an error due to misunderstanding.
As
I understand it, the Canadian National Railway System is kept separate and distinct from
governmental dictation and control, and bas
the same authority in dealing with wages,
hours and conditions of employment as the
Canadian Pacifie Railway. I presume that
the Government would expect the Canadian
National Railways to maintain such supervision over the wages paid and the hours
worked as to insure reasonable conformity
with current wages and fair conditions; but
the Bill, se far as I understand it, is intended
to apply only to such contracts as are directly
issued by the Government and te work that
the Government itself handles.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I may be wrong,
but I take it from the instructions that were
sent to me that the Bill would likely apply
to the Canadian National Railways. I am
sorry that there is a disagreement.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In the result
it would apply to the Government Railways.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
there is any doubt about it. However, I shall
make further inquiries and ascertain whieh
opinion is right.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Let the matter stand
until we find out what the fact is.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I shall be glad
to call the attention of the Minister in charge
of this measure to the observations that have
been made by the honourable leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Willoughby). I shall
be very glad to do this, because under the
Bill the Minister is charged with the responsibility of making regulations, and I think he
will be interested in what my honourable
friend has said.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
When the honourable gentleman who is acting
as leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) ventured the opinion that this Bill
would apply to the Canadian National Railways, did he base that opinion entirely upon
the wording of this measure, or has he been
aided in coming to that conclusion by some
other Bill? I am not a lawyer at all, and
I should not like to set up any claim against

MAY 16, 1930
my honourable frîend's interpretation of an
Act, but I do not read it within the terms
of section 3. Section 3 says:
Every contract made hereafter with the
Governmen±t of CanadaContract for what?
conotruction, remodellîng, repair or
-for
demolition of any worThe running of a railway is none of these
things. The construction of a railway might
corne under that section. But is there not
a difference between a contract made with the
Department of Public Works, for instance,
for the erection of a building, and contracts
for the construction of railways or additions
to railways now existing? These, as I understand it, are under the management and control of the directors. I think there is a
difference. Whether the work of demolition
or improvement, the building of sidings and
that sort of thing, carried out by the directors
of the Canadian National Railways, would
be regarded as coming under this section, I
do not know. But, entirely apart frorn that
question, how can we go so far as to apply
such legislation, as my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) assumes it would apply,
to the management and the daily and yearly
operation of -the system of railways? If that
is what is intended, I question whether it is
wise. The point that was raised by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) is
a point that must be taken into account.
There is a difference between the construction
of a public building for a Department, and
consequently under contract with the Government, and the runnîng of two great systems
of railway in competition with each other.
I should net like to say that my opinion is
superior to that of my honourable friend1 could not say it, and do not say it-but
1 cannot interpret the wording as my honourable friend does.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I read a
memorandum that comes frorn the framers of
the legislation?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my honourable
friend will permit me, I think I can make
a statement that will set the matter right. I
was wrong in using the words "National Railways." What was in my mind was really
"Government railways." I did not at the
moment distinguish between thc Intercolonial,
for instance, and the Canadian National
Railways. I have no doubt that the Bill will
apply to works carried out on the Governinent
railways, and not to the railways managed
by the Canadian National directors.

245

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That would include the old Intercolonial, then.
What about the
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Intercolonial? It is managed by the Canadian
National.
Hon. Mr. GRIESEBACH: What is the
difference between the two? The Government
have been promising for some tirne to consolidate ail those railways under one general
Act,' and t-hey have brought about a unity
of administration.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Until that is done
there are railways governed exclusively from
Ottawa, and under the jurisdiction of the
Department. The reason why this Bill would
nlot apply to the Canadian National Railways, as pointed out by my right honourable
friend the senior member for Ottawa (Riglit
Hon. Sir George E. Foster), is týhat the administration of those railways has been handed
over to the Canadian National directors and
is nlot under the Departrnent. But to the
rernodelling, repair or demolition of any work
that is under the control of any Department
this Act would apply.
Hon. Mr. GRIE8BACH: How would it
apply to the Intercolonial, which is in the
Canadian National Railway System?
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think that
this Bill is intended to apply to construction
and other work of the same kind, but not to
the management or the running of the railways. At one time, if we gave a subsidy to
a railway to aid in construction, Government
labour legisiation applied.
Hon. Mr. GRJESBACH: Even in the case
of a private railway?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think 80, if
Government aid was given.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAGH: Where do you
find the authority for that?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 do nlot think
it could be applied to the management even
of the Intercolonial. That is a Goverumentowned railway. Its accounts are kept separate,
and whatever deficits there are, even for management, are paid by the Government. It is
now managed by the Canadian National Railways, but I think the proprietorsbip will not
be included in the amalgamation, but will remain with the Government.
This Bill applies only to construction work
for wbich men are hired. 1 arn not sure that
it would not apply to the building of a branch
line for the Transcontinental Railway under

246

some contract, the Government having made
a grant for the original construction; and if
any public aid were given to a private line
for construction, then labour legislation might
possibly apply.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
bour inprovements?

How about har-

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think the
harbour improvements carried on by the Public Works Department, under the Government,
would be subject to this Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What about a
subsidy, or a grant, or even a Government
loan?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It would be a
question to decide whether a Government
loan would be aid under this Act. Harbour
Commissions receive money by way of loans.
Those payments are not grants; but a good
many of them, I think, develop into grants,
because the interest on them is never paid.
I should not care to go into that question, because I do not know the answer. But I am
strong in the belief that so far as the management of any railway is concerned, this Act
will not apply. It will ap'ply, possibly, to the
wages to be paid to employees who are carrying on railway construction under contraict.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I ask the right honourable gentleman a
question? When a branch line is being built
by the directors of the National Railways, is
the contract made with the directors or with
the Depa.rtment of Railways?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Generally
speaking, it is made by the Canadian National
Railway Company and is a Canadian National
enterprise, of course having the Governmen'
behind it. Lines such as the Hudson Bay,
for example, have been constructed by the
Canadian National Railways, but have remained Covernment lines.
The ordinary
branch lines, however, come under the exclusive control of the Canadian National
Railways.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Exactly. This language is explicit. It says:
Every contract made hereafter with the Government of Canada for constructionIf a company is subsidized, and under that
subsidy it goes on to build, it is the company
and not the Government that makes the
contract, and there is nothing here that gives
reason for believing that the Act would apply.
The contract is made not with the Government, but with the company itself.
light Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course those are
the governing words, and there can be no
mistake, except the one I made in applying
it to the National Railways. In the end
there can be no difficulty in interpreting the
Act. It refers to contracts with the Government of Canada. In any case where the
Government of Canada is charged with remodelling or reconstruction the Act would
apply; in all cases where that duty is cast
upon some other body, it is quite clear that
it would not apply.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: How is it going to
apply on the Hudson Bay railway? My right
honourable friend from Eganville (R'ight Hon.
Mr. Graham) in,timated that that was a contract between the Governmen(t and the Canadian National Railways. From the explanations we have had so far, it all appears to me
about as clear as mud.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Many of the
labour bodies think that, as the Government
is the ultimate paymaster in the case of
the National System, the Bill should be
applicable to all contracts made either with
the Government directly or with the Company. They are looking for the wider application. That is why I wanted an interpretation
as to how it would apply.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think that is
anticipating. Some of the labour people may
hope that that wider application will obtain
some day; but I do not think it is before
us at present.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: There is a contract to
build an elevator at Churchill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is made
directly by the Government.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Where are we now?
What is the real meaning? My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Murdock) bas followed this
Act pretty closely, and I should like to tear
his explanation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Here is the note
on this particular question that comes from
those who framed and fathered the Bill.

inereases amounting to S3,650,000. In answer
to a question by the honourabile member from
Amherst (Hon. Mr. Curry) the honourable

aeting leader of the Government stated that

the figures he quoted applied to the period
from July 7, 1919, to May 31, 1924, and that
is obviously incorrect. What I should like to
know is, what will be the annual increase
occasioned by the passing of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The statement I
received reads as follows:

That is obviously

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Yes, and we

I have here a

information desired by my honourable friend.

column the rank is stated, next the date when
pensioned, the length of service, the present

and then the increase.
I will read two or three names. The first
one is A. B. Perry, an ex-Commissioner, pensioned on the 1st of April, 1923: length of
service 40 years; present pension, $4,375; pension under the 1924 Statute, $4,690; increase,

of October, 1920: length of service 40 years;
present pension, $2,537.50; pension under 1925
Statute, $2,852.50; increase, $315. The nex*t
name is P. W. Pennefather, ex-Superintendent,
pensioned lst of September, 19M: length
of service, 37 years; present pension, $2,065;
pension under 1924 Statute, $2,380; increase,
$315. There are a number of other names
mentioned in the saine way. The total of the
present pensions to officers is $23,149, and of
pensions under the 1924 Statute, $26,812, mn
increase of 83,663.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is per
year.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is an
annual increase.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have a further
statement showing the cost of increase of pensions to non-commissioned officers and constables retired between the 7th of July, 1919,
and the 3lst of May, 1924.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is that the annual
cost?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, I fancy so.
I have to assume that, because it is not so
stated.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: The honourable acting
leader said that the increase was for the period
bie mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: WelI, it may be.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Which is it?
H-on. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 have no way of
telling. I have given my honourable friend
all the information that is before me, and if
further information is required I shail ask for
it. I cannot say whether the increases mentioned are per annum or for the whole period.
Hon. Mr. OOPP: From reading the Bill it
would appear that from the lSth of M-ay, 19J19,
to the 3Oth of May, 1924, certain constables
and officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police were in receipt of a definite salary, and
in addition they were given a bonus during
the whole or part of that period, but those who
retired during that period had their pensions
established on the basis of the definite salary
instead of their salary and bonus combined.
This increase of 83,650,000 is apparently for
the purpose of adjusting the pensions on thc
basgis of the combined pay and bonus.
Hon. Mr. GREISBAiCH: That is clearly
not so. I could state from memory the names
of most of those pensioners and the amounts

249

of their pensions. The figure mentioned in
the explanatory note is enough to provide an
annual pension of $1,000 for 3,600 retired officers and constables. It la plain that there is
an error somewhere. The honourable gentleman who is acting as leader of the House has
told us what will be the increased pensions
f or some of the higher officers, but I amn more
particularly interested in what increases are
to be given to some of the lower ranks. The
Royal Northwest Mounted Police Veterans'
Association has been advocating for years an
increase in pension for a lot of these men,
sorne of whom are receiving the ridiculously
smali sum of $12 or $14 a month. These are
men who have put in long service and who
played a great part in the building up and
development of our western country. I contend that the scale of pensions paid to exservice men of the Mounted Police is sharnefuily low, regard being had to the amounts
that are paid to men i -civil life and in other
Departments of the Governent. It was
hoped that the Governmcnt would bring down
a measure to provide for increascs for thcse
men, many of -whom are now oid and need
assistance. Nobody seems to know the reason
for this Bill. Apparently there has been no
general demand for it. The increases provided
by the Bill will be given to men who rnay not
need the money so badly, while those who
j oined the Force in the ycars from 1880 to
1890, and thereabouts, are heing treated
shamefully.
As I have already stated, the explanatory
note attached to this Bill was obviously meant
to be sent in with some other Bill. The amount
stated is absurd. I arn strongly in favour of
the Bill, but it f mils pitiably short of what it
should be. I should have been glad if the
House had 'been given information to show
how ridiculously small the pensions will be,
even when based on the combined pay and
extra allowances.
Hon. -Mr. BELCOURT: Is my honourable
friend suggesting that we should postpone the
second reading?
Hon. Mr. GRIESiBACH: No. If the House
is willing to give second reading to the Bill,
let it go. But I do not want to sec the measure
advanced without a word being said about the
absurd explanatory note. If the statements
which my honouraible friend has in fris hand
are put on Hansard, it may appear that a
huge sum of money is being votcd to increase
the pensions of these men, but I venture to
say that the annual increase in pensions authorized by this Bibl will not be more than
$5,000 or 86,000 a year.

250

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think my honourable friend is right. One of the statements
which I have here shows that the increase of
pensions to non-commissioned officers and
constables will amount to $4,652.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That was just a
rough estimate on my part, but I was not
very far out.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, you were not.
It may be that further information could be
obtained, but I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think it is
desirable that the public should know what
the annual increase is to be.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend state definitely what information
he wishes?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I want to know
what this increase will amount to in dollars
and cents. I think that there is an error in
the explanatory note. The House is entitled
to the information.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am quite willing
to try to get the information, but I should
be glad if my ionourable friend would state
exactly what he wants, so that Department
officials may be able'to refer to Hansard and
see what information they are required to
furnish.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
When we come to consider the Bill further, I
hope the honourable actine leader will be in a
position to tell us whether or not we are
putting our necks under the yoke to the
extent of $3,600,000. There may be a nigger
somewhere in the woodpile, and in this preelection period we must be careful.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 133, an Act to amend the
Judges Act.
He said: Honourable members, in explana'ion of this Bill I shall re'ad a memorandum
vhich bas been sent to me.
By section 2, chapter 38 of the statutes of
1927, section 9 of the Supreme Court Act was
samended by adding thereto the following:
'Provided that each Judge whether heretofore appointed or hereafter to be appointed
shall cease to hold office upon attaining the age
of seventy-five years, or inmediately if he has
already attainied that age."
By chapter 30 of the same year similar
provision was made regarding the Judges of the
Exciequer Court.
Hion. Mr. GRIESBACH.

The effect of tiese provisions was to change
the existing law by which the Judges of the
Suprene and Exchequer Courts held office
during good behaviour, so that they would
automatically cease to hold office upon attaining the age of seventyfive years.
Similar
provision could not be made with regard to the
Judges of the Superior Courts of the Provinces
because of the provisions of section 99 of the
B.N.A. Act, 1867, reading as follows:
"99. The Judges of the Superior Court shall
hold office during good behaviour, but shall be
removable by the Governor General on Address
of the Senate and House of Commons."
In vie of the above changes in the law, the
Judges Act awas amended by ehapter 33 of the
statutes of 1927 by the insertion of a new subsection, whici now appears as sub-section 2 of
section 24 of the Judges Act, chapter 105, R.S.C.
1927, and which is printed in the explanatory
note to tie Bill.
The effect of this provision was to give these
Judges the same retiring allowances as if they
had been retired under the provisions of section
23 or 24 respectively of the Judges Act, R.SC.
1927, Chapter 105. In the case of most, if not
all the Judges who held office at that time,
this would mean the grant of an annuity equal
to two-thirds of tie s.alary payable to them at
the time of retirement.
The purpose of the present Bill is to give all
the Judges who were in office at the time the
age limit above referred to was created a retiring allowance equal to the full salary payable
at the time of retirement swhere any such Judge
is retired by reason of having attained the age
of seventy-five years.
No discussion took place in the House of
Commons as to how this would work out in the
case of any individual Judge. If any information of this kind is asked for in the Senate, I
suggest that yen have the discussion stand, and
communicate with me, and I will endeavour to
furnisi the information promptly.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I take it that
the position of the judges already appointed
was that they were entitled to retire on full
salary; the others came in with the knowledge
that they would get only two-thirds of the
salary as a retiring allowance. I take i't that
is the meaning of it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
for it.

As requested,' I
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

have been lessened in area, or restricted, are
the two in Alberta-the Rocky Mountain
Park and Jasper Park. These maps, which I

The only reason the houndaries are specifically

that the new 1)oundaries involved the elimination of certain portions of the Parks as they

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is the elimination of
portions of the Rocky Mountain Park in any
way connected with the exploitation of waterpowers by private interests?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have no specifie
information as to what industry is being
carried on in any particular sect;ion. I cannot
tell whether it is for water-power, or mining
rights, or otherwise, but I am instructed that
it is for one of these reasons that the sections
have been withdrawn from the park area.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: We have the informatien in the Bill. Here it is:
A special examination of Rocky Mountains
and Jasper Parks was made by an officer of
this Department, with a view to the elimination
of any areas which are more suitable for
industrial and commercial purposes than for
National Park purposes. The change in the
boundaries of thmese parks is that agreed ipon
by the Department's representative and a
Provincial representative. So far as practicable only areas which are considered to be of
more value to the country as National Parks
than for any other purpose have been retained
in the Parks. An endeavour has been made to
follow heights of land and water courses as
natural boundaries for parks.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I think you
will find the explanation in the agreements
with the Province of Alberta and the Province of British Columbia. We want the maps
because without them it is impossible to
visualize what is being done. I do not object
to the Bill going te Committee.
Right Hon Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is a very lively and commendable interest on the part of the people of Cana-da in
this matter of public parks. I have received
twenty or thirty communications within the
last fortnight-and I suppose other senators
have received similar ones-caliling attention
to a rather general fear that the parks may
be reduced in area for commercial purposes.
I think there is a very general feeling that
our parks are none too extensive, and that
there ought to be very good reasons for
eliminating any portions of them. The mere
fact that some person has had a water-power,
a mining area, or a pasturage area granted
to him is not conclusive evidence that this
legislation should go through. There may be
some question as to whether that private or
municipal right, or whatever it may be, ought
not to be extinguished in the interest of the
parks as a whole.
The elimination of these portions from the
park areas is not the only thing to be considered. There may be operations set up which
wi'll destroy entire'ly the scenic beauty and
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

the recreational features that inhere in our
national parks. In the face of the representations that have been made, I should not
like to see this legislation passed without
some good reasons being given for what is
taking place. I would mot object so much if
there were agreement between the provincial
authority and the Dominion authority as to
abstraction for a certain purpose, because I
think the provincial governments have as
keen an initerest in the park system as we
have. But there are private contractors and
exploiters who are constantly on the move,
and I think very careiful examination shoulld
b- made of this matter. Therefore, if it is
not assuming too much, I would press the
suggestion that this Biil be sent to a special
committee, and that the officers of the Department be summonied to give such information
as is required. That committee then could
go into the whole matter thoroughly and
make its report to the House. I think that
would be
much more satisfactory than
attempting to pass the Bilil on the siliIht information that we now have.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable members, I entirely agree with what the right
honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Fostcr) says with regard to the advisability
of net reducing the boundaries of these parks
more than is absolutely necessary. It seems
elear to me from a reading of the Bill that the
Government is of the sane mind. Subsection
4 of section 6 of the Bill reads:
The Governor in Council may authorize the
Minister to purchase, expropriate or otherwise
acquire any lands or interests therein, including
the lands of Indians or of any other persons,
for the purposes of a Park.
I think the Department is fully alive to the
wisdom of not only keeping these parks intact,
as far as it is possible to do so, but also acquiring additional lands for park purposes.
I
realize the difficulty of fully understanding all
the provisions of the Bill unless we are able to
interrogate someone who is familiar with the
entire situation, and for that reason I have net
the slightest objection to the consideration of
the measure by a committee, with power to
send for witnesses and make a thorough
mnquiry.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That committee could meet on Monday,
perhaps, and secure the desired information
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps it would
not be possible to have a meeting of the

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is a matter
into which the committee might well inquire,
and if the honourable member desires to mak.'
a suggestion along those lines, he could do so
when the committee meets. I do not quite
understand the assumption or the hint of my
honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) that I was making a special declaration on behalf of the Government in regard
to this Bill. I am making nothing more than
an observation, in the same way that any
honourable gentleman might express his opinion, and I do not pretend to announce any
Government policy; I am merely voicing my
personal views in regard to this measure and
others we passed through this House a day or
so ago. I simply said that as the Bills wc
had passed for the transfer of natural resources
to the Western Provinces contained no special
clause as to when they should come into effect,
they are subject to the general rule that they
corne into force when given the Royal Assent.
And I say that this measure is in the same
position. There is nothing more that this
Parliament is called upon to do. If it is necessary to take any conservation measures after
the Bills become law. I imagine that is sonething that the respective provinces will have
to arrange. If there is any way in which wo
can assist the provinces to get control of
everything to which they are entitled under the
agreements, I shall be quite willing to entertain any suggestion along that line. But
my bonourable friend must not put into my
mouth words that I did net use. I am simpiy
speaking, for the moment, of the reac ion which
I got, such as any honouiable meiber umay
get. after reading the Bill. I am giving no
undiertaking.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I might be interested in anything that has been done in the
very recent past. These lands are highly
desirable and many people want to get hold
of them. What I am saying will appear in
Hansard and will come to the attention of
those who are interested in seeing that these
transactions are pr'operly carried out. This
measure may be full of danger. We do net
know what was in the mind of the Government before this Bill came te us. The Government may have committed itself-may
have taken applications which would be binding on the province. I want to make sure
that the Provincial Government will be protected in the transfer of these lands, which,
I suggest te my honourable friend, may net
actually take place within a year after the
Bill becomes law. How can the Provincial
Government take over the control of these
territories without months of preparation?
Numerous matters will have to be discussed
and settled before the actual transfer will be
effective. I want to see that the game on
these lands is protected, and that the interests
of the publie receive attention. There is a lot
of game, wandering around in that large area
adjoining Jasper Park, where the bears drink
out of beer bottles. They come up to your
car. and if you give them a bottle of beer they
will drink the contents and hand yeu back
the bottle.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What degradation of ta-te!
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Why waste the
beer?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is the game to
be protected? As I have already mentioned,
my words are being taken down and will
appear in Hansard, and I hope-ailthough my
hope may net be realized-that somebody in
authority will rend themn. The honourable
gentleman who is leading the Governient
ought to e carefiil in making statements.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But I submit that
the honourable gentleman who is leading the
Government must net react like any other
honourable member. He should speak for the
Government. We have a right to know what
the Government proposes to do. I draw the
attention of the honourable gentleman to the
fact that by this Bill we are disposing of a
considerable portion of lands on the outskirts
of the parks. My honourable friend suggested
a monent ago that the rcason for the disposal of these lands is that they will be more
useful for industrial purposes than for park
purposes.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: An assurance as to
what?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will the honourable gentleman permit me to correct him? I
said. because some concessions had been
granted in these parks. It is because of something donc in the past, and net of anything
that will be done in the future.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: J have pointed
out the situation to my honourable friend,
and I ask him, as representing the Government in this Chamber, to sec that no scandal
attaches to the transfer of these lands; that
the Government will protect itself against the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I try to b,.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
leave bere at the end of the session and go
to my part of the country with an assurance
from the Government-

MAY 16, 1930
machinations of certain people who may try
to rush in; and, particularly, that my province
of Alberta shall he protected in taking over
these lands and not be placed under obligations resulting from transactions which take
place before the actual transfer of these lands.
Hon. M'r. BELCOURT: 1 arn just as eager
as rny honourahie friend is to see that the
agreements are carried out. I think the Governiment is quite determined to do ail that it
can to insure that there shall be handed over
to the provinces ail they are entitled to under
the agreements. My honourable friend asks
me to give him an assurance that this is going
to he done-an assurance that the people in
his province are goïng to get everything to
which they are entitled. But surely the people
of Alberta have a responsibility in the anatter.
The Govermr-nent of that province is.' I talcit, wide-awake and well able to look after its
own interests. Has my honourable friend
some specifie suggestion to make? If hce wishes
an assurance as to something definite, I shall
endeavour to, get it for hýim. But I must confess I do flot know what he means.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAÇII: 1 wiil tell the hionourable gentleman what I mean. If this matter is referred to a committee of this House,
I ask the honourable member to warn the
officiais of the Governrnent who may corne to
advise us, that if 1 arn a member of that comrnittee I shall ask thern to tell me ail about
the applications that have heen made in the
last six xnonths for coal rights, grazing leases,
ranch leases, and anything else in respect to
these land.s that are being excluded frorn the
parks. I want to know what they are and
what the 'Government is going to do about
them. And I shahl want to know also how it
is proposed to administer these lands in the
interregnum between the passing of the Bis
and the actual taking over of the territories
by the province; and to what exten.t the Government will be bound by applications nowv
being received for certain rights, and whether
other applications may he received that will
obligate the province. I want to know whether
there is a policy for the administration of these
lands next year, between the complete relinquishment of control by the Federal Government and the final taking over by the Provincial Governiment. I arn anxious to know these
things in order that we may try to prevent a
wholesale grabbing of these valuable properties before they are in fact transferred to the
province. It is in the interest of the 'Government itself to avoid scandal, suggestions of
unfairness, or dea'lings which will ne-t be creditable to. it or to anybody.

255

Hon. M.r, BELCOURT: Perhaps my hionourabie friend is aware that scime of the provincial officers are now actually carrying on.
Hon. Mr. GRIES)BACH: 1 have no information at all on the subjeet.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot state it
as a positive fact, but it is my impression that
the provincial officers have been in communication with the Dominion officials for some
time past, looking towards a transfer at an
early date. I do not know wbat progress has
heen made, but I helieve tha-t to be the fact.
May I repeat? I arn thoroughly in accord
with rny honourable friend in suggesting to the
Governrnent that every means possible should
be taken to proteet the property of the province, whatever may happen, and if, in coinmittee, rny honourable friend will make the
inquiries wlih lielias just mentioned, I shall
end'eavour to, have tbern fuilly answered.
Progress was reported.
TRADE WITH BRITISH WEST INDIES
PROPOSED

RESOLUTION

WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed fromn Thursday, March
27, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Logan:
That in the intereslts of Canada, the British
West Indies, and of the British Empire as a
whole, Canada should admit ail tropical produets coming direct from the British West
Indies to -Canadian Ports, free of Customs
duties.
Hon, C. E. TANNER: Honourable mem,
bers, I want to say at once that 1 arn quite
in agreement with the underlying policy of
the motion of the honourable member from
Cumberland (Hon. Mr. Logan), namely, that
it is desirable, as far as is possible on fair
terms, Vo develop trade between this country
and the Brit'ish West Indies Islands. 1 asked
to have this matter stand over, not for the
purpose of being critical or of opposing the
proposition in general ternis, but largely in
order that I might acquaint myself a little
more thoroughly with the subjeet matter, and
obtain a hetter understanding of it.
I thinïk, honouraihiýe *ménmers, that the prýoposai is a step in the right direction, and is,
perhaps, particularly opportune at this time,
in vjew of the rather remarkahle and adverse
attitude of the British Governrnent in regard
to, the preference not only to the Empire in
generai, but to these very islands in particular. There is at the present moment, I think,
very bitter disappoilitment in the British
West Indies Islands in regard to the alrnost
unfriendly attitude of the Government of
Great Britain; consequently the time may be

256

SENATE

very opportune for Canada to do whatever can
be done fairly, and upon fair terrns, to increase and develop the trade between this
country and those islands.
I am not at this stage going into any
detailed discussion, in view of the fact that
the Government, under its tariff resolutions,
has adopted, in part, the suggestion contained
in the motion of my honourable friend. I
am going to make only a very brief reference
to a few features that appeal to me in considering the subject.
Prior to 1925, of course, we had treaties with
the British West Indies Islands, and I find
on looking up the records-and it is as well
to put it on Hansard-that under the old
treaty of 1920, and between 1922 and 1925,
there was a greater increase in the trade between Canada and the British West Indies
than there was between 1925 and 1929 under
the treaty now in existence. Between 1922
and 1925 the increase was $10,000,000; between
1925 and 1929 it was $3,500,000.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: Is the honourable gentleman aware that the treaty did not corne into
effect until 1927?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I know that, but I arm
taking these figures because, as J am going to
point out, there 'has not been any very marked
change in the volume of trade. For instance,
I find that for the eleven months period
ending February 28, 1929, the trade figures
were $36,703,719; then I find that for a similar
period ending the 28th of February, 1930,
they were $34,844,754, showing a slight decrecase.
As I say, I am submitting these
figures not for purposes of criticism, but for
purposes which I shall point out later on.
I find, as against that, that the trade of the
United States with the British West Indies
Islands increased between 1926 and 1929 by
almost $2,000,000. Just here I want to read
the view of the Department of Commerce
of the United States on the question of trade
with the islands. I an quoting from the Commerce Reports of April 7, 1930.
During 1929 the United States increased the
sale of its products in Jamaica to $9,131,010
as compared with $8,140,68'6 in 1928. An even
greater percentage of gain was noted in the
market of Trinidad and Tobago, sales increasing from $4,717,034 in 1928 to $6,735,923 in
1929. The anticipated Canadian competition in
the area, aided by the increased Canadian
shipping facilities, has not as yet had any
noticeable effect on United States exports.
The Amerian products continue to find increasing favour in the island markets and a
future expansion of trade is to be expected.
Increased communications, both steamship and
air mail, afford greater facilities te the
American shipper, particularly
from the
southern and Gulf ports of the United States.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

I have read that for the purpose of reminding honourable senators that we must be
on our guard, because we have very keen
competitors for that business, and must
be wide-awake if we want to get our fair
share of it.
In that connection I was a
little surprised to find the increasing amount
of Canadian exports to the West Indies that
do not go directly to those islands. We have
invested under the treaty of 1925, I believe,
about $11,000,000 in the new steamship service.
This is a very excellent service, and I am
not saying a word except in approval of it.
Last year, in 1929, this West Indices steamship
system suffereid an operating loss of $1,117,896.48. This year, according to the 1930
Estimates submitted to Parliament, the deficit
willl be approximately $900,000. The deficit
for 1929 vas larger than was estimated, and
it may be reasoned, therefore, that the deficit
in 1930 may also exceed the estimate. However, I am pointing out that we have a large
capital investment, that those steamers are
operating at a very considerable loss, and that
we have there another reason to be wideawake and to sec what .can be done in this
country to develop that trade, cut down the
losses and improve our situation generally.
These steamers, of course, cater largely to
passenger trade, and they do it excellently;
they are very popular; but I think it is
elementary to say that the money must be
earned by the carrying of freights, and that
therefore we must try to develop a freight
business between this country and those
islands.
The other day I read an interesting item
from Bermuda which intimated that there
was an appreciation there of the action of
the Government of this country in putting
certain tropical products on the free list. I
was curious enough to look to sec what had
happened last year, and I found that in 1929
the United States bought from the West
Indies $400,000 less of goods, and sold to
them $700,000 more than they did in 1926.
So there is another suggestion: that it is
necessary to look after this business-and in
a moment I am going to point, out just one
way in which I think that can be done.
Another point in dealing with the export
by the United States is this. I find that in
1922 Canadian exporters sent to the West
Indies, through United States ports, only
$1,163,000 worth of goods, whereas in 1929
they sent through those ports $4,026,402 of
Canadian products.
I suggest that this is
another matter of whioh we should take
cognizanoe, and that whatever can be done
should be donc to direct that trade with the
islands through Canadian ports and on Cana-

MAY 16, 1930
dian steamers, instead of having it go through
American ports and in American bottoms. I
see there a method of reducing the deficit
on our steamship service.
I do not want to take up much time at
this stage, but I may say that I was rather
interested in ebserving that since 1925 one
of the products largely exported from Canada
to the West Indies Islands was whiskey. We
seem to be doing a thriving business in that
commodity down there. In the reports furnished me by the Statistical Department I
find that of all our exporta that shows greatest
growth. For instance, in 1925 we sent them,
in round figures, 200,000 gallons, and in 1929,
634,000 gallons. During the elevenmonth
period ending February 28, 1929, we sent them
509,000 gallons, and in a similar period ending
February 28, 1930, we sent 608,000 gallons. I
am not saying that there were not increases
in other classes of goods; but to go into
those items would take more time than is
at my disposal. There were increases in
automobiles and accessories, and several other
items; but this is the most striking item in
the whole of our exporta to the islands.
I do not know whether we are prepared to
go so far as to abolish the duties and admit
British West Indies products into this country
free. I secured a statement of exports and
imports for the year 1928, the last year for
which these figures are available, and it shows
that we shipped to the British West Indies
in that year goods, not including spirits and
tobacco, to the value of $18,996,353, on which
the islands collected duties of $1,767,287;
whereas our total imports from them for that
year amounted to $23,416,643-this is also exclusive of spirits and tobacco-and our duties
amounted to only $1,566,612. Perhaps this
will suggest that we should secure more favourable terms from the islands in the matter
of their tariff.
In Nova Scotia there is a considerable difference of opinion as to whether the treaty of
1925 is as fair to Canada as it should be. I
do not pretend to be able to express an
opinion upon that question, because I am not
familiar with it. I suggest that some steps
should be taken with a view to determining
whether that contention is well founded. It
is felt that the treaty is particularly unfair
as regards sugar; but here again I cannot pretend to make an authoritative statement. The
opinion is widely held in my province that
the sugar producers in the West Indies absorb
the preference and that Canadians do not
get the benefit by way of reduced prices.
Some men who have large interests in the
sugar business in this country go so far as

257

to say that the result of the treaty is a loss
of about $3,000,000 a year to Canada, on
account of the sugar preference. My reason
for making these statements is that I hope
that they will be looked into.
In reading the report of the Conference of
1925 I find that a number of the representatives of the West Indies stated that Canadian
business men did not go to the islands in
search of business. One of them, if I remember correctly, spoke to this effect: "The Islands
swarm with men from the United States looking for business, but we never see a Canadian
at all." Now, if that is so, it is a fault, not
of the Government, but rather of our own
people. If we do not go after business we
cannot expect to get it, notwithstanding our
operation of steamers and expensive advertising and other such methods. If our manufacturers and dealers are content to let their
American competitors build up trade, we must
expect to be the losers.
I shall not detain honourable members much
longer, but I should like to repeat that I am
in sympathy with the desire to develop trade
with the islands. I commend my honourable
friend from Cumberland (Hon. Mr. Logan)
for bringing the matter up here and making
possible the discussion that there has been.
He has in part succeeded in his object. I am
going to suggest to him that I think the
matter is of sufficient importance to be investigated in a great deal more detail, and
that, should we live to return for another
session of Parliament, excellent work could be
donc if my honourable friend were to move
for and secure the appointment of a special
committee of the Senate to consider the whole
ground of trade with the West Indies and
make suggestions as to ways and means by
which that trade could be improved.
Hon. IANCE J. LOGAN: Honourable
senators, I desire to place on Hansard a few
figures which I think will correct the inference
drawn by my honourable friend from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) with regard to the results
of the treaty of 1925. I hold in my hand
statistics of trade between Canada and the
British West Indies in the years 1925 to 1929,
inclusive. Although the treaty was made in
1925, it did not come into force until, I think,
July, 1927. Canada's domestic exports to the
British West Indies in 1926, the year before
the treaty came into effect, amounted to
$17,207,130. In 1929 they had increased to
$20,524,366-an increase of over $3,000,000. The
imports from the British West Indies in 1926
amounted to $14,823,745, and in 1929 to
$20,638,916-an increase of nearly $6,000,000.

2425--17
REVISED EDITION

258

SENATE

I regret that the British West Indies have
not put into operation a policy similar to
ours, by providing that goods, in order to
receive the preference, must come into t/hat
country êeet from Canada. I believe there
was recently introduced in the Legislature
of Jamaica a Bfll to provide for such a plan.
If goods are exported from Canada to the
British West Indies via the United States it
is the fault of the British West Indies.
The percentage of goods coming into Canada
from the West Indies through United States
ports decreased from 6.3 in 1926, to .06 in
1929.
When I was speaking previously on this
matter I referred to the development of trade
between the United States and Porto Rico
as an example of what may be done between
Canada and the British West Indies. Porto
Rico became a part of the United States in
1901. From that time American goods were
admitted to Porto Rico free of duty, and the
United States treated imports frcm Porto
Rico in the same way. I should like to sec
a similar arrangement between Canada and
the British West Indies. The growth of trade
between the United States and Porto Rico
since 1901 is shown in the following table:

In twenty-seven years the annual imports
from the United States increased by about
$75,000,000, and the exports to the United
States by about $92,000,000. It seems to me
that this is a good incentive for us in this
country.
As I have stated before, I desire, not to
press this question, but only to have the matter
discussed. I think that the suggestion of the
honourable member from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) is a good one, and that it would be
advisable at the next session of Parliament to
have a committee appointed to go into the
whole question of trade with the West Indies.
Since our previous discussion on this matter
I have been much pleased to sec that the
Minister of Finance has placed upon the free
list nearly all the tropical products of the
British West Indies. In his budget speech
in another place he said:
Hon. Mr. LOGAN.

All fresh fruits are to be granted free entry
under the British preferential tariff; here again
the Government has kept in mind the possibilities of greatly extended trade with Bermuda
and the West Indies Islands and has taken
another step in the direction commenced two
years ago when free entry was accorded bananas
imported direct from the islands. So far as
possible, Canada desires to purchase from these
British islands to the south those fresh fruits
which they are capable of supplying to this
market.
That covers a very large part of the matters
referred to in my resolution, leaving out of
consideration practically only three products;
namely, rum, sugar and tobacco. With regard
to sugar, I think this is a matter which should
be given very full consideration. We intended
to deal with it at the last conference, but it
was not reached in the discussion. However,
if we have a cammittee, as suggested by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Tanner), at the
next session of Parliament, this is one matter
which should be taken up. I do net pretend
to have definite information on the subject,
but I know there is a great difference of
opinion between the average man who is
interested in the subject and the producers.
If we had a special committee we could thresh
out the whole question and perhaps make
better arrangements with the people of the
West Indies.
This would meet with the
wishes of most of the people down there, and
would result in cheaper sugar for Canadians.
I am not very much concerned with the question of rum. Perhaps the tobacco trade is
worthy of much further development. However, now that there have been made in the
recent Budget the provisions to which I have
referred, I ask leave of this honourable House
to withdraw my motion.
The motion was withdrawn.

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
On the Order:
The House again in Committee of the Whole
on Bill 135, an Act respecting National IParks.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Hon-ourable members, affer this Bill was moved into Committee
of the Whole the other day, my right honourable frîend opposite (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) urged that it should be sent te a
special committee. I suggest to my right
honourable friend that there is now, perhaps,
no necessity for a reference to a special coinmittee, inasmuch as I arn authorized. by the
Government te say that the areas that have
been taken out are to remain under the
administration of the Federal Government,
and no privilege of any kind will be granted
by the Government et Ottawa until the whole
transfer of the natural reseurces is censummated. It was, as I understand, beeause of
a desire to have a statement in this cennectien that some honourable gentlemen opposite
thought the Bill ought te be referred te a
special committee. I see no other reason for
such a reference. 1 wonder whether my
honourable friends are willing te have the
special oommittee dispensed with, and the
Bill considered in Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think my
honourable friend is correct in his understanding as to the primary reason for wanting to
have the Bill sent to a special committee. In
2425-17.1

259

view of the statement authorized by the
Government, that the lands te be detaehed
from the parks and transferred to the provinces are net in any way to be deait with
in the interval by the Dominion Government,
perhaps the one point that now needs to be
considered is that there is a great deal of
game on those lands, seine of which are in
the foothills. Not only should the Government refrain from. alienating the lands, or
dealing with them, commercially or otherwise,
as proprietors, but it should suppîy protection,
particularly protection for the game. I think
we ought te have it clearly understood that
the game will be protected until such time as
the Provincial Government of Alberta takes
the lands over.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn instructed
that the protection of game is a matter which
will immediately fali under the jurisdiction of
the provinces. They will have to look te
the protection of the game in these areas.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Are the parks being
turned over te the provincial governments?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The purpose of
this Bill is te transfer to the provinces certain
portions of the parks. The parts taken eut,
whose boundaries are determined, will become
the preperty and will be under the exclusive
*ursdictien of the provinces when the Irnperial Parliament approves of this legislation.
As soon as that is done, the provinces wil
take possession and have sole and exclusive
control.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What about the
interval? That is just the point.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is with regard
te grants. With regard te game, the agreement or understanding is that the provinces
will have control immediately this Bill
passes.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If that be
the case. there is ne objection at all te thie
Bill passing, and thQre is no necessity of going
into Committee.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do net understand
what the honourable gentleman says. I understood that the parks themselves were te
remain Dominion property, but that the
lands eliminated fromn the parks were te go
te, the province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Certain portions
of the areas that formerly constituted these
parks 'bave been taken eut and will rernain
hereafter under the administration of the
Dominion, as part of the Crewn lands.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
themselves?

That is the parks

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: How long is it since
the shaded parts have been taken out of the
parks?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The boundaries
were fixed some time ago, but of course they
are not out yet: they can be taken out only
when the legislation is completed.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is some confusion-in my own mind,
probably-about this matter. Let us see if we
can come to clear conclusions on it. I understand that the management of the public
parks, which has been heretofore in the hands
of the Dominion Government, is continued in
those hands. Is that clear?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Quite clear.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And it is provided by this Bill that certain
portions of what have heretofore been public
parks, under the management of the Federal
Government, are now detached from the public parks-and by so much the area of the
parks is diminished-and those lands, as I
understand, will be transferred to the different
provinces in which they are situated.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Quite so.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And will then come under the management
of the provincial administrations?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Yes.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What about the statement. which I understood
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
to have made, that the provincial governments
will have something to do with the management of the gaine in public parks? You surelv
cannot have a divided jurisdiction in what is
one of the essentials of the public parks, that
is, the preservation of all the wild game of
Canada in those parks. It is not desirable to
have a Provincial Government and the Dominion Government both administering the
game laws. In such a case the laws may or
may not be uniform. They should be under
the one administration. Perhaps I have been
mistaken in what I understood from my honourable friend's remarks.
But there is, outside all that, this question
that strikcs me: Why is it that certain portions have been chosen to be eliminated from
the parks themselves? Is it because mining
areas have been found in those parks and those
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

are to be used for commercial purposes? Or
has any form of production or enterprise been
the cause? What are the aims? We here in
these seats are ninety members with heads
upon our shoulders. and we should like to
know why it is that these changes are being
made. We do not know now. The scenic
beauty, the preservation of the game and the
integrity of the forests are the three principal
aims in the management of the sstem of
public parks. If we are going to cut into
a park here and there and set up a vast milling industry, or a vast mining enterprise, will
these militate against the benefits conferred by
the parks. or make it more difficult to preserve
or to administer them? It is all very well
for us to pick out every resource that God
bas given us, and dispose of it as quickIy
as possible, in order to produce more metals
and pulp, and the like of those. In our country there ought to be some areas which are.
in a manner, sacred; and I think they should
be as large and as well distributed as possible,
and that about them there should be a demobilized area, so to speak-a neutral zone
free from the whirring of wheels and all the
activities common to mining and similar industrial enterprises. Set down a modern mining village to grow into a town in the heart
of a public park, and I think you have a
settlement which is prejudicial to the park
itself, and to the proper management of the
park.
It bas been said there is no need for a
committee. Maybe there is not, but we all
have a naturaI curiosity to know why a thing
is being done, and I do not think it would
be very much out of the way to have a committee who could inquire into what is being
donc, and, by conversation across the table,
get at information which it is impossible for
us to obtain here. Therefore, if there is no
insuperable objection, as we have time on
our hands, I do not sec why we should not
carry out the purpose we had in mind at our
last sitting by the appointment of a committee to engage in a round table conversation
on this whole matter.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable members, I have listened to the right honourable
gentleman and I think he has made a very
good case, as he usually does. He has spoken
of the advisability of koeping nature in its
primeval state. But I should like to ask him
a question. Suppose there were a very valuable
mine in one of these parks-I am merely asking a question-would he consider it in the
publie interest to leave that valuable thing
dormant for generations and generations?

MAY 19, 1930
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
will answer my honourable friend. 1 do flot
think it is necessary for ils to go at a double
trot, or a strong pace, witb an avaricious desire
to get at the entrails of everything that is in
the natural banks of this great country of ours.
I do not think it wo.uld harm anybody if some
gc.od mining areas were kept intact for the
people themselves until a time very remote
from this. God knows there are plenty of
mines upon which to base mining company
prospectuses, selling on margins, and other
operationsi, including th-- muleting of the
people. After ail, a mine is a great thing. IV
belongs to the country; it is a bank in which
thare is solid material-guld, silver. or othar
valuable matais, as the rase may ha. Why
should we ba in sucli a furious rush to open
tu the exploiter every une of the areas of
hidden treasure? Surelv there are enougli
mining- areas outside the parks system to,
engage the anergy and tax the ingenuity of
the exploiters and the seekers after gold. But
Vo answer the question from my own point of
viaw: yes, I would lock up that treasure for a
while. It will not spoil; it will keep. And
I think there is sornething- else in this country
besidas the mere whirring- of machinery, the
gouging out of the resourcas that God lias
given us, and our getting rid of thamn just as
quickly as we possiblv can.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I understood that large
areas had been set aside in Saskatcliewan. I
do not see any referance to them in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Hlon. Mr. GILLIS: There is no reference to
it in this Bill, is there? 1 was just wondering
if it had been Vurnad over Vo the province
with ahl the other resources.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my honourable
friand will rafer Vo section 3, Part 1, on page
2 of the Bill, I Vhink lie will find the answer.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
senators, I tliink rny riglit honourable friand
the junior senator from Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Fostar) was at one ime, lika
mysealf, a membar of a Governmamt which for
many years atteînptad to straigliten out the
natural resources difficulty. I amrn ot telling
talcs out of school when I say that we thouglit
we had practically settled the Alberta problemn andi had corne to an arrangement, but
certain disagreceants, largaly as Vo detail,
arosa 'and prevented a conclusion of the agreement. The provinces of the West have been

that unleas sorne tangible objection can be
taken to, thesa agreements, we ought to
hasten thern through lest somebody sliould
arise and point to a slight fault in datail that
would rasult in tha arrangements falling
througli. This is the first tima in tlie history
of all tliese negotiations whan the interested
parties have arrived at agreements apparentiy
satisfactory to ahl.
Now, as Vo tbe garne, as a matter of fact
the provincial au.thoritias look after the gamne
in every province, if I amn noV mistaken._
Hon. Mr. GASGRAIN: Yes.
Except in
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
parts whera tlie proprietorsh-ip of the land is
still retained under Federal authority; and
aven where that is the casa, in sorne smal
areas, it wiIl lia foiînd, 1 think, that tha
provincial governrnants liave enforced the
game laws. The Federai authorities are
responsible for the protection of the gama in
the parks; ail that will pass undar tha control
of the provinces is the gama that mnay ba
found in those portions that are being detached.
A considerahie area is baïing taken
from the parks, but it must ha rernernberad
-and again I arn noV Velling any talcs out of
sehool-that tlie provinces ware eager Vo have
the entira park area.
That was discussed
tima and t.ime again, but the Dominion Governrnant wou-ld noV agree Vo go so far, halieving thay fhad a re-zponsibility iii these
federally owvned lands.
They have gone a
certain distance and have given some of
thesa areas Vo the provinces. IV is stated tliat
this wiIi not detract frorn the beauty of the
parks. I do noV think anyona wouid wish Vo
sc anything donc that woiild have such an
affect. Bu~t the provinces-e in particularbelieve that certain areas that are not assenVial to, tha beauty of tha parks should be
detache-d and placed under provincial control. This being so, wa are noV in a very
good position Vo say, "Tlie property is yours,

will immediately pass to the provinces. The
transfer of authority will not be delayed until
a Bill approving such action is pased by the
Imperial Pariamenit.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I add to what
My right honourable friend has said, that it
was at the request of the provinces that these
areas were eliminated from these parks in
order to form part of the natural resources to
be handed over to the provinces. When the
provinces found that the Dominion Government was opposed to handing over the parks
as a whole, they asked that the portions which
have since been eliminated should be transferred to them as part of their natural resources, and, in compliance with their desire,
the agreements provide for this.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Where
Prince Albert Park provided for?

is the

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT (reading):
3. (1) The Dominion Parks as establisied
under the provisions of the Dominion Forest
Reserves and Parks Act, ehapter seventy-eight,
Revised Statutes of Canada. 1927, with the
exception of Fort Howe and Vidals Point and
Menissawok Parks. are hereby set apart as
National Parks of Canada, except that the
Rocky' Mountains Park, whieh shall hereafter
be known as the Banff Park, and the Jasper.
Voio, Glacier and Fort Beauséjour Parks shall
comprise the areas as described in the schedule
to this Act; and all those parcels or tracts of
land which heretofore formied a part of the said
Parks. but which are outside the boundaries of
said Parks as described in said schedule, are
hereby withdrawn fron the said Parks.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That park remains as it was.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is much
cogency in the remark of the right honourable
the junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) ; but I would point out
that in consequence of negotiations between
the provincial governments and the Dominion
Government, agreements were finaly executed.
Perha:ps the right honourable member for Ottawa bas not had an opporttnity of seeing the
maps whieh have been produced here. Banff
Park and Jasper Park, as at present constituted, are shown in pink, and the portions
which it is proposed to set aside for the Province of Alberta are hatched in black. From
following the negotiations and reading the
printed proceedings, I know that some of these
lands are supposed to be suitable for agriculturc or some other sucb purpose, and to possess
a commercial rather than a scenie value, and,
so far as I know, that is the reason the provinces consented to the detachment of these
areas from the parks. If the people of Canada did net think that what the provinces did
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

was right, we should be justified in criticizing
their action; but the tihree provinces have
executed agreements acceding to what is
proposed, and now we have the assurance of
the Federal Government that during the interval before the passing of the fee these lands
will be under the controll and management
of the provinces within which they lie.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am prepared to
say on behalf of the Government that until
these areas are actually transferred to the
provinces there will be no grants nor appropriations of any kind made at Ottawa.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I am sure my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) did net wish to convey
the impression that I wanted to put a brake
on the wheel that was required to bring about
the agreement between the Dominion and the
provincial governments. I am as happy as
any person on the other side of the House
can be that the governments have at last
come te an agreement and that this vexed
question is to be settled for all time to come.
I did feel, however, that I should like to know
something as to why these areas were to be
withdrawn, what was their nature, and so
forth; and I thought a committee would provide an informal and easy method of securing
the information. Undoubtedly the provinces
have entirely in their own hands the game
laws of the lands which belong to them, and
I think that as a Whole they have administered then fairly well. Speaking of my own
old province of New Brunswick, J may say
that the manaeent with regard to both fish
and game has been up-te-dite and reasonable
in every respect. If the areas under consideration go te the provinces, the provincial governments must have jurisdiction over them.
The point I had in mind was this. When a
Government such as we have at the present
times comes to a conclusion, probably all
we can do is say to ourselves: "That is the
more to be said."
end of it; there is nothingr
And when three or four provincial governments in addition, in their star chambers,
come to a conclusion and issue their decree,
no one in heaven above or on the earth
beneath should find fault with that decision.
It is a very common failing of human nature,
however, to want to know how the wheels
go round, and why, and I aver to you that
I have net the least knowledge as to how or
why these things have taken place. I think
there is an easy way to get such information.
But if I do not get it I shall net die any
sooner; and if an agreement is come to by
three or four provincial governments, and the

263

at present-for how long it will exist, I do
flot know, and I suppose its members are
about as dubious as I arnRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 do not think
s0.

Hon. Mr. BELÇOURT: It is not at ahl
likely that the Dominion Government will
consider establishing a park there in the face
of these agreements.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Ail right.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
-probably it is flot for iay individuals to peep
under the curtain and see what is going on.
If this Bouse is satisfied, and everyibody else
is satisfied, I will take the letters that I have
received and the requests that have been made
to me to look carefully into this matter for
the sake of the parks themrselves, and wiil
retire to rny rest with thern, and in quiet
contemplation shall hope for the best, whatever may happen.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should not want
my honourable friend to think that we are
n-ot disposed to give him any information
that we have or can get. If he is flot satisfied,
I arn at his disposai; and shouid he desire
any further information, I shahl do my very
best to furnish it if I have not already done so.
There was a very close and protracted examination made jointly by officers appoînted
by the provincial governiments and the Ottawa
Government. After a very careful examination upon the ground they decided upon what
areas rQight be eliminated for the purposes
that have been mentioned. I arn instructed
that those areas were set aside largely for
pasturage. If the lands are used for that
purpose, I »do not suppose the scenic beauties
of the parks or the areas set aside are going to
be affected. On the contrary, I should think
that cattie grazing in the neighbourhood wouid
rather improve the picture.
Again I say to my right honourable friend
that if there is any more information he would
like to have, it is quite open ta hirn to ask
for i±.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I should like to ask
the honourable leader of the Government what
is being done about the park in the eastern
part of Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend refers to the proposai to establish a
park?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOITRT: Nothing has been
done. No park has been created.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I suppose that if a
park is created there the Dominion Government will take it over and mun it in the same
way that they do these other parks?

The Senaite again went into Committee on
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-definitions:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If the Department of
the Interior is discontinued, what Minister
wiii have charge of these parks?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The parks are now
under the jurisdiction of the Minister of the
Interior.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It has been stated
rather pubiiciy-I really do not know whether
it is the intention or not-that the Department of the Interior wili be discontinued. If
that is done, under what Minister wiil the
administration of the national parks corne?
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I do not think
any decision has been corne to in regard to
abolishing the Department of the Interior.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Some question
has arisen as to the anomaly-perhaps a
necessary one-of a Dominion jurisdiction surrounded by provincial territory. You have
imperium in iimperio: you are going to administer a Dominion park which. is surrounded
by lands under the administration of the
province. I do not say it is not workahie,
but how it will work out in practice I do not
know.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is My honourable
friend right in saying imperium in imperio?
I do not think so. The Federal authority will
continue to have exclusive jurisdiction in the
area comprised in the parks; the other portions, which have been taken out, will be suhiect to the administration of the provinces in
the same way as the naturai resources they
are obtaining under these agreements. So I do
not think there can be any more conflict in
regard to these areas than in regard to other
lands situated in the provinces.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not say
this is unworkable, but take Jasper Park or
Banff Park, for instance. You have quite a
large town at Jasper at present, and another
fairly large town at Banff, and in the course
of years they will grow. They are under an
administration absolutely distinct and separate

264

SENATE

from that of the land contiguous to them.
Those areas will not be regulated by the laws
of the provinces out of which they are carved.
Perhaps this is a necessary consequence of what
has taken place, but it is a very anomalous
condition. Possibly the officer who is here
knows about the American system and could
tell the honourable acting leader of the House
whether the national parks in the United
States are managed in a similar way, that is,
as a distinct entity, subject to United States
administration and jurisdiction, and operated
independently of the laws and regulations of
the State or States out of which they are
carved. You might have one set of civil laws,
one legislature making laws for property and
the administration of justice in that park,
and immediately across an invisible line, as it
were, there would be another set of laws in
force.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Has that not
been the case?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I just want the
honourable acting leader of the House to explain this. What civil rights are you going
to put into force in, we will say, Banff Park
after this law goes into force? I have some
idea of what will be donc, but I think the
acting leader of the House should explain it.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It will be a sanctuary.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: A bird sanctuary?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend think there is going to be very
much difference between what will happen
under this new arrangement and what obtains
in regard to the administration of the Indian
Reserves?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: You mean now,
with regard to the Indian Reserves?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. You have
there now practically the same conditions that
you would have with the territory adjoining
these parks. These parks which remain under
Dominion administration will have to be admninistered by the Minister under the Statute,
and by regulations, instead of being subject
to provincial laws with regard to property and
civil rights, to which my honourable friend
bas referred. They will be governed by the
regulations made by the Department.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Irrespective of
the property and civil rights and ordinary
administration of justice there?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know just
how that would be. My honourable friend
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

asked about the manner in which the United
States deals with its parks. As my honourable friend knows, the States are sovereign;
each has absolute control within its own
boundaries. But if a national park is created
in any State, that State simply hands over to
the Federal authority full and complete right
-the State withdraws entirely. I imagine the
parks are administered there very much in
the same way as our national parks have been
and will continue to be administered, notwithstanding the transfer of the natural
resources to the provinces. I will read section 15 of the agreement made with Alberta:
15. The Parliament of Canada shall have
exclusive legislative jurisdiction within the
whole area included within the outer boundaries of each of the said parks notwithstanding
that portions of such area may not forn part of
the park proper; the laws now in force within

the said area shall continue in force only until
changed by the Parliament of Canada or under
its authority, provided, however, that all laws
of the Province now or bereafter in force, which
are not repugnant to any law or regulation
made applicable within the said area by or under
the authority of the Parliament of Canada,
shall extend to and be enforceable within the
same. and that all general taxing acts passed
by the Province shall apply within the same
unfless expressly excluded froi application
therein by or under the authority of the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That is, the
portions you have added to these parks: the
little fringe you have added to theni. which
is shown in this map.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is section 15,
given under the heading of "National Parks";
so that applies to the parks theniselves,.
I
will read section 16:
16. The Governient of Canada will introduce
into the Parlianient of Canada sucli legislation
as may be necessary te exclude frein the parks
aforesaid certain areas forming part of certain
of the said parks which bave been delimîited as
including the lands iow forming part thereof
which are of suîbstantial commercial value, the
botundaries of the areas to be so excluded hav-

ing beenî lieretofore agreed upon by representatives of Canada and of the Province, and the
Province agrees that upon the exclusion of the
said areas as so agreed upon. it will not, by
wrks outside the houidaries of any of the said
parks, reduce the flow of water in any of the
rivers or streais within the same to less than
that whie the Minister of the Interior may
deem necessary adequately to preserve the scenie
beauties of tlie said parks.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Now, will my
honourable. friend be kind enough to go on
and show the clause which deals with the
rights of civil litigation? Suppose Mr. A and
Mr. B both live in Banff or Jasper Park, and
one sues the other. What is the Dominion
Government going to do with that?

265

MAY 19, 1930
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 think that section 15 is the answer to my honourable f riend's
question.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUIGHBY: I am not saving it is not, but I want to get the answer.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Section 15 says:
Provided, however, thýat ail laws of the
Province now or hereafter in force, which are
iiut repugnant to any law or regulation made
applicable within the said arca by or under the
authority of the Parliament of Canada, shahl
extend to and be enforceable within the saine,
and that ail general taxing acts passed by the
iProvince shall apply within the saine un-less
expresely excluded from application therein by
or under the authority of the Parliament of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That of course
reserves to, the Dominion the absolute right
to say what is and what is not repugnant,
It can make any law it likes.
Hon. Mr. BEILCOURT: I should not think
so. I should think that would be a judicial
rather than a legisiative question. I should
think it is a matter for the courts, rather than
for Parliament, to, say what is and what is
not repugnant.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3, 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6--Park lands:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Mr. Chairman, I
propose that subsection 3 of section 6 be deleted. The subsection rends:
No lands within a Park, other than those
specified in subsection two hereof, shall he
patented or conveyed in fee.
It appears that the railway company have
considered that this might interfere with rights
which they have acquired and presently hold,
and they have asked that this subsection be
taken out. The Departinent secs no reason
wvhy it should not be omitted, and I ioove
that it lie deleted.
The amendment was agrecd to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I suppose the
remaining subsections should be renumbered?
Yes. Section 4
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
will become section 3, and section 5 will be
numbered 4.
Section 6, as amended, was agreed to.
Sections 7, 8 and 9 were agreed to.
On section 10--repeal clause:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What are the
sections that are repealed? Ras the honourable acting leader a memorandumn as to that?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The exp'1anation
is that this section 21 and subsection 2 of
section 23 of the Dominion Forest Reserves
and Parks Act are repealed because the same
provisions are contained elsewhere.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
did not hear my honourable. friend very clearly, but I will state what 1 mean, and my
honourable friend can tell me whether I arn
correct or not. Authority is given to the
Governor in Council to purchase portions of
land that do flot beiong to the park system
or to the Govcrnment, and to, add themn to
existing parks, or f orm themn into new parks.
That is donc by Order in Council, as I understand it, without any further special authorization by Parliament, or an A'ct of Parliament
for each particular case. Has the Governor
in Council power to seli or alienate by Order
in Council any portion of the parks, or is
that a function which belongs entirely to Parliament? Will my honourabie friend answer
that?
My honourable
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
friend should remember that there is a distinction made in this Bill between national parks
and historie sites. It is flot contemplated that
any parks will be acquired in the future;
certainly not that any will be established
under a regulation or Order in Council. It
may be that Parliament will wish to acquire
additional parks or to enlarge the present ones,
but whatever is donc in that respect mnust bc,
by Act of Parliament. It is somewhat different
with regard to historie sites, because section il
provides that certain lands may be acquired
for the purpose of commemorating an bistorical event or to, preserve any historicai landmark, and so on.

SENATE

a dark hole-and-corner meeting where the
representatives of private interests surround
the committee table. Did he have in mind
when he used these ungracious words the then
recent event of his own party caucus, where
interests I will not venture to characterize
eem to have been vocal indeed, in protest at
the proposal of the Government to pass for
even a short time into the straight and narrow path of national rectitude, and during a
brief campaigning period to appear to heed the
remonstrance of our neighbour Republic? So
perverse and provocative, it seems, have been
the goings-on of the Canadian Government,
in the eyes of our neighbour, that even the
stout-hearted British Ambassador trembled at
the thought of possible consequences and was
reassured only by the advent at Washington
of the doughty Canadian representative, who
has moved our Government to hurried action.
But the tremblings of the British Ambassador
appear to have made no impression on the
party caucus, where according to report there
was a solid block against the proposed surrender to American clamor, and submission
only under dire threat from the head of the
Government. What was said to silence the
tumult of these honourable gentlemen as they
passed from the shadow of caucus to the limelight of Parliament? What were they told,
that brought them to acquiescence, but yet
could not be communicated to press or public?
Was it that this Bill is not to be taken
literally or seriously, but is only a votecatching and deceptive device, harmless te
liquor interests as a whole and designed simply
to fide over a critical election contest?
The Bill itself seems to forbid the removal
frein any distillery or bonded warehouse of
int.oxicating liquor destined for delivery in
any country into which importation is prohibited by law; and also the granting of a
clearance to any vessel having on board any
liquor so destined; but it is left te the Government to make regulations te give effect,
if any, te the provisions of the Bill. Mr.
Mackenzie King bas interpreted the Bill in
a letter to Washington, written in March of
this year, after four years' deliberation, wherein he says that the main purpose is "to require
officials of the Dominion Government having
charge of liquor in bond and the granting of
clearances to vessels, to refuse te release such
liquor or te grant such clearances where the
granting of such release or clearance in any
case would facilitate the introduction of intoxicating liquor into a country where the
importation of such liquor is forbidden by
law." This language, much wider than that
of the Bill, has been repeated to the Senate
by the leader of the Government in this
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Chamber, and indeed is noted on the printed
document, as the official interpretation of the
measure. But we have had another and a
contradictory interpretation, comforting to the
liquor operators, deliberately made by another
honourable member of this Senate, a member
who deservedly stands high in the confidence
of the Government and of his colleagues. Let
me quote this significant and disturbing
passage from the report of proceedings in this
House on the 3rd of April:
"Hon. Mr. Beique: If is my opinion that the
distillers will very likely arrange to ship their
goods to Jamaica, Cuba, and St. PierreMiquelon, and then the Canadian Government
will not be concerned.
Hon. Mr. Willoughby:
Why not? If you
have a strong suspicion that it is going there,
why not?

Hon. Mr. Beique: The Bill is not intended
to prevent that. Under this Bill it will be
open to the distillers to export their goods to
England or to any European country, or to St.
Pierre-Miquelon, Janaica. Cuba, or auny other
island not coning within the category described
in the Bill. I ana quite sure-and the onourable gentleman expressed the same opinionthat these people will find some way of selling
their goods, and I think he will find that instead of this legislation depriving fIe country
of revenue it wili very likely have the contrary
effect. J think tie distillers will pay the $9
per Imperial gallon instead of exporting the
goods under i bond. because the imomient the
$9 is paid they van dispose of their gonds as
they sec fit, provided they do not. to the knowledge of tic Canadian officers. send tleir goods
to the United States or to any prohibition
country.
The key- words in this passage are, of course,
"The Bill is not intended to prevent that,"
namelv, the making of a wrongful declaration
as to the destin' of any exports. The Canadian Governnent, we are assured in the
presence of their representative and of this
Secate, will net be concerned if an exporter
trifles with the truth and addresses to St.
Pierre-Miquelon. or to Cuba, liquor tined
for the United States. Se easy will it be to
avoid the Prime Minister's undertaking, te
cease from facilitating the introduction of
Canadian liquor to compete with the home
brew of the United States. We have not been
told who
utihorized the honourable senator
for De Salaberry te state the intention of
the Bill; but he must be assumed to have
spoken under authority and not lightly in a
matter of so great moment. If is significant
that his statement was accepted by the honourable leader of the Senate, in charge of this
Government measure. Was it the whisper of
this comforting assurance that silenced in and
about Parliament the clameur of those who
in the party caucus would have nothing to do
with the proposal? In the face of this fatal

MAY 20, 1930
and discreditable diminution of the written
undertaking of the Prime Minister, what becornes of the pretence that this measure
suffices as redemption of the pledge of the
honour of -Canada, which has remained in
pawn at Washington since four or five years
ago?
Let me repeat and sumamarize the extraordinary situation as disclosed in the passage
I have read from the record made in this
House six weeks ago, and in the meantime
not cbailenged or explained. Our Prime Minister has piedged to Washington the bonour
of the Canadian people that this Dominion
will cease te connive at export operations that
will facilitate the passage of intoxîcatîng liquor
to the United States, and he has offered to
Parliament, pursuant to this pledge, the slipshod Bill now under discussion. The Bill is
unpopular with his political party and is supported only in significant silence, whie provoking the remark from the Premier's colleague bere that this new legisiation bas not
been asked for in Parliament. There follows
the brief address of the honourable senator
for De &alaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique), who in
this Chamber is the interpreter for tbe Gos'ernment and their strong rijzht arma in influencing the course of events. He commends the
Bill becauise of its apparent efficacy in procuring the result intended. But wbat is intended? Volunteering to express the intention, and not contradicted by bis leader, he
avers tbat the Bill is net intended to prevent
tbe ultimate passage of intoxicating liquor
into tbe United States, but permits a convenient detour, as to whicb our Government
is not concerned. If this honourable gentleman be riglt-and be stands uncballenged by
the Government-then the Prime Minister has
written to Washington something that is not
true, in stating that be has introduced a Bill
preventing clearance or export of liquor wliere
sucb expert would facilitate its introduction
into, the United States. And the Prime Minister rnocks those in this Parliament who support bis Bill because of tbe representation
bere that it is designed to accomplisba something wbicb bis colleague from De SalaberrY
assures us is net intendedl
Cuba is conspicuously *mentionied *by the
bonourable senator from De Salaberry as a
base le-ft open to our operators in liquor.
Cuba hýas a population one-third that of
Canada, but bas not been a conspicuous
customer for Canadian wares, liquid or dry.
Cuba lies oonvenient to the front door of the
United States and bas so much traffic to and
from that direction that it Masy be readily
used as a base frorn which to projecet liquor

269

or other contraband; in other words, to
facilitate the introduction of liquor into the
United States. Premier Mackenzie King, in
effect, pledges the honour of Canada that
eWportations via Cuba or any other base
siimilarly situated to annoy the United
States wili not ha permitted. On the other
band, we are assured by his colleague that
exportations te Cuba are not oniy te continue,
but also that tbey are hikeiy to increase! No
wonder our Prime Minister feels uneasy on
bis throne as Minister of External Affairs,
and fancies that e.ven the British Ambassador
trembles as descrihed te us, over the continuing affront te the administration at Wasbington on the part of a neighbour nation
professimg to defer to the wisbes of the United
Stiates. It w"s, as our Prime Minister must
remcm.ber, beoause the Spaniali administration
persisgtrd in annoying Waslington that Cuba
became a republic through American intervention. Whiie Mr. Mackenzie King is in
the trembling mood in whi*cb ha bas represented himself and -the British Ambassador, lie
might with advantage remamber the Maine.
T-here is local interest in the province fromn
which I corne in the proposais of this Bill as
interpreted te us by tbe honourable senator
for De Salaberry. The badge of legality and
respectability lias been placed by the Government upon the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor, tbrough licence and tlirougli
officiai deciarations of tlie riglit to freedom,
of expert. Wbatever opinion may be hld as
to the profit of individual citîzens from indulging in the luxury of consumption of liquor,
there can be no difference as to tlie fact of
profit by communities froi tlie construction
and operation of distilleries. In the littie
city from wbicli I corne we bave possibly the
iargest distiiiery in Canada, with operations
steadily expanding, so that wiitlin the last few
years nearly a million dollars lias been spent
in building for the extension of tlie premises.
This building lias engaged the services of al
classes of skilied workmen to be found in an
industrial community. The steel worker, the
saw milis and planing milis employees, the
carpenter, the brickiayer, tbe plumber, the
painter, the electrician and ail their allies
have been calied upon in turn and benefited froma the substantial wages whicb tbose
trades comnmand. In Vancouver there are
distilleries and breweries also operating on
a scale similariy large. These institutions
have been purchasers of tbe farmer's grain,
the buge casks for containers from the
f oundry or barraI works. tbe shipping cases
from the box factory, the millions of bottles
and ail the other supplies required by great

270

SENATE

manufacturing enterprises. The waste grain
from the distilleries is the foundation in turn
for the operation of cattle yards in their
immediate vicinity, with a wide range of profitable occupation from these auxiliaries. Distillery products bulk largely in the outward
cargoes from our ports. So it will be seen that
the whole community is concerned in the
operation of -these enterprises, and that a word
on their behaîf is flot merely one for the
"liquor interests "somnetimes se airily dispoqed
of. As a matter of faci,, New Westminster is
a prohibition communi'ty, as shown by the
result of any test made at the poils. But I
arn satisfied that these citizens who stand thus
against abuse of liquor wiIl not rejoico at the
proposal of this Bill to transfer the export
business of the British Columbia institutions
to the banks of the St. Lawrence, which is to
be the effect or resuît of this Bill if the
prophecy of increased export 'to St. PierreMiquelon and Cuba is carried out. Is there
to be for the distilleries cf the Pacifi-e Coast
a reservation such as tha-t announccd as available for exporters to whom the ports of St.
Pierre-Miquelon and of Cuba are available;
antI, if so, how are they te be made aware of
the fact?
And again, in the face cf such
rescrx ations what remains of the Prime Minister's pledge not to permit anything thait mnay
facilitate the introduction cf Canadian liquer
into the United States? Lest anvoce sheuld
question the possibility of discrimination in
such a matter between. sav. Quebec and British
Columbia, let me refer te the recent incident
breadcast through Canada, wherein the Prime
Minister refused the contribution cf even five
cents te feed thec unemployed and hungry cf
the Province cf British Columbia se long as
it kept bis party out cf provincial office. fias
the Prime Minister bowels cf compassion for
distillers, and none for hungry workpcople?
The several points involved in tbe questions
I have asked might well have been discussed and disposed cf in commit-tee had the
request of the leader cf this side of tbe Hanse
been agreed te: but the Government, through
their spekesman, tbouight fit te refuse this
special committee and were silent in the
Committee cf the Whole flouse. Thaýt the
Senate has been thus flouted perhaps is a
aatural sequence cf cur tolerance cf the present
condition cf non-representation cf the Government in this body. I do net find fauit
with the honourable gentleman who crdinarily
speaks for the ministry cf which he is a
miember, thcugh witheut pertfolio (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), that be is absent on duty at
Geneva; but I do suggest that in his absence

Mr. TAYLOR.

and te speak with authority and knowledge
in the name cf the administration. This witheut reflection upon the henourable gentleman
now leading in this Chamber (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt), whe cannet he held at fauît
because the situation is as that cf the blind
leading the blind. He is a Privy Coiciller
in recognition cf distînguished service as
Speaker cf the flouse cf Commons in the
days when political knighthocd was in flcwer
and the words Laurier and Liberal wvere
synonyrneus; but he cannoýt know by intuition
what are the policies and intentions cf the
ministers with whom he is noyt privileged te
sit in Council. This Senate exists by the considered verdict cf the people cf Canada, who
did net contemplate that a time w-euld coe
when a ministry cf placemen would be timid
about expcsing their policies before an independent body, even though they had narucd
tbe majcrity cf the members, and that the
Senate would be left te drift as it dees today.
In another place recently the Prime Minister proclairncd bimself te be at last in
position te central both branches cf Parliament. But ho bas not fortifled bis pesiti.nn
in tbis Sonate, where thcre are six vacancies
thougb sixty applicants are in waiting-. If Mr.
Mackenzie King desired te make sure cf
the passage cf ýtbis Bill, ho would f111 these
vacancies, and 'have in the hands cf h-is party
the power te pass the Liquor Expert or any
other Bill. But this would provent the use cf
this measure as a vc'te-getting device, ce the
double-barrellcd pretence cf helping prohibitien, on the one baud, and cf nût biirtirng
rum-runners on the other. Tbis device I amn
net disposed to assist, having in mimd the
prcverb that "surely in vain is the ne t spread
in the sight cf any bird." On its demerits,
wero nothing eisc involved, this Bill shotild be
killed. An alternative is that it should. go
inte effect ccl.v wvhen there is the promnised
reciprocity in smuggling- legislation-and
divorce, as the rigbt hcnourable gentleman
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)

given for undeserved support at the poîîs te
the cheapest and mcst undeserving ministry
on record in Canada, an old bird like me is
prepared te take the responsibility cf veting
for the third reading.
Curiosity as well as caution impels te this
decision. I shail watch wvit', interest whether
the Prime Minister's letter or the conflicting
interprotatien wbich silenced the clameur cf

the Act. And I shaîl net forget that this
interpretation in faveur cf rum-running- by

detour is in conflict with the very last advice
presented by the experts consulted by the
Prime Minister.
The Canadian-American
Conference gave this advice, as to the inconsistency between granting clearances to
United States ports and refusing clearances to
other countries on the ground that the cargoes
were really destined for the United States;
and now the Government propose to reverse
the position, so that their officials will be
directed to accept the false clearances by
which liquor clearly destined for the United
States will be detoured via St. Pierre or
Cuba.
There is homely advice about giving a
certain personage enough rope to bang himself.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I may say that I did
not mean the right honourable gentleman who
has spoken.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You are mistaken. He did.not speak.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I am prepared to
give consent to putting this rope with its
strands of deceit an? decay in the hands of
the Ministry in the expectation that when
they swing it will be into the pit of political
oblivion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend tell me whether I heard him
rightly or not? Did he quote the Prime Minister as comparing meetings of the Senate with
dark hole-and-corner meetings? I did not
quite catch that.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I did not refer to the
Prime Minister. I referred to our honoured
leader who is now absent at Geneva. I quoted
bis words.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable friend tell me when the words were
used?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: On the lst, 2nd, or
3rd of April. I cannot at the moment say
which.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps my honourable friend did not understand me. I
meant the words he quoted as coming from
the Prime Minister, not those from the leader
of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: The words I quoted
were the words of the honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask my
honourable friend who was the author of the
essay he bas just read?

271

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: If the honourable
gentleman wants the information, and is not
asking just to be smart, I may say that I
wrote my address, not because I could not
deliver it without writing it, but because I
wished to save the time of the House by making it as concise as possible.
Hon. R. H. POPE: Honourable members
of the Senate, we have had more or less debate
on this question. The Government seem to
be very determined in their effort to put this
Bill through. Since it was introduced the
Prime Minister, in another place, made a
speech in which we were informed that a
treaty was being negotiated with the United
States of America in relation to this subject.
I presume the treaty is on a somewhat typical
line. Of course we do not know, because the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) told us the other night that he was
not at liberty to give us the details of the
drafting of this treaty; but he did say on May
15, as reported at page 228 of Senate Hansard:
Substantial progress has been made in the
consideration of the provisions of this draft
treaty, and it is hoped that at an early date
it will form the basis of what may be a final
discussion; and it is possible that before
prorogation takes place Parliament will be
advised of the nature and purport of the treaty.
Those are the remarks of the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). In view of these
circumstances and the statements of the Government, there cannot be any great urgency for
the proposed legislation. On the contrary,
I think it would be the part of wisdom to
hasten slowly, and, instead of letting this Bill
go into effect forthwith, to await the conclusion
of the treaty negotiations and a mutual arrangement in regard to smuggling generally.
This proposition should present itself favourably to members on both sides of the House, if
this treaty is in process of being negotiatedand as to that we must take the word of the
Prime Minister and the honourable leader of
the House. If we pass the Bill and it comes
into effect, and a treaty is made which conflicts
with this legislation, it may be impossible fo
put the treaty into effect until the Act is
taken off the Statute Book. I am not a lawyer,
and do not pretend to be, but that is a
contingency that occurs to me. Therefore I
am going to move the following amendment to
Bill 15, an Act to amend the Export Act:
To insert after clause 1, as clause 2, the
following: This Act shall corne into force upon
a day to be named by proclamation of the
Governor in Council.
That leaves the power in the hands of the
Government. If they negotiate with the
United States a treaty that eliminates the

SENATE

272

necessity of enforcing this measure, they will
then have the option of seeing that the provisions of the Act are not carried out, and
that the provisions of the proposed treaty
concerning liquor smuggling are not interfered
with in the slightest degree.
I am not qualifying my opinion on this
subject. I am opposed to this legislation from
the point of view that I mentioned some time
ago in this House, namely. that it imposes
extraordinary expenditure on our people to
enforce laws for the benefit of another nation,
which bas never reciprocated any efforts of
ours in the past. However, I have learned in
conversation that this point of view is not
acceptable to many honourable members on
both sides of the House. Therefore I suggest
that this amendment should be adopted, so
that the Government may be given an opportunity of dealing with developments that may
arise in the course of time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable senators, I have no authority to accept the
amendment proposed by my honourable
friend. It will have been observed that the
honourable gentleman attempts to justify his
amendment on the ground that the treaty to
prohibit smuggling, which is now being considered by the Governments of the United
States and of Canada, may affect the provisions of this measure. I think nearly every
honourable member will agree that there is
very slight possibility that such a situation
will arise. It is most unlikely that in any
treaty negotiations between the two Governments the United States authorities will be
satisfied with anything less than a provision
for the prevention of smuggling. They are
aware of the intentions of our Government,
and they would unquestionably insist upon
provisions in line with this Bill. There is no
possibility of my honourable friend's dream
ever being realized, and for that reason I
cannot on behalf of the Government accept
his proposai.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members, I have been a patient
listener and interested spectator in what has
taken place in this Chamber during the discussion upon the Bill that is now before us for
third reading. I do not profess to have any
knowledge of the secrets of the Prime Minister
of Canada, or to know what goes on at the
caucuses of the party of which he is the leader:
consequently I am unable to give an authoritative interpretation of the motive of the one
or the conclusions of the other. However, I
have had some experience in legislation and
Bon. Mr. POPE.

in public matters, and I base my action on
this Bill upon grounds other than those of
supposed motive, worthy or unworthy, or of
interest, selfish or benevolent, individual or
national. I shall briefly bring to -the attention of honourable members the reasons for
which I favour this Bill and intend to vote
for the third reading. About a year ago I
expressed my opinions on a similar subject,
but the interest in the question was not so
keen at that time as it is now, and honourable members may not take it amiss if I
review the grounds upon which my stand is
founded.
In ail my experience of legislation I think I
have never known of any Bill so strongly
documented as the present one coming before
a House of which I was a member. Whatever
we may say about the rightness or wrongness,
the advisability or the futility of legislation
which embodies the policy of a neighbouring
country, if we aspire ta maintain good relations
in the family of nations we are bound to take
cognizance of the policy and will of our
neighbour, and nowhere else can we so
surely read an expression of the policy
and will of a nation as in the legislation
passed by its duly authorized institutions. The
thoughts, the sentiments and the desires of
the people of a country are embodied in their
legislation and placed upon their Statute Book,
where ail who will may read. After more
than one hundred years of vital and thorough
discussion of the control of the liquor traffic,
the people in the neighbouring republie to the
south of us came to a conclusion, to which they
gave the most authoritative and most signal
expression that could be given to the will of
the people by placing it in their Constitution
in what is known as the Eighteenth Amendment.
In 1923 there was held in Great Britain an
Imperial Conference, attended by representatives of what we are now taught to call the
British Commonwealth of Nations. That Conference considered what action should be taken
towards the United States with respect to its
herculean task of enforcing that new law,
the Eighteenth Amendment, among its 100 or
120 millions of people scattered over an immense territory with some 18,700 miles of coast
line, along any league of which the violators of
the law might carry on their operations. The
Imperial Conference decided unanimously that
it was its duty to take cognizance of this policy
of the United States of America, and after a
full discussion it came to certain conclusions,
which were embodied in a treaty ratified in
1924. The basis of that treaty and of the
action contemplated under it was the principle

MAY 20, 1930
mentioned in the preamble to the convention.
I will read the preamble itself, so that it may
go upon the record:
Ris Majesty The King of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of
the British Dominions beyond the seas, Emperor
of India, and the President of the United
StatesHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will the right
honourable gentleman pardon me? He has
left out the most important line.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
-being desirous of avoiding any difficulties
which might arise between themHon. Mr. BELCOURT: I wanted to point
out to my right honourable friend that he left
out the most important fine of the whole
preamble, after the word "India."
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
thought I read that.

I

No. My right
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
honourable friend did not read the words, "in
respect of the Dominion of Canada."
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, they are now read. They are in the
preamble.
desirous of avoiding any difficulties
-being
which might arise between them in connection
with the laws in force in the United States on
the subject of alcoholie beverages.
That, I think, is the fruit of real statesmanship. I consider that the object stated in
that preamble is an eminently wise principle
upon which to base the action of one nation
with regard to another. It seems to me that
the principle therein expressed is the only
basis upon which the comity and good-will
of nations can be successfully maintained.
The treaty was ratified by the Parliaments
of Great Britain and of the Overseas Doninions, including our own, and by the Government of India. I am well aware that some
of our statesmen to-day, even some who are
in this assembly, if they had occupied the
position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in
Great Britain, would probably not have carried out so broad a policy.
Directly after the treaty was concluded,
Canada followed it up by framing a convention with the United States of America for
the suppression of smuggling. That convention, though narrower in its application, was
based upon the same principle as the treaty
between Great Britain and the United States,
namely, the desirability of maintaining continuous good-will and friendly relations between the two countries.
But further action was taken. As a consequence of certain charges, a special committee

composed of prominent representatives of all
parties in another place was appointed in
1926 to make an investigation which is well
known to all honourable members. I think
it may be said that if any committee ever
discharged its duties in a non-partisan and
reasonable manner, that one did so. It made
a unanimous report in June, 1926, and that
report was unanimously adopted by the other
House. The Bill that is at present being
discussed by us is founded upon the report
of that special committee.
Shortly after the committee's report an election was on the tapis. In the course of the
campaign the leader of the Liberal Party,
the present Prime Minister of Canada, made
to the electorate a solemn pledge, which became incorporated in the electoral contest
and was a factor in the result at the polls.
That pledge was to carry on the investigation and to give the relief that the investigation showed was necessary. After the election a Government was formed, and subsequently an Order in Council was passed constituting a Royal Commission to carry on the
investigation to its utmost extent.
That
Royal Commission, the constitution of which I
do not think will be cavilled at by any member of this Chamber, carried on under able
management and with the assistance of able
counsel a most efficient and widespread investigation and came to its conclusions. Those
conclusions approved and recommended the
very principles that had been recommended
by the special committee of the House of
Commons and approved by that House.
There you have the basis for legislation
such as this, and I think I was justified in
saying that probably no piece of legislation
bas ever come before either of our legislative bodies more strongly documented. The
report of the special committee was presented
in 1926, and that of the Royal Commission
in 1928. Whether or not the Government had
any excuse for delay after the presentation
of the report of the special committee and its
adoption by the House of Commons, which
was tantamount to an instruction by that
House to enact the legislation proposed and
recommended, I say that upon the presentation of the report of the Royal Commission
the Government should have taken immediate
action to place the legislation upon the
Statute Book, and I find no excuse at all
necessary for any amount of criticism that
may have been levelled at the Government
for its evasions and delays and lack of action
during four years and seven months. I have
gone carefully over the excuses that have been

2425--18
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
given, but I do not find them at all sufficient
to justify a delay of nearly five years in
bringing down this legislation.
Having backed up that criticism, I leave it
at that. Alt.hough criticism is called for and is
justly expressed, I do not think that is any
reason for failure on my part to support this
action, tardy though I consider it to be.
Therefore I have supported this Bill. There
may be a great deal of by-play and political
maneuvering.
I do not know what deep
thoughts, either straight or crooked, may be
in the minds of the leading politicians on the
side opposite from mine; nor do I know
what may be the thoughts or motives that lie
in the minds of men on my own side of the
House. I can be responsible only for my own
thoughts and actions. As for myself, I believe that the legislation is just. I believe
that the assent it received and the instruction
given with regard to it ar such as are seldom
given to any piece of legislation submitted to
the Canadian Parliament, and I am therefore
earnest in my desire to sec it placed upon the
Statute Book, for what it is worth.
We on this side of the House are at a
great disadvantage. I cannot say as to those
on the other side. Whilst I have been listening to this debate I have been wondering
somewhat at the tongue-tied representatives
sitting on the Government benches. Fluent
and voluble on other matters, they are singularly silent upon this question. I do not
need to ask myself why. If I tried to answer
that question I should probably get into
devious ways and do injustice to some persons, and tha-t I should not care to do. But
it is a striking fact that after all the criticisms
made on this side of the House, only one,
two or three voices have been raised on the
other side in support of the measure that is to
be voted upon this afternoon. Why is it?
There might be a great many reasons for it,
but I leave it to each member on either
side of the House to state his reasons for
himself, and to his own satisfaction.
A great deal has been said on this side
of the House which I think is open to some
reply. It has been generally assumed that
Canada tas been over-neighbourly, so to
speak, in rushing to the assistance of the
United States in an endeavour to facilitate
the enforcement of the law of the United
States in regard to intoxicating beverages; and
the impression has been made upon my mind
-and maybe upon the minds of others-that
Canada has been the only one to move in
this direction, and has been a little officious
in her efforts ýto assist our friends to the
south.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

W'ha-t are the facts of the case? The very
first move in this direction was made in 1923
by that body which represents, if it represents
anything, the whole of the united British
Empire-the Imperial Conference. The first
legislation to be enacted was contained in
the treaty made between Great Britain and
the United States of America, and ratified
by the Parliaments of the British Commonwealth. That was a very important piece of
legislation. Let us for a moment see what it
did and in what way it aided in the enforcement of the United States policy and law.
The generally accepted boundary of the area
at sea over whieh a country has authority
was three marine miles from the shore. Great
Britain tas held to that boundary during all
the controversies of the past. The treaty made
a notable exception: for the purpose of enforcement of the United States law it extended
that boundary to at least twelve miles from
shore. That was the first concession on the
tasis of good-will and international fellowship
made in the treaty to which I have allided.
The area within which the United States
authorities could exercise jurisdiction in administerime the law of the United States was
extended from three marine miles to the distance that might be traversed in one hour
by the vessel which was, or was presumed to
be, carrying contraband goods into the United
States; or, if a ship herself did not proceed to
port, to the distance which a runner could
make in one hour in travelling from the ship
to the port. That was an extension from three
miles to a minimum limit of twelve miles, or
a possible maximum of fifteen or twenty or
more miles, depending upon the speed of the
delivering vessel. Within that extended area
the United States authorities have power
under the treaty to arrest a vessel, to board
ber and search her, to seize eontraband, if she
is carrying it, and to take her into port and
submit the question to legal adjudication
under the laws of the United States.
That was a very great concession to make
in the interest of international comity and
out of respect for the law of a neighbour
nation. But Great Britain tas done more
than that in the case of the rum-runncr who
seeks to utilize as a base of operations the
Bahamas or some of the other West Indies
Islands. Ste tas instructed ter officials as
regards the registering of rum-running vessels
under the British flag, and tas given the
United States authorities the right of entry
and examination in ports in the West Indies.
This tas effectually diminished the advantages

MAY 20, 1930Zi
which the rum-runner enj eyed from the use of
lhose ports. So mucli for what Great Britain
lias done. And this was ratified by Canada.
In 1925 Mexico made a convention with
the United States of America to the extent
of refusing clearances and taking other means
teo prevent the shipment of intoxicating- liquer
from that country te the United States. That
treaty was in operation until 1927, wlien the
United States itself denounced it. For what
reason? Because under that treaty Mexico
had passed a deeree which preventied arms and
ammunitien from being imported into its
territory, and there was a dispute between
the twe countries in that regard, the United
States net wishing te lie bounid net te expert
arcos and ammunitien te a particular party in
Mexico at that time. Nevertlieless, there was
an evidence of the good-will of Mexico, and
it extended over a period of twe years.
The case ef Cuba was instanced this afternoon, but I think the in.stance was scarSely
a hiappy one. The Island of Cuba is in very
close proximity te the United States and would
form a most convenîcnt base for smuggling
eperatiens, but in 192'5 there was signed at
Washington, and .rati6ied by the Senate of tbe
United States, and agreed te and ratified by
Cuba, a treaty on alI fours witli the treaty
made witli Mexico, which I have already mentioned. Se since 1925 Cuba bas been bound
by treaty te prevent ahl clearances of cargoes
of intexicating beverages for the ports of the
United States, and she is bound as well ta
give information and in other ways te carry
eut reciprocahly witli the United States tlie
obligations of that treaty.
Japan lias taken action similar te that taken
by Great Britain. Norway lias done the saine
thing, and net only lias gene thus far, but
punishes these who centravene the arrangement that she bas made with the United
States. Eheven of the Baltie nations have
entered into an agreement binding themsehves
nut te alew vessels of under one hundred tons
te carry intoxicating liquor fromn oe country
te the other, and they are working together
in good-will witli the United States as wehl.
Tlie samne may be saîd of ceuntries in South
America.
Se mucli fer tliat. I think it is well te place
it upon record te show the international goodwill ameng some of the most prominent natiens of the worhd.
Now, I shouhd like te say a few words on
the question of how far this measure, wlien it
is passed inte haw, will give effect te the
pohicy which the Prime Minister lias said it
is intended 'te carry eut. If it is as properly
enforced as I hope it wihl be, it wihh put an
2425-18à

end to the direct traffle between the two
countries; but it is said that it will be ineffective because when the Dominion authorities refuse to permit distillers and brewers
to clear cargoes for the United States tliey
pan ship their liquers into -the United States
by way of St. Pierre-Miquelon and Cuba.
I think it will not lie possible to ship via
Cuba, because under convention between that
country and the United States liquor cargoes
cannot be cleared from a Cuban port for an
American port; net only is the clearance
refused, but eil information relative te consignments of liquor is freely given by the
authorities of one country to those of the
other. Consequently I think it will be found
that Cuba will not be a convenient resting
place for cargoes like those which hitherto
have gone across the rivers and the lakes
between our country and the United States.
It may be said that ýthis Bill will not preý
vent the distillers from circumventing the
purpose of the Government by shipping
liquors to St. Pierre-Miquelon, whence they
can lie sent to the United States. If the
brewers and distillers do take advantage of
that channel of transportation, if the quantity
of liquor shipped there becomes so large that
it is apparent to everyone that it cannot be
consumed there, and if the Prime Minister of
Canada becomes convinced that the destination
of St. Pierre is a subterfuge whereby the intention of this legisiation is net carried out,
then it would be a question for the Prime
Minister to settie, whether it is possible to
have pence within the demain of his own
conscience se long as it is commonly known
that our legisiation is being nullified by the
actions of the brewers and distillers. If sucli
a condition arises the people of Canada will
have te take it up witli the Government,
and if our people really desire that Canada
shahl play the part of a good neighbour. soel
action will then be taken te solve any complications that may have arisen.
I have mucli respect for the wisdom, cnergy
and business abili.ty of my honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor)';
likewise for my honourable friend from Picfeu (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and for this versatile
and tahented ohd friend of mine, the honourable senator for Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope),
but I scarcehy see-how shahl I express it?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I do nat know.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
scarcely see liow they can consistently champion the distiller and the brewer as beneficent
business men, or their business as a worthy industry. I couhd wish them a nobler and
safer subject, te champion; but they must

choose for themseslves the cause for which
they are willing to don warlike armour and
fight. It is difficult for me to understand
how a business man, or a labouring man, or
a representative of labour in its broader
aspects, can enter the lists to oppose a measure
because, forsooth, it may cause some inconvenience to the ancient trade of making
alcoholic liquors. Never, from the time of
Noah-that is a long way back-up to the
present, could it be said that that industry,
if it can be so called, has been the friend of
any other industry. It is the constituted, continuous and inevitable ravager and enemy of
every other business enterprise in the wide
world. Am I right or wrong?
lon. Mr. POPE: You are wrong.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I thought my honourable friend from Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Pope) would say that I am right.
lHon. Mr. POPE: No; you are quite wrong.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, then, I shall have to labour with him
still more, but I labour not without hope.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But without
Pope.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
When listening to my honourable friend a
short while ago, I indulged in a wish that I
could turn some of my honourable friends
along a certain path. Some of them say:
1'What you need to do in the cause of truc
temperance is to use moral suasion. You cannot by law make men do certain things."
Hon. Mr. POPE: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
rhey say, "In the interest of true temperance it is moral suasion that must be used."
Hon. Mr. POPE:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But my honourable friend must not put all
the burden of using moral suasion on me. I
am sure my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Pope) has the best interest of his country at
heart. He would rather sec our young people
temperate, even abstainers, than the opposite;
I have not the least doubt of that. But why
do these honourable gentlemen who say, "In
order to advance the interest of true temperance you must use moral suasion," not take
part in that movement themselves? It would
rejoice the cockles of my heart to see my
honourable friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr.
Pope) standing before a group of Boy Scouts
or Girl Guides and, in the interest of truc
temperance, impressing upon them the necesRight Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

sity of having nothing to do with alcoholic
liquors. It is his duty as well as mine to do
that, and I plead with him to do his share of
the work. I have been trying to do such
work for a long while, and now, in my old age,
I should like my honourable friend, in his
youth and vigour, to take my place in endeavouring to inculcate the principles of true
temperance. And might I suggest to my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
that he could do a little bit of the same thing?
What an advance there would be in the
temperance movement if we all joined our
forces together! We might see the millennium much sooner than it is otherwise likely
to come. But this is a diversion.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

Oh, no, no.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What I want to make clear is that I do not
consider it necessary to oppose a measure of
this kind out of sympathy for the distiller
and the brewer. I ask honourable gentlemen,
can they name me any business that is not
injured in one way or another by the operations of the distiller and the brewer? Is the
labourer made any more effective because of
the distribution of the brewers' goods? Are
the miners and the transportation men more
energetie on that account? Or is it net a fact
that on any business of this country with
which alcohol interferes it has a blighting and
destroying influence? But I <lo net sec that
there is any like effect frorn the use of boots
and shoes. The more boots and shoes that
are nanufactured and distribuîted and worn,
the better for everyone concerned and the
country at large. The same is truc with respect
to ail other industries. excepting the business
of the brower and the distiller. Whether you
econsider that business froin a national or an
individuîal, a social or an economie viewpoint.
it is net beneficent, but maleficent. An ironical
freature of that business is the fact that while
the distillers and brewors are making their
profits, the huîman wreckage that is caused by
their business bas to be taken care of by
the honest, legitimate workers and taxpayers
of the country. Four or five men participating
in a small social affair may use intoxicating
beverages; an hour or two afterwards there
is a collision and two men are suddenly deprived of life, and lost to labour and production. Two citizens have lest their lives
because of the liquor trafhc. This is multiplied a thousand fold. in greater or lesser
degree, ail throuîgh our country.
Sooner or later the good sense of the people
of the whole world will centre upon this
business. It is my impression that in the

MAY 20,1930

MAY
United States of Amerîca the prohibition
amendment will neyer be abolished-that; the
people of that country will neyer go back to
the old system that was in vogue during my
younger days, and up to a very short time
ago. Wbat 1 want to emphasize is that I
think it is in the interest of every legitimate
and beneficent business that, as provided by
this Bill, there sbould be a stoppage of the
export of liquýor. Inasmucli as the prevention
of this export of liquor will curb the activities
of the liquor trade, it will mnure to the advantage of the country in every respect. That
is the only ground that a Government can
take to save its own reputation.
I arn in favour of this legisiation aise because it is in the interest of the Civil Service
of Canada. We have an immense body of
civil servants. numbering some 60,000 or 70,000
men and women, among whomn there is a
certain kind of freemasonry. The continuance
of the system that lias been in existence for
the last six or seven years would be disadvantageous to the morale of parts of the Civil
Service, and the Government is well advised
to abolish that systein.
.I do not know that I ought to impose anytbing more upon the good nature of my honourable colleagues. My remarks have been
made in good spirit. 1 amn glad to know that
rny honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Taylor) intends to vote for the
third reading. I arn not entirely in accord
with bis reasons for se voting, but, notwithstanding that, I arn glad that we have both
come to the same conclusion.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: I risc only to state
my position on thîs Bill. I am not opposed to
it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: There is an amendment which bas not been seconded.
Hon. Mr, DANIEL: I have often wondered why legisiation of tbis kind had not
been 'brouglit down before. I arn in favour
of it, and 'intend to vote for it.
An amendasent te the Bill bas been introduced proposing the -addition of a clause, the
effect of which would *be to postpone the
ceming into force of the Act until the issue of
a proclamation by His Excellency the Goverfor in Council. I sec some reason also to
vote in favour of the amendinent, and I
purpose doing so. In that I arn somewhat
influenced by the rememibrance of the speech
delivered on the Divorce Bill the other day by
the right honourable senator from. Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham), who suggested
that possibly some bargain might be made
between this country and the United States

277

i

with regard te the div-ercing in the United
States of Canadian cibizens. The proposal
that the coming inte force of this Bill shal
take place only on the proclamation of the
Governor in Council lias the menit of giving
the Government an opportunity to take a&
vantage of any additional liglit they may see
on the subjeet, and, perhaps, before finally
dealing with the Bill, te make seme sucli
arrangement as was suggested by the riglit
bonourable gentleman te whom I have referred. So, as far as I arn concerned, I intend
te vote for both 'the amendment and the
Bill.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable members,
I had net the pleasure of hearing the remarks,
made Iby the bonourable memiber for NewWestminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor). Unfortunately, when I entered the Chamber thisafternoon he had terminated hie address. I
have been told, however, of the significancethat the honourable gentleman attacbed to theremarks that I made on this measure in thisHouse on a previeus occasion, and it is a
significance that I cannot accept. The remarks
te which the bonourable member alluded are
no doubt the remarks which are to be found
on page 124 of Hansard. At that turne I was
dealing with an argument that had heen made
by an honourable member who bad spoken.
before me, te the effect that if this Bill were
te pass and becorne law, the resuît would be
a great loss te the country. My rernarks were
directed merely te answering that argument,
and 1 stated, as will be found upon reference
te Hansard, that, wbetber it resulted in a loss
or net, the country had a duty to perform.
The opinion wbich 1 expressed was only my
own opinion. Possibly I was not correctly
inforrned, but I was under the impressionand I still am-that notwithstanding the passing of this law, there were a number of places
in the West Indies and soine other islands to
which liquor might be directed. I doulit
very much that the Governrnent could prevent
the expert of liquor to those countries any
more than it could prevent its being exported
to England. I will take the liberty of reading that part of my rernarks, se that anyhody
who may read the speech of the benourable
gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Taylor) wil
have an opportunity of judging whether or
net bis interpretation is correct. What I said
was ths:
Sorne honourable gentlemen eeem te be concerne'd witb the confequýences of the passing of
this Act, or te fear that it will entail a very
large loss of revenue. As f ar as I arn concerned,
1 do net think that if the Government ha@ a
duty to perform towards a foreign. country the
question of whether there is a lose of five or
ten millions should eut any figure at ail. I eay

278

SENATE

that the Government should discharge its obligations irrespective of the loss which may be
sustained. I doubt very much, however, and in
this I am agreed with the honourable leader on
the other side (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), whether
this measure will prevent liquor from being
exported to the United States. It is my opinion
that the distillers will very likely arrange to
ship their goods to Jamaica, Cuba, and St.
Pierre-Miquelon, and then the Canadian Government will not be concerned.
Apparently I was not right in speaking of
Cuba. I understand from the admirable speech
that has just been delivered by the right
honourable member for Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) that there is a
treaty between Cuba and the United States
which would stand in the way. Instead of
Cuba I might have cited three or four other
islands in the West Indies. Then I was interrupted by the honourable leader on the other
side, as follows:
Hon. Mr. Willoughby: Why not? If you have
a strong suspicion that it is going there, why
not?
Hon. Mr. Beique: The Bill is not intended
to prevent that. Under this Bill it will be open
to the distillers to export their goods te England or to any European country, or te St.
Pierre-Iiquelon, Jamaica, Cuba, or any other
island net coming within the category described
in the Bill. I am quite sure-and the honourable gentleman expressed the same opinionthat these people will find some way of selling
their goods, and I think he will find that
instead of this legislation depriving the country
of revenue it will very likely have the contrary
effect. I think the distillers will pay the $9 per
Imperial gallon instead of exporting the goods
under a bond, because the moment the $9 is
paid they can dispose of their goods as they
sec fit, provided they do net, te the knowledge
of the Canadian officers, send their goods te
the United States or te any prohibition country.
I think it is ineumbent upon the Governent
te discharge its full duty in the matter. It is
a question of propriety or impropriety. It would
be improper on the part of the Canadian Government not te introduce, and on the part of
:his honourable House net to pass. this legislaLion, which is as clear as it can be made, and
which bas received the almost unanimous approval of the members of the House of Conmens. It would be improper to show any
indication that the memibers of this House are
disposed to support the snugglers or te help the
distillers or anybody -]se to introduce intoxicating liquor into the United States in violation
of the treaty.
I repeat-my opinion may be wrong, or it
may be right-that I am not at all concerned
with, nor am I the guardian of, the interests
of the distillers.
I am concerned solely with
the duty which the members of this honourable House owe to the country at large.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, I had the privilege of discussing this subject on a previous occasion, and I have na
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

intention now of going over the same ground.
There are, however, just a few brief remarks
which I should like to make before the vote
is taken.
In regard to the discussion in which I took
part the other day, I would remind the
House that what I said was based on the argument of the Minister of National Revenue in
another place, and of my right honourable
friend from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), who was leading this House at the
time. Both of those gentlemen, as the House
will remember, without reservation and without
conceding that there was one element of merit
in the proposition, were opposed to the same
principle Ihat is involved in the Bill now before the House. They are on record, and I
read to this House from the record what they
said. As far as I know, neither of them has
taken back one word of the arguments which
he addressed to Parliament one year ago; and
I think I had a right to believe that those
honourable gentlemen were sincere in 1929,
and that as they did not disclaim in 1930 what
they had previously said, they were still of the
same opinion.
I largely concur in what was said in the
very cloquent address of my right honourable
friend froin Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster). With hin I look forward to the
time when, persuaded by his eloquence, other
honourable members in this House and in another place who are in favour of this Bill, and
who believe that it should become law in order
to save the souls of the people of the United
States, will combine their efforts to save the
souls of the people of Canada. I presume that
the souls of Canadians are just as precious as
the souls of the people of the United States,
and that consistency will prevail, and that, with
the aid of my right honourable friend hero,
this will be the last year when honourable
members opposite will permit such an iniquity
in this country as licensed distillers and
brewers. I presume that if this business is to
be crushed out for our neighbours across the
line, steps will be taken to crush it out in
Canada. Surely in all consistency we must
stand together and tell the distillers and
brewers of Canada, "No more liquor in this
country."
My right honourable friend described in his
own eloquent and dramatic way the effect of
the treaty, under which we have consented to
the officers of the United States going out
twelve miles from the shore, seizing our ships,
destroying and sinking them, and killing the
people on them. When I heard that description I said to myself, as my right honourable
friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) said
in 1929, "Have we not conceded enough to

MAY 20, 1930
these people, who are always ready to take,
very unwilling to give?" What are we getting
in return? Absolutely nothing.
Now, honourable members, since the Easter
recess some returns have been brought down
to this House by the Government and laid
on the Table. They contain entirely new
matter. Chief among the arguments that have
been put forward on behalf of this Bill in
another place was one referred to by my right
honourable friend from Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) to-day. It was said that
this business of shipping liquor to the United
States was corrupting the Civil Service. Are
there any protests from the Civil Service or
from the civil servants who are engaged in this
particular line of activity? We have a return
on that question. What do the Government
say? They are asked whether there was any
correspondence or protest of any kind in
regard to this liquor business on behalf of the
civil servants. What is the answer? "Nil."
That means, I presume, nothing. That disposes of one of those objections. Another
apparently powerful argument was that the
provincial governments were demanding action
on the part of the Federal Government.
Copies were requested of all correspondence or
representations from the provincial governments in Canada asking the Dominion Government to refuse clearances. What was the
answer? Again it was "Nil"--nothing. The
provincial governments have said nothing. Yet
we were told at an earlier stage that this Government was being urged forward in this
matter by the Civil Service and the provincial
governments. That statement, according to
the statements now made by the Federal
Government, misrepresented the facts.
How much more does this Government
know? They were asked to state the number
of vessels of Canadian ownership carrying
liquor as cargo which cleared from Canadian
ports for United States ports during the years
1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929. And what do they
say? Here is another return that was laid
on the Table of this House. "No information."
They were asked the number of vessels of
United States ownership carrying liquor as
cargo which cleared from Canadian ports for
United States ports during the years 1926,
1927, 1928 and 1929. What do they say?
They were asked the
"No information."
nationalities of the captains and crews of these
Canadian and United States vessels. The
answer again is, "No information." They
were asked the number of those vessels which
exceeded five-ton burden. The answer again
is, "No information." And they were asked
the average size in gallons of the cargoes on

each trip of these vessels during the above
years. There again the answer is, "No information."
I have tried to form some opinion of the
necessity for the Government's action. My
honourable friend opposite cannot put his
finger upon a request by the United States
of America for this legislation. The Government have had no request for it from
our neighbours. There is nothing to show
that the people of Canada or of the United
States really want it. Judging by the returns
which they have made, it is apparent that
the Government know practically nothing
about the business, and yet they come to this
House and ask us to pass this measure.
There was one point which I think I did
not mention on a previous occasion, namely,
the conflict between the Minister of National
Revenue and the Prime Minister. If I did
refer to it, there will be no harm in doing so
again. The Minister of National Revenue insisted that if this legislation became law Canada would be bound to see to its enforcement.
Now, the Prime Minister has made the statement that we shall not be so bound, and we
have been informed in this House that the
Government will not take the responsibility
for the enforcement of the law. What is the
situation? What is the present stand taken
by the Minister of National Revenue? Athough he voted for this Bill, he is reported
to have said in another place on March 25:
I have no apologies whatever to offer for what
I said last year. The views I then held I hold
now.
If this Bill is passed we shall be giving up
a revenue of $15,000,000. The responsibility
of seeing that the law is carried out will be
placed in the hands of a Minister of the
Crown who is on record as saying positively
that the legislation will result in great additional expense to the country and will be
futile. That in itself is a reason why this
House should not pass the Bill. We should
not forego this revenue and put the subjectmatter of the law in charge of a Minister who
says that he does not believe in the legislation,
and that it cannot be enforced.
My honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor) spoke about the
export of liquor via St. Pierre and other
places. What is the record of the export of
liquor from this country to the British West
Indies? Anyone who knows anything about
that business is aware that the bulk of the
liquor shipped to those islands is not for
consumption there, but for export to the
United States. In 1925 we consigned to the
British West Indies 219,759 gallons of whisky,

280

SENATE

valued at $1,119,786. Last year the flow had
grown to 634,358 gallons, of a value of $3,220,787. Are we going to permit that stream to
continue, or do we întend to be consistent
and honest with ourselves? Shall we be satisfied with the prohibition of direct clearances
to the United States when we know that the
liquor is reaching our neighbours by way of
St. Pierre and the British West Indies?
In conclusion, I should like to make it
clear that the effect of the amendmnent proposed by the honourable gentleman from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) is not to destroy
the Bill, but simply to provide that it shall
corne into force and opera-tion at the wiIl
of the Government. If this amendment be
adopted and the Bill be assented to, the whole
matter will ho in the hands of the Government, and they will bo able to determine
whether a reciprocal treaty can be arranged.
The Government profess to be in favour of a
reciprocal treaty, and that seems to be the
common attitude. Why should not the United
States be obliged in -the same way as Canada to prevent smuggling?
If the whole
matter of the prevention of smuggling, not
only of liquor but of other goods, can ho
covered by a treaty equally binding on boath
countries, then, as my honourable friend fromn
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) says, there will &e
no need for 'this Bill. And he proposes that
the matter be lef t to the discretion of the
Government to decide at any time after
Parliament prorogues whether they wilI put the
legislation into force or endeavour to conclude
a treaty with the United States. So when we
vote for this amendment we vote for the Bill
and the turning over of the whole matter
to the absolute control of the Government of
the day.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourable senators,
I did not vote on the amendment, because I
~vspaired with the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. White). Had I voted,
I should have voted against the amendment.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Honourable members,
before the motion for third reading is put I
want to draw attention to an evident error in
line 27, paragraph (c) of subsection 1 of the,
Bill.
It will ho observed that the word
"exportation" is used where it should be
"importation."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That lias been corrected. It was a clerical error and was correeted before the House ad.iourned.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:

When?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Before our hast
adlournment.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
We cannot take
any risk about that. We must sce to it now
that the Bill is made right.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
the Committee.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was not present,
but, as .1 understand, the cherical error in
using the word "Iexportation " where it should
bo "Iimportation " was corrected at the time.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
We must get ahI
the niggers out of the woodpile.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn telling my
honourable friend what occurred.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
If the honourable gentleman was not present, how does
lie know what happened?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Clerk of the
House lias informed me that the attention
of the House was calhed to the fact that the

281

MAY 20, 1930
clerical error, which has just been poin'ted
out, existed, and with the consent. of the
Cornrittee the clerical error was corrected.
The Clerk of the House made the correction
at the time.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The Bill does not show
that thait correction was made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOITRT: The Bill which is
now being voted upon has the word "importation " substituted for the word "exportation."
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It is flot ini this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURI: I do not know
about my honourable friend's copy; I ar n ot
responsible for it. If honourable senators
will listen, perh.aps they will get the information they want. Subsection (c) reads:
(c) it shaI be un.la.wful to make any entry
for exportation of any intoxicating liquor,
destined for dalivery in any country into which
the importation of ouch liquor às prohibited by
law.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is in
the Bill that His Honour the Speaker lias.
Io it neoessary
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
that the Bill as amended should go baek to
the Commons? Did it corne to this House ini
that form?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is not necessary to send the amendment to the Commons. It is merely a clerical error; it is flot
an arnendment of substance at ail.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Does the honourable gentleman say it was corrected in this
House?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The form in
whîch it is printed and in which it came to
us is the form in which it was passed by the
other House, I am informed. I do not know
about that myseif.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have no information about that.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY'- If that is so,
it will have to go back there with the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, if that is the
case.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, that this Bill
be now read a third time?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: As amended.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I beg to differ
with my honourable friend. It is very mucli
an arnendment of substance.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Speaking for the
Governrnent, I arn prepared to take the responsibility of moving that thie Bill be now
read a third time, according to the officiai
copy.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: But this Bill wil
have to go back to the House of Commons
anyway, when we give it the third reading.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Surely -there is no
officer of this Chamber who can alter a Bill
without the authority of the House. This is
the Bill that was passed in another place and
there is no officer eonnected with this Chamber who dures put a finger upon the Bull
unless we vote -the authority.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have explained to
my honourable friend that that; is exactly
what did take place. The clerical error was
pointed out to the House and the House
directed that the correction be made.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: But the honourable
gentleman will not allow us to correct it
now.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; in this House.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Who gave the authorit.y for it?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Committee
gave it.

Hon. Mr. CURRY: The point raised, I
think, is a very important one. I have tried
to f ollow the discussion. As I understand, the
Bill as it passed the other House was in the
printed f orrn that we have before us. If there
bas been a correction made, we should be
informed who made it and what authority
was given for the correction. Was the amendment made by the other House?

Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
rnittee of the Whole.

When it was in Com-

Hon. Mr. BAR.NARD:
Then surely it
goes back as an amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUIRT:

That may be.

Hon. Mr. . GILLIS: It must be reported
as an ameudment.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I think the proper
thing would be to pass the Bill as amended.
We have amended it here, and we must report
it as amended, and the other House will presumably aeoept that arnendment when it is
sent over there.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My information
is what I have received from the Clerk of the
House.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
The Bill was
amended.

282

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Clerk points
out to me that on page 137 of our proceedings appears the following discussion:
Hon. Mr. Bureau: During the debate an
honourable senator raised a question about the
word "exportation" in the twenty-seventh lins
of the Bill. My honourable friend the leader
said there would be an amendment suggested.
Would it not be well to make it now?
The Hon. the Speaker: The correction was
made in committee.
Hon. Mr. Bureau: I thought the Bill was
reported without amendment.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: It is not an amendment; it is taken simply as a clerical error, and
the Clerk of the House is empowered to correct
it.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Where is his power?
Where is his authority?
An Hon. SENATOR:
error.

It was only a clerical
No, no; we

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members, I think that the matter
is one which can be easily decided. When
that Bill came from the other House it was in
a certain form. When it came out of Committee and before it came up for third reading
bere, there was a word addedSome Hon. SENATORS:

Changed.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Changed. If that be so, it seems to me that
the Bill has to be passed on its third reading
is amended.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Certainly.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And sent back to the other House for its
ipproval. I do not think there is any doubt
Ibout that.
There cannot be any

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: In
the opinion of this House it may be a very
unimportant amendment-it may be considered a clerical error, but it is a Bill that is
different to the extent of the change from the
Bill which came to us. Our opinion as to its
being all right may not be the opinion of the
Lower House. I think we shall have to send it
back as amended. At all events, rather than
have a dispute about it, why not do so?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In saying what I
did, I was taking the stand taken by the
leader himself (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) before
the adjournment. I thoroughly agree that it
should bc clear, and that there should be no
question of that kind about the Bill.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am simply taking the stand taken by the honourable leader
of the Government when the Bill was in committee. He thought that, as a clerical error,
it could be corrected and that there was no
necessity for an amendment. That may be
right or it may be wrong. Being his substitute,
I thought I should follow his method. If there
is any doubt about it, I am not willing to
assume the responsibility. J want the matter
to be cleared up, and would ask that the Bill
be read the third time as amended in committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
will not let it go that way.

Hon. Mr. BELAND:
objection to that.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
If you can change
one word you can change a hundred, and in
that way smuggle all kinds of legislation
through the House.

Carried.

Hon. Mr. COPP: It does seem to me that
it would be looked upon as a clerical error,
and so could be dealt with by this House.
I understand that if a clerical error appears in
a Bill, the Clerk, under the rules of this House,
bas full authority to make the correction.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable
gentleman will have difficulty in finding that
rule. If there were a clerical error in our own
proceedings we should have power to correct
it; but what power have we to change a Bill
coming from the other House?
We have a
remedy in our hands-Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Even the transposition of a comma might
vitally change the whole face of the Bill. No
doubt the simple and direct way is to pass
the third reading of the Bill as amended.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Docs my honourable friend insist that I withdraw the motion
for the third reading, or does he consent to
the question being put on the motion for the
third reading of the Bill as amended?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That is quite agreeable.

As amended.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Upon reading Hansard, to which the honourable leader has just
now referred, I find that the question was
raised by the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton). I see
here:
Hon. Mr. Lyneh-Staunton: Did not the Bill
pass the House of Commons with that in it?
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: I do not know. I think
it occurred between the two Houses.
Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton:
It
being six
o'clock, I would move the adjournment of the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: Did the honourable
gentleman declare that he was. through with
his remarks?

283

MAY 20, 1930
Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton: I arn through.
Hon. Mr. Danduranýd: If there are no other
apeakere, I will a sk the House to divide.
Hon. Mr. Pope: They wiil not divide just
now.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The fact is that there was no amendment
read by the Clerk when the Committee rose.
It was taken for granted by this House that
the error had ocurred while the Bill was being
reprinted, and it was looked upon as a clerical
error. The amendment was flot read before
the Chair and declared carried.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand,
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
is quite willing that with the word "importation " substituted in paragrapli c for the
word "exportation," the Bill should get the
third reading without guing back to Cornmittee.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, without
taking the vote again. The Bill passes as
amended.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The proper course is to
move it back to Committee.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand it,
with the word "importation" substituted for
the word "exportation " in paragraph c, the
third reading may now take place, by Lave
of the House. Have I the leave of the House
to make that motion?
Hon. Mr. GREEN: No. If it is brought
in properly, we will accept it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If one honourable
gentleman objects I cannot do it, and I wilI
move that the Bill be referred back to Committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If the Bill is to
be amended as proposed, it will have to be
done in the usual way, by a motion, duly
seconded, that the word "exportation" be
struck out and the word "importation" be
substituted therefor. That is the only way
we can amend it in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: We do not know
whether this is a clerical error or not, or
whether or not it occurred while the Bull was
in transit fromn the House of GCommons.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think the
honourable leader has consented to the amendment being made. What is the use of argument?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My impression is
that the Bill as coming from the other House
contained the word "exportation."

Hon. Mr. BELAND moved that the Bill be
amended by bhe striking out of the word
"iexportation," in the twenty-seventh lie, and
tihe substitution of -the word "importation"
therefor.
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the third
reading of the Bill as amended.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
At six o'clock the'Senate took reoess.
The Senate resumed at eight o'clock.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the third
reading of Bill 132, an Act respecting the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
He said: Honourable members of the
Senate, since this Bill was last up for consideration, I have had an explanation with
regard to it. In 1919 the members of the
force received a bonus of $125 for the officers,
75 cents for the sergeants, and 50 cents for
the constables. This bonus continued for
five years.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

Ia that per year?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
1924.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
yearly?

From 1919 to
That much

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: For five years.
In 1924, when the pension was fixed on the
basis of the salarythen received by the offcers
-and men, this bonus was not taken into
account. It ehouhd have been included in
order 'to determine the rate of pensions of
both the men and their widows. The Bill is
now brought in for the purpose of correcting
that error, so that the pension may be based
on the pay received by the men at that
time, plus the bonus which was paid during
the five years.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable gentleman was to get some figures as to
the amount.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The amount would
be about $8,000 annually. That of course
will go on decreasing gradually until it is
wholly wiped out.

284

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That makes it
quite clear. The notation on the opposite
side of the Bill was very misleading. It was
not the fault of the honourable gentleman
but it was obvious that some serious error had
been made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I must confess that
I did not quite understand the difficulty. The
explanatory note on my copy is quite correct,
and I could not follow the argument.
Hon. Mr.
$3,650.000?

WILLOUGHBY:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was spared that.
My copy was quite in accordance with the
provisions of the Bill.

read the third time, and passed.
FAIR WAGES AND EIGHT HOUR DAY
BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 49, an Act respecting Fair Wages and an
Eight Hour Day for Labour employed on
Publie Works of the Dominion of Canada.Hon. Mr. Belcourt.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I thought the
honourable gentleman would have been ready
to concur in the suggestion for a special committee, so that we might hear some evidence.
I suppose every senator has been circularized
in regard to this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have a statement which may be found satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think it would
be well for the honourable gentleman to make
that statement before we deal with the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The right honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster) asked me to procure a
statement from the Department of Justice as
to the exact meaning of the Bill. I shall now
read that statement. It is dated to-day, is
addressed to H. H. Ward, Esq., Deputy Minister of Labour, and is as follows.
J have the honour to refer to your letter of
the 19th instant directing my attention to the
debate which took place in the Senate on Friday, 16th instant, on the second reading of
Bill No. 49, entitled "An Act respecting Fair
Wages and an Eight Hour Day for Labour
employed on Public Works of the Dominion
of Canada," and to the undertaking which was
given at the close of the debate by the honourable the acting leader of the Government in
the Senate to obtain the opinion of this Department on the question whieh was raised and
discussed in the course of the debate, namely,
whether or not the provisions of this Bill, if it
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

should become law, will a.pply to the Canadian
National Railways. By direction of the honourable the Minister of Labour, you request my
opinion upon this question for transmission to
the honourable the acting leader of the Government in the Senate.
The application of the provisions of the Bill
is governed by these material words in sub-s. 1
of sec. 3,-

"Every contract made hereafter with the
Government of Canada for the construction,
remodelling, repair or demolition of any work,
shall be subject te the following conditions
respecting wages and hours," etc.
The Canadian National Railway Company as
constituted under the provisions of chap. 13 of
the Statutes of Canada, 1919 (lst sess.),
(consolidated with amendments as Chapter 172,
R.S.C. 1927), is a corporation entirely independent of and distinct from the Crown or
from any Department of the Government of
Canada. It operates and manages, as a national
railway system, under the name of "Canadian
National Railways," as a mere collective or
descriptive designation, certain lines of railways
and railway works, the ownership of which is

vested, except in the case of lines of railway
cf the Canadian Government Railways, either
in the Canadian National Railway Company or
in certain constituent and subsidiary companies
formerly comprised in the Canadian Northern
system. The ownership of the Canadian Government Railways remains vested in His
Majesty in the right of the Dominion, but these
railways as specifically designated for the purpose of sec. 10 of the Act of 1919 by Order
in Council of the 20th January, 1923 (P.C. 115),
were by that Order in Council, which was
passed under the authority conferred by sec.
Il of the said Act, entrustedThe following is in quotation marks:
-"in respect of the management and operation
thereof"
That ends the quotation.
-entrusted "in respect of the management and
operation thereof" to the Canadian National
Railway Company.
In my opinion, while the said Order in
Council had effect to transfer to the Canadian
National Railway Company the Canadian Government Railways in respect of the management and operation thereof, it left unimpaired
and still subsisting the powers vested in the
Minister of Railways and Canals under the
Government Railways Act, R.S.C. 1927, chap.
173, respecting the construction or maintenance

of G-vernment railways and works connected
therewith, although, by the provisions of sec.
16 of the Canadian National Railway Act as
enacted by chap. 13 of the Statutes of 1928,
these powers are required to be exercised subject, except in respect of certain specified
matters, to the provisions of the Railway Act.
In accordance vith this view, contracts involving the construction or maintenance of works
for the Canadian Government Railways are
made by His Majesty as represented by the
Minister of Railways and Canals, and I entertain no doubt that such contracts would in
future become subject to the conditions respecting wages and hours set out in sub-s. 1 of sec.
3 of Bill 49, if and when that Bill should be
enacted into law.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Who signs that?

MAY 20, 1930
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Stuart Edwards,
the Deputy Minister of Justice.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Then I take it
that this Act wouid appiy to the construction
and operation of the Canadian National
Railways.

Not to the opera-

tion-and they nre constructing to a considerable cxtent every year.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 dîd net understand that. My understanding is that -the
Bill will not apply to that portion of the
Canadian National Railways which neyer was
the property of the Government of Canada,
but that it will appiy to that portion whicb
was the property of the Government of Canada, and still is.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT:
better read it over again.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Perhaps

I had

Oh, ne.

Hon. Mr. BEJJCOURT (reading):
In my opinion, while the said Order in
Couneil had effect te transfer te the Canadian
National Railway Company the Canadian Gevern-ment Railways in respect of the management
and operation thereof,-I emphasize those words-Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
apply te the contracte.

That does net

No. "In respect
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

I think those words have a significance of their
ownlef t uninîpaired and still subaisting the

powers vested in the Minister of Railways and
Canais under the Government Railways Act,
R.S.C. 1927, chap. 173, respecting the construction or maintenance of Government railways
and works connected therewith, aithough, by
the provisions of sec. 16 of the Canadian
National Railway Act as enacted by chap. 13
of the Statutes of 1928, these powers are
required to be exercised subject, except in
respect of certain specified matters, te the
provisions of the Railway Act. In accordance
with this view, contracte invelving the construction or maintenance of werks fer the Canadian Government Raâiways are made by His
Majesty as represented by the Minister of
Railways and Canais, and I entertain ne doubt
that such contracts would in future become
subjeet te the conditions respecting wages and

if and when that Bill should be enacted inte
law.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: As a matter of fact,
has not the Government of Canada delegated
to the Canadiana National Railways the
operation and management of the Intercolonial Railway?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, not of the Intercolonial.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes, the operation and management.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, yes. The Department of Railways and Canals, as I understand it, is neither operating nor managing
the Intercolonial or the Prince Edward Island
Railway at the present time. On the other
hand, the Government of Canada took over
the Grand Trunk Raiiway and the Canadian
Northern Railway, and they became the
property of Canada. Are they not Governnient raiiwavs? Is it only the fact that the
Governnent of Canada built certain railways
that makes them Government railways, and
are the others not Government railways because they were purchased, or were acquired
in some nther way? I cannot sec the distinction. As a matter of fact, what railways in
Canada are to-day operated and nanaged by
the Government of Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: None.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They have been
mentioned-the IntercolonialHon. Mr. CALDER: They are not operated by the Government of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They are all
operated and managed by the Canadian National Railway Company. Operation means
the running of the trains; it does net mean
construetion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You have to distinguish between the railways included under
the general term "Govcrnment railwavs" and
those railways which are operated, managed,
repaired, reconstructed, and so on, by the
Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: None such exist. I
should like to hear the honourable gentleman
name one railway in Canada, with the possible exception of the Hudson Bay Railway,
that is operated and managed by the Department of Railways.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think all the railways in Canada that have been committed to
the Canadian National Railways are Government railways, and all Government railways
have been so committed, with the possible
exception of the Intercolonial, apart from its
management and operation.
Hon.

Mr. STANFIELD.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:

So has the

Grand

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In a sense.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In every sense.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But to the Caoadian National Railway Company exclusively
has been assigned the operation and management of the Canadian Northern and the Grand
Trunk. The other railways that are called
Government railways are in a different position. What we are trying to ascertain is whether this Bill is going to apply in any respect
to the Canadian National Railways, which are
under the operation and management of the
Canadian National Railway Company. I say
no.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Would it net
be desirable to have a special committee-I
thought before that the honourable gentleman
was going to accede to that-and to allow the
various contractors and others who are interestied in a very large way in construction
work to be heard? We could refer the Bill to
our own Railway Committee. If such action
were going to delay the House, I may say
frankly to the bonourable leader of the Government, I would not at this late stage press
the point; but I think we have ample time.
It is our duty to satisfy people who are intensely interested, and wbose business is construction in a large way. I had hoped that tho
honourable gentleman would accede to my
proposal, and that the Bill might be sent to
the Committee very promptly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If that were done
just now, the hearing would be very largely
one-sided.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Why?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The representatives
of the other point of view, the labour organizations, have generally assumed that this matter
was thoroughly threshed out in another place,
and that both parties there were practically
confirmed in the view that it was time the
Canadian Government took a reasonable lead
in implementing the terms of the Treaty of
Peace and the proposals adopted by the International Conference in Washington in 1919.
Those parties te the dispute-if there is a dispute-have assumed long since that there
would be no further general discussion. Now
certain gentlemen have made representations
to you and to me during the past few days,
and have lobbied, and circularized every bonourable member of this HouseHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Net lobbied.

MAY 20, 1930
Hon. Mr. MUR.DOCK: Maybe I should
speak only for myself. Surely there is not a
single question under consideration that in the
time at our disposal cannot be answered here
just as well as if these people were permitted
10 bring a flood of witnesses into a private
roomHon. Mr. SHARPE: Oh, no. It is a public
room.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I arn sure that if
the honourable gentleman frons Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) were here, he would want
other parties to be heard.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Certainly. Let
us hear Vhem all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is there time?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think not. I
think that what is proposed would be a great
mistake, and would be unfortunate at this
time and in this place, because every question
upon which we have been circularized can be
answered and dealt with right here. As a
matter of fact, there is nothing to the staternents that have been put forth by certain
gentlemen. There is nothing contemplated
that is any more rigîd or far-reaching than
what we have had here in Canada, to ahl
intents and purposes, for nearly thirty years,
by Order in Couneil. This Bill is brought
down in order to stabilize conditions and
establish a legal basis, just as was done by
the Bill introduced and passed here to regulate traffie on Dominion Governrnent property.
I arn not
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
assuming that things that are asked by contractors or others represented are necessarily
going to be concurred in. With regard to
having representatives of labour here, 1 think
they cen 'be hrought together as quickly as
others, where it is in their interest 10 be
present. They have their paid representatives-Il arn not saying that disrespectfully
at all-whose business it is to look after their
affairs, and 1 venture 10 state that if thitb
Comrnittee sat to.enorrow rnorning we could
have at the meeting representatives of labour
as well as of the contractors. This suggestion is not made through any hostility to
labour at aIl, so far as 1 arn concerned, but
as this Blouse can afford time to permit
various classes of the cornrunity 10 be heard
and have their interests considered, 1 think
that is the least we can accord 10 thern.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, 1 arn not surprised that there is
a good deel of misunderstanding concerning

b

the position of the Canadian National Railways and the Government Railways. As a
matter of fact, in the amalgamation, which
is flot yet completed-I arn not telling tales
out of school-there were, in addition to the
Governrnent Railways, about one hundred
separate companies. Ail their bond holders,
trustees and stock holders had to be consulted, and that is work that must be done
carefully and quietly. 1 would suggest to rny
honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) that on looking at the Act creating the Canadian National Railway Company
hie would flnd there, if my memory serves
me, a provision for placing the conipany railways under the -Canadian National Railways
in every respect; and that although the stock
of those railways is in the hands of thE
Finance Minister or the Receiver General, on
behaîf of the Government, the Canadian
National Railway -Comnpany, as organized, has
complete control over ail these companies.
No construction is donc except on the recommendation of the Canadian National Railways,
and though they have to corne to Parliament
for rnoney, the work is financed by the Canadian National Railway Company. Tenders
are asked for and construction is undertaken
by the Canadian National Railway Company,
and the Government has nothing whatever to
do wjth this. I think that will become clear
to my honourable friend if hie will read the
statute creating the Canadian National Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My difficulty arises
from the language used by the honourable
gentleman who is acting as leader of the
Blouse (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). H1e tried to
draw a line be-tween Government Railways and
Canadian National Railways, saying that this
Bill would apply to Governrnent Railways
and not to Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
arn perfeotly righit.

That is right.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
your instructions say?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

1

That is what

Yes.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I understood the
honourable gentleman (Hýon. Mr. Belcourt),
hie said there are two classes of railways. But
in fact there are not two classes of railways.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: One reason why I
should like to see this Bill go to Comrnittee
is because I want to have that point cleared
up.

288

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I am not
objecting to the Bill going to Committee. I
think we have time to consider it there. I
am in favour of the Bill protecting employees.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

We all are.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We all are.
But I want to make it clear that there are
two kinds of railways. One has remained in
the Government ownership and controlHon. Mr. CALDER:

Give me an example.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
colonial?

The

Inter-

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In my opinion
the Intercolonial will never be handed over,
under the Act, to the Canadian National
RailwaysHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Nor the P.EI.?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Nor the P.E.I.
The amalgamation is under a statute. The
private companies are operated, managed and
controlled by the Canadian National Railway Company under that sta-tute. The Governnent Railways do not come under that
statute.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But there are no
private railways. Surely the honourable
gentleman recognizes that as far as the Grand
Trunk and the Canadian National Railways
are concerned, -the Government acquired
those railways for the Dominion as the
property of Canada.
Righit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

That is clear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: The Canadian Govci rnent built the Intercolonial Railway. Both
that road and the Canadian National Railway
belong entirely to Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Then why is one
called a Goveornment railway and the other a
private railwav?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: One is a Government railway, and under that statute the
others are not. If the honourable gentleman
will read the Act creating the Canadian National Railway Company ho will see the distinction. There is a difference with regard
to the Intercolonial. That road was constructed and paid for; there are no securities
against it, but there are securities outstanding
against all the railway conpanies that were
private companies, which are treated under
the statute by themselves. The Intercolonial
Railway is given over to the Canadian National for operation and management.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:

And construction.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If my honourable friend will look it up, I think he will
find that is not the case; but I am not sure
about that. I think the Government Railways,
constructed and paid for by the people of
Canada, are in a class by themselves, under
the management and operation of the Canadian National, but not really owned by the
Canadian National, as the former privately
owned companies are. There may be something that we ought to clear up along that
line. For years the provisions of this Bill
have been carried out in Governmont contracts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Council.

Under Order in

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Yes, under
Order in Council; and regulations, I know,
have gone further than that: where subsidies
have been given to certain railways, they have
been asked, as part of the consideration for
the subsidies, to come under the fair wage
clause in regard to construction.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE:
Under what
classification would you put the branch linos
that have been built since the formation of
the Canadian National Raihxvavs?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They are built
by the Canadian National Railways. They
would come under the Canadian National
Railways Act as part and parcel of the system.

Hon. Mr. WHITE:
Government.

They are built by the

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
No. The
morney for the construction of these lines has
to come fron the Goverrnent, but they are
constructed by the Canadian National Railway Comprany. The matter is complicated,
as I said before, and I have no personal objection to the matter being cleared up in
comnuisittee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Surely.
Hin. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is it his understaniing that the Canadian National Railwavs will cone under the operation of this
Aet, if it is passe.d?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Then I am to
understan-d from the letter from the Deputy
Minister of Justice that the Government
Railways will come under this Act. Is that
the fact?

MAY 20, 1930
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I should
understand that, fromn this letter.
Hlon. Mr. GRIFiSBAOH:
What does the
honourable acting leader of the Governanent
say about that?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps I can put
it in this wayHon. Mr. GRJESBACH: I want to ask the
honourable gentleman who sits beside him,
too.
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: If rny honourable
friend will let me apeak, I will try to answer
him.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
An honourahie
gentleman who sits beside me says thst ho is
quite sure that the Canadian National Railways do not. corne unider this Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They do not.
Hon. Mr. GRIPESBACH: I arn rnerely pointing that out as a reason why we ahould, have
a committee to cross-examrine the Deputy Minister of Justice and find. out what he means,
with the objeet of roconciling the different
views.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think thero
is not a difforence of view, but rather a
difference of understanding of the view as ex-.
pressed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If I arn allowed
two minutes, I can perhaps rernove the difficulties and doubts. If honourable gentlemen
wilI orsly read section 3 of the Bill now under
discus.sion, they will lind there, I think,,a very
clear answor to ail this difficulty:
Every contract made hereafter with the
Government of Canada for construction,
romodelling, repair or demolition of any work
shall be subject to tho following conditions
respocting wages and hour:Now, the words "contract with the Govornment of Canada" cannot possibly iniclude any
contract with the Canadian National Railway
Com~pany.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That suggests another
question. As I understand the situation, the
Governrnent of Canada doos not lot any contracts on the Government railways that are
operated and managed by the Canadian
National.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think that is
quite right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Thon the Bill means
nothing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, it doos mean
something.

289

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What does it mean?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This is not a
railway Bill. It applies to public works.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Let meo have the
narnes of the railways that are oporated and
rnanagod by the Govornrnent of Canada today.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask the
honourable mernber, is he convinced that a
contract f or the doing of any of the work
mentioned in section 3, regarding railways
operatod and rnanaged by the Canadian
National Railway Cornpany, would not ho a
contract with the Governrnent? It would bo
a contract with the Canadian National Railway Company. Ahi the contracta with railways that are undor the juriefdiction and control of the Canadian National Railway Company wouhd be dealt with by the Canadian
National Railway Comny; ail other contracte for these works would ho mnade with
the Government direct.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think it is
abundantly clear that we do not all under.
stand the distinction. I know thut I do not.
It seems to me the former Minister of Railways (Hight Hon. Mr. Graham) should be
present at the committee, if ho is agreeable.

COMPANIES BILL

The Senate again went into Commiittee on
Bill 9, an Act to amend the Companies ActHon. Mr. Belcourt.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable members,
you will remember that on Thursday last
this Bill was considered in Committee and
approved, with the exception of section 14,
which wa8 reserved. It has been suggested
to-day that instead of section 14 being
changed, the Bill might 'be amended by a
Fourth Part added to the principal Act, which
is Chapter 27 of the Revised Statutes of 1927.
Part I of the Act of 1927 deails with com.pawles
incorporated by letters patent; Part II deals
with companies incorporated by special Acta,
and Part III deals with British and foreign
mining companies.
The object of the amendment is to give the
companies incorporatcd otherwise than by

Part I and Part II of the Companies Act the
sanie powers as are given to companies incorporated by letters patent. The powers referreil
to are mentioned in paragraph (g) of section
32 of the Companies Act, which reads as
follows:
(g) to establish and support or aid in the
estavblishmient and support of associations,
institutions, fond6, trusta and convenienees calculated to benefit. enipioyees or ex-employees of
the company, or its predecessors in business, or
the dependents or connections of such persons,
and ta grant pensions and allowances, and ta
make payments towards insurance, and ta
subseribe or guarantee money for charitable or
benevolent objecta, or for any exhibition or for
any public, general or useful object.
If this suggestion is adopted, the iest
method of giving effeet ta it would 'be, I think,
to add ta the Bill a section, which would be
43, and which would rcad in this way:
(1) 'Notwithstanding anything in sections 2
and 153 of this Act, every corporate body
creaited otherwise than by letters patent for
any of the purposes or objecte ta which the

SENATE

legisiative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends, is hereby declared to possff, as
incidentai and ancillary to the powers conferred
by the special Act or charter creating it, power
to establish and support or aid in the eetablishment and support of associations, institutions,
f unds, truste and convemiences intended or calculated to benefit employees or ex-employees of
the corporation, or of its predecessors in business, or the dependents or connections of such
persons, and to grant pensions and allowances,
and to make payments towards insurance, or
for any object like or similar to these foregoing,
and to subserihe or guarantee money for charitable or benevolent objecte or for any public,

war and to substitute for armed force the
appeal to reason and justice for the settlement
of international disputes. Public opinion
throughout the civilized world is ready for, and
in fact demands, peace. Pacifc procedure must
take the place of violence. Mankind at last
realizes that in the international community,
as in the state, there can be no compromise with
violence. The law of the jungle has become
as intolerable in world affairs as it has long
been in national affairs.
The Covenant of the League of Nations
did not, it is true, at the outset decree the
outlawry of war. This was largely, if not wholly,
because the means to end war, and the pacific
means to take its place in the effective adjustment of international disputes, were not then
apparent and could not be clearly apprehended
or devised, and still less could they be applied.
No doubt the necessity of ending war was
uppermost in the minds of the framers of the
Covenant, but for many obvious reasons the
accomplishment of the task was not at the
time possible. Problems of commanding and
absorbing importance requiring the urgent
consideration of the Allied and other nations
had to be solved, such as the occupation of
enemy territory, the reparation of the colossal
losses, the indemnity to be paid by the enemy,
the fixing of new national boundaries, the
protection of minorities, the sanitary conditions and health of a whole continent, economic, social and other matters of national and
international character.
The world was still staggered by the greatest
of human tragedies; it was just emerging from
the most horrible exhibition of brute violence;
the hoary and blasphemous doctrine that war
is inevitable, though crumbling, was not dead.
The possibilities, the sufficiency and efficacy
of conciliation, arbitration or judicial settleSuch was
ment had to be demonstrated.
destined to be, and for an indefinite time, the
principal concern, the main effort of the League
of Nations and of the leading powers of the
world. Hence the many and laborious meetings and conferences held by the League, the
Allied and other powers, at Geneva, Paris,
London, Washington, and elsewhere. Hence
the Covenant of the League of Nations, the
Treaty of Mutual Assistance, the arbitration
treaties, the Geneva Protocol, the Locarno
Pacts, the Four Power Pacific Pact, the Paris
Pact, to mention only the principal ones.
These are the most important and pregnant
acts in the scheme of ultimate universal peace,
which the League of Nations originated, inspired, adopted or supported, and which have
gradually contributed to the end that now
seems susceptible of accomplishment. The

293

substitution of arbitration, conciliation or
judicial settlement for war, for the adjustment
of all international disputes, no longer seems
impossible.
Thus the march towards the goal of world
peace, begun at Versailles, upon the cessation
of the greatest turmoil and upheaval in human
history, impeded at the time by difficulties and
obstacles which to many then seemed and
which still to some appear insurmountable, has
been-it could not have been otherwise-slow,
laboured, and at times apparently hopeless;
but with patience, good-will, faith, courage
and determination, we have got nearer the
goal, which can now be seen in the not too
distant future.
If the going has been slow and trying, let
us not forget the magnitude of the task in
hand. It was started only ten years ago.
What is ten years in the life of this world?
Only, after all, an infinitesimal moment of
time.
To appreciate what has been so far accomplished it is necessary to remember that the
nations had to be taught (and it was the
special function -of the League to teach) that
the doctrine that war is inevitable, and if you
want peace you must prepare for war-"Si
vis pacem, para bellum"-was a fallacy; that,
on the contrary, international peace can be
achieved only through appeal to justice and
reason; that the habit of war must give way
to the habit of peace; that the late war
had brought one-half of the world to the brink
of the abyss; that had the war lasted a little
longer it would have destroyed modern civilization itself; that war no longer pays, but is
disastrous to victor and vanquished and to the
whole world; that the international world
has reached a stage, which national communities have long ago attained, where violence
must cease to be the means to stability,
security and progress.
I purpose, honourable senators, with your
permission and indulgence, to examine briefly
the steps taken from time to time in the
arduous task of the establishment of peace,
and to indicate the results so far secured, as
well as the reasonable hopes which may now
be entertained for the ultimate pacification of
the civilized world.
The objects of the League of Nations are,
stated briefly, "To promote international cooperation and achieve international peace and
security." If time permitted I should like to
refer to the sections of the Covenant in which
these objects are specifically set out, but for
the sake of brevity I shall content myself with
referring particularly to sections 5 to 16. Of
these, the last is the most important.

294

SENATE*

No comment is needed to show what a
significant departure was thus made from all
past history with regard to international difficulties and conflicts.
The Covenant has been attacked and condemned as incomplete and consequently inefficient because:
1. It did not include certain States, and
among these two of the most important, the
United States of America and Russia;
2. It did not specifically and definitely outlaw all wars;
3. It did not provide sufficiently binding
sanctions.
The answer to the first objection is found in
the reasonable hope and expectation that all
civilized nations would eventually abide by
the Covenant.
With regard to the second objection, it
must not be ignored or forgotten that the
Covenant does denounce war of aggression,
and decrees the settlement of all international
quarrels by arbitration, conciliation or judicial
inquiry.
The third objection, the absence of binding
sanctions, was the only lack. It has been
called the "gap" in the Covenant. But the
sufficient answer is that at that time the
gap could not by any human possibility have
been filled and that any attempt to fill it
would have seriously endangered, probably
destroyed, the whole Covenant. The Covenanters were faced with the definite alternative of abandoning the Covenant, with all
the advantage it contained for the cause of
world peace, or accepting it, without such binding sanctions, in the hope and belief, or even
on the chance, that with time and education
the civilized world would insist upon proper
and efficacious sanctions, and that in time the
gap would be filled. Is there any.one to-day
who, in the light of what has since happened,
conscious of the tremendous strides that have
been made towards world peace, can doubt
that the Covenanters chose the only wise
and prudent course?
Speaking for myself, I have a deep conviction, a conviction which I shall, before I
resume my seat, endeavour to fully justify,
tha't the Covenant has for all practical purposes secured the outlawry of war. I refuse
to subscribe to the hoary and utterly false
doctrine that war is inevitable. The statement
that the obligations assumed by the fifty-four
nations, signatories to the Covenant, carry
no sanction, is unfounded. Again I would
ask honourable members to look at the sec,tions of the Covenant to which I have previously referred, and particularly section 16.
It has been said that these sanctions are merely
moral sanctions and consequently insufficient
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

What of national honour
and unreliable.
and prestige; what of the interdependence
and solidarity of nations; what of common
national
interests, political,
social
and
economical, in the international universe;
what of international support and co-operation in this contemporary world of ours and
in the future?
The Covenant, if it has not as yet definitely
outlawed war, has to all intents and purposes
outlawed those States which shall in the
future resort to war, except war in self-defence.
Section 16 of the Covenant can have no other
meaning and no other effect. What State of
our day is there which will declare and prepare for war and deliberately assume the
risks and consequences implied-nay, specifically provided for by section 16?
Let me now briefly deal with some of the
subsequent steps that have been taken towards
world peace.
The Treaty of Mutual Assistance may be
treated as abortive, because it added nothing
that was not already in the Covenant, because
it did not go further than to proclaim a mere
pious wish, because it did nothing more than
state that the High Contracting Parties
solemnly declare that aggressive war is an international crime, and they (the High Contracting Parties) severally undertake that no
one will be guilty of its commission. It must
be conceded that this was but a beautiful
gesture. Certainly it added nothing substantial
to the Covenant.
Then we come to the Geneva Protocol. En
passant, I should like to mention with pride,
in which I am sure every honourable member
will join, that the author of the Geneva
Protocol is a Canadian, Dr. Shotwell. It
specifically purported to outlaw all aggressive
wars. Settlement by pacifie means is made
compulsory under article 10. The aggressor
is defined as the nation that refuses to submit
its case to arbitration, to the Permanent Court
or to the Council of the League; or, having
so submitted its case, refuses to abide by the
decision and resorts to war.
This Protocol, however, did not commend
itself to Great Britain and the Dominions, to
whom the consequential obligations appeared
too

serious.

Like

the

Treaty

of

Mutual

Assistance, the Geneva Protocol merely proclaimed once more a growing world conviction
and a growing desire and determination to
end war.
The Locarno Treaties were signed in 1924.
It was at Locarno that Germany entered the
League. Having offered to renounce all claims
to Alsace-Lorraine, to enter the League as a
permanent member of its Council, to join in
a mutual guarantee as to the Western Front,

and to agree not Vo seek by force any modification on Vhe Eastern Front, Germany was
admitted as a full member of Vhe League, and
Stresemann and Luther, the representatives
of Germany, signed the treaty on bier behaîf.
May I be permitted Vo make a brief
digression here? IV was my good fortune Vo

loss to Germany can be said Vo be irreparable.
He had earned the sincere admiration, the
complete confidence, noV only of his own
people, but of the members of the League and
the most responsible leaders of the world, by
his evident sincerity, bis indomitable efforts
to achieve peace, and his very great ability. He,
probably more than anyone else, contributed
Vo Vhs reconciliation of victor and vanquished
and Vo the progress of international .peace.
The Locarno Treaty marked a substantiel
advance Vowards peace in that it practically
removed the greatest obstaale to the peace of
Europe by the definite restoration of AlsaceLorraine to France.
The Pact of Paris, 1928, was a very marked
peace aecomplishment and the rnost pronouneed stop in streng-tbenin the work of
peace; a decided improvement and advance
in the organization of peace. Whilst it declared national self-defence an inajieipable

preamble and section 2 of the Paris Pact,
but I feel there is no real necessity of reading
it, because it probably is familiar to aIl bionourable mnembers who are listening to me.

and Czecho-Slovakia, at Paris in tbe montb
of August, 1928, and it bas sine been accepted by forty-flve ot-her nations. IV bas

Thus was seoured Vhs active co-operation
of the United States for Vhs establishment and
preservation of peace. The definition of
aggressive wnr, as contained in the Paris Pact,
bas been aocepted by the United States as

well as eil the other signatories. The ooroilary
of this acceptance is that the United States
renounce their former attitude of beneivolent
neutrahity in ail aggresaive wars, and this
implies the obligation to co-operate in puttng
tbem down.
The signatordes to the Pact have outlawed
war as an instrument of national policy, but,
of course, not war of deifenice. The United
States, ilike every other nation, will noV and
cannot alienate the paramount riglit to defend itself. That right must ever be retained
by aIl states; 1 mean the righV of legitiinate
defence. The United States, it is truie, does
not agree in s0 many words to put down the
aggressor, as the signatories of the Covenant
have done; but it warns the aggressor that
it can no longer count on its frienidship -or
neutrality. IV is a fair interpretation of the
reaty tu say that any nation signatory to the
Paot which goes Vo war over any dispute with
any other nation, also a si.gnatory to the Pacît,
before submitting such dispute Vo arbitration,
or which, baving submnitted it to arbitration,

sections 8 Vo 14 of the Covenant and more
particularly of section 16, and eubject to the
moral sanction of sections 8 Vo 14 and the
positive sanction of section 16.
It -may be said that the United States, noV
being a meraher of the League, would noV be
bound by section 16, and not be obliged to
apply the sanction therein contained. That,
of eour-se, is correct. But we must not forget
that the United States is bound by the provisions -of the Paris Pact, wiiich bas solemnly
condemned the -recouarse Vo war for the solution of international tontroversies, and in
which the parties have renounced war as an
instrument of national pdlicy. We must remember the provisions of article 2. The
United States and other nations who have
signed the Paris Pact haeve a cominon solidartly; so that any violation of its provisions
would be a violation as mucb against the
United States as the other nations. As a
corollary, the duty Vo defend the Pact would
be a joint and several one. Dos it noV
f ollow that the United States would be bound
to apply the sanctions of the Pa.ct contained
in the first part of the section?

Article 4. The court shall render advisory

Article 5, setting forth procedure in the
matter of advisory opinions, is the kernel of
the agreement. It provides that "with a view
to ensuring that the court shaill not without the
consent of the United States entertain any
request for an advisory opinion touching any
dispute or question in which the United States
has or elaims an interest" the Secretary-General
shall inform the United States of any proposal
before the Council or Assembly for obtaining
an advisory opinion, and thereupon, if desired,
an exchange of views as to whether an interest
of the United States is affected shall proceed
"with alIl convenient speed" between the Council

On the 14th of January, 1030, 22 countries
had ratified the Optional Clause of the Permanent Court; 19 had signed it, but their
Governments had not yet accepted .it formally; and 19 were expected to sign.
Now I come to the treaties for the pacifie
settlement of disputes. These treaties provide, some for arbitration, some for conciliation or judicial setitlement. A large number
of these treaties, drawn in accordiance with
the model treaty approved by the League of
Nations, have been signed. During the last
year alone there were twelve treaties of
arbitration, eleven treaties of conciliation,
eleven treaties of arbitration, conciliation or
judicial settlement. Of these, thirty-three are
bilateral and one is multilateral. In 1928
there were fifteen, and in 1927 there were
eight. Twenty-five countries are parties. The
United States of America signed twenty
treaties; Finland five; Germany and Spain
four each; Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Yugoslavia, three each; Albania, Bulgària,
France, Italy, Netherlandb, Norway
and
Switzerland, two treaties each; Brazil, Denmark, Greece, Lithuania, Portugal, Roumania,
Siam, Sweden,, Turkey and Soviet Republic,
one treaty each.
Up to the 1st of January, 1930, there had
been registered with the League at Geneva
130 treaties for the pacifie settlement of international disputes. It is gratifying to notice
that the United States has signed by far the
greatest number of these treaties.
It will theref ore be seen that with the provisions of the Covenant of the League, articles

8 to 14, inclusive, and 16, the acceptance of the
Optional Clause, the Paris Pact, and the very
large number of treaties, bilateral and multi-

lateral, agreeing to the adjustment of international disputes by arbitration, conciliation
or judicial settlement, practically the whole
world is now definitely committed to the
policy of pacifie means exclusively for the
adjustment of all international quarrels. With
this magnificent advance towards a better and
more peaceful world civilization, it would seem
that the nations of the world ought to, and no
doubt will soon, feel that they have obtained
the measure of security which will ensure the
exercise of their national liberties free from
international violence.
There are still, however, two different
opinions with regard to the necessity of
further or more positive sanctions. I have
already stated that in my view the sanctions
already provided for are reasonably sufficient.

I need not repeat what I have said. But I
admit that specific sanctions may be necessary, as well as sanctions of a moral kind.

The value of moral engagements cannot, however, be doubted, because in the end it is
upon mutual faith and good-will between
nations that international peace essentially
rests.
It was with a view to devising additional
guarantees and sanctions that a committee of
the League of Nations was appointed for the
purpose of considering amendments to the
Covenant with the object of filling the gap to
which I have referred, and bringing the
Covenant of the League into harmony with
the Paris Pact. The committee was composed
of the following:
M. Antoniade (Roumania)
M. Von Bulow (Germany)
Viscount Cecil of Chelwood (Great Britain)
M. Cobian (Spain)
M. Cornejo (Peru)
M. Cot (France)
M. Ito (Japan)
M. Scialoja (Italy)
M. Sokal (Poland)
M. Unden (Sweden)
M. Woo Kaiseng (China)
M. Scialoja was elected Chairman.
This committee met at Geneva in March
last and submitted the following proposals of
amendment. I am going to read, as I think it
is worth my while doing so, articles 12, 13,
15-6 and 15-7 of the Covenant of the League,
and I am going to read afterwards the amendments which this committee has recommended
for adoption by the League. These amendments, I believe, have been the subject of
very serious consideration at the present meeting of the League of Nations at Geneva, but
I am not aware what the result has been. If
the honourable senator for De Lorimier (Hon.

SENATE

298

Mr. Dandurand) were present he would be
able to give us this important piece of news,
and that is one reason, among others, why
I exceedingly regret his absence.
Article 12, section 1, of the 'Covenant, with
its proposed amendment, reads:
The Members of the League agree that, if
there should arise between them any dispute
likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the
matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they
agree that they will in no case resort to war.
The words "that they will in no case resort
to war." constitute the amendment proposed
to the committee.
Article 13, section 4, reads:
The Members of the League agree that they
will carry out in full good faith any award or
decision that mnay be rendered.
Now follows the amendment:
In the event of any failure to carry out such
an award or decision, the Council shall propose
what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.
Article 15, section 6, provides:
If a report by the Council is unanimousiy
agreed to by the Members thereof other than
the Representatives of one or more of the
parties to the dispute, the Members of the
League agreo thatHere are the new words of the amendment:
-as against any party to the dispute that complies with the recommendations of the report
they will take no action which is inconsistent
with its terms.
Honourable members who are familiar with
the provisions of the Covenant will readily see
the tremendous import of these suggested
amendments. Then there is article 15, section
7:
If the Council fails to reach a report which is
unaninously agreed to by the Members thereof
ther than the Representatives of one or more
>f the parties to the dispute, the Members of
:he League reserve ta themselves the right to
take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justiceAnd it is proposed that the following words
oe added in amendment:
-other than a resort to war.
It will readily be seen how much more binding the Covenant will be if these proposed
amendments are accepted, as I have every
reason to believe they will be, by the League
of Nations.
Honourable members will observe that the
proposed amendments are in strict harmony
with the Pact of Paris. If and when they
are adopted war will have been definitely
outlawed, since sueh amendments will constitute a definite, absolute and unequivocal
reiunciation of war, for any cause whatever
other than self-defence.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

I can find no language adequate to express
the thankfulness which all nations must feel
at the early prospect of world peace. Some
honourable members of this House, and, no
doubt, many people throughout the world,
may not be disposed to share fully the optimism to which I have given expression. It may
be because the great tragedy is still too near
them; or public opinion is not sufficiently
awakened; or the conviction, so old, yet so
false, that war is inevitable, is not quite dead.
Apparently nothing will convince some that
the world will renounce the law of the jungle,
just as men and nations did many, many
centuries ago.
I have all my life entertained the happy
conviction that international peace was bound
to be established eventually, and in my humble
sphere I have never overlooked an opportunity to proclaim that belief. I hope honourable members will pardon me if I dare to
inake a personal reference and quote my own
words, in proof of this. I realize that it is
not usual nor quite proper for one to quote
his own language or speak about himself, but
I think the circumstances are sufficiently out
of the ordinary to justify my doing so in this
instance.
On the first day of the parliamentary session
of 1906, nearly a quarter of a century ago,
when I had the honour of occupying a seat
in another place, I moved an address for the
purpose of suggesting that an invitation be
sent by our Parliament to His Majesty Edward
VII and the Queen to visit Canada. This was
very shortly after the King, who had earned
the name of " the Peacemaker," had consummated the "Entente Cordiale," and when
world peace -was being generally and earnestly
advocated. In the course of my speech in
support of the motion, I said, among other
things, the folloving:
When Ris Majesty (Edward VII) ascended
the throne, who believed that the Entente Cordiale, such as it exists to-day, was probable or
even possible? And if to-day the French republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland and the Dominions are found allied
in such a close, such a cordial, such' a lasting
alliance, it is conceded that it is due mainly
to the wonderful tact, te the ever unerring judgment, to the genius, to the intense love of
humanity, and the earnest desire for peace of
His Majesty. Have we not good reason to hope
and to believe, Mr. Speaker, that His Majesty
is not content to rest on the laurels, however
great, which the world has so freely accorded
hlim, and that His Majesty will continue to
devote his genius and his all-powerful influence
in the cause of humanity until he has exerted
his last effort in the realization of that so long
and so ardently cherished hope of mankind for
peace and good will to all men? And, Sir, may
we not be permitted also to indulge in the hope

for him also the gratitude and admiration of
the world, would afford an opportunity and be
the means of rendering more intimate and more

between the American republic and our mother
country? Nay, may we not be permitted to
indulge the hope and belief that such a visit at
this time would be the means of enlarging the
scope of the Entente Cordiale se as to secure
the mighty co-operation of the United States of
America in the accomplishment of this great
aim and noble object? An alliance between
the republie of France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its possessions all over the world, the repuiblie of the
United States of America, and that empire
in the Far East whose national emblem so
typically and so truthfully symbolizes its recent
brilliant exploits and its marvelous progress.
-an alliance between the foremost nations of
Europe, the two greatest nations of America
and the only true great nation of Asia-an
alliance encircling the world, whose motto
would be universal peace with all that these
magie words imply for humanity-such an
alliance could and would probably accomplish
world peace.
The time must come, may we not think the
time has come, when the enlightened nations
of the world will put an end to military
armaments and will cease paying to the devils
of war the tribute of its best blood and of its
best money? There is everywhere a desire, a
demand for peace. Why, Sir, the very atmosphere is to-day filled with that fragrant air
of peace.
The King of England and the President of
the United States have devoted themselves to
the cause of peace, they are both thorough
believers in, and have constantly and with maintained success preached the gospel cf peace. May
we not to-day indulge in the hope that their
recent brilliant successes are but the augury
of generai peace in the very near future? Some
may think and some may say that this is but
a dream, though a very happy dream, but still
a dream and an illusion. My answer is that
sometimes dreams are followed by realization
and that what seems to-day ta be an illusion to
some may to-morrow be turned into a reality.
My answer is that but a very few years ago the
Entente Cordiale was nothing but a dream, today it is a living and vigorous reality.
I cannot refrain from expressing an opinion

which may seem somewhat egotistical and
vain. I believe that if more heed had been
paid to the invitation which the Parliament
of Canada extended to His Majesty and the

Queen, if old and obsolete traditions had not
stood in the way of the acceptance of that
invitation, the Great War which began eight
years after this invitation would not have
taken place. It is not at all inconceivable that
a visit of Their Majesties to Canada would

have been followed by a visit on their part ta

299

the United States of America, and that the
Entente Cordiale might then have been extended so as to include the United States and
Japan. Can there be any serious doubt that
upon such a combination the Kaiser and his
war lords would not have dared to precipitate
hostilities in 1914?
The Address was transmitted by the Secretary of State for Canada to the Colonial
Secretary at the time, but it is my opinion
that the invitation never came to the notice
of His Majesty. The official excuse for not
taking some action in the matter was that
according to tradition Ris Majesty could not
go outside the realm during his reign. But
we all know that he frequently visited Paris
and other parts of the European continent.
And now, honourable members, I come to
the Four Power Pacifie Pact, which is a
realization of my dream of a quarter century
ago. Great Britain, France, the United States
and Japan have formed an alliance to secure
the settlement by pacific means of all disputes concerning territories in the region of
the Pacific Ocean. I shall not read the names
of the plenipotentiaries who negotiated the
treaty, but I should like to quote sections 1
and 2 of the pact, which I think are of great
interest.
The High Contracting Parties agree as between themselves to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular
dominions in the region aif the Pacifie Ocean.
If there should develop between any of the
High Contracting Parties a controversy arising
out of any Pacifie question and involving their
said rights which is not satisfactorily settled by
'diplomacy and is likely to affect the harmonious

accord now happily subsisting between them,
they shall invite the other High Contracting
Parties to a joint conference to which the whole
subject will be referred for consideration and
adjustment.

I desire to emphasize the words, "consideration and adjustment."
If the said rights are threatened by the
aggressive action of any other Power, the High
Contracting Parties shall communicate with one
another fully and frankly in order to arrive at
an understanding as to the most efficient measures to be taken, jointly or separately, to meet
the exigencies of the particular situation.

In my estimation nothing more markedly
discloses the progress made by the United
States of America in the way of renunciation
of war and the disposition to resort to nothing
but pacifie means for the settlement of international disputes than the pact so entered into
by -the United States, Great Britain, France
and Japan as far back as 1921 and formally
completed in 1922. This international treaty
is remarkable as much for the few words in
which it is drawn as for the ambit of its provisions. It is a solemn, unqualified, definite

300

SENATE

and permanent renunciation of war in any
controversy between the parties, and an
assumption of the obligation to refer any such
controversy for consideration and adjustment
to a joint conference. It is, besides, a positive
agreement that if the rights of the parties to
it are threatened by any other party, the High
Contracting Parties shall fully and frankly
confer as to the most efficient means ta be
taken jointly or separa.tely to meet the
exigencies of each particular situation. The
territorial application of the treaty is confined
to the Pacifie. The making of this treaty
has confirmed the hope and belief that the
co-operation of the United States in the work
of establishing universal peace is assured,
regardless of whether that country ever becomes a full-fledged member of the League of
Nations or continues separately to strive for
peace in its own way.
Despite failures, hesitation and temporary
setbacks, the progress made towards universal
peace since the war has been constantly increasing. This has been due, in a very large
measure, to the growing conviction of governments and peoples that international co-operation, good-will, trust and confidence have
become absolutely necessary to the peace,
development and stability of civilization.
I desire to thank honourable members for
their kind and patient attention. If I have
taken undue advantage of their indulgence,
I am sorry. I hope that I have said some
things that were worth hearing.
Hon. E. MICHENER:
Honourable senators, the right honourable the junior member
for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster),
who began the debate on this subject, gave us
an informative review of the progress, particularly in the past year, of the League of
Nations. Now we have had the pleasure
of listening to another résumé of the League's
activities, given in a comprehensive manner
by the senior member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt).
I shall not detain honourable
members long, but I desire ta express a few
thoughts on the influences that have made
possible the successful functioning of the
League of Nations and have brought about
such a widespread sentiment for peace in a
marvelously brief period of time.
From the dawn of history war bas been
the final arbiter of disputes among peoples.
So tradition and history are on its side. Today, however, reason, justice and humanity
are striving to dethrone the god of war, and
are asserting the futility of brute force.
One thing that has helped to bring about
this change in public sentiment is the revulsion following the carnage and devastation
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

of the Great War. On Sunday last I witnessed
the annual Garrison Parade in the city of
Toronto, and as I stood for over an hourand watched 5,000 soldiers pass by-many of
them bearing the marks of war-I could not
but feel that the glory of war had departed.
More than 12,000,000 men were killed in the
late watr, and as many have died since their
return, or have been condemned to a living
death. An army composed of an equal number of men, if it marched day and night,
would take 100 days to pass a given point.
The world has been appalled, and the hopes
and ambitions of many have been crushed,
not only by the awful human toll of the
late war, but by the financial wreckage and
devastation that it wnought. The total wealth
of Canada to-day is estimated at about
twenty-five billions of dollars; the cost of the
late war, at a conservative estimate, was at
least two hundred and fifty billions, or ten
times the total wealth of the whole Dominion.
One cannot but feel how vastly better it
would have been to expend this huge sum
in peaceful and useful undertakings and for
the betterment of mankind.
A second influence on public sentiment has
been the progress of science. If reason, justice
and humanity do not outlaw war, science
necessarily will. The inventions of the past
fifty years, including the use of steam and
electricity, the telegraph and the telephone,
the aeroplane and other modes of transportation, have done much te bring about a better
understanding among peoples. The application
of scientific principles in industry has made
nations largely dependent upon one another.
Nations are learning that they can no more
hurt others without injuring thermselves than
one can destroy one's arm without impairing the
effectiveness of one's body as a whole. Nations
glory no longer in physical force and conquest,
but rather in the aim so nobly expressed by
the late President Wilson when he said: "I
believe the United States of America can
nnd no higher ideal than to b of service to
the other nations of the world." Nations have
found that the achievements of art and learning, science and industry, are far grander than
the achievements of war.
A third factor that bas brought about a
different state in the world to-day is what I
will term the evolution of progress-the law
of life. At the beginning of human history
disputes were always settled by physical force.
But as people became organized under orderly
forms of government, they had to refer their
disputes to courts of justice or to arbitration.
So to-day, as civilization has advanced and
culture progressed, nations find it to their

MAY 21, 1930
înterest to defer to the principles of reason,
justice and humanity and to decide their
,differences in accordance with such principles
rather than by the old method of physical
force.
These various influences have made it possible for the League of Nations to function
:as successfully as it has done, and have
brought about a sentiment ini the world today which is largely opposed to the arbitrament of war in the settlement of international
disputes. The League of Nations has been a
*great factor in focusing the world's thought
upon peace and progress, and the conventions
and treaties made have contributed to that
end.
It is marvelous to think of what lias been
accomplished during the twelve short years
.since the war. Before the war we had such
bodies as the Hague Tribunal, but their efforts
were largely diplomatie, not judicial. Since
the war we have had conferences and treaties
to bring about a better understanding among
the peoples of the world. First, we had the
Washington Treaty for the reduction of armaxnents; then we had the Locarno Pact, which
settled many differences among the nations
of Europe. Prdbably the most important of
ail is the Kellogg Pact, which was consummated
in the Treaty of Paris, by which 58 nations,
through their representatives, pledged themselves not to resort to war, but rather to outlaw it. It is incredible that any one of those
58 nations would 'be an aggressor, because, as
Ramsay MacDonald has pointed out, it would
fear the frowns of the other parties to the
treaty more than it would those of an enemy.
It is possible that a group of nations who
have signed the treaty may have a dispute
with another group of nations, but if those
signing the treaty live up to their signatures,
and to the principle of honour among nations,
the desired end will have been practically
accomplished.
The late Field Marshal Haig, in lis last
speech. said: "We have one more victory to
win-the victory of peace." In the twelve
short years since the war we have gone a long
way towards accomplishing that victory.
However long it may take, the peaceful
method of settiement will prevaiI.
Besides the organized efforts for peace there
are many other influences at work in the world
to-day. One of these influences is public
sentiment as expressed through the women
of the world. We know that the women,
especially the mothers, are for peace. Fraternal and other organizations, national and
international, are unanimously for peace.
The more cultured and civilized nations are
earnestly desirous of peace and have given

301

expression to their desire not only ini word,
but in thought and deed as well. True, some
nations have been so long in the habit of
thinking in ternis ol war that they still do
so. While talking of peace they prepare for
war. We usually get what we are loohing
for, and if a nation prepares for war that is
what it is likely to have. It was said that the
last was a war to end war; that another
great confliet miglit destroy civilization itself.
The more advanced nations are to-day doing
ail in their power to bring about such a condition that it will be almost impossible for any
country again to resort to war; and, more and
more, the other nations are following their
lead.
When referring to the conferences and meetings which have done so much to help the
cause of peace, I omitted Vo mention the London Conference. The outeome of that conference has been viewed differently by different
people. Undoubtedly progreas was made,
but one cannot help feeling that if France
and Italy lad thouglit less of the parity of
their navies and more of co-operation with
Britain, the United States, and Japan, their
security and honour would have been better
vindicated. Only as the nations of the world
trust one another and co-operate can permanent peace be secured.
AlI through the ages, even in the days of
the Romans, efforts have heen made towards
the establishiment of peace, but neyer before
lias the outlook for the attainment of permanent peace been better than it is to-day.
It is for ourselves Vo determine whether the
peace shahl be permanent, or whether the
world must go through an Armageddon worse
than the last, and such as it lias neyer yet
seen.
Peace is inevitable: it is the law of life,
of human evolution and progress. Just as the
intellectual and spiritual forces of if e are
greater than the physical forces, so is it certain that war will be outlawed and permanen-t
peace consummated. The prophets of old saw
the day when nations should war no morewhen the instruments of war should become
the instruments of peace and production. I
tbin we iniglit include am.ong the prophets
the honorurable Vhe senior memiber for Ottawa
(lion. N. A. Belcourt), who twenty-five years
ago had a vision of what is to-day a reality.
Poets and statesmen have done their part
in contributing Vo the thouglit that peaee is
inevitable and must prevail. You all remember the familiar words of Lord Tennyson:
Till Vhe war-drum throbb'd no longer,
And the battle-flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man,
The Federation of the world.

302

SENATE

I recall also the lines of the Indian poetess,
Pauline Johnson-whose monument is erected
in Stanley Park, overlooking the Pacificin which she expresses the same sentiment:
Sing thou that song of unison
That makes all nations one;
Nor pause till peace has come to birth,
And love enfolds the earth.
The late President Wilson coined a phrase
which will go down in history: "Is the world
safe for democracy?" To-day we might ask,
"Is democracy safe for the world?" In other
words, is democracy to be the master or the
victim of the civilization it has created? That
is the question in the great struggle going
on in the world to-day. But whether it be
in our day, or whether it be in days to come,
peace is inevitable; and the challenge to us
in our day and generation is to do our part
in developing public sentiment until, like a
swelling tide, it spreads over the world, and
the victory of peace is finally won.
Honourable
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
members, we have heard three very inspiring
speeches on this subject, and I will ask you
to bear with me for only a short time. First,
is to the right honourable the junior member
for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster).
[ know of no higher compliment that could
be paid him than to say that his effort was
worthy of him and his ability. I followed
with a great deal of interest the remarks of
the honourable the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belceourt). His address, it seemed
to me, was a careful, almost scientific, exposition of the instruments created by the
League of Nations to assure the future peace
of the world. The last speaker to whom wc
listened (Hon. Mr. Michener) made a most
optiimistic pronouncement.
I now ask you to leave for a while your
present environnent, so well suited to the
noble sentiments that have been expressed,
and to corne with me into the crowd and lend
an attentive car, that you may learn the reaction of the masses on this subject. After
all, the masses are to-day supreme. Let us
listen to what they say of the League of
Nations.
In what I am about to state, I do not wish
to be regarded as playing the part of the
devil's advocate. Such is not my intention.
Faith and trust are necessary. It is fear that
Our
menaces the world with armaments.
faith is often assailed. How often have we
heard it said, even by men of distinction,
that the League of Nations is but a pions
Utopia; that it is unnatural and will therefore
be rejected as Nature rejects a foreign body.
Hon. Mr. MICHENER.

Homo homini lupus-ian is wolf to man.
War has always been and always will be.
Human nature, morally, is a strange mixture, always complex and difficult to fathom.
Socrates, in order to demonstrate the endless
strife between the good and the bad instincts
of man, compares him to the driver of two
horses, one of which is beautiful, well formed,
courageous, reliable and possesseid of good impulses, while the other is ugly, thick-set,
vicious and manageable only by the lash.
Often it happens that the vicious horse,
thougi for a time held under control, at last
drags its mate and the driver te the abyss.
The famous police strike in London provided an instance of mans bad impulses,
when, as night fell, armies of hoodlums
seemed to spring up from the very pavements.
The world war strikingly revealed the innate
cruelty of man. But civilization has been
nursed through most of its ills and troubles,
and assisted in its onward march, by charity.
To deny the existence of charity would be
to deny Christianity, for we cannot conceive
of the one without the other.
But if man is morally complex and obscure,
he is mentally limpid and radiant. It was
man's intelligence that organized his national
laws, which are a vast improvement on internecine strife and the vendetta. It was a
desire to promote his own happiness rather
than that of his brother-man that gave rise
to the rules of law that are found in all
civilized nations. Why should we doubt that
human wisdom is equally able to organize
man's international affairs? Will it not also
be to his advantage to make international
laws?
The methods of warfare have changed. No
longer are there professional armies and closed
seasons for battles. The custorm of the days
of Louis XIV, when soldiers folded their tents
in the autumn and returned to fight in the
spring, has gone by the board. War now
may be waged in all seasons; it is ubiquitous
and omnivorous; it consumes every living
being and blights the most hidden and most
sacred things. War and civilization are incompatible; one or the other must go.
If honourable members will permit me I
shall quote, on this point, a few opinions of
statesmen and other authorities. Lord Grey
of Falloden said in November, 1917:
If war is felt even in Germany to be hateful;
if as a result of this war men of al nations
will desire in future to stamp out the first sign
of war as tbey would a forest fire or the plague,
then the world may have a peace and security
that it has never yet known. If that is not the
result, then the lot of mankind in this epoch
of its history will be more desperate than in the
darkest and most cruel ages, for civilized
nations will prepare and perfect the destructive

303

MAY 21, 1930
inventions of science, a.nd these will be ueed to
the point of mutual extermination. Militarism
and civilization are now incompatible, and
nations must attain some greater measure of
international self-control than hms previously
heen thought possible, if civilization is to
progress or even to be preserved.
Another great statesman, M. Leon Bourgeois, who before hie dcparted from this life
earned the respect and affection of ail whn
are dcvoted to the cause of international
peace, said in June, 1910:
Another reason makes it impossible for us to
face a renewal of snob. a war. It is the great
progress and the great future progress of
science, which contrary to its objeet, which is
ail for the benefit of mankind, will be used as
it bas been usEed, if we do not find somne wsy
out of the difficulty, for purposes of wholesale
destruction.
A short time before hie rclinquished the
office of Secretary of State of the Unitcd
Sta tes, Mr. Kellogg declared:
It is flot necessary to dwell upon the appalling results of the last war, but with the dis-

coveries of science and the improvements of the
means of destruction on sea a.nd land, nobody
can look upon another war without shuddcriog
at its inevitable result.
Now, if honourable members permit, 1
shahl quote opinions of scientists and soldiers.
The next war, if any. will be a chemîical war.
General Amos A. Frics, General-in-Chief of
the American Chemical Warfarc Section, is
quoted as follows in the March, 1929, number
of "International Conciliation," published by
the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace:
General Fries considers the poison gases which
the ceemical officer had at bis comimand during
the last wvar a child's game eompared to what
tbey will be in tbe future. At the beginning of
the war, 30 aspbyxiating gases were known, today tbere are more than 1,000.
In the saine number of " International
Conciliation " a partial list of these gases is
given. I do not desire to read the list, but
with the permission of the Hanse I should like
to place it upon Hansard.

Commander A. E. Mon tgomery, who led the

said in answer to the samne question laVer in the

a war in any other part of the world. Recognition of this feet lias brouglit about a
reversal of the traditional. policy of the United
States. Josephi Chamberlain, in the June,
1929, number of "International Conciliation"
illustretes this strikingly at page 260:
Jefferson, in 1793, believed that the great wer
between France and the coalition Ieaded by
Englýand was a happening "in foreign and
dista nt ounitries in which we have no conceriu,"
and Mr. Adams, l'a 181,8, wrote that: "By the
usual principles of international lew, the state
of neutrality recognizes the cause of both
parties to the contest as just; that is, it avoids
ail consideration of the merits of the contest."
It was under these conceptions that the doctrine
of neutrality was developed. War to Jefferson

305

and to Adams was an aif air of the countries
involved alone and a war in Europe an affair of
a far-distant country. The Uniterd States had
no interest in preventing it and no riglit to
question, the motives of either belligerent.
Contrast this with the opinion of ex-President Coolidge, uttered a few inonths before hie
took leave of the White House:
An ant of war in any part of the world is an
act that injures the interests of my country.
In his inaugural address, President Hoover
expressed a similar thouglit, which illustrates
the tremendous change that hýas been brought
about in the minds of American statesmen.
He said:
The United States f ully accepte the profound
truth that our own progress, prosperity and
peace are interloceked with the progress, prosperity and peace of ail humanity.
The necessary conclusion fromn these quotations must be that no one to-day is out of
reacli of war; no one, whether man, woman or
child-no country, however large-no continent, however remote. War to-day is really
omnivorous and ubiquitous.
If man in his national and home life thought
wise to substitute t.he rule of law for that of
violence, has hie less to gain in his international life by the selection of justice in lieu of
war, the agony and ruthless destruction of
which lie cannot escape? But war lias always

life, the right to property, the right to freedom, even-handed justice, and the peaceful
pursuit of happiness and contentment. That
proclamation long lay dormant on the dusty
shelves of libraries; but one day the sufferings of two great nations under a ruthless
despotismn suddenly gave life to these principles, and they became the very soul and substance of the constitutions of the two greatest
republics in the world, France and the United
States.
For more than thirty years the Interparliamentary Union has preached the doctrine
of the rights of nations. As the citizen within
his country, so the nation within the universe
às entitled to life, security, peace, even-handed
justice and the pursuit of happiness. The
sufferings of the Great War have given to
these slumbering principles an authority which
has already dominated two-thirds of the world.
The Interparliamentary Union advocated
consultation, conciliation, arbitration and the
judicial settlement of quarrels among nations.
To apply these principles in practice, it conceived the idea of the League of Nations
and the World Court. We possess both of
those .organizations to-day, and both of them
within the last decade have rendered inestimable services.
Now, with your permission, honourable
members, I shall not recall the League's progress-for that has been eloquently demonstrated-but shall briefly refer to some of
its trials. If ever anyone had reason to
doubt the vitality of the League, it was at
its inception. It then counted on the confidence and loyalty of but a few superstatesmen.
Honourable members will remember those
days in 1923 when France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr in face of the opposition of
Great Britain. At that time Poincaré and
Lloyd George were openly, almost aggressively,
opposed to one another. Would this difference of opinion between the two greatest
powers within the League threaten seriously
its existence? It did not, and the League
lived.
May I recall the incident of Corfu in 1925,
when Mussolini took possession of Corfu and
defied the League.
Three Italian commissioners, while on an international mission, the
object of which was to determine the boundary
between Greece and Bulgaria, were murdered
in Grecian territory. Italy's representative,
Mr. Salandra, refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the Council of the League, which
was determinedly upheld by Sir Robert Cecil,
in the name of Great Britain. Italy claimed
her right to seize the territory of an aggressor
Hon,

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

country and to compel the payment of due
reparation. The conflict was settled by a
conference of ambassadors, and Corfu was relinquished one month after its capture by the
Italian navy. The incident was a serious one,
and the situation pregnant with ominous consequences. What happened? Did Italy withdraw from the League? No. Two years later,
in the Greco-Bulgarian conflhet, Italy, represented by Mr. Scialoja, upheld the jurisdiction
of the Council under similar circumstances to
those of Corfu.
The attitude of the United States towards
the League was certainly the greatest obstacle
in the path of its progress. From the first,
they were cold, distant and guarded in the
extreme, as if the League had been their child
of error. The communications of the Secretary General of the League were net even
acknowledged. In time, however, the rigidity
of these relations was relaxed. The United
States, ostensibly remaining outside of the
League, have become a sympathetic and serviceable neighbour, willing and capable of helping in a large way in any meritorious endeavour for peace. In initiating, with France,
the Pact of Paris, in entering the World
Court, and in taking the leading part in the
settlement of war debts, they have contributed very largely to the League's ultimate
purpose and, therefore, to the League's stability and prestige.
A recent incident shows clearly how appreciably their attitude bas been altered for the
better. The Council of the League was suddenly notified that Bolivia and Paraguay were
on the verge of war; Bolivia had ordered
inobilization; there was no time to lose. Both
countries were members of the League, and
both had signed the Pact of Paris. Clearly
it was the urgent duty of the Council to intervene. But how would the United States look
upon such intervention? Would it be regarded as a violation of the Munroe doctrine?
If this danger created apprebension, it caused
no hesitation in the Council's action. Mr.
Briand, the world's greatest living apostle of
international peace, as President of the Council, forthwith communicated by telephone with
the Bolivian authorities, at 5,000 miles' distance, and remninded thim oi ileir obligation
to refrain fram war. Tlie warning was both
timely and fruitful. But how was it regarded
at Washington? It was accepted in the spirit
in which it was given-as a move made solely
in the interest of world peace. The BoliviaParaguay clash was finally settled through the
intervention of the Pan-American Union; but
the League had helped to smother the first

MAY 21, 1930
outburst dlf a conflagration and had conflrmed
ifs jurisdicfion over the new world, in thec
intercsts of peace, good-will and amity.
The League's tenth birthday fell on the
lOth of January last. The Young plan lias
just taken effeet; the post-war pcriod has
terminafed, and at last fthe League is free to
turn a hand to the problems of peace. If
anyone were seeking an opinion as to the
menit of the accomplishments of the League
during the past decade, and its ability to
pursue its mission in the future, I would refer
himi to the following testimony of two great
international minds. Mr. Elihu Root said:
For these years, the League, in the polifical
field, and the Court, in the ludicial field, have
been renclering the bcst service in the cauise of
peace, known ta the history of civilization, incompaiably the beet.
General Smuts stated:
Mankind bas, as if were, af one bound and
in the short space of ten years, jumped frorn
the old order ta the new across a guif which
may yet prove to be the greatest divide in
human hisfory. What bas been donc cari neyer
lie undone. One epoch closes in the history of
the world and another opens.
I fear that I have spoken at too greaf
length; so I will close by recalling an incident
which greatly impressed me when travelling
fhrough Bohemia. My attention was drawn to
a graceful monument erected to the Virgin
in the l7th century. Upon ifs pedestal it bore
this inscription:
A peste, f amine et hello, lihera nos, 0 Virgine.
0 Virgin, free us from pestilence, famine and
war.
Where is the pestilence of old, that mosf
calamif nus of all visitations, that well nigh
depopulated Athens; that in fthc l4th century
swcpt away 25 million people in Europe and 23
million in Asia; that in 1832 afflicted our own
counfry? Thanks to the genius of man, and
lis willingness to co-operate against a common
danger, it lias been pracfically sfampcd ouf
of the civîlized world. The effcctivcness of
thaf co-operation is now greafly increascd by
the erection, througli ftle efforts of fhe League,
of the Epidemiological Bureau of Singapore,
whicli to-day reccives telegraphie information
in respect to cliolera, plague, etc. from 143
ports, and widely spreads information by radio

PORTRAIT OF THE LATE SENATOR
BOSTOCK
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
tenators, before commencing the business of
the day, I wish to make a brief announcement. A portrait of our late lamented and
much loved Speaker, Hon. Hewitt Bostock,
has been to-day hung in the foyer of the
Senate, and I have arranged with the two
leaders in the House to have the Senate adjourn for a few minutes so that we may proceed to unveil this portrait. We shall not
have any very formal ceremony, but I feel
that it is due to a senator who bas held the
very high position of Speaker for so many
years that this portrait should not merely be
hung and left there, and I am certain that all
the senators will be glad to join in paying
this last tribute of respect to the late Hon.
Hewitt Bostock.
I would ask, therefore, that a motion be
made to adjourn the Senate during pleasure.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The honourable members of the Senate, pre-

reded by the Honourable the Speaker, assembled in the foyer in front of the Senate
Chamber.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I have had the
honour, honourable senators, to request your
presence this afternoon for the purpose of
marking the official participation of the
Senate in the unveiling of this portrait of the
late Hon. Hewitt Bostock. I can add nothing
to what has been said already by the two
Hon. Mr. BELAND.

leaders, and their colleagues, in the Senate
Chamber. I will simply ask the acting leader
of the House, Hon. Senator Belcourt, to unveil the portrait.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Your Honour,
honourable members of the Senate, I feel
very highly honoured and greatly gratified
that the function of unveiling the portrait of
our late lamented Speaker has been assigned
to me, since it affords me the opportunity of
reiterating the expression of the deep and sympathetic regret felt at the death of our late
Speaker, throughout Canada and by bis colleagues in the Senate, and more especially by
those whose good fortune it was to enjoy the
intimate friendship of the Hon. Mr. Bostock.
For nearly thirty-five years he provided the
example of a parliamentary career marked at
all times by great devotion, constant loyalty
to duty and uniform courtesy. He has left
behind him a record of public service which
we can all admire, a record which all of us
would like to emulate. He displayed to the
very end of his life a marked submission to
duty, which was manifest in many ways. It
is now known that for many months before
bis death our late Speaker felt that his health
was failing, and that some months ago he
asked the Prime Minister to relieve him of his
duties because they had become almost too
great a burden. When told that bis resignation at that time would be inconvenient and
embarrassing, he went on bravely and courageously doing his duty until death called him
away.
Even if tradition and custom did not
demand it, I think that on bis own merits
it is eminently fitting and proper that bis
portrait should adorn the halls of Parliament. I have, therefore, great pleasure in
complying with the request of Your Honour
to unveil the portrait of the late Mr. Bostock.
The portrait was unveiled.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In asking the
leader of the Opposition to join with the
leader of the Government in a few words, I
wish to say, what I should have said before,
that the place where the portrait is hung was
chosen by the late Speaker of the Senate
before he returned home this spring.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
members, I am sure that every member of the
Senate attends with pleasure the unveiling of
the portrait of our lately deceased Speaker.
We were deeply grieved by bis unexpected
and untimely death. I do not think that any
Speaker of the Senate ever discharged bis
functions more acceptably than did our deceased friend.

309

MAY 22, 1930
It is fitting that an ex-Speaker of the Bouse
of Commons, the pr.esent acting leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), should performi the ceremony of unveiling this portrait. If you look at the row of
portraits of distinguished gentlemen which
adorn the corridors of this building you will
find that they date from the days of Sir Alan
MacNab, who, was, I think, the first Speaker.
Those gentlemen did nlot all enjoy careers of
case and unalloyed pleasure while occupying
office. Times were often more stormy than
they have been during the occupancy of the
Chair by the late Senator Bostock. During
lis tenure of offiýce his time has been a time
of pleasantness-our paths have been patbs of
peace. He was as helpful to the leader of the
Opposition as to the leader of the Government, being always ready to suggest anything
that would facilitate the business of the
Senate. It was known to me, indeed it was
obvions to us all, that in bis high position lie
forgot all polities. Be was a well informed
student of everytbing pertaining to the traditions of our Bouse or the carrying on of our
public duties. On many occasions, unsolicited
by me, hoe bas been kind enougli to give me
a word of aid, whicb was always appreciated.
1 arn sure that no future occupant of tbe
office will fill it with greater bonour to bimself and to the position than dild our late
lamented friend.
The Bon. the Speaker and the bonourabl.b
members returned to the Senate Chamber.
The sitting of tbe Senate was resumed.
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: I beg to move that
the proceedings w.hich bave just taken place,
at the unveiling of the portrait of our late
lamented Speaker, be recorded in the minutes
for to-day.
Bon. Mr. WILLOUGBBY: I have pleasure
in seconding the motion.
The motion was agreed to.

Bill and beg leave to report the saine with
certain amendments.
The report was concurred in.
Bon. Mr. BLACK inoveti the third reading
of the Bill.
Riglit Bon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Bonourable senators, in se far as this Bill is
concerned, I am a little late in making a
suggestion, but Wliat I bave to say may be
taken into consideration in the future. When
the ohairman of a eommittee brings in a
report on a Bill lie informs the Bouse whether
it is proposed to ýaccept the Bill with or without amendment, and the Clerk reads the nuirnber of the clauses and the words that it is
proposed to add or delete. Some of us, not
being members of the committee that lias
considered the Bill, have to rely entirely on
information given in this Chamber. In the
absence of sueb information we are unable
to formi any idea as to wbether tbe proiposed
changes are proper or not. I would suggest
that when the chairman of a committee brings
in a report lie sbould give the B-ouse a brief
summary of the changes tbat the committee
proposes. That would be an easy thing to
do, and would not take mueh time. As I
have intimated, I am not raising the point
with regard to this Bill in particular, but I
tbink it would be well in the future to follow
the plan that I bave suggested.
Right Bon. Mr. GRAHAM: Bear, hear.

310

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My right honourable friend is quite right in saying that some
honourable senators are not members of all
committees, but may I remind him that every
senator has the right to attend these committees, to take part in the discussion, and to
propose any amendment that he desires. He
has not the right to vote, but that is the
only difference between him and a member
of a committee. As to the other suggestion
made by my right honourable frientd, I entirely agree with him, but I would point out
that it is the practice of chairmen of conmittees when reporting Bills to the House to
give an explanation of any amendments made
in committee. It is quite open to any member to ask the chairmen of committees to
explain amendments. Some chairmen do so
without being asked. It is clear that the
chairman must give an explanation if he is
requested to do so.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It is quite true that it is the privilege of
any honourable member to attend the meetings of any Senate committee, but it is not
the practice to do so, nor is it feasible.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable members,
in response to the suggestion of the right
honourable the junior memiber for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), I shall
briefly explain the proposed amendment to
this Bill. The object of the amendment is to
bring the corporation into line with similar
companies whose Bills of incorporation have
been dealt with by the Banking and Commerce Committee of the Senate. We have
made certain eliminations in order that the
new company may be kept uniform with
others of a like character.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That makes it quite clear.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If honourable senators
will permit me, I should like to add that last
session two or three smilar Bills were considered by the Banking and Commerce Committee and referred to a subcomrnmittee. The
subcommittee, and afterwards the committee
itself, after litaring a numuber of parties on the
subject and giving a great deal of consideration to it, decided what powers should be
given to corporations of this kind. It was
deemed advisable-and I think properly sethat the decision arrived at last year should
be followed this year. The. purpose of the
amendments made to the Bill now before the
House is to bring it into harmony with similar
legislation passed last year.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To standardize
it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 139, an Act to incorporate
the Hamilton Life Insurance Company, with
one amendment.

He said: Honourable members, life insurance companies incorporated by Parliament in
the past have had their capital stock divided
into shares of the par value of $100 eaci, but
it will be observed that section 3 of this Bill
provides for the issue of the capital stock
of the proposed company on the basis of $25
par value. The anendment is to change section 3 so that the capital stock may be issued
on the basis of $100. It was thought desirable
to have uniform legislation in this connection.
The report was concurred in.

OF COMMITTEE-THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE presented the report of

He said: Honourable senators, some time
ago a sirmilar Bill was reported to this House
with an amendment intended for the protection of people who may have acquired rights
after an application for a patent has becorne
forfeited. That provision was prepared with
a great deal of care, and at the time I suggested that in future it should be incorporated
in all Bills of this kind. The amendment to
this Bill is similar to the one adopted in connection with the previous Bill to whieh I have
referred.
The report was concurred in.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE moved the third reading

le said: Honourable inembers of the
Sen-ate, it is not any inten'tion at ths stage
to offer any extended remarks about this
Bill. I believe that every member of the
Senate has read the Bili, and that severai of
tbem have had an opportunity of following
the proceedings of the committee of the House
of Commons that -deait wjth it. I realize that
this is a mensure to which a great deal of
time and serious consideration should be
given, and for that reason I arn agreeable '.o
the Bill being referred to a special coinmittee.
Honourable senators will recala that we appointed a committee of sixteen members to
attend the meetings of the House of Gommons
committee and wvatch the progress of the Bill.
Our committee was composed, of the f ollowing memnbers: Hon. Messieurs Belcourt, Black-,
Béland, Blondin. Buchanan, Gillis, Graham,
Griesbach, Hatfield, Laird, Lewis, Macdonell,

I bave agree.d with my honourabie friend

The namnes that I propose are: Hon. Messieurs

That lie will idraw the attention of thre Senate
to, the pro1resý and pireeent position cd the
League of Nations Society and the participation and standing of Canada therein.
Ho)n. H. S. BELAND: Honourabie rnembers, I feel that I Ahouad crave the indulgence
of the House in view of the fact that this
subject cornes under consideration in this
ChatoSer for the third time. I arn per-fect-ly
aware that I arn unaible to carry on the
debate on the lervei mainitined on previous
occasions, and my remarks, made at random,
will be iimited to a very short space of
time.
I think that I sbould express to the right
honourable member for Ottawa our gratitude
for bringing to our attention in suceh a brilliant
manner -the activities andi achievements of

the League of Nations.

There are f ew in

Canada who can claim to, have as extensive
a knowledge of the subject as is possessed
by my right honourabie friend. That knowledge was acoquired in part through actual

eNperience and personal contact in Paris in
1918 and 1919, and, later in Geneva, where

bie was the delegate of Canada; and it is
due also to an exhaustive study of al
the documents pertaining to the creation and
development of that great international
agency. With the possible exception of our
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. D.andurand), I
doubt that there is anyone in Canada who
bas been more zeaious and untiring in lis
efforts to crystallize in the minds of the
people the institution known as the League
of Nations.
I have mentionesi our leader (Hon. Mr.
Da.ndura-rd), who is now absent, but, as we
heard yesteaiday, is returning to this country
and «nay aririve in time to speak on Vhs
important subject before prorogation. That
honourabie gentleman bas played an important part in the de.iberations of the League
t>f Nations. Before the League was instituted
tbie na-me of Canada was weil known throughout the worid, but since 1919 Canada lias
1
ucquired a fame whicba is enviablep, and it 15
tnot out of place, 'I tbink, to say that the
honourable gentleman from DeLorimier (Hon.
,Mr. Dandurand), in the first place as President
of the Assembiy, and later as a member of
,the Council, lias contributed .argely towards
that condition.
May I say to my riglit honourabae friend
(Riglit Hon. Sir George E. Foster) that in
House and eisewbere
in this
speaking
tbroughout Canada bis voice lias not been a
voice crying in the wilderness. We can now
per-ceive a stea.dily growing interest in the
League of Nations. Whilst it may be a liglit
undertaking ýte arouse public interest in the
cause of pence when war is rnging, it is a mnuch

312

SENATE

more difficult task to create such an interest
when peace is reigning. To most of the people
war means danger, mediate or immediate,
whereas peace means relative security. There
exists in the minds of the people a latent
desire for peaice. Peace means happiness and
a large measure of sunshine in the home; it
means health, and, to a 'certain degree, the
preservation of economic wealth. Travel as
mueh as you !like; visit the countries of
Europe and America; penetrate, if you have
the time, the ranks of the people; enter the
'home of the peasant, sthe bourgeois, or the
'millionaire, and ask the question of whomever
'you meet: "Are you in favour of peace?"
The response will be immediate: war will be
'described as a, curse, and peace as a blessing.
Someone has expressed a doubt as to whether any man in whose soul there is an intense
love of peace can possess at the same time
those qua-lities which go to make a great
military leader. T'hroughout the pages of
history we find the names of general.s and
other great warriors who were animated not
by peaceful sentiment, but by the desire for
personal glory and aggrandizement and the
spirit of domination. The World War has
shown, however, that many of our best generals were distinguished for the double quality
of possessing great military genius and at the
same time a strong desire for peace. I know
of no better example of such a man than the
great Marshal Foch. Let us carry our minds
back for a moment to 1918, when the representatives of Germany visite.d the car of
the great commander of the A'llied Forces.
The conditions of the Peace were there and
then enumerated by the Marshal. At that
time great pressure was being brought to
bear upon the French Government and upon
the commander of the Allied Forces that
they -hoiuld pay no attention whatever to
the proposals, or requests, or prayers of the
Gormans. It was contendcd that MarshaI
Foch should advance immediately with his
victorious armies, drive before him the fieeing
Germaun regiments, penetrate into Germany,
and stop only when he reaehed the capital of
the German Empire. What was the attitude
on tihat occasion of the great Marshal? He
resolved that not a single drop of blood was
to be shed for any other purpose than the
establishment of permanent peace. He refused to yield to the pressure, which was, I
think, far from humanitarian.
Though we in Canada look upon war as a
curse, and peace as a blessing; though we
are aware that war is a calamity, perhaps the
greatest that can be inflicted upon mankind,
or upon the nations engaging in it, there exists
on the part of the population a certain inHon. Mr. BELAND.

difference towards the noble aims of the League
of Nations. What is the reason? It may be
that, unlike the nations of Western Europe,
we have been spared the immediate horrors of
war. It may lie in the fact that our territory
has been free from the heel of the invader
and we have been spared the sight of our
countryside, our villages, towns and cities
being ransacked, pillaged and plundered, and
the spectacle of entire populations moving as
refugees along the highroads in caravans such
as I have witnessed, of which we see some
representations on the walls of this Chamber.
This may be the cause of the indifference in
Canada, which, let us hope, is more apparent
than real. The presence of the enemy in
one's town or city is not merely disagreeable;
of'ten the enemy becomes insolent and abusive.
A debate such as this, which was initiated
some weeks ago by my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), has a
tendency to reinforce public opinion in favour
of the pacifie settlement of international
disputes. At this point I should like to make
a few observations on the subject of public
opinion. Whatever we may desire te do with
a view to the betterment of our own community or country or other countries, it is
difficult to make any real headway until we
have publie opinion on our side. I will go so
far as to say that when we have public opinion
with us we may undertake almost anything and
carry it through to a successful conclusion.
But what is publie opinion and how may it
be created? It is, I think, the common sense,
the common opinion of the people as a whole,
the universal conscience in a community or a
country or the world at large. There are many
means by which public opinion may be produced, but I desire to stress two. When we
think of production generally, we say that it
comprises four elements, namely, labour,
capital, ability and nature; but the elements
in the production of publie opinion are many,
varying in importance and in degree of
efficiency. The two means which I wish to
emphasize are the press and the schools.
There is no doubt in my mind that the
press is the most powerful agency for the
creation of public opinion. The newspaper of
to-day is not, as it was perhaps no longer than
a quarter of a century ago, an occasional or
accidental visiter in the home. The modern
daily-and to a lesser extent the weeklynewspaper penetrates into almost every home.
There it is read by the head of the family and
by his companion and children, and commented upon around the family table. That is
donc in the homes of the pensant, of the artisan
and the mechanie, of the bourgeois and of

MAY 22, 1930
those who are more favoured from a social or
economic point of view. When immediate and
concerted action is necessary, as in a crisis like
that wbicb developed in 1914, the power of the
press is more readiiy apparent; and it is aiso,
in my opinion, an extremeiy efficient agency
for the preparation of public opinion as we
should like to have it, say, twenty-five years
hence.
It is more particularly in the work of
creating the sentiment that shaîl exist in the
next generation that the sehool plays a highly
important part. Fresh from his or her
motber's devoted care and the tender relations of family life, the cbild enters school
unaware of the dissensions, rivaîries and
jealousies that exist in the world. The soul
of a child may be compared to soft wax wbich
is ready to be moulded by the artist. In this
respect I think the noble career of the teacher
may be aptly compared with that of the artist.
The pulpit also piays an important part in
the creation of public opinion. Every Sunday
ministers of different creeds deliver messages
that are calculated to inspire, to cheer and
assist their congregations. One might mention
books, lectures, radio broadcasting, theatre
and Parliament as other means entering into
tbe production of public opinion.
I think that if on the subjeot under debate
the people who control the forces to which I
have referred could get as close to unanimity
as I feel we hava done in this Chamber, we
might rest assured that within a comparatively
few years the united will of the peoples of
the various nations would resuit in the settiement of ail difficulties as between nations
by arbîtration and other peaceful means.
But there are great difficuities in the way of
creating uniited public opinion in any one
country.
May I just make my point clear by referring to an incident that took place when the
Young Committee sat in Paris for the review
of tbe reparations settiement. The representatives of Germany had come to the point
where they were aimost ready to accept
unanimously the proposai that had been drawn
up by Mr. Young and his associates, when
suddenly one of the German delegates, Dr.
Vogler, because he bonestly differed witb bis
colleagues, decided to withdraw from the
conference. He went home convinced that
though the newiy suggested conditions were
more favourable than the previous ones had
been, tbey could not be accepted by his
country. In other words, he was influenced
by the publie opinion of his own nation.
More recent instances of this same condition were given at the naval parley in London.
Some newspapers and prominent people have

313

criticized ItalY and France for the stand
taken by their representatives at the conference. But do we know wbat the public
opinion of their respective countries was?
The individual representatives may have
thought that the proposais to which they
would not yield were really in the best interests
of their countries, but they were influenced
in their stand by what they surmised their
own people desired tbem to do. Who can
tell what the future has in store? It may be
-that within a year or two there will be a
change in the attitude of those nations and
they will be ready to accept proposais that
will meet with the favour of the rest of the
world.
We must recognize that there are other
factors, such as chauvinisma and intolerance,
whic h present obstacles to the moulding
of public opinion. Chauvinism is nothing
but the exaggeration of a noble sentiment,
the love of country-commroniy called patriotism. Go one degree farther and you have intoleranca. We may pro-test against these
tbings, but tbey exist and we cannot do away
with them; at least not in the prasent state
of society. Then there is a point of view
wbich 1 find it difficuit to describe: it is the
result of a sentiment whicb abides in the
bosoms of men who are neyer satisfied with
anything, who are naturally pessimistic, whose
minds are rancid and sour, who are ready
to hoist the flag of danger whenevar it is
proposed to change a condition that has
existed for some time. In a word, they are
men wbo thrive on alarm and starve on
serenity.
I mention these things to illustrate the
difficulties that are encountered by those who
strive to turn the public opinion of any country in any one direction. Wben we ponder
over these tbings we can form some idea, of the
difficultiee that face those wbo meet at
Geneva as representatives of fifty nations.
The work of the League of Nations in reconciling diversified racial, economic and political
interests is a work that should command our
admiration.
The birtb of the League of Nations was
laborious and for .many years its growth was
uncertain. It must be concedeld that the
situation in 1918 and 1949 was full of pitfails. At that time it was impossible for
Germany to beicome a member of the League:
public opinion in the Allied countries would
not have tolerated that, for the passions
aroused by four years of war were still alive.
It has often been remarked that human pas..
sions may ba compared to the waves of the
ocean. Once the sea, bas been driven into fury

314

SENATE

by the winds, the waves which have been set
in motion continue to roll when the winds
have ceased to blow and the sky is once more
peaceful. In like manner, it will be a long
time before the peace that was proclaimed at
Paris is reflected in the souls of men in all
countries.
The reparations presented an enormous
difficulty to the League. It was not possible
for the Allied nations to demand from Germany less than they did: had their representatives attempted to do so they would
have been condemned by the public opinion
in their own countries. The delegates from
the five great powers and other Allied nations
were wise men. They knew that time was
the greatest healer of human passions. They
also foresaw another factor, to which it is painful for me to :efer, the tremendous extent to
which the war crippled most of the countries
that parteipated in it, and especially in
Europe. Take France as an instance. She
was amongst the victors; she was one of those
who shared in the triumph of the Allies. To
form some idea of the disastrous effect of the
war upon France, one need only visit the
north-east side of Verdun, where not long ago
an ossuary was dedicated to men who had
died in a sector of two, three or four square
miles. How many men feill in that comparatively smajll area there? It seems incredible, but no fewer than 400,000 soldiers
made the supreme sacrifice in that little sector of Verdun. A few minutes ago we heard
pealing from the central tower of this building notes of sorrow and sympathy for the
sudden passing of two men who died in this
city while in the performance of their duty.
It was a deserving tribute also of respect and
admiration, in which we ail participated. But
consider what happened in that small area
of Verdun, where 400,000 men gave up their
lives in similar devotion to duty.
The history of the past hundred years bas
been such, it seems, as to encourage men who
are actuated by sentiments of domination and
aggrandizement. For just a few minutes I
shall review some of the wars that have taken
place during that time, in order to show that
in almost every instance the victorious party
derived some profit from engaging in war.
Leaving the Crimean war, I will pass to the
Danish-Prussian war of 1864. Poor little Denmark was subjected to attack by Prussia. The
war lasted but a short time, and Prussia gained
Schleswig-Holstein as ber booty. Next came
the war of 1866, between Austria on the one
hand and Italy and Prussia on the other.
That war rid the German States of the domination of Austria. Italy, which had previHon. Mr. BELAND.

ously acquired Lombardy, annexed Venetia.
By the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 Germany
acquired two French provinces, and her representatives went home with five billions of
francs. At the end of the Spanish-American
war of 1898, the United States had acquired
the Philippine Islands and Porto Rico, and
Cuba had been wrested from Spain and placed
under the protectorate of the United States. I
may mention, in passing, the wars between
Japan and China in 1894, and Japan and
Russia in 1904. The net result of the South
African war-I am not discussing the causes
of it nor the way in which it was carried onwas that certain important provinces which
before that time had been independent passed
under British rule.
I cite these wars only to show that these
historical incidents-if they are incidentshave been conducive to the World War. They
have been instrumental to a certain degree in
determining the frame of mind which prevailed
in Cermany at the time the World War broke
out.
But in the World War, honourable members,
there was no gainer. No country can boast
that it reaped any great profit from that
terrible engagement. The Treaty of Versailles
may have dispossessed Germany of her
colonies; Austria and Bulgaria may have been
deprived of certain territories; but from whatever angle you consider it, the Great War
resulted in a loss to all concerned. No substantial advantage accrued to anybody, and
no compensation resulting from the Treaty of
Peace can measure up to the huge losses sustained. In this respect, at least, the World
WTar was quite different from other wars, and
that is why I say that in 1919 the moment was
propitious for the presentation of the Covenant
known as the Covenant of the League of Nations.
At the time the Treaty of Peace was signed
there were two schools of thought: there was
the school, very limited in number, whieh contended that we should call the account square,
and that nothing should be exacted froni
Germany or Austria in the way of reparations,
indemnities or territory. The voice of the
followers of that school was very feeble, and
was heard in very few quarters, and it soon
ceased to exercise any influence. On the other
side there was the school whose doctrine was:
"No mercy whateverl An exemplary punishment is the only effective deterrent from a
similar enterprise on the part of Germany."
Public opinion in most of the countries of
the allied nations was behind that proposition.
I do not say that every citizen of Canada, or
every citizen of France, or of England, or

MAY 22, 1930
Belgium, or Italy, waa insistent that Gerxnany
.should be absolutel>' sborn of everytbing; but
the majority of the people of those countries
insisted that an exemplar>' punisbment, materially and otherwise, should be inflicted upon
the Germnan Emperor, his caste, and the Germnan nation at large.
May' I digress for a moment, and ask you
to come back with me to the year 1871, wben
the city of Paris was encompassed by the
IPrussian army. There she was besieged-encircled in iron. Two men, Mr. Thiers and Mr.
Favre, lef t tbe centre of the city to meet Mr.
Bismarck. You know the conditions tbat were
imposed upon France. Wbat wouild have been
the future of tbe world, I ask, if Mr. Bismarck had said: "There you are at my feet.
You confess your inferiority, almost your
guilt. You are praying for peace, and I will
give it to you. I will not demand anytbing
in return. I ask for no territory and no money
indemnit>'. All I ask is that you take care of
t.hose wbo have been maimed and înjured in
the war." If those conditions had been held
out to tbe representatives of France, and if
peace had been secured upon those terras, do
you believe that the germs of the World War
would bave developed? Could they have developed? I leave ever>' bonourable gentleman to answer that question for himself. But
1871 was what Gersnany made it; and 1919
was what the Allies made it.
Now let us pass on. My honourable fricnd
the eloquent senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), in bis able remarks yesterday,
referred to the attitude of the United States
of America. One cannot but remember the
circurustances of the coming to Europe of the
President of the United States in 1918. Mr.
Wilson appeared bo be carrying wvith bim the
good wisbes and tbe entîre confidence of tbe
people of bis cou.ntry. 11e arrivcd in Europe
heralded as no bero of antiquit>' or tbe Middle
Âges had ever been. In Paris bie carried
everytbing before bim. We know of bis
activibies wibb regard to the Treaty of Pence;
of bis presentation of tbe Covenant of the
League of Nations, and bis great plea in favour
of its adoption, and we know also of the tragic
sequel, that he returned to bis ovin country
only to bave wbat bie bad donc repudiated by
the United States Senate.
My bonourable friend ma-de a remark yesterday bo the effeet that the fact of the
Ulnited States not being part and parcel of
the League of Nations sbould not be regarded
ns an obstacle in the way of tbe progress and
ultimabe success of the League. In a large
measure 1 share that view.
But are the United States of A-merica entirel>' indifferent? As a miatter of fact tbey

ô

are shsring in large measure in the activities
of the League of Nations. Take tLhe Dawes
Plan, for instance. You ma>' say that it did
not corne witbin tbe framnework of the League.
I grant you that, but I say that it was under
The Dawes
the influence of the League.
Plan was devised for the purpoee of alleviating the heavy reparation conditions imposed upon Germany wi.thout provoking adverse public opinion in the Allied countries.
That plan worked for a numiber of years. I
think honourable gentlemen will support niy
contention that the United States in this
instance were not indifferent to the work of
the League of Nations.
What bas been said of the Dawes Plan may
be said of the Young Commission and a
large number of other commissions upon
whicb the United States are represented.
'rake for instance the Committee of Experts
for the Progressive Codification of International Law. On this committee the United
States are represented b>' Mr. George W.
Wickersham, former Attorney General of the
Uniited States. member of the Comrnittee on
International Law of the American Bar Association. and President of the American Law
Institute. Take thc Preparator>' Commission
Here again the United
on Disarmament.
States are represented by Mr. Gibson. Coming
to the Economic and Financial Organization
of the Le-ague-1 think that ever>' bonourable
gentleman will admit ths.t that commîttee is
an important one-I find that the United
States are representd by Mr. Lucius R.
Eastman, ex.-president of tbe Merchants'
Association of New York. Now I proceed
to the Consultative Committee of the
Economic Organisation: on that comnmittee
we find Mr. Robert Olds, former UnderSecretar>' of State, and Mr. Alonzo E. Taylor,
Director of the Food Research Institute, StanThen I pass on to the
ford University'.
Financial Committee, on which the United
States' representative is Mr. Jeremiah Smith,
Jr., former Commissioner General of the
League in Hungary. Passing over somne other
comrnittees, I corne to the Health Organization, and among the naines of those on the
Healtb Committee I flnd Surgeon-General
H. S. Cumiming, Chief of tbc United States
Public Health Service, and Dr. C. E. A.
Winalow, Prof essor of Public Health, Yale
Sehool of Medicine, and member of the
Publiýc Health Counci;l of the State of Conneoticut. On thc Commission of Expert
Statisticians I find the namne of Dr. Haven
Emerson, Professor of Public Real-th Administration, Columbia University', New York.
H1e is also one of tbe members of the Joint
Commission for the Revision of thc International List of the Causes of Death. On

16

SENATE

the Expert Committee on Sleeiping Sickness
I find the name of Professor R. Strong, Department of Tropical Medicine, Harvard
University Medical School.
On the Commission on Standardisation of Sera, Serological Reactions and Biological Products, the
representative is Dr. W. G. McCoy, Director
of the Hygienic Laboratory of the United
States Public Health Service. On the Commission on Education in Hygiene and Preven-tive Medicine appears the name of Professor W. H. Welch, Director of the School
of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore.
The United States are represented on the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation by Mr. R. A. Milliken, Director
of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics
at the California Institute of Technology.
Another American, on the Subcommittee of
Sciences and Bibliography, is Mr. Schramin,
member of the National Research Council of
the United States of America. The list of
members of the Advisory Committee on
Traffic in Opium contains the name of Mr.
J. K. Caldwell, appointed by his Government
to attend in an unofficial capacity; and the
Permanent Central Opium Board has as the
representative of the United States Mr. H. L.
May, and the Advisory Commission for the
Protection and Welfare of Children and
Young People, Miss Abbott. Again, as my
honourable friend the acting leader (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) said yesterday, the United
States have given their adherence to the International Court of The Hague.
I submit, honourable senators, that the
League has achieved gratifying results during the last ton years in spite of serious obstacles. As the honourable acting leader (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) pointed out yesterday, it has
succeeded in effecting settlements by conciliation, arbitration, or other pacific means,
in 130 cases. The League has dampened the
ardour of many nations that have been on
the threshold of war. In not a few of these
instances the main instrument of success was
delay; for if but one day's delay can be
secured, a war may be averted.
In this connection I should like to bring to
the attention of this honourable body a fact
that undoubtedly will h cited in history as
one of the most interesting and most regrettable incidents of modern times.
It is
reported in the memoirs of the late Myron T.
Herrick, American Ambassador to France during the World War, which have been compiled
and published by his intimate friend, Colonel
T. Bentley Mott. On the 28th of July, 1914,
Mr. Herrick despatched to the Secretary of
State of the United States, the late Mr.
Hon. Mr. BELAND.

Williams Jennings Bryan, a cable which, with
your permission, I shall read. The copy I
have is in the French language and I ask the
indulgence of honourable members while I
translate it as well as I can into English.
The situation in Europe is regarded here as
one of extreme gravity. Civilization is threatened by the demoralization which would follow
a general conflict. It is said that the popuîlar
demonstrations against war which took place
last nightThat was in Paris.
-are the first of the kind in France. It is
felt that if Germany mobilizes, war is inevitable. France bas great confidence in her army.
The people here place great confidence in our
bigh ideals and intentions. I therefore believe
that a gesture by our nation would have the
greatest weight in this crisis. My opinion is
confirmed by the British Ambassador.
I believe that a strong appeal by President
Wilson for delay and moderation would be
welcomed with respect and approval in Europe.
The whole question could then be reconsidered.
This suggestion is consistent with our role as
arbitrators in treaties and our attitude in the
affairs of the world in general.
I do not wish to be thougbt unduly zealois,
but I deem it my duty to give you my opinion
frankly.
(Signed) Herrick.
The Ambassador received no acknowledgment of this despatch, and when ho returned
to the United States later ho inquired of
President Wilson whether the cable had ever
been received by him. The President replied
that ho had never seen it.
On whom must
be placed the responsibility for withholding
such an important document? It is not for
me to say. Honourable members may draw
their own conclusions in this matter. But
is it not within the bounds of reason to express
the view that an intervention by the United
States at that moment might have averted
a war?
I would ask honourable members to bear
with me a little longer while I briefly review
what I consider to bo four distinct periods or
phases of the activities of the League of
Nations.
The first phase, extending from
1920 to 1922, included the organization of the
Secretariat, the Assembly and the Council,
and the Constitution of the Hague Court.
The dominant feature of this phase was the
creation of the Hague Court. The second
phase, from 1922 to 1925, was a period of
struggles and difficulties over securities, arbitrations and disarmaments, all interrelated,
and all brought to a head when the Geneva
Protocol was presented and voted upon by
the Assembly. The principal achievement of
those years was the Geneva Protocol. The
third phase, from 1925 to 1928, saw the rejection of the Protocol and the substitution there-

MAY 22, 1930
for of covenants like the Locarno Pact and
the Briand-Kellogg Treaty. The outstanding
event of this period was the entry of Germany into membership of the League of
Nations. The f ourth phase, from 19M to the
present, is notable principally because of the
settlement of the reparations question.
It should be remernbered that at the time
the Treaty of Peace was made, the amount
tentatively set out for payment hy Germany
to the Allies was one hundred and tbirty
billions of marks, which, I suppose, would be
equivalent Vo about tbirty-five billions of
dollars. The Dawes Plan reduced that amount
to eighteen billions of dollars, and the Young
Plan, which was accepted by Germany and
was the decîsive factor in making possible ber
stay in the League, brought the -figure down
to eleven billions. Knowing as we do what
France bas suffered, that all ber departments
from the Belgian border on the west to the
Swiss border in the east bave been ravaged
and subjected to terrible econoii strain,
and mindful of ber buge losses of men, one
feels that ber consent to this last reduction
proves ber sincere desire for peace among
nations, and especially between berself and
Germany.
We have in this country a League of
Nations Society, which. needs and menite the
co-operation of every Canadian citizen in its
efforts to create public opinion favourable to
the objecte and works of the League.
Mr. Eduard Benes, the most illustrious
statesman of Czechoslovakia, was asked wben
the activities of the League of Nations would
cesse. He're is his answer:
The tasks of the League will neyer be comnpleted; they are eternal. The necessity of
organiig international co-operation will always
exist, eULse new situations will always arise
to demaand international adjustment.
Let us bear in znind, bonourable members,
that the League of Nations commenced its
work under most trying circumestances. Let
us not forget that for many years it bad to
repair before it could proceed to construet.
It is my impression that the League is on the
rigbt path. The best proof that this is 80 15
the growing confidence and trust witb wbicb
it is regarded now by all kinds of people
everywbere.
It may be asked when the zenith cf
buman greatness will be attaîned. It is a
diffioult question to answer, but we may say
that that will comne to pass wben the barriers
of discord, wbich at present are apparently
insuperable, bave been removed. When will
this be possible? There is another difficult
question, which we might answer in this way:
when national rivalry, ambition and hatred

1

are no longer bred on each side of international boundaries. When will that stage be
reached? That is a stili more perplexing
question. But let us answer it by saying,
when every citizen in the making, every
cbild, bas been taught to be a citizen of the
world as well as of his own country. When
that time cornes, the common adventure of
humanity may be a happy one. This littie
earth of ours will continue to revolve around
the sun for a long time before the desired
goal is reached. Those who, like myself, have
passed the meridian of life may not live to
witness that glorious era. But, aocording Vo
the opinion expressed by M. Briand, it is on
the way. The time must corne when man's
life and the wealth whieh he has accumulated
through centuries of industry will not be subject to destruction by bis brother man.
In conclusion, honourable senators,' I submit
that it is our imperative duty as part of the
Parliament of Canada, as it is the duty of
every citizen of this great country, to support
and encourage in every possible manner the
noble work of the League of Nations. We
-owe this duty to ourselves as individuals, to
our families, to our fellow citizens, to our own
country, Vo other nations, and to humanity as
a whole.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable sens.tors, 1 had
not intended to take any part in this debate,
but wben it was adjourned the thought
occurred to me that, without going over the
ground so well and eloquently covered by
other honourable mernbers, I might briefiy
discuss another phase of the subject, or perhaps
1 should say, a kindred subject. 1 refer to
the part that the English-speaking nations, the
British Commonwealth of Nations and the
United States, seem, privileged to play in
advancing the cause of peace. I do not mean
to dlaim for those of the British races any
racial superiority. They have their full share
of pugnacity, that element of buman nature
which is one of the causes of war; and so
far from being ashamed, they are rather proud.
of it. Such advantages as we of the British
nations and the United States possess for
the promotion of peace sbould be a cause. of
gratitude rather than of pride, and should
make us realize our grave responsibility towards the rest of the world. These advantages
are due to favourable circumstances, which I
shall try Vo partially explain.
The League of Nations is particularly concerned with Continental Europe, where lies the
chief danger of war. Great Britain, while part
of Europe, is to some extent removed. from the
traditions, jealousies, fears and anxieties of
Continental Europe, and therefore is peculiarly

318

SENATE

fitted to play a helpful part. The United States
is stili farther removed from those complications, and, though it is true that public men
of the United States to-day realize that an
attitude of aloofness is no longer possible, yet
the comparative isolation of the last century
and a haîf has had a certain influence upon the
mentality and the point of view of the
American people. The result is that among
English-speaking nations there has been
evolved an entirely new conception of international relations, and it is an entirely new
conception of those relations that is needed
if the hopes of peace are to be fulfilled.
Consider first the relations of the nations
composing what is calýleýd the British Commonwealth of Nations. There bas been a great
deal of controversy about national states,
but usually the question has been treated as
one whicb concernied only the United Kingdom and the self-governing Dominions. What
1 want to point out is tha-t in reýconeiling
Britisbl unity with national status, there bas
been evolved a new kind of international
relattion wbich may have a most important
influence uýpon international relations ail over
the world. 1 do nlot mean that the British
example can be followed exactly and in détail,
but I do mean that we have established the
fact that international relations are capable
of taking new forms-that tbey are not flxed,
but fluid. That is a faet -that must be recognized if international relations are to be
radically reformed. If Great Britain were a
centralized empire there would be no lesson
for the world in that, because centralized
empires are an old story. If the Dominions
bad separated from the United Kingdom,
theie woîîld be ne lessen in that for the rest of
the world, because separate nwtionality, too,
is an old story. But here we have something
new: we have the example of several nations

controlling regions capable of enormous ex-

pansion-nations in the full sense-living on
terms of assured peace, friendship and cooperation. This, as I have said, is an example whieh 1 do net expeet to be followed
in detail hy other nations, but wVhich should
be food for thought for all wbose minds are
open to receive new ideas.
I pass on to the remarkable relations
existing between Canada and the British
Empire on the one side, and the United
States on the other. And here again I make
no dlaima of superiority over our less happily
situated brethren in Continental Europe. There
can be no dlaim of racial superiority here,
because most of us are transplanted Europeans,
or descendants of Europeans. Our advantage
is due not to any racial differeaice, but to
enviren.ment-to the fact that we have been
Hion. Mr. LEWIS.

blessed in being able to make a fresh start
and discard some traditions of the old world..
Whatever may be the source of the advantage,
it is one of which we should avail ourselves
to the fu.llest extent, not so, much for the
comfort and .safety of Canada as in the in'terests of the British Empire and of the human
race as -a whole. We are all agreed on the
benefit of our conneetion with the British
Empire, not for ourselves only, but for the
stability of the whole world. We ought to
be equally agreed on the vast importance of

friendly relations with tbe United States, and

it is there that we can do the greatest work,
a work in which every man and woman, and
every ehild of thinking age, can take a part.
Our little difficulties as to tariffs and other
matte-s are as dust in tbe balance when
weigbed -against the part that we can play
together in making, this world a, hetter place
for bumanity. There is no objection whatever to spirited rivalry between ourselves and
our neigbbours in the development of our
resources, nor to the assertion of a strong
Canadian spirit; but let our rivalry be a
generous rivalry in service for mankind.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE:

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

If

thore is ne one cisc to follow, although I
have already spoken, I wonder if I may be
permitted just a word along the line cf the
remarks made yesterday by the acting leader

of the Huse (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) on the
effeet of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, or the Pact
of Paris, in premoting peace as epposed te
war, and also in strengthening and making
mole sueeessful the League of Nations. The
Paet of Paris is in one sense a pieus declara-

319

MAY 22, 1930
tion, but it is none the less important because
that description may be applied to it. In
the obligation that it imposes upon the nations who have signed it the Pact of Paris
has implications which we have as yet seen
only in their beginnings, and to which no one
can set the limits.
What I wish to bring to the attention of
honourable members is the practical application of what is implied by the pact. Difficulties
arose between Russia and China in the far
distant region of Manchuria. China was,
and is, a member of the League of Nations,
and as such was bound by the obligations of
the League and of the Pact of Paris as well.
Russia was one of the first countries to
signify their adherence to the pact, and was
oonsequently bound by its obligations. When
war threatened between those two signatories,
the first practical step was taken to make the
pact more than a pious resolution or a solemn
pledge. As one of the prime movers, and one
of the signatories to that pact, the United
States Government felt bound to take some
step against the threatened violation of that
agreement, and immediately addressed an
official note to China and to Soviet Russia,
calling attention to the fact that as signatories
to the pact they were bound by its obligations,
and intimating in a very quiet and nonaggressive way that she fully expected them
to live up to those obligations.
That was a direct application of the obligations that are undertaken by nations that
have agreed, first, that they shall never use
war as an instrument of national policy, and
second, that they shall settle all disputes, of
whatever kind, by peaceful methods. What
follows logically and properly from such
obligations? It is true that the Soviet Government, in a style somewhat usual to it,
intimated that the United States had better
mind its own business; but it is true also
that a number of other nations of great importance and power, who were signatories to
the pact, followed the lead of the United
States. The important fact for us to remember is that, although there were unauthorized
depredations along the border, they were disavowed by both countries, and war did not
ensue. This gives rise to strong hope and
confidence in the future, and it is an earnest
that whenever similar trouble threatens between signatories of the pact, the great powers,
the initiatory powers, so to speak, and the
contributory signatories, will bring to bear
not only a moral influence, but diplomatie,
financial and economie influences as well.
It is true that no war of any consequence
can take place in the future without a tremen-

dous expenditure of capital, resources, and
other war materials. It is also true that the
great moral influence of the world, without
recourse to actual arms and armaments and
warfare, will be a powerful sanction against
the robber or brigand nation.
Every year since I have been a member of
the Senate, as a matter of duty, a matter of
privilege, and a matter of pleasure to myself,
I have plagued my fellow members on this
subject with a screed, more or less lengthybut to my mind very abbreviated in comparison with the magnitude of the question
involved-and each year I have been accorded
a sympathetic hearing by members on both
sides of the House. The discussion that has
taken place this year, I am glad to saywhether it be due to some efforts of my
own or to wider influences-makes me indulge
in the hope that hereafter in both Houses
of Parliament there will be repeated contribution and communion on this great subjectthe disuse of war, the discarding of prejudices,
misunderstandings, and racial antagonisms, and
the prospect of peace, prosperity and happiness for the human race.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable senators,
as a member of this honourable House I am
proud of the contribution to this subject
which has been made in the several speeches
to which we have listened during the past
few days. I have no intention of speaking
on the question, because there is little that
I can add to what has been so well said. I
think, however, that it would be proper to
afford our honourable colleague and leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) an opportunity to
address us on his return, and to tell us something of the latest proceedings of the Council,
of which he is a member. Therefore I beg
to move the adjournment of the debate until
Monday.
The debate was adjourned.

Moreover, under Chapter 161 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, an Act respecting the

Postmaster General or of the Department to
add considerably to the number of questions
to be answered. On referring to sections 85
and 127 of the Companies Act, Chapter 27
of the Revised Statutes, it will be found that
the newspapers, especially those that are
organized into corporations, are required to
mnake extensive and detailed reports. They
must also send reports to the Finance Min-

HOPPE MINING LANDS
REPLY TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable senators,
I have a letter from the honourable the
Minister of the In'terior With regard to certain
inquiries made by my honourable friend from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope). The letter is dated
the 21st of May, and reads as follows:
Dear Senator Belcourt,
In connection with the discussion in the
Senate on the 14th instant on the coal mining
leases comprising locations situated near the
junction of the Muskeg and Smoky Rivers in
the Province of Alberta which stood recorded
in the Department in the name of Mr. Paul R.
Isenberg (known .as the Hoppe leases), I may
say that on a petition of right of the Hawaiian
Trust Company, Limited, and Bertha K. Isenberg, of the City of Honolulu, dated the 10th
February, 1926, as executors of the Estate of
Paul R. Isenberg, deceased, claiming compensation for unlawful cancellation of the leases,
a fiat was granted and the Exchequer Court
ruled on the 3rd July, 1929, that the suppliants
were entitled to recover from the Crown
$113,280, in full satisfaction and settlement of
the claim. This amount was paid and a release
dated the 5th July, 1929, was executed by the
solicitor for the petitioners.
As you are awa-re, this coal reserve was
created by an Act of Parliament passed in 1923,
and now arppears as subeection 2 of section 35
of the Dominion Lands Act, which reads as
follows:"Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Act, lands containing coal, and the coal mining
rights therein, situate or being within townships fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight
and fifty-nine, in ranges seven, eight and Dine
west of the Sixth Initial Meridian in the province of Alberta, shall not be sold, leased or
otherwise disposed of in whole or in part, or
as to any right, title or interest therein, except
by the special authority of the Parliament of
Canada to be hereafter enacted."
I may say that in the opinion of Colonel
Biggar the surface and under-rights of this
reserve pass to the control of the Province
with the remainder of the resources.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) Chas. Stewart.

Bill No. 130, an Act respecting the Canadian
National Railways, and te provide for the
refunding of certain maturing financial obligations.-Right Hon. Mr. Graham.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I think I
should give a little explanation of this
measure. It is in the usual forrn of Canadian National Railways financing Bills, as to
the power te issue securities and in its other
formal clauses, and provides for the refunding of an amount of $20,042,038.84. I shall
give a brief comment on the different classes
of original securities which are to be refunded,
and honourable members will find it easier
to follow my remarks if they turn te the
schedule which begins at page 4 of the printed
Bill.
The bonds mentioned in paragraph (a),
anounting to S5,684,753.3.3, were guaranteed
by the Manitoba Government and become
due this year.
The bonds referred to in paragraph (b)
were net guaranteed by the Province of
Manitoba, but were exchangeable for guaranteed bonds of the issue mentioned in paraNearly all these securities were
graph (a).
exchanged for the guaranteed securities, but
a few were net, and they amount te $59,860.
Paragraph (c) represents bonds for 810,785,993.31 guaranteed by the Province of Manitoba. The securities described in paragraph
(d), amounting te $2,859,998.87, and in paratotalling $2,433.33, were also
graph (e),
guaranteed by the Province.
The securities mentioned in paragraph (f),

amounting te

$300,000,

were issued in connec-

tien with a branch of the Canadian Northern
Railway outside Manitoba. These were net
guaranteed.
Paragraph (g) deals with bonds that were
issued in connection with the Minnesota and
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Manitoba Railroad Company. The Manitoba
Government could not guarantee the company's bonds in this case, because it was a
foreign company, although the railroad was
operated by the Canadian Northern; se the
Province decided to aid the company to the
extent, I think, of $8,000 a mile. The Government issued bonds for $349,000, and the Minnesota and Manitoba Railroad Company
handed over to the Government bonds to the
amount of $352,000. There is a discrepancy,
but the amount to be refunded is only $349,000.
As I said at the beginning, the securities
amount altogether te $20,042,038.84. They all
become due this year, and it is necessary that
the Canadian National Railways be empowered
te issue securities which, like all their other
securities, will be guaranteed by the Federal
Government. I am moving the second reading, if honourable members have no objection.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: When will copies of
this Bill be distributed, se that we may see
what it provides? I have net a copy on my
file.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have just
been told that the Bill is net on file and probably has net been received here. If we could
have the second reading now, the third reading might be postponed until to-morrow, and
in the meantime honourable members will
have received copies.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have a copy,
which I received outside the Chamber. I do
not think there has been a general distribution.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The copies are
coming in now, I am told.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have no comment te make on the assumption by the
Federal Government of the guarantees which
were given by the Manitoba Government.
All the obligations will fall due and must be
retired or otherwise provided for before Parliament meets again.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Canadian
National owns the stock of these roads.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is one of the
many chickens that have come home te roost.
I do not know that we are at all surprised
that one more of them has come into the
old hen coop. I have no more to say on
the matter now, except that it is an absolute
obligation, a business obligation on our part,
to protect our own property.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

MAY 26, 1930
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If there is no
objection and the HEouse consents, I move
that the Bill be read the third time.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 should like ta ask the
honourable gentleman whether this Bill is to
have any effeet whatever on the guarantees
that have been made by the Western Provinces with regard to the building of these
roads.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Canadian
National, having taken over these roads,
assumes the responsibilities. It is the owner
of the stock of these lines.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Then I understand that
the various provinces are relieved of theiT
guarantees.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Ijnder this
Bill the only province interested is Manitoba,
and it will be relieved of these guarantees.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the 'third time, and passed.
CANADIAN NATIONAL (CENTRAL
VERMOINT) FINANCING B3ILL
FIRST REAIDING

Bill 131, an Act respecting the Canadian
National Railways, and ta provide for certain
financing in connection with certain uines of
railway located principally in the State of
Vermont.-Right Hon. Mr. Graham.
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING

POSTPONED

Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, the Central
Vermont Railway, consisting of about 180
miles, in addition ta braniches, is the hune over
which the "Washingtonian" runs from Montreal to New York. Some few years ago the
Grand Trunk conceived the idea of completing the line from a place called Palmer, I
thiink, down ta the sea, and lent to the Central
Vermont Railway Company, which they controlled, between eight and nine million dollars.
That line was neyer completed. Later on-I
think it was in 1927-a great calamity befell
t he New England States and damage ta the
extent of millions of dollars was donc to the
Central Vermont Railway.
The Grand Trunk and the Canadian National had altogether some S38,000.000 in the
Central Vermont. Owing ta the calamity ta
xvbich 1 have referred, the Canadian -National,
in ordcr ta prateet its interests, asked that
the Central Vermont Railu ay be placed in
the hands of receivers. This was donc, and

the receivers proceeded to repair the damage
and put the line into fit condition to operate
once more. The certificates of the receivers
amountcd to about $5,000,000. When the line
went into the hands of the receivers they of
course took steps to dispose of the property.
As the successors of the old Grand Trunk,
the Canadian National Railways were deeply
interested and made a bid on the property
and purchased it for $22,000,000 plus the
55,000,000 expended by the receivers in putting
the road into proper condition. The purchase
price was therefore $27,000,000 all told. The
Central Vermont, although it was handed over
to the Canadian National Railway Company,
which now own ahl the stock and control the
road, is stili run by another company.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
the purchase price?

Their debt was

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 2 Their present
0
debt is the purchase price- 7,00 ,0OO; but
the G.T.R. and C.N.R. had some 538,000,000,
I think, in the undertaking. This amount,
less $22,000,000 and $5,000,000, left $11,000,000.
The $8,000,000 odd asked for by this legislation is about the amount loaned by the
Grand Trunk to the Central Vermont for the
construction of a line that was neyer constructed. There is a wcll-founded hope that
part of that amount will be recovered through
the sale of the right of way, which is stili in
the hands of the Central Vermont, and therefore of tbe Canadian National. Of course
there is an unavoidable loss.
W'hen the matter was placed before me
as Minister of Railways 1 was not prepared
to encourage the building of any more uines
to the sea outside of Canada; and in this
the Canadian National was in agreement with
me. I was wholly opposed ta going on wit-h
the construction of the New England line,
and maintained that it would not cost as
much to get out of the arrangement as it
would to proeed with it.
The securities of the Central Vermont
Railway, amounting to $12,000,000, have been
handed over ta the Canadian National Railways, and practically 54,000,000 will remain in
their hands. The balance of the securities,
equal to the amount naw asked for, will be
placed in the hands of the Recciver General,
and when they become more valuabyle than
they are now, as they probably will, the
Receiver General will be authorized to dispose of them as he secs fit and to apply the
proceeds ta the reduction of any amount
guaranteed hy the Canadian Government on
any line.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. TANNER: What are the termini
of the railway?
Where does it begin and
where does it end?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It begins in
St. Johns, Quebec, and runs to White River
Junction; then it starts again at Brattleboro,
Vermont, and ends at New London, Connecticut.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
What
physical value of the railway?

is

the

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is hard
to say. It is worth at least the amount we
were asked for it-the $22,000,000 and the
$5,000,000. But the $38,000,000 will have to
be taken care of. I imagine its value is semewhat greater than that amount less the amount
lost in New England.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
a feeder?

Is it valuable as

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
It is used
by the Canadian National Railways as one
of their through lines now. It is a very
valuable feeder. It has not been so successful
in years past. I have my own views as to
the reason.
If I remember correctly, the
Central Vermont last year, for the first time
in some years, appeared in black figures in
the annual statement of
the
Canadian
National. The Canadian National Railways
could have let it go into other hands, but it
was one of their chief feeders and one of
their chief connections.
They would have
had to lease running rights over it if it got
into other hands.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Did they build
the whole of it into New London?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It runs to
New London, I am informed by the Department of Railways.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is the significance of "black figures"? Does the honourable gentleman mean a surplus?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes, I mean
that last year it paid a surplus.

Hoin. Mr. GRIESBACH: On what?

On

operation, or on total charges?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think it paid
a surplus on total charges, but I am not sure
about that.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Formerly the "Wash-

now it does.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Leaving Ottawa, we
went through the city of the late Finance
Minister.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hon. Mr. TANNER: We connected with
the Montreal train at St. Albans. Now we
go right into Montreal.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Was it the
"Washingtonian" you were attached to, or the
"Rutland"?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have been several
times on that train going through Montreal.
I was down during the Easter recess this year,
and we went right into Montreal.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That was found
more convenient than the other way. I have
the impression that it was the old Rutland
route you went on before, through Noyan
Junotion.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I wondered when the
change was made.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But there was
a difficulty in the connection. I tried once to
catch the "Washingtonian" by way of Coteau.
but discovered that to make the connection
I had te be taken twenty miles by a special
engine.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Do I understand that the road is actually completed to
New London?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I understand
so.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am not
familiar with this Bill. I do not know, but in
view of the fact that the Central Vermont
was unable to carry the line on to New
London, the only ones who could do so would
bh the Canadian National Railways. I happen
to know that some three or four ycars agoperhaps a little more-the officials of the
Canadian National held the highest hopes of
dceeloping an enormous and profitable business through this line to New London. In
later years I have not been in touch with it.
I assume the road was built to New London.
But who built it?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: MY instructions are that the railway runs from Brattleboro to New London.

â27

MAY 26, 1930

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I cannot dispute that, but I do not know who built it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my memory
serves me aright, there were entanglements in
one or two legislatures. Mr. Hays, the President of the Grand Trunk Railway, and his
officials, were threatened with arraignment
before the courts for contravening the laws of
the United States in the building of that line.
After considerable money had been spent,
construction was stopped and the road remained as it was until the Legislature of
Connecticut, I think, threatened to cancel the
charter, or refused to renew it. I know the
matter was ventilated in this Chamber some
years ago. My impression is that we now
have a line that has cost a lot of money,
and has been carried forward to a certain
point, but has never reached its projected
destination.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It has not been
finished. That is the point I am getting at.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think we
had better leave the second reading until
to-morrow.
The motion for the second reading stands.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

SENATE
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable members, the passage of this Bill practically completes the soldier legislation of the present
session, and perhaps the Bill warrants some
comment, if for no other reason than to
emphasize the magnitude of its scope and the
burden placed upon the country in carrying
out its provisions. It has always been the
proud boast of the Canadian people that their
ex-service men have received as generous treatment as the veterans of any country which
participated in the late war; and in many
respects our ex-service men have in the past
received even more generous treatment than
has been accorded by other participants.
While this is true, it is now becoming
apparent that with the passage of time the
situation has undergone marked changes, and
consequently we have been forced to change
the structure of our soldier legislation. We
have always had before us the experience of
the United States in dealing with the care
of veterans of the Civil War, and it has been
our constant effort to avoid, if possible, the
scandalous condition of affairs which developed
in the American Service, the marked feature
of which was that, although many years had
passed since the Civil War, the pensions paid
to American war veterans showed practically
no diminution up to recent times. It has
always been gratifying to those who have interested themselves in soldier legislation in
Canada to find the officials of the Canadian
veterans showing a disposition to avoid the
conditions which, in the American post-war
period, for many years practically amounted
to a public scandal.
As I said before, however, with the advance
of time new conditions have arisen and have
to be met, and the legislation of this session
is merely a reflex of the changed conditions
as regards Canadian veterans. A few days ago
this House approved Bill No. 19, entitled "An
Act respecting War Veterans' Allowances,"
which, while confined exclusively to ex-service men and their dependents, is to be considered not as pension legislation, but rather
an advanced step in social legislation, with
particular regard to men who are now breaking
down as a result of war service and who heretofore have not been claimants for pensions
or assistance as a result of war casualties.
As we got further away from the Great War,
men who participated in that great struggle
commenced to show a delayed
physical
impairment. It did not appear in the years
immediately following the Armistice. The
country was therefore faced with a great
problem, which could be met only by the
establishment of soldiers' homes to take care
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of such cases, or the adoption of legislation
to provide for the maintenance of those men
who, by reason of their war efforts, were
showing signs of inability to provide for themselves.
As time passes and new generations come
on, there may be a natural disposition to
forget the men who bore the brunt of the
struggle in upholding their country's honour on
the battlefields of France. New generations
have not the same perspective of what the
great sacrifices made by those men involved,
and the onus is upon those of us who participated in that war effort, either directly or
ndirectly, to stick by those who fought our
battles, not to allow the advance of time
to overshadow the great sacrifices and achievements of our army in the field, but to sec
that a grateful country does not forget, even
through the passing of time, the debt of
gratitude it owes to the men who upheld our
cause.
While this is truc, I am afraid that the
necessities of the situation are forcing upon
us, to some extent at least, a semblance of
the burdens which were placed upon the
Arnerican Republic after the Civil War. We
are probably commencing to realize that what
wve considered a grave question in connection
with the American forces may, after all, have
been the logical result of an attempt to do
justice to war veterans. With their experience
before us, we can probably avoid some of
their pitfalls, but it is quite clear to my
mind that Canada will have to face for many
years an increasing financial burden in providing for its ex-service men.
It may be interesting right here to take
stock of the expenditure Canada has made on
account of war veterans up to the present
time. The figures are involved and technical,
but with the assistance of competent departmental officials I have endeavoured to arrive
at some idea of what it has cost this country
since the war to deal with the soldier problem. The following figures are as nearly correct as I can make them without going into
details and sundry explanations which might
complicate the statement:
Pensions already paid to soldiers
and dependents..........s

would tend to cause the pendulum of justice

to swing too far in the opposite direction. A
great deal will depend upon the attitude of
the veterans' representatives before the tribunals which have been established by this
legislation. If they co-operate with the Government in seeking only what is fair and just,
and if, though demanding justice, they have
at the same time some regard for the eternal
fitness of things, they will perform a woi-thy
service on behalf of the men they represent
and will also assist in carrying out the generous intentions of Parliament.
I unreservedly support the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADIAN NATIONAL (CENTRAL
VERMONT) FINANCING BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the motion of Right Hon. Mr.
Graham for the second reading of Bill 131,
an Act respecting the Canadian National
Railways, and to provide for certain financing
in connection with certain lines of railway
located principally in the State of Vermont.
Right lion. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, when we discussed this Bill
last night there were some matters which,
though seeming clear to nie, I was apparently
unable to make quite clear to some honourable gentlemen. I admit frankly that the
point raised by the honourable leader on the
other side of the House
(Hon.
Mr.
Willoughby) set me thinking, and think as
hard as I might, I could net find the answer
at the moment. Ris question, briefly, was:
"How did the Central Vermont get to New
London. Connecticut?'
I knew it had
reached New London, but could not explain
hiow it got there. Now, I think, I have a fairly
clrar explanation, and in order to make quite
plain how t he Central Vermont proper and
the leased lines are constituted, it may be
weIl to place a memsorandum on Hansard.
The Nortelirin Div-ision of the main line
is comped cf lines from St. Jolins, Quebec,

Hon.

LAURD.

The branch lines of the Northern Division
are as follows: St. Albans to Richford,
Vermont, 27.48 miles; Burlington, Vermont,
to Essex Junction, Vermont, 7.85 miles;
Essex Junction
to Cambridge
Junction,
Vermont, 22.29 miles; Montpelier Junction,
Vermont, to Barre, 7.96 miles; Barre Junetion
to Williamstown, 8.69 miles. These branches
total 74.27 miles.
The Southern Division main line is comnposed of the line from White River Junction,
Vermont, to Windsor, Vermont, 14 miles, and
the line from East Northfield to Brattleboro,
10.59 miles; or a total of 24.59 miles.
The branch lines of the Southern Division
are fron Brattleboro to South Londonderry,
35.45 miles.
The total mileage is 290.29 miles. The
figure I gave last night, 180 miles, is the total
of the main line.
The question that seemed te puzzle us al!
iras how the Centrail Vermont got from Brattleboro to New London. Some honourable
gentlemen thought it never got there. They
were right so far as proprietorship is concerned, for the line frou Brattleboro to New
London is owned by the New London and
Northern; but it is under lease te the Central
Vermont for ninety-nine years. This lease was
made in 1891. If this branch is included, the
total mileage is 411.29 miles.
Some honourable gentleman asked me te
give a few more details as to the liabilities of
the Central Vermont. Mark you, the Central Vermont securities are issued on the 290
miles. This is the mileage purchased by tie
Canadian National Railways. The liability of
the Central Vermont is made up as follows:

concerning the Grand Trunk resulted fromn
the first receivership and fromn the settiements made by that railway, by whioh it got
control of the Central Vermont. Since that
time other advances have been made. Af ter
the floocts in the State of Vermont in November, 1927, the Canadian National Railway, in
order to, protect its interests9, asked for receivership, for the Central Vermnont. When
the company again went into the hands of
receivers the bonds became due and provision
had to be made for them. On account of
the repairs made by the receivers of the
Central Vermont some $5,000,000 waa represented in certificates.
One cen sec that when bonds amounting to
$8,609,000 became due the Canadian National
had ta do sorne ternporary financing in order
to take care of this indebtedness. The Bill
provides for the issuance of securities to the
same amount. The securities of the Central
Veomont were flot very valuable et the time
of the receiversbip, but the-re was a new issue.
Securities of the new issue, of the par value
of $8,609,000, will 'be plaoed in the hands of
the Minister of Fin ance of Canada; and as
these become more valuable he cen dispose
of them and Lise the funds obteined therefrom to reduce the amount of Canýadien

National, of roiughly $11,000,000, the difference
between 827,000,000 andI 838,000,000-both in
round figures. This deficit was due ta the
feilure of arrangements between the Grand
Trunk and the Central Vermont, or ta the
non-reelizetion of the hopes that had been
enterta-ine.d. For exemple, as I pointed out
yesterday, there was a loan of 88,603,170.18 ta
the Central Vermont for the construction of
what is callesI the Southern New Englend,
wbich was neyer built. If that loan had not
been made, it would probebly have been unnecessery to issue new securities to-day.
H.on. Mr. CURRY: What was donc with
thet money?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That money
was expended in buying right-of-way and in
doing preliminery work. Yesterday. the
honoureble leader of the Government in this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), speaking from
memory, said he thought there were legal
actions and other troubles et the time the
Grand Trunk abandoned the construction of
that line. After the Canadien National came
into control it wes decided, and I think
rightly so, to meke fia further expenditure of
money on the proposed Southern New England
roed. As I pointed out yesterdey, when 1 was
Minister of Railweys I wes opposed ta proceeding further towards the securing of a
new ocean terminal outside Canada.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: That

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Most of thet

$ENATE
for the last year of operation there was a
balance in the other column. The heads of
the Canadian National Railways are firmly of
the belief that the road, under its new management, will be a paying proposition for the
Canadian National. When the receivership
came into effect and the Canadian National
got the entire stock of the Central Vermont,
the road was continued under its former
management. Now, for the first time, it is
fully under the control of the Canadian
National, although the company is legally
established in the State of Vermont. As I
have pointed out, $8,609,000 of the new 5
per cent bonds of the Central Vermont have
been placed in the hands of the Finance
Minister as security, in so far as they .are
security, for the issuance of new bonds by the
Canadian National Railways, guaranteed by
the Government.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What are the figures of the last year's operations-the receipts and expenditures?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have not the

during the last year.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It

taken fron the hands of the receiver just a few
months ago.

GRAIN BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 12, an Act respecting grain--Hon. Mr.
Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members of the
Senate, this is mainly a consolidation of the
Grain Act. At varions times we have made
more or less important amendments to the
statute, and it is thought opportune at this
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

time to consolidate it. The Bill was referred
to a committee of the House of Commons,
and representatives of the grain trade followed
the work of the committee very closely. This
measure contains few amendments.
There
are, however, one or two changes to which
I should like to refer.
Under the Grain Act as it stands at present
on the Statute Book, licenses were granted
to elevators on certain conditions. According
to some legal authorities, there was some
doubt as to the constitutional right of the
Dominion to enforce those conditions. The
Bill prohibits railway and other transportation companies from carrying grain to or from
elevators which have no license from the
Board of Grain Commissioners; and inasmuch
as we have authority over those transportation companies, it is held that this provision
will materially strengthen our Act in this
respect.
By last year's amendments the terminal
elevators and mixing houses were prohibited
from lowering the grade by mixing to the
minimum of the grade, and were obliged to
inaintain a new export standard known as the
75-25 per cent sample. Under this new rule
No. 2 grade, for instance, stood at 371 above
the bottom of that grade. No mixing whatever is allowed in No. 1 Hard, No. 1 Northern,
No. 2 Northern and No. 3 Northern. I am
not quite sure that this is net an amendment
of the Act passed last year.
These are the principal features to which I
deeni it proper to draw the Senate's attention. With the leave of the House, I move
the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I think it is extremely unfortunate that legislation se important as this Bill should be
brought down at this stage of the session.
Surely some arrangement could be made
whereby measures of this nature could be sent
over to us at an carlier stage. The Bill relates
to the transportation and the general handling of grain and is very important, particularly
to Western Canada. I am pleased that the
Act has been consolidated, for I think the
consolidation will be a convenience to the
public generally.
But, I repeat, it is unfortinte that this Chamber is not given time
to consider properly the various changes that
are made in this Act from year to year. The
present Bill will go through practically without any consideration at all by the Senate.

year, and that further amendments will be
necessary. Some changes were made last year.
The one in regard to mixing was made then,
and apparently it bas given satisfaction, although some dire prophecies were made as to
what would happen if the amendment were
put into force. I think one of the most beneficial changes which have taken place is the
absolute confidence the farmers and grain
dealers have in the new Board of Grain Commissioners, and the general feeling that things
will go along satisfactorily in future. As a
Western man, greatly interested in the marketing of grain, I am quite prepared to accept the
Bill on trust, after the thorough examination
it has had by the committee of the other
House.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: If, in accordance with
the honourable gentleman's argument, we

practically nothing more nor less than a rubber stamp. If important changes are to be
made in this Act in the future, I would urge
upon the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that the proposed amendments be brought before this
Chamber earlier in the session, se that we
may be able to give them proper consideratien. We are as much interested as the other
House in having a good Grain Act.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a suggestion that perhaps honourable members

of the other House? I do net know what
powers such a committee of the Senate would
have. At all events, that is a suggestion that
honourable members may find worth consideration. This Bill was given third reading in another place yesterday or this morning, and it bas now reached us. We must
decide what we will do with it. I have often
felt that important legislation should net be
brought to us at the tail end of the session.

My reason for putting the question is this
As I understand it, the British North America Act was a contract entered into by the
various provinces, and I have heard it stated
at different times that it can be amended
only with the consent of all the provinces that
entered into it. If this is true, the amendments now proposed would require the consent, not only of the provinces particularly
interested in this case, but of all the provinces. My information may not be correct,
but I should like to have the opinion of the
honourable leader of the Government on this
point before the resolution is passed.

And Whereas subsequently to the execution
of the agreement with the Province of Alberta
it was agreed that in addition to the rights
accruing thereunder to the Province, it should
be entitled to such further rights, if any, with
respect to the subject matter of the said agreement as were required to be vested in the
Province in order that it might enjoy rights

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My recollection
does not go further than I have just stated. I
may remind my honourable friends that the
four Western Provinces are receiving some
material advantage through these agreements,
and that the three provinces of the East are
also securing benefits that did not necessarily
flow from the letter of the pact of 1867; so
there remain but the two provinces, Ontario
and Quebec, that might claim to be entitled
to consideration and whose approval might
be asked. Al I can say is that at least three
or four representatives of Quebec and as many
from Ontario were present at that conference
and were agreeable to the policy embodied in
this resolution, which is based upon the Bills
passed by the Senate.
Right Hon. Sir 'GEORGE E. POSTER:
Honourable members, it strikes me that the
question put by my honourable friend from
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donneilly) is a rather important one. No discussion ever took place
in the other Chamber, or outside of it, so far
as my knowledge goes, that did not assume
that the articles of Confederation were agreed
to only after much negotiation, and that they
became in reality a compact between the
partners in Confederation. The partners
originally were four in number, but other
provinces have since been added, and have
become jointly interested with the original
partners. I am not lawyer enough to know
whether, technially, the four provinces that
united in 1867 are of themselves sufficient to
consent to a change being made, and I imagine
that my honourable friend who leads the Government is not quite in a position to say-in
fact, he has intimated that he is not-whether four are sufficient or all are required; or
whether, if the consent of all is required, all
the provinces have virtually consented to the
matter in hand.
It is a grave undertaking to amend a
constitution resulting from an antecedent set
of circumstances such as those of Confederation. We may as well admit that this will
not be the last attempt made to amend the
Constitution. This is a step that may be
followed by others. I would suggest that as
the matter is so important, and as we must
stan -a little for our dignity as a Chamber
and for the position of the provinces as members of the Confederacy, this resolution should
be allowed to stand over until a later sitting,
so that we may at least have time to read
over the resolution and think about what it
means, and, perhaps, to amplify our knowledge a little by an understanding of what
took place in the other Chamber and resulted
in the passing of this resolution. I would
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

suggest also that my honourable friend
should in the meantime take this question,
which is not an unimportant one, to the law
officers of the Government and secure from
thom a statement in regard to it. I think
it would be safer and more dignified to
dispose of such a very important subject in
that way than to rush it through with a turn
of the hand.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
Honourable
members, the inquiry that bas been made is
an eminently proper one. The provinces that
followed the four original provinces into
Confederation came in, unquestionably, under
the same terms and conditions that applied
to the former. They would have the same
rights and the same obligations. When the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
raised the question, I asked myself whether
this would be the proper forum in which to
inquire into the matter of the consent of the
other provinces. If the consent of the other
provinces is essential to the consideration and
adoption of a measure by the Imperial Parliament, I ask, would not the submission of
the measure be the occasion for that Parliament, if it were so disposed, to ask to be
advised as to whether or not such consent
had been given?
It seems to me-I am
thinking aloud--that we should pass these
measures on the assumption that if anything
further is required in order to justify their
adoption by the Imperial Parliament, it will
he for that Parliament to make a requisition.
I do not know that we can refuse approval
of the resolution because of the point raised
by my honourable friend, although I readily
confess that it is a very serious one.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honoumeble
members, I do not think that we should
deliberately put the Imperial Parliament in
the position of haxving to go behintd an Address
of both Houses of this Parliament to ascertain whether or not we have proceeded in
accordance with our understanding of our own
constitution.
I agree that the question is
important and that we should endeavour to
satisfy ourselves as to the law on the subject.
On the other hand, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that there bas
been a discussion upon this matter for a
great many years. This year it has been
brought to a head.
The four Legislative
Assemblies have been called upon to approve
the agreements entered into with the Governments of the Dominion, and both Houses
of Parliament have also been asked to sanction the agreements.
Much depends upon
these Bills passing this year. The resources
have to be transferred. A building is being

iromn what I said that there was any disposition ta, hold up the legisiation. It is nat a
hold-up ta proceed stop by step, and ta leave

Provinces. As this resolution is based on an
arrangement. made between the Federal Government and the Gavernments ai the four
Western Provinces, it seems ta me that a
protest against it could ýcame oniy from. any
af the other five provinces. As my honour(Hon. Mr.
able fricnd fram Edmonton

looking farward ta the transfer ai the natural
resoui-rces. The Western Provinces are being
given only the saine right that the older
provinces reccived undier the British North

natural resources and the public domain. I

ilonourable
Hon. Nlr. DANDURAND:
senators, I woffld draw the attention ai my
right hon-affable friend the junior membher for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
ta the fart that this resolution is but a cenisequential ane. During this session we have
approvcd of the agreements that were etered
ino hetween the Dominion and the four

M

Western Provinces. That having been done,
it gocs without saying that the next step must
be a request to the Imperial Parliament to
amend aur Constitution in accordance with
these agreements, in order that they may be
fully iegalized.
I have no objection whatever to the postponement of the motion for adoption of the
resolution until to-morrow. But wîth respect
to the statement made by my right honourable friend (Right lion. Sir George E. Foster)
that perhaps the legal advisers of the Justice Department or af Parliament should be
asked about aur right to proreed as we have
been doing, without consulting the other five
provinces, my impression is that there is nc
irgai basis for the view that we should con.
suit the other provinces, but that it is a question of policy for this Parliament to determine
under what conditions it will by resolution
ask the Imperial Parliament ta amend aur
Constitution. It has been contended in this
Chamber that no amendment should be made
ta the Constitution without the consent of the
provinces. I remember that on one occasion
when this subjeat was being discussed 1
wondcred whether the consent should be ob.
tained' from the original provinces of Confediera.tion or fromn the whole nine. I have
neyer heard it affirmed that there was anything in the Constitution which bound this
Parliament ta ohtain consent fromn the Legislatures for the arnendment of the Constitution.
As my riglit honourable friend knows, the
Dominion Parliament has more than once had
tbe Constitution amended without referring
the miatter ta any province; but such amendments did not affect vital interests ai the
provinces, so far as their iurisdiction was conceroed.
However, 1 believe that the Parliament of
Canada would be goin.- beyond the spirit of
the agreainent of 1866 if it undertook to
trespass upon the priviieges which were given
ta the provinces that originally eiitered iinto
the compact. Parliament is but thc creature
of the provinces. Oid Canada. New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia, at the time oi their union,
agreed ta delegate some powers to Federai
autbarity, but they had the first and the
last word as ta what powers should be delegated. I doubt very much that we would
iindertake ta sernd to the Imperial Parliament

SENATE

among the three great naval powers signing
the agreement, there is in it the beginning of
an understanding that I am sure wili bear
fruit in the future. I have heard Americans
in authority and technical experts in London
who were interested in maintaining a certain
status on the seas disclaim and deny any
desire on the part of one nation to build as
against the other, but at the same time admit
that the nations were competing against one
another in naval construction. This I take
to be a euphemism. I am convinced that we
have now started a program of reduction that
will progress as years roll by.
I do not know that I need give this Chamber a statement explaining what this agreement means, for we have all read of the conclusions reached by the conference, but I am
going to place on record a few facts as to
the results attained.
There has been proclaimed a holiday in
battleship construction till 1936. The signatory
powers renounce their right to replace 32
capital ships aggregating 1,470,000 tons. They
have agreed that within eighteen months they
will scrap nine b.attleships which under the
Washington Treaty might have been retained
until 1936. This means that within eighteen
months there will be scrapped by Gredt Britain
5 battlcships, by the United States 3, and by
Japan 1. They have agreed to a limitation
of the displacement and the gun calibre of
submarines, and to rules restricting the use of
submarines against merchant ships in time of
war. They have agreed to a limitation of aircraft carriers, by the extension of the Washington definition to include in this category
vessels under 10,000 tons, and bv the reduction
of the gun calibre permilted.

Rules have been

adopted for the replacement and the scraipping
of ships. A list of exempt and special vessels
has been agreed on. Special vessels are net
to be replaced, but are to be allowed to die
out as a separate type.
The second part of the treaty seems to be
even more important than the first part, of
which I have just given an outtine. It consists of an agreement between the British
Commonwealth of Nations, Japan and the
United States as to tonnage levels, and programmes for erui-ers, dstroyers xnd sibmarines. This means that there will be a
reduction, and it represents the solution of
difficulties that were impossible of solution
at Geneva in 1927. The ratio allowed each

will have 52,700 tons.
Italy and France were unable to settle their
mutual difficulties as to ratios in time to
participate in the agreement, but they are
still working at the problem, and it is hoped
that the three-power agreement will soon become a five-power agreement.
In view of the fact that there was no
agreement between France and Italy, there
was introduced at the last moment what has
been called the "Safeguarding Clause." Under
this clause the figures which I have given
may be exceeded in case the building programme of a power outside the agreement
threatens the security of any one of the three
powers that are parties to it. It is agreed
that this clause shall be used only as a last
resort.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
France only?

That applies to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
France and
Ital.
It covers the possibility of a large
building programme being carried on by
either of those powers.
I need not dwell upon the difficulties that
arose between France and Italy. Italy never
gave figures of the requiremeents for her own
protection, but simply affirmed the principle
that she should hve as large a tonnage as
the strongest nival power on the continent
of Europe-which meant France. France denmurred at that contention, claiming that as
she had possessions far renoved from the
Mediterranean she could net accept parity
with Italy. A sonewhat lengthy discussion

sultation in this case. Honourable members
are aware of the correspondence that was exchanged between Washington and London
when that question arose. France then suggested that Great Britain, which has important
interests in the Mediterranean, should enter
into an agreement similar to that signed at
Locarno, by which she would act as umpire
or arbitrator in case the peace of the Mediterranean were threatened. This has not been accepted as a solution; but France and Italy,
under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister
or the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Great
Britain, will continue their discussion, and
possibly a solution to their difficulty may be
found.
I think I said that the results were not
all that could be hoped for, or that were hoped
for at the opening of the negotiations. Notwithstanding that, a great step forward has
been taken. The results arrived at are supplementary to the work that was donc at Washington. The difficulties that caused the deadlock at Geneva have been removed, and the
work of the League Disarmament Commission
has been made casier. But the conference
recognized that it had not finished its programme. It merely adjourned, after progress
had been made, and the good work of removing difficulties and bringing the five powers
into a general agreement is still going on.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has referred to
most of the salient points in connection witli
the conference. He emphasized the thought
that a distinct advance has been made. In
that I consider he is absolutely justified. Even
those who give most thought to the promotion
of peace often find it difficult to appreciate
fully the problems that confront a number
of nations which are endeavouring to come to
an agreement, there are so many considerations drawing in different directions, so many
economic, financial, commercial and racial
issues that have to be settled before final
conclusions can be reached.
I think it should be said here that crities
of the stand taken by the American Government ought not to lose sight of the fact that
since the Washington Conference of 1921-1922
thc United States has not built up to the
limits which were set for her by that confer-

341

ence. When she claims the right to build at
the present time in order to come up to those
limits, it is apt to create the impression that
she is being unreasonable. But we must take
into consideration the fact that for a number
of years she was not increasing her naval
forces to the fullest permissible extent.
I think the greatest benefit that has come
out of the London parley has been the immense impetus that it has given to the
thought and consequent action of the world
at large upon the question of disarmament.
The world was given the spectacle of five of
the greatest powers, on the initiative of two
of the strongest of them, sending their
most representative diplomats, statesmen and
technical advisers to a conference and keeping them there for many weeks in an effort to
reach an agreement which would have the
result, among other things, of lightening the
financial burdens of the nations represented
and of setting free vast resources for development along more modern lines. Thinking
people all over the world had brought to their
minds the importance of the questions that
were being discussed at the conference. It
was apparent to everyone who followed the
proceedings that the representatives of the
five nations were honest and purposeful in
their desire to improve the conditions for the
peace of the world and to lessen the heavy
burdens that come from war. That intimate
relationship among the international representatives during those months in London,
where the frankest expressions were used,
where the positions of the different powers
were openly explained in a way that can
only be commended in the highest degree, has
had the effect of bringing about a better
understanding among all nations and a sympathetie desire to co-operate one with the
other along similar -ines, from which we may
expect great results in the future. I want to
emphasize that side of the question.
After all, the watchwords of to-day are
conference and co-operation. First there must
be conference-the getting together, the
avowal of the different positions, the discussion with good purpose and good-will of the
different points of view; and over and under
all there must be a dominating desire to improve the peaceful relations of all states, and
a co-operative renunciation of war. I do
think we have passed out of the area of possible great wars. As I think of science, of the
economic and financial interests that are interrelated all over the earth, of the desire of the
human heart in every clime and country for
peace, and for release from the tyranny and

SENATE
cruelty of war, I cannot believe that there will
be another great war in the future. Rather I
sec that the time is surely coming when international disagreements shall be settled by
justice and by peaceful methods of conciliation and arbitration, and when the cruel
arbitrament of war shall have passed away
for ever.
In a discussion this afternoon, short but
pregnant, my honourable friend fro-m Regina
(Hon. Mr. Laird) put before this Chamber
a few figures which were astounding, even te
me, illustrative of the debt entailed by war
upon human resources and happiness. All those
millions upon millions of dollars of debt,
which will have te be paid by generations te
come, were incurred in order that disputes
might be settled which could have been concluded peacefully had there been at the time
an organization such as we have to-day, with
the sentiment that nov lies bahind it, for
the abandonment of war. I think we all
should be encouraged te be more hopeful
and te adopt a mental attitude in line with
the settlement of international disputes by
peaceful means. In that attitude we should
not be merely passive; rather we should endeavour te make it effective through our contact with others, and thus render valuable
service in the great cause. After all, it will
be only when we get public opinion lined up
in support of peaceful metihods of international settlement, when the muost powerful
sections of humanity have shown their desire for such methods and the determination
to push their desire to the utmost possible
limit, that there will bc certainty of realizing the objective. We who are sitting here
will never sec the full accomplishment of
the great purpose towards which we are now
working; but generation after generation will
progress on the onward and upward path until
humanâty does reach the goal for which it
prays and for the achievement of which I
believe it is now ready to organize and te act.
The motion was agreed te.

HALIBUT CONVENTION
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the following resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Convention between Canada and

the United States for the preservation of the
Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacifie Ocean
and Bering Sea, Ottawa, 9th May, 1930, signed
in respect of the Dominion of Canada by the
plenipotentiary named therein, and that this
House do approve of the same.
He said: The following ara the facts and
reasons which explain and juîtify the convention which is now before this Chamber. While
the annual total catch of halibut by the Canadian and United States fleets is being maintained at about 55,000,000 pounds per annum,
such is possible only by constantly increasing
intensity of fishing and extension of the fishery
farther west. The fishery had its inception
off Cape Flatteryv, at the entrance to Juan de
Fuca Strait, in 1888. It was rapidlv extended
northwards, the best fishing grounds being
found in Hecate Strait. These also produced
the finest quality of halibut. By 1910 the fishery had extended as far north as Cape
Ommaney, southwestern Alaska, about 600
miles north of Juan de Fuca Strait. It has
now been extended te more than 1,200 miles
farther west te beyond the Shumagin Islands,
but no more fish are being taken on the 1,800
miles of coast than were being caught on the
600 miles in the earlier days of the fishery.
Also, the catch on the older grounds, south of
Cape Ommaney, has. decreased from over
50,000,000 pounds in 1910 te about 20,000,000
pounds. Moreover, to make this diminished
catch, much more intensive fishing is necessary.
For instance, a unit of gear that on the older
grounds would catch 300 pounds of fish in a
given time now catches less than 50 pounds.
In the light of these facts, it was evident
that if something were not done te control the
situation, the commercial exhaustion of this
great fishery was in sight. It was this fact
that brought about the Halibut Treaty of
March 2, 1923. This treaty embraced two main
provisions:
1. An annual close time of three months
extending from November 16 te February 15

MAY 28, 1930
following, both days inclusive, to last for ai
least threo seasons, after which it might ho
cbanged by special agreement.
2. The appointment of a Commission to
make a thorough investigation into the ife
history of the halibut and to submit recommendations as to the regulation of the fishery
that seem necessary for its preservation and
development.
The Commission reported at the end of the
throe-year period, the substance of its recoinmendations being:
(a) That the annual close time should be
extended so as to begin November 1 in each
year, and that authority should be given for
further changes as experience might show to
ho necessary, by authority of the two Governmonts.
This change is favoured by the whole industry. It is during November that the losses
of if e and vossels that are experienced usually
occur. Also, much fishing equipment is lost
thon, this loss of equiprnent resulting in the
destruction of all the fish that may become
caught on it.
(b) That authority ho given the two
Governmonts to regulate the fishery by dividing the treaty waters into areas and fixing a
maximum quantity of flsh that may bo taken
yearly in each area. When such quantity of
fish is caught, fishing therein by ail must cease
The licensing of vessels is essential to carrying
this out, and to facilitating the obtaining of
statistical information.
No objection to this proposed regulation has
been made by Canadian interests. The proposai is, for the start, te have only two areas.
(c) The closing of certain coinparatively
smaîl areas that are found to ho nurseries for
immature flsh. Two are proposed to start
with, one being off the coast of Alaska and the
other off Massett, Queen Charlotte Islands.
(d) That power ho given the two Governmonts to prohibit the use of fishing gear that
mnay ho found to ho unduly destructive.
Tho recuiimsndations of the Commission
were approved by both Governments, but it
is necessary to modify the troaty to enable
them to ho put into effect.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I prosume it
is the intention of the honourable the leader
te have this resolution referred to the Comrnittoe of the Whole. There are, I believe,
many details, which some members want to
discuss.
I confess that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it was not my intention to have it so referred,
because this is a resolution for the approval

343

of a convention, and, though it may be discussed frorn many angles, it can bardly ho
amended. Amendment would moan practically
the rejection of the convention, which has
been signed by the plenipotentiaries of both
countries. However, if it is donc for the purpose of facilitating discussion, I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I propose it
merely for that purpose. I have no reason to
think that anybody intends to move for the
rejection or alteration of the treaty. If we
do nlot go into Committee there cannot ho the
same freedom of discussion.
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Sonate went into Committoe on the resolittion.
Hon. iMr. Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Sonate, I would ask Mr. Found, Deputy
Minister of Fisheries, to corne to the floor
of the House.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable members, there is some anxiety in the Province
of British Columbia, from which I corne, as
te the dLispoqition of our fisheries by the
series of treaties that are being made with
the United States. The fisheries of British
Columbia, which amount to about fifty per
cent of the fisheries in the whole of Canada,
corne nder three principal headings: sock-eye
salmon, hs.libut, and seal. We find that the
Government of Canada, who are responsible
for the admrinistration of the fisheries, have
practically abdicato.d, so f ar as these three
principal sources of fisheries wea.lth on the
Paciflo are concerned. I repeat, the value
of the British Columbia fisheries is about
fifty per cent of the total value of fish caught
in the whx>le Dominion. Yet the control of
these British Colurnbia fisheries is being gi'ven
away; it is being transferred as a gif t to our
American neighboura. This Bill having been
put into committee, I presumne the treaty
will ho read, so that, without needless repetition, we may get detailed information as to
the progress made so far by the Commission.
I understood from the memnorandum. prosente'd by the leader of the House a few
moments ago that the present Commission
made a report at the end of the three-year
period. That would make 1926 t.he date of
the report. It appears that action is being
taken for the first tîme now, in 1930, on a
report made by the Commission in 1926. I
arn ail the more inc'lined to helieve that this

344

SENATE

extraordinary state of affairs does exist because I read in the annual report of the
Department of Marine and Fisheries last year,
or the year before, a complaint from the
Halibut Commission, that while they had
made certain recommendations to the Dominion Government looking to just such an
enlargement of their powers as is proposed
now, no action had been taken by the Government.

It cannot be too strongly emphasized that
the halibut are actualy disappearing. It is
not a matter of apeculation or theory that
each year the halibut fishery is being destroyed.
We are diminishing our capital
in the British Columbia waters and making
it more difficult, if net impossible, to restore
it within the present generation.
I should like to be informed what becomes
of the reports that the Commission make -from
time to time. They do net appear to get
before the publie. I have before me the latest
report published by the Department of Marine
and Fisheries, for the year 1928-29. In it
there is only one page devoted to the International Halibut Commission. We are told,
by way, I presume, of a summary of the work
of six years, that this Commis-,ion has laid
what it believes to be a secure foundation for
carrying on adequate future observation. I
1Cave it to honourable gentlemen who are
faumiliar with conditions in British Columbia
to say whether all we have a right to expect
from an International Commission in existence six years is a set of figures.
W'e are told a little further on in the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think the
honourable gentleman is in error. This treaty
vas confirmed in November, 1924; so the
three-year period would bring us practicaly
into 1928; not 1926.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I stand corrected to
that extent. The treaty was made in 1923,
and the honourable gentleman said that there
was a report at the end of the three-year
period. My primitive arithmetic would indicate that the end of that three-year period
was in 1926.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The treaty was
confirmed in November, 1924, and the report
was submitted in the fIall of 1927.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: But the fact remains
that a year or two ago the Halibut Commission complained that their report to the Dominion Government, asking for such enlargement of powers as is proposed now, had not
been acted upon. Action has been taken only
after the lapse of two years. I find in this
treaty a provision that the Halibut Commission arc to report from time to time. That,
of course, is very indefinite. It is not as if
they were engaged in a work in which time is
of no importance. The facts are that for
several years past, and before the appointment of this Commission, the halibut on the
banks of British Columbia have been in
danger of absolufte extinction; that the bulk
of the fisa that are caught there have not
spawned; that halibut are not permitted to
remain on the banks long enough to reproduce
themselves, and that our capital has been
diminishing by enormous strides year by year.
Side by side with this situation is the fact
that the Halibut Commission, which this
Parliament hoped would take quick action
with a view to obviating these appalling conditions, have been prevented from doing any
real good because of the inertia of the Department of Marine and Fisheries. According to
the statement of the honourable leader of this
House, it is more than two years ago that
the Department received the recommendations
for the taking of precautionary measures such
as set out in article 3 of the treaty now before
Us.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

report:

It has been shown that the stock on the
banks. particularly in British Columbia waters,
ts relatively stable, but this stock in British
Coinnbia waters is largely immature and it
lias been found that the more mature lialibut
population in the gulf of Alaska is more
migratory.

As the report says, the halibut on the
British Columbia banks are largely immature.
Yet the Government allow the waters to be
filshed, notwithstanding that every netful of
halibut that is caught diminishes the possible
chances of ever bringing about more satisfactory conditions.
Another significant paragraph in the report:
In connection with this phase of the work
it would seem that the migration of those fish
which are of a size suitable for the commercial
fishery is of primary importance. It is by the
depletion of those sizes that the ill-effects on
the fishery bave been produced. It follows that
action to conserve the different stocks in these
areas, so that each such stock will yield its
quota of eggs, should serve the immediate purpose of conservation.
We are also told in the report:
Vith a view to determining thei relative
amount of spawn, and to make sure that
spawniers were actually absent from British
Columbia watersThat is what I have said, that spawners
have ceased to frequcent the banks of British
Columbia. That is confirmed in this official
report by these words, which I will repeat:
-

and to nake suire that spawners were actually

absent from British Columbia waters. where it
had been impossible to find any considerable

MAY 28, 1930
stock of spawning fish, a series of hauls with
silk plankton nets were made in these waters,
where the persistence of the fishery bas seemingly been due to extensive drift of eggs and
larvae.
I have spoken several times in this House,
even though it was tilting against a windmill,
of the absolute necessity of organizing a
Department of Fisheries at Ottawa under a
responsible Minister. I have always entertained the hope that with a responsible
Minister in charge we should be able to get
some results from the efforts of all the commissions which, in the absence of Government,
have been in control of British Columbia
fisheries. This year the estimates that were
brought down in another place contained an
item for the salary of a Minister for a separate
Department of Fisheries. There have been
various reports as to how it is intended to fill
the position. One report says that a distinguished scientist will be the new Minister, and
on the other hand it is stated that possibly a
politician of the Maritime Provinces, equally
distinguished, will get the appointment. But
we have seen no indication that it is intended
that the new department shall take a businesslike attitude towards the British Columbia
fisheries.
It may perhaps be said that investigation
by the distinguished scientist who has been
named as the probable Minister would likely
be productive of results. What is the record?
Since the inception of the Halibut Commission,
until a recent period, it has had a distinguished
scientist making reports on the life and habits
of halibut. Prior to the time the Commission
engaged his services and made them the main
feature of their operations, that gentleman,
who is a real authority on the subject, had
already put into print, on the records of the
British Columbia Government, a complete
story of his observations on the habits of
halibut and a statement of the steps that were
necessary in his opinion to prevent the extinction of the industry. That report was made
by him to the British Columbia Government
nearly twenty-five years ago. Not only did
this gentleman make official reports to the
Provincial Government, but he was so
impressed with the necessity of arousing
national attention to the present state of the
halibut fishery that he delivered before the
Royal Society of Canada an elaborate paper,
which was discussed by men of culture and
scientific training who are members of that
society. Yet we find that during the six years
the Halibut Commission bas been in existence
it bas confined its activities to securing from
this distinguished scientist a repetition of the
reports that he made to the Government of

British Columbia and to the Royal Society of
Canada, and nothing has been done with his
recommendations. There has been no other
action whatever.
We spend on the International Halibut Commission $36,000 a year, a sum which is trifling
in comparison with the value of the industry.
Although far less than one-half the quantity
of halibut that is brought into Prince Rupert
is brought by Canadians, the industry produces for Canada annually about $3,000,000.
The annual value is steadily declining, while
the catch is being secured at higher cost. A
few years ago a fisherman went out only one
hundred miles from land, but now it is
necessary to go a distance of about twelve
hundred miles in order to find new banks to
exploit. So little interested are we in the
Commission on which we spend $36,000 a year
that the names of the commissioners are not
printed in the annual report of the Department. One would think that the departmental
report would contain a statement signed by
the commissioners; that is, if they report to
the Department. In the latest annual report
of the Department of Marine and Fisheries,
for the year 1928-1929, according to the index,
there is no reference whatever to halibut or
the Halibut Commission, except a single page
written by the Deputy Minister, from which
I have read extracts.
Some two or three years ago I saw a report
from the Halibut Commission. But why have
they been silent since? Is it because they
have been discouraged by the Government?
The impression that I have got is that the
Commission were anxious to render really
worth-while service, but the Government, for
want of a responsible Minister of Fisheries,
have allowed the industry to be gradually
ruined.
I do not desire to discuss in detail the
Salmon Treaty, which will no doubt be presented to us, but I should like to say. that
under it we are giving up Federal control of
the salmon industry to a Commission on which
the Americans have equal .representation.
That control will be taken out of the hands
of Parliament, as was done in connection with
seals. We made a treaty for ten years to give
Americans the exclusive control of the seal
fishery. What bas happened? It is fourteen
years since the treaty was made, but the
Government apparently have taken no action
to protect the industry. As any honourable
member may discover by going into the
Library and reading the reports of the United
States Department of Trade and Commerce,
the American seal herds have increased, notwithstanding the extensive killing, to the extent of well over a million dollars for the

SENATE
American people, Although we are supposed
to have a fixed interest in the seals, we
get only a small proportion-I think it is
one-fifth-of the value of the seals killed,
which in the year covered by.the report in my
hands came to only $73,000. What did the
Department of Marine and ,Fisheries report
concerning the seals? There are in this report
of about 300 pages but five words chronicling
the fact that our rake-off from Washington on
the seals was S73,000.
Would anyone be surprised that there
should prevail in British Columbia the feeling
that our fisheries, constituting half of the
entire fisheries of Canada in value, are not
receiving proper attention?
If I am permitted, I shall ask, for certain specific *nformation later. That is all I have to say
at present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From the remarks of my honourable friend I gather that
his indictment of the Department is based
on its alleged dilatoriness. It does not seem
to me that I can draw the conclusion that
the honourable gentleman is opposed to this
convention.
Hion. Mr. TAYLOR: No, certainly not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then it is a
quesion concerning the Department's administration of the important fisheries on the
Pacific coast.
I want to say that for a number of years
I was in the same state of mind as my honourable friend. I remelmber meeting the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) in London
about twenty years ago and telling him of
impressions I had gathered during my first
twenty-five years' experience in public affairs.
From 1878 to 1896 my party was in opposition,
and I spent those eighteen years in criticizing
the Conservative administration or listening
to criticism--pretty severe at times-of its
actions. I had really come to believe that I
came of a better elay. To my mind there
was some inferiority in the Tory party, for
I had never heard a good word uttered in
their favour in ny vicinity, nor read it in the
press.
I was telling my right honourable
friend that after ten years of Liberal administration I was beginning to regard with more
consideration and esteein my political opponents, who had borne the responsibility of
office during the previous eighteen years. My
honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Taylor), if I am not mistaken, is
a journalist, and has had a very brilliant
career as such in the East as well as in the
West. His mind is probably biased, as mine
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

was during the eighteen years I have referred
to, and he is critical.
Criticisn is vern much casier than action.
My honourable friend conp.lains of dilatoriness in the administration of the treaty and
thinks that we have been negligent of the
interests of Canada in this respect; but he
must not lose sight of the fact that these
fisheries are on the high seas and do not
belong exchisivelv to Canada. He must remember that citizens of the United States
have the right to fish in these areas and that
consequently, if something has to be donc in
connection with the contirol of these fisheries,
it can be done only by the joint action of
the Goveiniment of this country and the Government of the United States. J do not think
the present Government of Canada can be
accused of subserviency to Washington in
entering into an agreement with the United
States for the purpose of protecting these
fisheries. As to the delays of which my honourable friend complains, if he were absobitely au fait he would probably recognize
that they are due to dilatoriness on the part
of the United States. Very often during my
occuipancy of my present position I have
found unon meeting officials of various departments, in committee, that suspicions and
criticisms were groundiless.
As the subjeet
now under consideration is a very broad
and irnportant one. I would suggest to mv
honourable friend that next session we can
take steps to investigate the operations of
the Fisheries Department; and I am convinced that when we meet face to face the
men who are responsible for the administration of 'this Department we shall judge them
less severely than my honourable friend has
done.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I understood that we
were to have an opportunity of getting some
information about several proposals. I would
ask, for instance, what bas been done under
article 4 of the treatv.
The High Contracting Parties agree to enact
and enforce such legislation as may be necessary to imakýe effective the provisions of this
Convention and any regulation adopted thereioder. witi appropriate penalties for violations thereof.
Lias that been done? And if so, how and
where may we find it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In 13-14 George
V, Chapter 61, an Act for the Protection of
the Northern Pacifie Halibut Fishery.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: That provides
regulations and the penalties, does it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

the

MAY 28, 1930

Je'

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Have there been any
prosecutions under that? Have there been
any violations?

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Could the honourable
gentleman tell us the names of the commissioners?

No, there have

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The commissioners are Mr. John P. Babcock, Chairman;
William A. Found, Miller Freeman and Henry
O'Malley. I am surprised that my honourable
friend has not the report of the International
Fisheries Commission appointed under the
Northern Halibut Treaty, which report bears
the signatures of those gentlemen.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
been none.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: None have been observed. Then there is another provision here.
I should like to ask whether this is new, and,
if it is not new, how it has operated in the
past. It is:
It is understood that nothing contained in
this convention shall prohibit the nationals or
inhabitants or the fishing vessels or boats of
the Dominion of Canada or of the United
States of America. from fishing in the waters
hereinbefore specified for other species of fish
during the season when fishing for halibut in
such waters is prohibited by this Convention
or by any regulations adopted in pursuance of
its provisions. Any halibut that may be taken
incidentally when fishing for other fish during
the season when fishing for halibut is prohibited under the provisions of this Convention
or by any regulations adopted in pursuance of
its provisions may be retained and used for
food for the crew of the vessel by which they
are taken. Any portion thereof not so used
shall be landed and immediately turned over to
the duly authorized officers of the Department
of Marine and Fisheries of the Dominion of
Canada or of the Department of Commerce of
the United States of America. Any fish turned
over to such officers in pursuance of the provisions of this article shall be sold by them to
the highest bidder and the proceeds of such
sale, exclusive of the necessary expenses in connection therewith, shall be paid by them into
the treasuries of their respective countries.
Was this in the old convention?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, that was
a part of the old convention.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: How has it operated?
How much has been received from the sale?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There were but
one or two boats seized during the closed
season. The proceeds did not represent anything of importance. I am informed that the
whole industry makes a very special effort to
respect that clause of the treaty.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Another section, then,
has been a dead letter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If laws are dead
letters because they are not violated.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Can the honourable
gentleman tell us how this Halibut Commission operates, what time the commissioners
spend on their job, and how they go about it?
I have a hazy idea of that, but I should not
like to state it authoritatively.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand that
the Commission has a staff of experts who are
working continuously under the direction of
the commissioners.

I was under the
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
impression that those were the commissioners.
I happen to know that Mr. Babcock is virtually the whole of the British Columbia
Department of Fisheries, and is a very busy
officer. Mr. Found, I think, is virtually the
whole of the Department of Fisheries here,
and is also very busy. How they can represent our interests on an International
Halibut Commission having to do with an
entire fishery worth $3,000,000 a year, I cannot understand. I think we should have some
serious representation.
The CommisHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sion is an administrative one. It directs, but
does not go out to investigate. It has a staff
for that purpose. I am glad to bear from
my honourable friend that he realizes that
two of the four commissioners are very busy
departmental officials. On that score, at all
events, they cannot be acused of negligence
in the -discharge of their duty.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I do not accuse the
commissioners of negligence.
Mr. O'Malley
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is the Commissioner of Fisheries of the United
States.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes. Mr. O'Malley
rogularly visits the scene of halibut operations,
and is very adequately represented in Alaska
during his absence. He is anything but an
ornamental commissioner. He is one of the
brightest minds in the United States service.
The other American Commissioner, Mr.
Miller Freeman, of Seattle, is also a frequent
visitor to the scene of operations. I do not
know how much time Mr. Babcock spends
there, but I have seen in the British Columbia
statisties the statement that he receives an
honorarium of $1,000 a year for his services
to the Halibut Fisheries Commission. I leave
it to any honourable gentleman who has to
do with business to say what kind of service
can be expected from a busy officer, situated
2,000 miles from the scene of operations, who

348

SENATE

receives an honorarium of $1,000 a year. I
think we should have better representation
than that with regard to a S3,000,000 industry.
I say this without reflecting on Mr. Babcock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Mr. Babcock is
re,ceiving that from the British Columbia
Government.
Hon Mr. TAYLOR: What is he receiving
from the Federal Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Nothing.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
Then there is no
point in contradicting my contention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Found receive anything.

Nor does Mr.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
Then there is another point about the reports. It is stated
here somewhere that the Commission shall
report from time to time. How often do they
report, and what is done with their reports?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Three of the
reports of the investigators are now in the
press and will soon be ready for distribution.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I take it that that
mcans these reports of statistics?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Reports of
investigation, and on the life history of the
halibut.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I stated, and it has
not been commented upon, that the gentleman who is the chief scientific investigator
had already made two reports on the lýife
history of the halibut before he joined this
Commission. If the Commission have confidence in him, why have they not acted on
his previous reports?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
the reports to which my honourable friend alludes were but preliminary works, and that the
reports he is now making are far more scientific
and accurate.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: But they confirm thé
general statement. For instance, I read here
a sentence from the report of our own Deputy
Minister, which says that spawning fish have
disappeared from the British Columbia banks.
They must have disappeared a long time ago,
for he is dealing with reports that are two or
three years old. What have we done about it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is easy to
make general statements and to conclude that
there has been a depletion of the halibut fisheries, but the minute investigation is necessary
for the purpose of finding a remedy for this
depletion.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I object to the imputation that I have made unreliable statements.
I have read from the report of the Deputy
Minister of Fisheries of this Government. The
only statements I have made as to present
conditions have been made out of this report.
I know as a matter of fact that they are correct, because I have been on the halibut fishery grounds and have talked to people engaged
in the industry, who have told me that conditions are simply shocking. They are amazed
at the inertia of the Government in not dealing with the situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course one
might get such impressions from fishermen individually, but I think that if my honourable
friend desires to inquire directly from respons1ble representatives of the Department he will
have the opportunity of doing so next session.
I think it
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
would be well for us to follow the suggestion
of the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) by referring the
Question to a special committee next session.
The matter is complex to most of us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think that
whenever any honourable member feels that
it would be useful to have a committee to
consider any department, the appointment of
such a committee can ba secured.
The resolution was reported.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for
the adoption of the resolution was agreed to.
AMENDMENTS TO BRITISH NORTH
AMERICA ACT
JOINT ADDRESS TO THE KING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand that the Senate unite with the
House of Commons in an Address to His
Most Excellent Majesty The Ring, praying
that he may graciously be pleased to give his
consent to submitting a measure to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to amend the
British North America Acts. 1867 to 1916.
Hon. R. DIANDURAND:
This debate was
adjourned because of an inquiry made by the
honourable member from South Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly) as to the procedure adopted
by the Federal Government in the transfer
of the natural resources to Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.
The honourable gentleman desired to know
whether it was not necessary to consult the
other five provinces and secure their approval
of the agreements that were made. After

MAY 28, 1930
examining into the Bills that have been passed
by this flouse to authorize the transfer, I
have come to the conclusion that it was not
necessary to consult the other provinces.
At the Dominion-Provincial Conference. held
about two years ago, claims were made on
behalf of all but two provinces, Ontario and
Quebec, for better ternis from the Federal
Government. After the various claims had
been discussed the responsible representatives
of those two great provinces declared that
they had no objection to the Dominion of
Canada giving such treatment as it deemed
fair and proper to the western and the eastern
provinces, and that so far as Ontario and
Quebec were concerned, they would make no
counter claim for compensation as a result
of any benefits that the other provinces received. It was virtually a love feast.
With regard to the question whether any of
the provinces have the right to be consulted
in certain matters affecting the Dominion and
other provinces, I desire to say that in these
present instances there is no necessity for
consultation with the provinces not directly
interested. The Province of Manitoba was
created by Act of the Canadian Parliament
under authority given in section 146 of the
British North America Act. British Columbia
was taken into the Union by virtue of the
same clause. The Parliament of Canada considered that this clause gave it full power to
act as it did with regard to those two provinces. Doubt was expressed in some quarters
as to the right of Parliament to grant a constitution to any of the provinces, particularly to
Manitoba. In order to remove the doubt as
to whether the Parliament of Canada was on
solid constitutional ground in creating the
Province of Manitoba and granting it a constitution, special powers were sought the following year from the Imperial Parliament. The
British North America Act was amended by
an Imperial Act on the 29th of June, 1871.
The amendment conferred upon the Parliament of Canada the right to establish new
provinces in any territories forming for the
time being part of the Dominion of Canada,
but not included in any province thereof. It
also contained a clause confirming the act
of the Canadian Parliament in creating the
Province of Manitoba. The British North
America Act, section 146. and the amendment
of 1871, gave to the Dominion of Canada the
power to constitute and organize provinces.
Under this authority the Federal Government
could have given to Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta the very powers that are now
being handed to them by the measures passed
at this session. Instead of doing this, Parlia-

349

ment retained control over the natural resources of the Western Provinces. Now it is
held that the Parliament of Canada, having
exercised its power to create and organize the
Western Provinces, has no further power to
amend the constitution of the provinces unless
authority is secured from the Imperial Parliament.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman to ask whether the
Acts of the Parliament of Canada creating the
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905
were later approved by the Imperial Parliament?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can answer
that in the negative. Because one's memory
may be faulty on a matter of that kind, I
have made inquiries and verified my recollection. There was no confirmation by the
Imperial Parliament of the charters given by
the Parliament of Canada in 1905 to Saskatchewan and Alberta. Those provinces
were created by virtue of the powers given to
the Dominion Parliament in section 146 of
the British North America Act of 1867 and
the amendment of 1871.
Would the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
honourable gentleman state what is the difference between the legislation of 1905, which
did not require sanction by the Imperial Parliament, and the present legislation, which apparently does?
The honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able gentleman will realize that section 146 of
the British North America Act, and the
amendment of 1871 which confirmed the power
to create Manitoba, were sufficient to enable
the Dominion Parliament to constitute the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. When
the Canadian Parliament had created those
provinces and given them their charters, it
could not change any of the provisions in those
charters, or modify them in any way, without
the sanction of the Imperial Parliament. It
is because we have not the power ta change
the constitutional Acts which created those
provinces that we must appIy to the Imperial
Parliament now.
Hon. D. O. L'ESPERANCE: Honourable
senators, before the .motion is put, I should
like to ask the honourable leader a question.

MAY 28, 1930
the Dominion of Canada had a title to the
property, but it was vested by the Order in
Council in Newfoundland.
As the Privy
Council so decided, and as it is the supreme
tribunal, all I can say is, dura lex sed lex.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable members, now that the lawyers
have had their fling-and they were so ambitious that they could not confine themselves
to parallel cases, but had to go outside for an
extra subject in order to display their versatility and legal lore-perhaps a layman may
be permitted to voice his satisfaction that
this matter was laid over last night, and that
we have had the benefit of this morning's
experience, which to my mind is quite satisfactory. Virtually all the provinces of the
Dominion partook of what my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has called a
love feast. At the feast there was provender.
That it was a love feast I am not quite so
sure, but if my honourable friend vouches for
the statement I am prepared to accept it.
In any event, the representatives of all the
provinces were together discussing rights, resources, concessions, and such matters. The
provinces with claims advanced them for consideration, and two provinces, Ontario and
Quebec-the large men at the conferencehad no objection to the claims, but were
sympathetic towards them, and there was a
virtual consensus of opinion. I think that is
warrant enough for an answer to the question
whether there was a general conference or
a general agreement. As the rearrangements
now under consideration have been made upon
the basis of the agreement manifested at that
conference, we cannot reasonably expect any
objections to come from the two provinces I
have named. In fact, their attendance at that
conference and its agreeable termination remove all objection. This answers my query,
and for myself I am very glad to have had
the answer placed on record.
Hon. J. J. DONINELLY: Honourable members of the Senate, after listening to the discussion last night and this morning, 1 am still
of the opinion that there is a well defined
understanding that the British North America
Act should net be amended without the consent of the different provinces. I think, however, that as this matter has been very filly
advertised and discussed throughout the country, and as none of the provinces have offered
any objection, we might very well take their
silence as consent. I raised my point not for
the purpose of delaying the legislation now
before the House, but rather that it might go

on record that this procedure should not in
the future be taken as a precedent for amending the British North America Act without
the consent of all the provinces. I am still
of the opinion that this Parliament would not
be justified in asking the Imperial Parliament
to make any amendment to the British North
America Act if any one province went on
record as being opposed to the amendment.
So far as I am concerned, I am glad that I
raised the objection, because it brought out
the information which I desired when I raised
it.
The motion for the Address was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved:
That a message be sent to the House of

My informant said that the Lithuanians number oaly about one million and a half and

and Lithuania.

The

and that they cannot hope for prosperity
unless they accept the treaty and tbe patronage of Poland.
Since Valdemaras has been dethroned as

Valdemaras addressing the metmbers-a little

Tbrougbout Europe there .prevailed a spirit
of unrest, of fear, and of ha'tred. Anyone
passing through the countries of Europe or
meeting their representatives at Geneva could
flot but be aware of this condition.
That was seven years ago. Sinoe then the
situation has changed consîderably for the
better. The reparations problem bas been
settled. Not only have the troops of the
Allies been withdrawn from the Ruhr and
t he Rhine, but by the end of June they will
have disappeared completely from German
territory. Franco-German relations are slowly
but surely moving towards normalcy. Austria
bas been revived through the financial help of
the League of N-ations. Hungary, which was
the only country to repudiate openly the
treaty she had signed, has during the past
twelve months become somewhat more tractable. The German-Polish situation also bas
been imprevi.ng. During the last six montbs
there bas been a neticeable relief of the tension which existed between those two nations.

by the establishment by Poland of norne
sehools in the Uk'raine, where teachers would
be given an efficient bilingual course. I think
there is an inclination among those who
doininate publie opinion in Poland to endeavour to solve that problem, which is agitatiug such a large portion of their population.
I hope that Poland will succeed in overcoming
this difficulty, and I amn sure it wvill if it
applies itself to the question cnerget-icelly.
It has worked wouders in other directions in
the last ten years. An agrarien reform lawv bas
been passed there, whereby peasants wbo
wcre working farms under lease have become
owuers of the land.
I should like to review briefly the situation
that existed after 1918 throughout Eastern
Europe. Thé Soviets were in power in Russia
and were carrying on a campaign in favour of
their Communistie ideas, which had such an
influence on bordering countries that tbey too
feit the necessity of transferring the ownership
of lands te pea.sants. Iu the Baltie states of
Esthouia and Latvia, and in Polaud, Roumanie,
Czechoslovakia and Serbie, laws wcre rapidly
passed to provide for the purchase by expropriation of large estates and the division of
tbem amoug the peasantry. As a consequence,
there arose a very formidable financial situation in meny countries. When the expropriations were made tbe purchase price was net
paid, but the State gave its obligations for the
capital sum and paid the intcrest to the former
owuers; and, in turu, the State sold on lon
ternis to the farmers and received frem the
interest which wvent to the late owuers.
The situation hecarne particularly acute in
Transylvania, which 'vas one of the richest
provinmes of Hungary. At the cl-ose of the
war there were 1,200,000 Hungariaus and
1,600,000 Roumaniaus in Trausylvania. The
numerical rnajority in that part of the country
under Hungarian ruIe werc the political minority. Transylvania and Bukovina, as, wxell as
Bes'.arahia on the other side of the Carpathian
Mountains, were transIerred to iloumnania.
The Mag-Yar famnilies, the nobility of Hungary,
xvho livced in Budapest, lost the large estates
which they had in Trýansyl\,ania, and,' to make
matters xvorse, the iei-the trnit of Roumanian
currency, corresponding roughly to a francgradually depreciated in value te one cent.
When the expropriation xvas going on and
payments were heing fixed, the former owners
thought they would not have a very serious
complaint, but wbeu they found that not ouly
were they losiug their political power over that
province, but in addition they were being

basis of one cent in the franc or Ici, they
hegan to protest te the League of Nations.
For the lest five or six yeais there have been
violent discussions on the right of the expropriated Hungarians to be paid in gold for
their lands. Their champion was Ceunt Apponyi, eue of the most brilliant men in
Europe. HIe has visited Canada more than
once, and I knew him in bis prime, some
thirty years ago. The demiii of the Hungarian
optants wa.s discussed by every uuiversity professer versed iu international law.
This trouble, which. seriously affected the relations between Roumania and Hungary, has
et lest been settled, and Hungary seems satisfied. We shahl hear nio more of the grievances
of the Hungarians because of the expropriation
of thousends of hectares of land in Transylvania.
I stated thet the reparations problem had
becu settled. It bas been settled not only between Germany and the Allies, but also betwecn Austria, Hungary and Bulgeria, the defeatcd countries, on the eue aide, and Czechoslovekie, Roumania and Serbia on the other.

If yeu were te accempany me tbrough thbe

problems were flot easy of settiement. The
frontier between Serbia and Bulgaria lias been
very closely watched. Until lately people
passing from one country to the other, except at certain indieated points situated thre
or four miles apart, were apt to be shot. A
man owning one f arm on one side of the fine
and another farmn on the other side, or a farm
extending on both sides of the boundary, and
desiring to pass from one side to the other,
would have Vo walk down perhaps six miles to
the place of crossing and then back again, or
else run the risk of being shot. This brouglit
about a situation of which we heard vpry painfui echoes at Geneva in the form of petitions
from the Bulgarian minority calling attention Vo what they designated as assassinations.
We had to decide whether they were to be
classified as assassinations or frontier mncidents. I have had occasion to examine sucli
cases, beoause 1 have sat with many Committees of Three in an endeavour to place the
responsibility. The situation became s0 exa.sperating that there were complaints from
very many quarters. The two countries have
now established a Commission to try to
regulate the movement of people across these
boundaries so that their lives may not be

tween the Serbs and the Macedonians.
This will indicate, honourable gentlemen,
what is involved in the question of minorities
in Europe, and what a disturbing element it
constitutes. Some twcnty-five millions of
people are living away from their nativecountries. Their protests against unfair treatment have a natural repercussion in their
motherlands. That is one of the great difficulties which beset the League of Nations.
Committees of Three arm constantly 'being
appointed to investigate the cornplaints of
the minorities. In this connection I rnay say
that during the termn of Canada's representation on the Council, which will end in September, she has made a very considerable contri'bution towards the settiement of this very
grave problem, which affects a do-zen or more
of the countries of Europe. In eight or nine
treaties creating autonoanous units or increasing the areas of countries certain conditions were imposed as to the treatmnent od
minorities. It was quite natural that the
Allies, when transferring a province with a
large population to another country, thus
making them a rninority, should extend to
thema their protection in the matter of their
religion, their language, and their schools.
The qarne clause was repea)ted in cadi treaty.
When the treaties were examiined it was held
by legal experts that the minorities had beeD
given no juridical personality and were not
2425-23j

entitled to bring itheir grievances before the
Council. Only a member of the Council could
brîng to the attention of the Council any;
violation or threat of violation of the obligations imposed by the treaties in favour of
minorities. It was held that only a State
member of the Council could take the responsibility of denounoing another country for
violating one of its treaty obligations. Tic
Council felt that this was a heavy responsibility to be a.sumed by one member, and iA
was decided that if a complaint came to the
Secretariat the President of the Council should
select two members, independent of the
groupe involved, to investigate the complaint.
They were appointed, not by the Council, but
hy the President in office, in order that the
responsibility should be shared by three members of the Council ànstead of one only; but
the Council. was not apprised of the complaint
unless the âmhre members od the committee,
or any one of them, took the responsibility
of 'bringing the matter before tic Council. If
they did not deemn it proper to do so, tic
matter was closed, and there was no publicity whatever.
When Canada's representative came into the
Council the important minorities of which I
have spoken were convinced that the meinhers
of the Council did flot interest themselves in
the minorities' affairs, and that it was useles
to continue to submit petitions, because they
were not aware whether or not the petition
had been received and a committee appointed,
or what had been the resuit of the investigation. Canada's representative moved for
publîcity, and for the committee to have thse
right to turn to the petitioner for any furtier
information that it wanted. Up to that time
the minority was supposed to be non-existent
s0 f ar as the trial was concerned. It was not
a party to the trial, but was simply an informant. Tie question of procedure was brought
before the Council, and afiter study by a
committee composed of Sir Austen Chamberlain, the Japanese Amibassador Mr. Adatci,
and the Spanish Ambassador M. Quinonès de
Léon, a report was made recommending
greater publicity andi obliging the Coinmittees
of Thrce to report to Council the resuît of
their inquiry.
A very interesting incident occurred at tic
Madridi meeting in June last. A report was
made from the committee irecomrmending tiat
the procedure siould be amcnded to permit
of greater publicity, andi of the Secretary Genera;l corresponding with the petitioners and
informing thema that their petition was not
receivable. The Council was a litïtle disturbeti
lest it might raise too high the hopes of minorities, as there was always tic possibility

351

SENATE

that behind complaints there might lie
political motives inspired by people who were
not satisfied with the treaty imposed upon
them. As the amendments did not go as
far as the Canadian proposition, I presented
the following argument to the Council:
"Suppose that all the procedure that we have
established for the reception and examination
of complaints did not exist, and we had
simply the treaty guaranteeing the minorities
certain rights, which throws upon every member of this Council the responsibility of transmitting complaints to the Council. Any member of the Council could bring before it any
violation, or any threat of violation. If any
member received a complaint it would be
his duty, because of the amicable relations
existing between nations, to transmit it to
the Government concerned. The Government
might deny the statements in the complaint.
Thm it would be the duty of the member
receiving that denial to turn to the complainant and say: 'Sir, I have received your
communication asking me to transmit your
complaint to the Council. I have transmitted
it to your Government, which answers thus
and so, and I must tell you that with that
auswer in hand I cannot submit your complaint to the Council.' If it is my right and
duty to do that, why should I lose that right
when I enter a Committee of Three?"
To everybody's surprise, Sir Erie Drummond, the Secretary General, who bears the
whole responsibility for the procedure in these
matiers, said: "There is certainly a misunderstanding. The Committee of Three bas always
had that right." In many instances, I may
say, it had been denied to me. He said,
"Committees of Three have the right to correspond with the petitioner." I had stated
that I intended asking the Council to declare
that a Committee ef Three has always the
right to apply to any source of information,
without exception, in order te be enlightened.
Sir Erie Drummond answered: "It has that
right, and within my experience has exercised
it." Mr. Briand turned to me and said, "If
that is so, you need net press your proposition te a vote, since you have full satisfaction." The reply of your delegate was,
"If that is the understanding of the Council
I will not insist." Thus the right to apply
to minorities for further information was
officially recognized by the Council.
Now, what has been the effect of this intervention of the Canadian delegate? I asked
a very high authority in the Secretariat what
was his opinion as to the modification in the
procedure. He answered it had been most
beneficial, because the whole discussion had
created
considerable
interest
throughout
lion.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Europe and had given the Council a chance
to show that it was seriously interesting itself
in the questions that were submitted to it
by the minorities. Moreover, the Committees
of Three, having te prepare a statement of
their reasons for not submitting the complaints to the Council, give a much closer
attention to the matters presented to them
by the Minority Section of the Secretariat and
to the whole record placed before them.
I have the satisfaction of feeling that your
representative in the Council has net laboured
in vain.
I said that Germany seemed to have
recovered some of its old time optimism and
te have settled down earnestly to work out
its salvation under the Young Reparation
Plan. Of course we often hear the question
asked, whether Germany will meet its obligations after the troops have withdrawn from
the Rhine. I am convinced that the debt
which has now been imposed upon Germany
is one that it can meet. The amount is far
less than that provided under the Dawes
Plan, and unless Germany wishes to run the
risk of falling into a financial abyss, it will
meet its obligations. Any default by Germany would affect Great Britain, France and
the United States, and one can easily imagine
how seriously the whole German financial
fabrie would be affected if that country incurred the ill-will of those three nations.
Furthermore, the Young Plan gives Germany
ground te hope for improved conditionsalthough not in the immediate future. If
and when the United States reduces its claims
against Great Britain, France and Italy, Germany will benefit te the extent of 80 per cent
of that reduction. When M. Poincaré moved
for the ratification of the Berenger-Mellon
Agreement, by which France bound itself to
pay annuities for sixty years te the United
States, he was asked if there was any hope
of an improvement in the conditions that
weigh so heavily upon the French budget.
He replied that there could net be any change
in the situation, because of a domestic condition in the United States. He said, in effect:
" If the people of the United States were
asked te agree to a reduction of the annuities
that we are called upon te pay, they would
have to assume extra taxes to make up the
amount of a reduction."
M. Poincaré expressed the opinion that the Allies cannot hope
te receive any better terms from the United
States within the next fifteen years. But
after that time, when the bonds have been
recalled and the people of the United States
are no longer creditors for any part of the
capital or interest represented by those debts,

MAY 28, 1930
it may be that the United States will feel
disposed ta deal more leniently with its
debtors. Germany foresees that possibility,
and provision lias been made that she will
receive 80 per cent of any reduction that
the United States gives to Great Britain,
France or Italy in the distant future.
As I have already stated, Hungary obtained
material advantage through the settiement
under the Young Plan. The so-called Oriental
debts were settled by a sub-committee of the
Hague delegates, whiie 1 was in Paris. Austria
bas been relieved of its obligations. A fund
bas been created to which Great Britain,
France and Itely are making subscriptions ta
belp Czechoslovakia, Roumania and Serbia
ta meet the dlaims of Hungary. Hungary
cherishes the hope that in the course of time
there may be an alteration in its frontiers, by
general agreement among those who have
obtained part of its former territories. Hungary realizes the impossibility of securing any
alteration by means of force, and it relies
upon article 19 of the Covenant of the
Legue, wbich, is:
The Assembly may from time tu time advise
the reconsideration by Members of the League
of treaties wvhich have hecome inapplicable and
the consideration of international conditions
Nvhose continuance miglit endanger the peace of
the world.
During the last meeting of the Assembly, the
Chinese delegation asked for an interpretation
of that clause. An interpretation was made by
a sub-committee of the Third Commission,
and M. Antoniade, the Roumanian delegate,
said, "Rou mania accepte the interpretation of
clause 19 because it relies on clause 10, whicb
guarantees it frontiers." 'f'lie Hungarian delegate, Count Apponyi, said, "Hungary accepts
clause 10, because it relies on clause 19." Those
who desire the maintenance of the frontiers say
that clause 10 of the League of Nations has
guaranteed the sacredness of the border line,
and those who have been dispossessed retort
thet article 19 provides tbat the Assembly may
from time to time advise the reconsideration
of treeties whicb have hecome inapplicable
and the consideretion of international conditions wbose continuance miiglit endanger the
peace of the world.
This ycar there is a manifest relaxation in the
relations among all those countries. The Geneva
atmospbere seems to be permeating Europe
more and more. Peace can only be assured by
personal contact and co-operation on the part
of representatives of the different nations of
the world. M. Briand, who bas had frequent;
conferences with representatives of Germany
over a period af years, lias declared that

357

nothing but friendly meetings of representatives of different nations will cause the disappearance of prejudices and hatreds.
Proof that there is a change of heart ini
Europe is shown in the reception that was
accorded to the Briand Plan for a federation
of Europe, which was mooted in September
last and made public on the 17th of May
this year. The plan was drafted under provisions contained in clause 21 of the Covenant
of the League, which I shahl not read. The
scheme proposes a fedieration on the lines of
tbe Soutb Amierican republics. Here is how
M. Briand explained bis project:
Ail possibility of progress toward economic
union being strictly determined by the question
of security, itself closely bound up with the
quiestion of possible progress in the realm of
political union, it is tberefore on the political
field that the hest efforts of organizers to
create for Europe an orgenie structure muet be
concentreted.
It je elso elong these Uines that the economie
policy of Europe, as well as tbe tariff policies
of the variaus European States, must subsequently develop.
An opposite procedure would flot only lie
useless but would also appear to the weaker
nations as destined ta expose tbem without
guerantees or compensation to tbe risks of
political domination whicb migbt easily resuit
from industriel domination by the better
organized States.
I shaîl read one other paragrapli from M.
Briand's report:
The conception of Europeen politicel cooperation should tend toward this essentiel
end; a federation built not upon the idea, of
un'ity but of union; that is ta sey, sufficiently
supple as ta respect the independence end
national so%,ereignty of eecb of these States, et
tbe saine turne aesuring to aIl tbe benefit of
collective eolidarity for the settlement of
political questions involving tbe fete of the
European comnîunity or of one of its membere.
Tbe States of Europe-I think there are
twenty-six of them-arc asked ta f orm. a union
under the eŽgis of the League, sa that they
inuy be able to co-operete in the solution of
their varicd problems. Time ivili tell what
wilI cume of the proposal.
Count Condenbouve-Calerghi, wbo publishes
an interesting review called Pan-Europe and
Who is the father of tbe idea of bringing the
European countries together in a union, points
out how peace can lie gradually established
in Europe through economic action. H1e says
that the frontiers cannot be altered by force,
and lie pleads for a reduction in tariffs so that
the importance of the frontiers may be minimized and people may came ta forget tbem.
Wbether there sbaîl be peace in Europe depends principally upon the attitude of Germany. The German mind seeme tQ baviu

358

turned towards economic fields lately. I was
told that there is no party or no union of
parties in Germany to-day strong enough to
succeed in imposing upon the people a law
of conscription. I have also been informed
that the maintenance of the military structure
in Germany, prior to the war, was due to the
fact that all the so-called best families, of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the bourgoisie, the
well-to-do middle classes, aspired to have a son
in the army. They were able to contribute
some income in order to help their sons to
maintain the scale appropriate to their position. At that time an army oflicer was at the
top of the social scale in Germany and his
career was coveted by the men of the wellto-do families. But no longer is the army a
career and no longer are there so many
families who can afferd to furnishi money to
their sons to enable them to continue as army
officers. The result is that the young men of
the highest classes of Germany to-day are turning to finance, to science and to business. The
statement was made to me that when the
military officers who miourn the loss of their
pay and their rank pass away, or through
advancing age abandon all hope of further
service, militarism as it flouîrished in Germany
under the old regime will be entirely a thing
of the past.
But it miav be said that no serious advance has leen made iii the reduction of
armaients. The recent Naval Convention
in London was a step in that direction.
Of course, it iS casier to reduce naval units
tian Lind forces.
It is always possible
te know xc tvl what ainother country has
in the way of siips, but one is never able to
tell how un u men are ieing trained acrozs
an international bomdary. My hope is that
as fears, haftrnds and suspicions graduallv
vanish thiere will le a corresponding reduction
in armnamuents. Such is, I an sure, the ardent
hope of everpeace-loving man and womean
in the world to-day.

have another distinguished representative, the
right honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster),
who has been the apostle of the League of
Nations and has preached its benefits all over
Canada and in the United States. He, as we
all know, is one of the most eloquent men in
Canada and has popularized the League of
Nations in this country in a way that perhaps
no other man could have done. In the
honourable the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) we have an eminent
member of this House who has devoted a
great deal of attention to the League of
Nations. We are indeed singularly fortunate,
especially in having with us one who, through
his position on the Council, came into close
contact with the functioning of the League
and the legislation that has emanated from
if. He, being a bilinguist, was well qualified
to be our representative.
However little
French iav be spoken generally on this
continent, the public men of nearly all the
nations in Europe are more or less familiar
with that language, and the ability to use
two languages in the masterful manner in
wuhiech our honourable friend uses them is
undoubtedly an advantage at the League of
Nations or in any legislative body, partieularly on the continent of Europe. Canada
has reason to be prend of her distinguished
representative at the League of Nations, and
I for one should be extremely happy if the
three-yvear term with whieh our honourable
friend has been honoured were te be succeeded
by another such term.
The honourable gentleman has referred to
the treatment of minorities.

We know, from

what we have heard and froin what we have
read of the proceedings of the League, something of the active part taken by the Canadian delegate in that regard. We in Canada
are soniewhat faiiliar with minorities and
realize the necessity of a spirit of give and
take. That spirit- I am glad to say tliat it
bas not been necessarv to invoke it in recent
year-is worti a great deal. The precuirsors
of the great French minnority of this country,
a large and ever gurowing section of our population, recognized the value of British institutions ind had tieir share in the establishment and maintenance of those istituitiens. Our experience in this respect is worth
something to a delegate to the League of
Nations.
I remember that I happend to
be one of the dlgate. of the Eip:ire Prliamuetry party who wcit to Souitli Africa.
One or two of our delegates were rather unwilling to commit themselves to speaking in
English, and on a few occasions I bad to

MAY 28, 1930
become the interpreter of the Frenchi speaker
to the English audience. The people of
Sou-tb Africa are of a mixed origin, and tbey
were delighted at ail times to learn bow we
had solved our racial difficulties.
On behaîf of bonourable members on this
aide of the Hous, and also on behaîf of mierabers on the otber side, if tbey will permit me,
may I signif y our plensure and admiration
at tbe way in whicb our delegate to the
League of Nations has conduoted himsîf.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is unnecessary for me to say how bighly 1 appreciate
the kind remarks of my bonourable friend.
DOMINION BUýECTIONS BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 309, an Act to amend the Dominion
Elections Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of tbe Bill.
He said: Honourable members, it is my
privilege, witb the leave of the Senate, to
move the second reading of the Bill, and I do
s0 witbout any pang of conscience, thougli I
bave not perused the Bill. There bave been
times when sucb measures bave reached us
from the otber House after some turmoil,
but within recent years amendnients to the
Dominion Elections Act have generally come
to us with tbe blessing of ail tbe members
of tbe House of Comm ons. 0f course I am
referring, not to the troublous days of the
W'ar-time Elections Act, but only te tbose
measures which. have come ta us under normal conditions. During the past twentyfive or thirty yeýars the Franchise Act or the
Elections Act bas been a resuit of the twoparty system, or, as we 110w bave it, the
tbree-party system. Members of this House
have the good fortune ta hold a longer mandate than is souglit by candidates for the
other House.
If there are any particular explanations
rcquired, I shall try ta furnish them ta the
satisfaction of the House.
Hon, W. B. WILLOUGHBY: I do not
know whether any bonourable gentleman is
desirous that ive sbould go into Committee
on this Bill. It deals entirely with the memabers of the other Hanse. I notice, however,
that section 9 of the Dominion Elections Act
is repcaled. I have not that Act hefore me

and am not aware of

involves.

mast

what that repeal

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend bas asked what is the clause that is repealed. Subsection 5 of section 29A of the
Dominion Elections Act, Chapter 53 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as enacted
by section 13 of Chapter 40 of the Statutes
of 19Q29, is repeaied. S'ubsectîon 5 of section
29A bas to do with summer residents. It
reads as follows:
Except persans who, at the date of the issue
of the writ of election, have no other quarters
to which they might at will remove, no person
shal1 be deemed to be resident at the said date
in quarters or premises which, notwithstanding
that they may be sometimes or ordinarily occupied during sorne or ail the months of May to
October inclusive, ordinarily remnain unoccupied
during some or ail the months of November to
April inclusive.
That is replaced by the section before us in
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Is section 9 not
toucbcd at ail?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is subsection
5 of section 29A.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Then you need
flot follow that any further.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is ail there
is to clause 1. Section 2 lias to do with the
preparation of lista of voters in urban polling
divisions. In the cities the Chief Electoral
Officer appoints two persons, representing the
two parties, to go hand in hand from one
bouse to another to take tbe census.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: Do they take a policeman with tbem?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose they
stand guard one upon the other. I confes
that personally I was very mucli dissatisfied
with the system of registration in the cities as
I saw it in the city of Montreal. I thouglit
that the system. lent itself ta any number of
abuses.
Han. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Particularly impersonation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And tbe cost to
the candidates was something tremendous. In
one election a candidate told me that the
registration alone bad cost him some $8,000,
and yet bie was not satisfied that it was well
done. I do not know bow this systein will
work out. We are stili in tbe experimental
stage. If the experiment proves unsatisfactory
we may drif t ta some scheme of permanent
liats with the type lef t standing, and revised
from year to year. This would perhaps be
costly, but in the long run it would probably
be the most satisfactory.

360

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Impersonation
is common in big cities. There have been
instances of it in Montreal, I have been told.
This amendment does not prevent impersonation, but it gives the enumerators a chance to
check every name on the list. I presume the
primary intention is that if they do not know
who a person is they are not to allow him to
go on the list. The great difficulty is to
prevent impersonation and identify qualified
voters. In some of the American cities--in
Philadelphia, for instance-it has been charged
that there has been wholesale impersonation.

vice versa shall be taxed as income to the
purchaser.
If the Bill is given a second reading now,
it will be understood that any honourable

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I have received no memorandum of explanation of the
various changes that are proposed in the
Income War Tax Act. I am familiar with some
of the amendments, but I am unable to explain
them all. There is a clause to lessen taxation
to a certain extent on account of donations
to charitable organizations. There is an additional exemption of $500 where a parent,
grandparent, brother or sister who is incapable
of self-support on account of mental or
physical infirmity is dependent upon the taxpayer for support, and this applies unless the
exemption is already provided for in the
Act.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 311, an Act to amend the Special War
Revenue Act. Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, in this case,
as with the previous Bill, I will move that
the House go into Committee of the Whole
when we meet this evening.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable senators,
this succeeds or amends a Bill that was
brought before this House last year. At that
time I stated that the principles of the
measure were altogether foreign to this or any
other civilized country. In my opinion there
should be no discrimination in taxation such
as this Bill provides. I shall endeavour to
explain just what I mean. Paragraph (b)
of section 58 of the Bill that was brought
down last year provided a tax of 4 cents for
every share of stock sold or transferred at a
price over $100 per share. On the sale or
transfer of a stock worth $400, say, there was
still the same tax of 4 cents, but in the case
of cheap stocks the tax per share would be
in some instances as much as thirty times
greater than that. In other words, the Bill
would have penalized the man who dealt in
lower priced stocks. I asked what was the
reason for the proposed legislation, but could
get no satisfactory explanation. The information which I had at the time was that

MAY 28,1930o
some broker in Montreal had asked that a
higher tax be placed upon the transfer of the
cheaper stocks. As I have stated, under the
Bill of hast year the tax per share on the
transfer of the cheap stocks would run in
some instances to thirty times as much as
the per share tax on the transfer of expensive
stocks.
In proportion
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to the value of the stock.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But the rate was
4 cents, was it not? The rate wouhd be the
same, but the ultimnate resuît would be
different?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No, the rate was not
the same at ahl.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What wouhd be
the rate on the hower stock?
lion. Mr. GORDON: According to paragraph (b) of section 58 of the Bill of last
year, tîjere was to be a tax of 4 cents on
every share of stock sohd or transferred at
a price over 3100 a share; according to paragraph (c) a tax of 3 cents for every share
of stock sohd or transferred at a price over
$20 a share, but not more than $100 a share;
and according to paragraph (d) a tax of 2
cents for every share of stock sold or transferrcd at a price over $3 a share, but flot more
than $20 a share.
Under this Bill, as I understand it, for
every $100 worth of stock on the basis of
$150 a share sold, the tax according to, paragraph (b) wouhd be 3j cents; for every $100
worth of stock sohd on the basis of $75 a
share the tax would be 5* cents; for every
$100 worth of stock sold at the rate of $50
a share the tax would be 6 cents; for every
$100 worth of stock sold at the price of $25
a share the tax would be 8 cents; for every
$100 worth of stock sold at the price of $5 a
share the tax would be 20 cents; and for
every $100 worth of stock sold at the price
of $1 a share the tax would be 25 cents. In
other words, the man who sold one share of
stock valued at $150 would be taxed only Si
cents per $100, whereas if he sold $100 ýworth
of stock made up of individual shares valued
at $1 he would be taxed 25 cents, or almost
eight times as much, on a transaction of the
same value.
I arn sure that every honourable gentleman will agree with me that a principle of
that kind is unjust. While the present Bill
is better than the one that was brought down
hast year, it is objectionable. I cannot understand why any such hegislation should be

361

proposed. It looks to me as if the Bill had
been drafted by an office boy in the Department of Finance and the Minister had passed
it on the boy's recommendation.
Does the honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ouralble gentleman know whether any statement was made by the Minister of Finance
in explanation of the scale of taxes?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It was not explained,
so far as I know. If I remember correctly, the
Minister was asked last year in another place
whether he considered this to be a stamp tax,
and he said that he did; that it was a stamp
tax.l
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was not the matter discussed yesterday in another place? It
seems to me that I saw some reference to the
subject. It must have been discussed yesterday.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: 1 tbink it was, because it has reached us just now. But it is
a departure from any principle known in any
civilized country, and I cannot for the 11fe
of me see how it can be justified.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not just
now in a position to defend it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable
gentleman: who bas just spoken (Hon. Mr
Gordon) gave hast year a concrete example of
how it worked out, and the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) had
detailed figures showing its effect, particularly
on the lower priced stocks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is reduced to
some extent. The only defence that was put
before us last year was that we shoulci discourage the small speculator from going into
the mining market; that it would teach him
a valuable lesson and perhaps keep hlm out of
the market.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
a good thing.

Which might be

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I cannot agree with
that.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY. Anybody who
knows anything of the mining business, even
if he has loat money in it, knows that it is
necessary to sell shares on faith. You pay

right (Hon. Mr. Gordon) would know better
than I do about that. In any event, it is
made as difficult under this Bill as it was
under the old Act to get subscriptions for
small sums.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Entirely apart from
that, as a matter of principle, how can you
justify it? Whether a stock is worth $150 or
$1,000 per share, it would pay the same tax
of 5 cents. One hundred dollars' worth of a
stock selling at $1 per share is taxed 25 cents.

DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
" One-quarter
of one cent for every share of stock sold, or
transferred at a price of one dollar ta five
dollars per share."
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But the tax on a
stock selling at $1,000 per share would be
only 5 cents. How can that be justified? In
the first place this was intended only as a
stamp tax.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The stamp tax
on cheques is the same on $1,000 as on $100.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But in the Bill as
brought in last year the tax could easily be
regarded as a property tax. I opposed it also
on the ground that it was a property tax and
that the Dominion Government has no right to
tax property.
In the mining areas, for
instance, the roads and schools and so forth
are built and looked after by the Provincial
Covernment; yet here was the Dominion
Government exacting an excessive tax on the
stocks of the mines. On looking at this superficially, and without figuring it out, you would
imagine that it was all right; but when you
find that one man's dollar is being taxed
eight or ten times as much as another man's
dollar, you sec there is no justification for
it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That is, the
poor man's is subject to the higher tas.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have looked over
the discussion tîat took place in the other
House yesterday, which will be found at page
2803 of lansard. I am not going to read it,
but just wish to point out that the ground
taken by my honourable friend was apparently not taken in the other House. The
objection there seemed to be confined to
the point that the tax was too high and that
it discouraged business in Canada and rather
helped business in New York.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Because the
transfer fes are cheaper there.
IHon.

'Mi. WILLOUIIBY.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: One member says:
Let me cite one or two examrples-and from
the reasonable attitude of the Minister of
Finance I have some hope that he may be
inpressed by them. Suppose I wish to sell 100
shares of stock having ,a par value of $100,
which stock is listed on both the Canadian and
New York exchanges. In that case I pay the
provincial tax of $3 and the Dominion tax of
$4, or a total of $7. By doing my business
through a New York house I pay the state týax
of $2 and the federal tax of $2, or a total of
$4. Let me remuind lion. members I am dealing
not with conditions brought about by the 1929
amendment, because they were much worse, but
with conditions under the proposals noi before
the committee.
So the ground taken by-my honourable friend
does not seem to have been taken at all in
the other House.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That, of course, does
not affect the proposition in the least.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do n.ot quote it
for thait purpose.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Prior to last year the
tax was on an ad valorem basis and aIl
dollars
were treated alike. Last year it worked out
as follows: paragraph (b), 4 cents; (c), 15
cents; (d), 66 cents; (e), S; (f), 50 cents;
(g), $1. One hundred dollars' worth of the
high priced stock is taxed 4 cents, and the
lower priced stocks are taxed twenty-five
times that amount. This year we are confronted by the same principle again: the
poor man's dollar is taxed eight times as
mach as the rich man's dollar. We all know
thait only men in pretty good circumstances
buy stocks that are worth even $100 a share.
Such stocks are treated very liberally, the
tax being merely a stamp tax.

that, the Family Corporation being exempt on
election of shareholders, the shareholders would
also be exempt as non-residents and the Crown

Hon. Mr. GORDON: We do not appear to
have a copy of the Bill. Apparently it has
not been distributed.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But why make
it retroactive? That is the question.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There has apparently been no distribution to honourable

Section 5 (1), "Family Corporations," was
designed to give relief to shareholders resident
in Canada employed in the corporation. The
relief was from the company tax and to place
the shareholders in the position of partners, in
which capacity they actually worked. Partnerships. as such, were not taxable and so the
Family Corporation, as such, was made exempt

The Income
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Tax amendment cannot well be brought into
force at the time of the passing of the amendment. Inasmuch as the law applies to taxation periods, the amending legislation is
brought into effect at the commencement of
the designated taxation periods. The returns
for the 1929 taxation period were to be filed
on or before April 30, 1930. The sections,
with one exception, apply to these returns.
The exception is in respect of section 4, which
applies to income for 1930, returns for which
are not filed until 1931.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:

These amendHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ments are to be applied to the 1929 income
returns in order that the taxpayer may enjoy the benefits accruing to him.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: He would get
a refund?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The returns for
1929 are due by the 30th of April, and part
of the tax is payable then, or it may be paid
in full. There will be cases in which a refund will have to be made.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I take it also that
under the Bill there will be cases where the
opposite is true. There are certain provisions
in the B-ill which impose taxation on people
heretofore not taxed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only burdens mentioned in the Bill are made applicable to the returns for 1930, which will be
made in 1931.

it is retroactive. Further taxation is imposed

will lose something on the others.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 311, an
Act to amend the Special War Revenue Act.
Hon. Mr. Béland in the chair.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am told the
Bill has not yet been distributed.
Hot

Mr. DANDURAND.

On section 1-excise tax on sale, transfer
or assignment of stocks, etc.:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman from Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon)
has asked me to explain the working of section
58, which is a modification of the section
passed last year. The honourable gentleman
has stated tha.t money transactions should
be taxed on an equal basis, and suggested that
there should be a sliding scale reducing the
taxation in proportion to the reduction in
the size of the transaction. To him it seems
that some of the items here indicate that the
levy on a small transaction is higher than on
a larger one. All I can say to my honourable
friend is that the change of last year was
made because of pressing requests from men
dealing largely in stocks and debentures, who
claimed that under the old system the bookkeeping was most difficult, and stated that
they preferred a flat levy upon the face value
of the stock. The Department of Finance,
after considering their representations, reached
the conclusion that it would simplify the tax
to accede to the request.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Was that request
from brokers?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It came from
the exchanges in Montreal and Toronto. They
are, I suppose, the largest dealers in stocks in
Can-ada. The Minister of Finance has found
the levy on the smaller transactions to be a
cause of complaint, and he has materially reduced the levy. He has found also that some
of the transactions were so small that a flat
levy could net be fixed. If there has been
discrimination in favour of the more expensive
stocks, as my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Cordon) contends, it has apparently not been
objected to by stock brokers. It would scem
that the Finance Minister endeavoured by
amending the Act to make the levy as
equitable as possible.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: I will give an illustration in an endeavour to show the House
that the Finance Minister has taken a wrong
view of the whole situation. Let us suppose
that five men desire to procure $1,000 each
from the sale of stock. Mr. A has one share
of Sun Life stock, which will bring him in
more than $1,000: I suppose he would get
about $2,400 for it at the present time. The
tax on the sale would be only 5 cents. Mr.
B sells five shares of Consolidated Smelters
at about $217 a share, and pays a tax of 25
cents, or five times the tax that Mr. A pays
in selling stock valued at more than twice the
money. Mr. C sells thirty shares of Nickel
at $33.30 a share and he pays 60 cents tax.
Mr. D sells 143 shares of Hollinger at £7 a

MAY 28, 1930
share and pays a tax of 81.43. Mr. E seils
1,000 shares of Vipond at $1 a share and is
taxed 82.50. Honourable members can see
-what a discrepancy there wouid be in the
taxes in these instances, aithough the value
,of the stock sold would he roughly about the
,sarne-1,000 in each case excepting where
the one share of Sun Life is sold.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The saine thing
appiies to bank cheques.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is a different
thing altagether. If a man goes to a braker
-and selis 81,000 worth of stock, there is a
single transaction, regardiess of the number
of shares there may be. Yet on a transaction
amounting to 81,000 one man rnight pay a
tax af 5 cents whiie another might be taxed
$2.50, and the worst of it is that in rnost cases
those who paid the higher taxes would beiong
to the poorer classes. As a rule, a mnan in
modest circumstances very seldom bliys a
high priced stock. It is only people who are
comparatively wealthy who purchase stock
valued at $100 and more per share.
I cannot understand why this Bill passed
the other House withaut serious objection
being raised. Why should there be discrimination ag-ainst the poorer classes of our
people, who cannat affard to invest in the
rnost, expensive stocks? As I have already
rernarked, property is taxcd according ta its
assessed value, under our system. I think
I arn safe in saying that no other civilized
country in the world would pass a measure
of this kind. I hope it will be sent back to
the other Hause for reconsideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not cxarnined the Bill in detail, but rny honaurable
friend bas admitted that the amendrnents are
a considerable impravernent over the Biii of
last year.
Han. Mr. GORDON: Yes, the Bill is better
than the one we had iast year. The measure
we had before us last session was what I cali
a fool Bill. This is aiso a fool Bill-tbough ta
a lesser extent-because the principle is the
saine.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I hesitate ta take part
in the discussion, because I arn not weil pasted
on the matter, but if I remember rightly, the
abject of the Bill af iast year was ta discourage the sale af shares valued at $1 ar $2
because a grcat many companies who float
shares of that cIass are not bona fide.
Han. Mr. GORDON: A man who seils
1,000 shares af stock valucd at $1 per share
is taxed $2.50, whereas the man who is wealthy
enough ta passess stock valued at $1,000 for

365

a single share pays a tax af only 5 cents when
hie seils $1,000 worth, simply because thc tax
is an the number of shares rather than on the
value of the transaction.
Han. Mr. FORKE: Dut the campanies
that are flaating cheap shares valued around
3are not as a ruie bona fide.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I do not agree with
that at ail. I think the bonourabie gentleman
is entireiy wrang in that statement. Many
campanies whose stock has been sald for a
few pennies have made their stockholders
wealtby. But I arn contcnding against the
principie of this measure. Frankiy, I do not
sec bow it can be justified.
Hon. Mi. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend makes out a speciai case by indicating
the apparent disparity in the taxation as betwecn high priced and iow priced stocks, but
it seems extraordinary that although the Dill
passed Iast session bas been on the Statute
Book for about twclve months, no abjections
bave been made ta the Departrncnt of Finance
aiong the uines of those voiced by my honourable friend on the floor of tbis House.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Oh, oh!
I do not know
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
wbat influenced the Minister of Finance ta
reduce the taxation on the sale of cheaper
stock, but this Dili provides a material reduction. I arn sorry that rny bonourable
friend did not present ta the Minister the
figures ho bas given us here. I arn surprised
that noa member of the other House discovered
the aliegcd faults tbat my banourabie friend
finds in the Bill. We are confronted with the
difficuity that wc are unabie ta amcnd the

because the Senate cannat reduce a tax. This

Section three of this Act shall be deemed to

Upon turning to section 3 of the Bill I find
that it imposes the obligation of making
monthly returns. I should like to know why
that section should be retroactive. If a man
has failed to make a return during the past
three years, not being legally required to do
so, why should he be compel'led to do so now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From reading
the explanatory note I should judge that this
is but a declaratory enactment, because the
section is intended to remove any doubt as
to the state of the law.

Part IV of this Act. . . . .". In the Revised

Statutes of 1927, the Manufacturera' of
Gallonage Tax was placed by itself in Part
XI, the Excise Tax on Playing Cards and
Wines in Part XII, and the Consumption or
Sales Tax in Part XIII, but section 106 was
re-enacted to refer only to the tax imposed by
Part XIII. The Revised Statutes are intended
only to codify the existing law and the amendment is designed to make it clear that the
penalties apply to all three taxes.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I say it is
a bad principle to make penalties retroactive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There will be no
arrears collected under this enactment, but
there will be no refunding.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That will be
different.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: That is to say, the
Department collected penalties they should
not have collected, and these will not be
refunded.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It has collected
penalties under an Act which embodied the

will of Parliament; but in the revision of the
Statutes, which was but a consolidation, there
was an omission which technically would free
certain persons from paying penalties. The
Department has continued to administer the
law as formerly enacted, and has collected the
penalties.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am toid that
there are very few cases of that kind.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: The will of Parliament is expressed in the Act as consolidated. Otherwise who is to say what is the
will of Parliament? And if the Department
have collected penalties contrary to the Act
as printed in the consolidated Statutes, they
have been collecting them illegally and
should be willing to refund them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Technically the
argument of mxy honourable friend may be
correct, but lie knows that the will of Parliament is expressed by the various Acts that
formn the Statutes, and that the purpose of
the codification is not to alter the legislation
which is being codified.

its facilities and building a Union Station.
The Board granted the application on certain
conditions, as set out in the order of the
Board dated February 23, 1905.
By Chapter 170 of the Statutes of Canada,
1906, the Toronto Terminals Railway Company was incorporated, with power to take
over from the Grand Trunk the property in
the city of Toronto known as the "Union
Station property," and was vested with all
powers and authority conferred upon the
Grand Trunk by the above mentioned order
of the Board of Railway Commissioners.
Apparently nothing was done until June 9,
1909, when the Board, by Order No. 7200,
ordered a four-traek viaduet between certain
specifie points in Toronto on both the Grand
Trunk and the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The city of Toronto was ordered to pay to
the railway companies one-third of the cost.
Subsequently, all compensation to be paid
to the Canadian Pacific for extra lands taken
and consequential injury and damages to its
facilities by the forced raising of its freight
yards and buildings was ordered as a charge
solely against the city, to be paid directly
to the Canadian Pacifie.
Appeals were taken from the orders of the
Board and suibsquently, in 1913, a new
scheme was agreed to. This was confirmed
byv the Board on July 31, 1913. This agrecment provides for a full six-track viaduct
scheme between certain specific points in
Toronto and provides that the total cost of
the sane shall be borne by the city of
Toronto, the Grand Trunk and the Canadian
Pacifie in such proportions as may be agreed
to or, in default as fixed by the Board, but
the amount which the city shall contribute
tfhereto shall not, in any event, be greater
than the amiount which, under the existing
orders of thec Board, the city is or may be
directed to pay or assune in respect of the
viaduct or works to be executed under and by
virtue of the said orders.
The raiiways
-cre arranging for the Terminals Company to undertake the work of
constructing the viaduct and also the new
Union Station and preparing for a bond issue
to cover the cost when the war broke out and
further procedings of that kind were discontinued. The station building was completed about 1921.
In November, 1923, no actual viaduct construction had been started, and as an alternative to the 1913 agreement a scheme which
w-ould be less costly at that time was submitted by the railway companies.
In April, 1924, no agreement liaving been

the Chief Engineer of the
In July, l4,
Department investigated the situation and
made a report, and on July 19, 1924, an Act
respecting the Terminals Company, being
Chapter 70 of the Statutes of that year, was
passed, under which a new scheme was provided in lieu of the viaduct and works
provided for in the orders of the Board and
the agreement of 1913. This Act also declares that the cost involved shall be borne
by the Canadian National and the Canadian
Pacifie and the city of Toronto in such proportions as the parties may agree upon or, in
default, as may be determined by the Board,
provided that certain compensation ta the
Canadian Pacifie shall be paid by the city
of Toronto.
By this Act of 1924, the Act of incorporation
of the Terminals Company was amended to
provide that both the Canadien Pacifie and
the Canadian National might each take and
hold one-half of the capital stock of the company, and the Canadian Pacifie might guarantee principal and interest of one-half of the
securities issued by the Terminals Company,
and the Canadian National might issue its
own securities to an extent not exceeding
$3,577,500 to purchase one-half the securities
issued by the Terminals Company.
This latter amount was increased by an
amendment, in 1925, to $7,000,000, to be
issued(a) to purchase securities of the Terminals
Company;
(b) to defray cost of portion of the viaduct
and works which will not he included in the
works owned by the Terminals Company and
will have to be constructed by the Canadian
National.
By an amendnent in 1928 this sum was increased to $10,500,000 for the same purposes,
and the present BiH is for the purpose of increasing the amount to $14,150,000 for the
sane purposes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

of equality with imported coal.-Hon. Mr.
Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, by way of
explaining this Bill, I think it would be
sufficient to read its three clauses:
1. So long as the provisions of tariff item
number one thousand and uineteen in schedule
B to the Customs Tariff remain in full effect,
the Governor in Council may authorize the
payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
to manufacturers of iron or steel, of forty-nine
and one-half cents per ton of bituminous coal
mined in Canada and converted into coke by
a proprietor of coke ovens at his coke ovens
in Canada, and used by such manufacturers in
the smelting in Canada of iron from ore or in
the manufacture in Canada of steel ingots or
oteel castings. No such payment shall be made
more than once in respect of any coal so used.
2. No payment shall be made to any person
or corporation entitled to receive any payment
under this Act, or an-y drawback under the
tariff item mentioned in the preceding section,
where it is shown to the satisfaction of the
Governor in Council that such person or corporation is not complying with laws enacted
by the Province, in which the industry concerned is operating, for the purpcse of maintaining in the operation of such industry hours
of labour and rates of wages consistent with
the provisions of any international convention
adopted by a labour conference held under the
Treaty of Versailles.
3. The Governor in Council may make regulations to carry out the intentions of this Act.
Honourable members are aware of the form
of the convention adopted at the conference
between employers and employees at the
International Labour Bureau, Geneva, which
fixed a maximum of working hours on what
is called the eight-hour-day basis. Honourable
members also realize the inability of the
Dominion Government to sign that convention, inasmuch as its subject-matter comes
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. The
second section of the Bill is so framed that
any person or corporation shall not receive a
bounty unless such person or corporation complies with laws enacted by the province, in
which the industry concerned is operating, for
the purpose of maintaining hours of labour
and rates of wages consistent with the provisions of any international convention adopted

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would ask
permission to have Mr. McKinnon sit beside
me.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It will be seen
that the payment of the bounty is made
contingent on the provisions of tariff item No.
1019 in Schedule B to the Customs Tariff
remaining in full effect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Item 1019 in
Schedule B to the Customs Tariff reads:
Bituminous Coal-when impor.ted by proprietors of coke ovens and converted at their
coke ovens into coke for use in the smelting
off metals froua ores and in the melting of
metals.-99 per cent drawback.
So long as the provisions of that tariff item
remain in force, the bounty of 49z cents per
ton may be paid.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have not read
the debate on this Bill in another place, but
I know there was considerable discussion on
it there. The Bill provides that a person
or corporation shall not receive payment of
the drawback if there has been non-compliance--with laws enacted by the province, in which
the industry concerned is operating, for the
purpose of miaintaining in the operation of such
ndustry hours of labour and rates of wages
consistent with the provisions of any international convention adopted by a labour conference held under the Treaty of Versailles.

provincial law. We are contemplating the

by the province for the purpose of maintaining wages and hours consistent with the
provisions of any international convention
adopted by a labour conference held under
the Treaty of Versailles. I do not pretend
to make any new comment on this matter, for
the point I wish to emphasize has already
been discussed in another place.
In my
opinion we should not make the payment of
the bonus conditional on compliance with legislation by a province. We, who are authorizing
the payment, have the power to say under
what conditions the payment shall be made.
I think we should provide that the bounty

Mr.

WILLOUGHBY.

may be paid to manufacturers who comply
with the provisions adopted by a labour conference held under the Treaty of Versailles
with respect to hours of labour and rates of
wages. We should not pay any attention to
what legislation the Province of Nova Scotia,
or any other province, decides to pass. The
payment of the bonus should not be made
conditional upon the action of some outside
party. I do not desire to oppose the passage
of the Bill. In common with every honourable member of this House, I am eager to
encourage the growth of native industry in
Canada, and I think this legislation will be
of sone assistance along that line.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend realizes that the Dominion Parliament
cannot legislate with regard to hours of labour
and rates of wages.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Quite true.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a provincial matter. This Bill provides for the payment of a bonus to manufacturers of iron or
steel. If the province where the industry concerned is operating has passed legislation
respecting hours of labour and rates of wages
in conformity with any international convention adopted by a labour conference held under
the Treaty of Versailles, the manufacturers
will have to comply with that legislation in
order to receive the bounty. But the Bill does
not demand the passage of any such legislation. A province may go as far as it wishes
with a view to protecting labour employed in
the iron and steel industry.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does the corollary apply, namely, that if a province does not pass
such legislation any industry concerned in the
province would not receive the bonus?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the bonus.

It would receive

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It would receive it anyway?
Honu. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, unless it
disobeyed any provincial law.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: I quite concur in the
view expressed by the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that the Parliament of Canada cannot pass legislation governing hours of labour and rates of wages. But
would it not be possible to provide in this
Bill that the bonus shall be paid only to such
persons or corporations as, let us say, adopt
the eight-hour-day basis? By doing that we
should not be encroaching on provincial jurisdiction. We can say to the manufacturers, in
effect, that they will be eligible for the bonus

MAY 28, 1930
if they adopt the eight-hour day. Surely we
have power to do that. The authority for the
payment of the bonus lies in the Dominion
Parliament, and therefore we should be able
to attach any conditions we desire to the
payment of it.
I have conHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
siderable doubt as to the right of the Dominion of Canada to do that, and I will point
out my difficulty to my honourable friend.
If we can do it in one instance by using tariff
privileges to favour one industry, how would
a tribunal view an enactment to cover all
the privileges, or protection, if you will, or
incidental protection, accruing to most of the
industries of this country through the imposition of customs duty?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
a customs duty.

This is a bonus, not

If Parliament
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
can single out one industry employing a thousand men, can it not cover ail the industries
that receive sortie kind of privilege or protection through any Federal enactment? When
I am faced with that possibility I doubt very
nuch whether our legislation would stand before the tribunals of this country.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable
gentleman bas pointed out that to make this
document applicable to all industries might
mean great difficulty. Assuming that to be
true, which I do not admit, it would not be
illegal; it would only mean difficulty in applying it.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: This provision, it
seems to me, is the only means by which we
can control the matter. It is possible, I think
-it
may never happen-for a company entitled to this bounty to apply for it and get
it, and then change the rate of wages or the
hours of work of its employees. If there is
a provision on this subject in the law of the
province you may be sure that the employees
will have the benefit of it permanently. Otherwise, a company might secure the bointy and
then change its rate of wages or hours of
employment. This, it seems to me, is the real
reason for this restriction.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 313, an Act to amend the Soldier Settlement Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, I do not
know whether honourable senators have had
occasion to read this Bill. I have received
no brief, but I think I clearly understand
its purport. The Soldier Settlement Act,
Chapter 188 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, as amended by Chapter 48 of the
Statutes of 1928, is further amended by adding
thereto the following sections:
69. (1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act,
on or after the first day of July, 1930, in any
case where the Board, before exercising as
against the land the right of recission of the
agreement with any settler who is in default,
gives to the settler the statutory notice as
required by this Act of its intention to do so,
no recission of the agreement shall take place
where, within the period set forth in the notice,
the settler advises the Board in writing of his
opposition to the proposed action, or where the
Board has otherwise reasons to believe that a
dispute may arise, unless an order of a County
or District Court Judge is issued declaring the
recission of his agreement warranted.
(2) The Governor in Council may make such
regulations as he deems fit for the procedure
in applications to a District or County Court
Judge for an order under this section, and may
by such regulations modify and dispense with
any provisions as to procedure which might
otherwise affect such application, or in the rules
and practice of any such Court, and all such
regulations shall be published forthwith in the
Canada Gazette.
70. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, in
the case of any settler qualified and established
upon the land in accordance with the provisions
of this Act and regulations thereunder, who
bas not abandoned his land and whose agreement with the Board bas not been terminated,
rescinded or assigned, the Board shall credit
the settler's account as on the standard date in
1929 with an amount equal to thirty per cent
of the settler's indebtedness to the Board as on
that date; provided that in the case of any
such settler whose application for revaluation
under section sixty-eight of this Act bas not
been finally disposed of, the settler's indebtedness as on the said standard date shall for the
purposes of this section be deemed to be the
amount owing by him to the Board as on the
said standard date less the amount of the
depreciation in the value of the land, if any,
determined as provided by section sixty-eight
of this Act; provided further that the maximunm amount which may be so credited to any
settler in accordance with the provisions of this
section shall in no case exceed the settler's total
indebtedness to the Board.
71. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, on
or after the fifteenth day of June, 1930, in the
case of any settler holding under purchase from
the Board any live stock to which the Board

SENATE
retains title pending the completion by the
settler of the payment of balance of the purchase price thereof, or on which the Board bas
a charge, lien, or other encumbrance as the
result of any advances made to the settler pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the Board's
right, title and interest in such live stock shall
be released by the Board in favour of the
settler; provided that such release shall in no
way relieve the settler from the payment by
him te the Board of the balance of the purchase price of such live stock renaining unpaid
together with accrued interest, or from the
repayment of any amount secured by a lien,
charge or other encumbrance against such live
stock; provided further that no such release of
title shall be made in favour of the settler
where the settler has with the Board's consent
assigned his interest in such live stock to
another party to whom the Board is obligated
to deliver clear title upon the fulfilment by
such party of certain obligations to the Board.
The principal enactment of the Bill bas to
do with the remission to the settler of 30
per cent of his indebtedness, provided that it
does not make him a creditor of the State.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The Bill is not printed.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have a copy.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: This means an expenditure of probably $10,000,000 or $11,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Most of us have not
received copies of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seems to me, bonourable gentlemen, that a Bill of this character should go to committee. We have not
the slightest idea what it means or what the
effect of it will be. As I understand it, notwithstanding the fact that a year or two
ago we set up machinery whereby returned
soldiers who had gone on the land were given
the fullest opportunity to have their debt decreased, and that work bas been going on at
a cost of millions of dollars to the country,
the Bill now makes a blanket provision to
reduce the indebtedness of every returned
soldier by 30 per cent.
At least we should have an opportunity of
getting in touch with some of the officials of
the Department, in order to find out bow
many people are interested and what sum
of money is going to be involved. I have not
even seen the Bill, and to ask us to deal with
it in this cursory way at this time is very
unreasonable indeed.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Could we not
send it to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I will simply

move the second reading. We can then send
it to the Coimnnittee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND

Hon. Mr. FORKE: This is very drastie
legislation. There is a great deal entailed in
the carrying out of the provisions of this
Bill. I think it would be well for members
of the House to know exactly what remissions have been made to soldier settlers and
something of their present condition. I am
somewhat familiar with this subject, and I
think the Senate should be well informed as
to what has taken place in regard to soldier
settlement work in the Dominion. I cannot
estimate the amount involved, but I know
the present indebtedness will amount to a
very considerable sum.
Furthermore, there is something here-I
have not had time to read it-in regard to
releasing liens on live stock. I know this
Bill bas received a great deal of attention
from the committee of the other House. It
is the result of their consideration, and probably it will be found to be all right. But a
large sum of money is involved, and I think
the Senate should be informed of just what
is entailed.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Probably we
can have some officers of the Department
present at the committee meeting to inform
us just what the cost will be.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

He said: I am quite sure that every bonourable member of this Chamber is familiar
with the general purport of the amendments
that have been made to the Customs Tariff,
Chapter 44 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927. I do not think it is necessary to go
through the hundreds of items that are printed
in the Bill. If any honourable member desires
an explanation in regard to any particular
item, I suggest that be so state. I do not
think it is necessary that the House should go
into Cominttee of the W hole on the Bill,
unless honourable ienbers desire to examine
some of the clauses in detail. I place myself
in the hands of the Senate in this matter.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is there any obiection to giving the third reading now?

MAY 28, 1930

very slim House, but if it is necessary to speed
up things I shall not oppose the passage of
this measure now.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the Report
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
to whom was referred Bill 313, an Act to
amend the Soldier Settlement Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not

know whether the concurrence of the House
in the suggestion made by the right honourable the junior member for Ottawa (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster) a few days ago,
that an explanation should be given by the
chairman of a committee reporting a Bill,
allows me to make a few remarks now. However, I am going to assume that I have
that right, and shall proceed, unless I am forbidden, to say a few words on this Bill.
Some members of the committee requested
that a résumé of the expenses of soldier settIement, together with other particulars, as pre-

373

pared by Col. Rattray, should be laid before
the House. I have that résumé and shall
submit it with the Bill, and ask that it be
placed on Hansard.
Ottawa, April 14, 1930.
The Soldier Settlement Board
Organization
The start of the organization was in 1917,
when legislation was put in force permitting
the Board to make loans by way of mortgage
on lands owned by returned soldiers. This met
the condition existing at that time, because it
was only those who had been discharged
medioally unfit who were coming back to
Canada in 1917.
In 1918 and 1919, after the war was over,
the question of re-establishing returned men
became very acute. It must be remembered
the end of the war caused a collapse of business and manufacturing, and many of the men
who had been in employment before going overseas could not get back into the same positions,
for reasons that I need not enumerate.
The Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, was
passed to allow greater scope in settling
returned soldiers on the land. The number of
returned men applying for homesteads was
really greater than the supply of these, and
also many of the returrned soldiers did not
wish to go into homesteading, but wished to
purchase land in the older parts of the provinces, so power was granted to the Soldier
Settlement Board to purchase farms.
An organization was set up for the purpose
of acquiring these lands and settling these
returned soldiers and purchasing stock and
equiprment for them. This organization was
composed of men who had gone overseas during
the war, and very few of those in the executive
and administrative positions had any previous
knowledge of lands or of leaning money on
same; but it speaks well for those who were
in the organization at that time, that during
1918, 1919, and 1920, about 30,000 returned
soldiers were placed on the land, and of this
number about 25,000 received advances for the
purchase of land, erection of buildings, and
purchase of stock and equipment. In all a
total of about $112,000,000 was loaned during
these years.
Criticism might be made as to why it was
necessary to do this, but I think it is a sound
assertion to make that the effect of soldier
settlement was to act as a safety valve on the
returned soldier problem during these years.
These men were coming back in thousands and
bad to re-establish thenselves, and in their
endeavou-r to do so they always ha.d in their
minds the fact that if they could not establish
themselves in their own positions or in any
other way they could go to the Soldier Settlement Board and have some land purchased for
them and some stock and equipment, and in
this way ensure a livelihood for a few years
until they were able to get themselves placed
in some way more to their liking, The fact
that some 6,000 men took up homesteade which
later on they never were near, is proof of
what I have just stated. Also, the fact that
a considerable number of these men gave up
their lands during the years 1920, 1921, 1922,
and 1923, bears out what I have stated-that
it was a temporary undertaking which enabled
many returned men to tide over a few years

MAY 29, 1930
current values of land under similar conditions
in that district at the time of revaluation.
When a survey was made of those who were
eligible under the 1927 amendment for revaluation, it was found that 10,697 were eligible
to apply. Of this number 8,325 applied for
revaluation; later on, 187 of these withdrew,
so that the net number applying was 8,138, and
2.559 were satisfied with their prices. While
8.138 settlers had applied for revaluation, 8,109
of these applications were completed by the
31st March last, that is, as far as the field
work was concerned. Final revaluation awards
have been made in 7,392 of these cases, and the
average reduction in the original purchase price
lias been 24 per cent. This refers to the
original cost of the land purchases, and does
not take in any revaluation of moneys advanced
for stock and equipment, because stock had
already been reduced 40 (per cent.
Following through by way of summary, it
will be seen that the soldier settler got(1) Free interest on stock and equipment for
2 years;
(2) His whole loan consolidated and given
interest free for from 3 to 4 years;
(3) Reduction in the original cost of stock
of 20 per cent or 40 per cent;
(4) Reduction in the original price of land
averaging 24 per cent.
The effect of all these concessions bas been
that the settler has had the use of the money
advanced to him through the Soldier Settlement Board up to the present time at an interest rate of from 3 per cent to 3j per cent.
The Result of Revaluation
As it lias been stated, the settler bas received
a reduction of 24 per cent, or practically onequarter of the original purchase price of his
land. Taking it on the average one-quarter
reduction on the purchase price of the land
means one-quarter reduction in the interest.
The interest was 5 per cent per annum. Onequarter of Ithis is 11 per cent, so that on the
average the settler is now paying on his
original loan about 3î per cent.
Revaluation, as I have stated, is not filly
completed, but is very nearly so, and what bas
been done shows certain results, as folHows(1) Revaluation in some cases has completely
wiped out thle land indebtedness.
(2) Those whose payments were kept up, or
nearly so, and who got revaluation, find their
annual payments much r'educed thereby.
(3) Those who were badly in arrears. on the
crediting of their awards now find their
annual payments greater than they were before.
In order to understand this, it is well to
explain that when an award was completed
the settler was not only credited with the
amount of the award but also was credited
with the interest on same at 5 per cent from
the lst October, 1925. This was the termination of the interest free period on his consolidated loan. After he had been credited
with the amount of his award, together with
-the interest, as stated, then the balance of his
account was a'mortized over the remaining
period of his loan. Where a settler's loan was
badly in arrears, after receiving the credit of
his award and interest from the lst October,
1925, the balance of his loan was reamortized,
but the effeot of his arrears was sueh that bis
payments were greater than they were originally. This created a situation that was not
intended through revaluation, and the Board,

375

in order to meet this situation that was thus
created for those who previously had allowed
their aceounts to get into arrears, adopted the
policy of ask-ing, for a stated number of years,
that the settler pay in-terest only and taxes
and insurance, deferring principal payments. A
survey of the cases coming under this policy,
and which the Board grade as 3 and 4, has
shown that there are different reasons for their
failure to keep their accounts in good standing,
and among them might be enumerated(1) Their original purohase price much too
high;
(2) Climatie conditions affecting crops;
(3) Not using fara for best revenue-producng purposes;
(4) Certain physical disabilities;
(5) 'Settler unsuited for farm life.
In all these cases except some in (5) of the
above, readjustnent was made through revaluation, and I would say that a safe estimate
would be that in these cases a 40 per cent
reduction on an average bas been made in the
purchase price of the land; in some cases very
much higher. Forty per cent is two-fifths reduction of the principal. This means two-fifths
reduction of the per cent paid, which reduces
it to 3 per cent on the original loan. It is now
felt thiat with the reduction of the original
purchase price, the asking for interest only will
give a number of these grades 3 and 4 settlers
an opportunity to place themselves in such position that they will be able later on to undertake the payment of part of the principal. Of
course they have the opportunity at any time
of reducing their principal indebtedness if they
are able to do so. It is expected that with
these decreased payments, the settler will use
the balance that might be asked for in improving his revenue-producing situation, either by
bringing more land under cultivation or by
purchasing more stock. I might remark here
that since revaluation is about completed as
far as the field work is concerned, the Board's
Field Supervisors are now giving more definite
attention to these classes of settlers, in giving
them advice and direction and supervision
toward the ends just named above.
I have also, in very much briefer form,
sone figures that are decidedly pertinent,
which I think the members of this House and
the country at large should have.
The net amount advanced to soldier settlers
by the Farm Settlement Board is $108,287,000.
There has been repaid by soldier settlers on
that account, in round numbers, $30,000,000.
This leaves a net investment made by Canada
in the soldier settlement lands and eq'uipment,
of $78,287,000.
Canada's equity in that $78,000,000 has been
very materially reduced, as follows: There has
been written off by revaluation in 1922 and 1927,
$10,288,000. The estimated loss on the resale
of lands recovered-that is, lands given back
or abandoned-is $8,000,000. The actual loss
on live stock is $6,000,000. The anticipatory
loss on live stock and equipment paid for by
the Department is $2,500,000. The amount
of interest remitted to date is $10,000,000. The
estimated loss of interest which lias not yet

376

SENATE

been entirely lost is $4,000,000. The Bill that
is now reported resuits in a net decrease in
the equity that the country now has of
$11,000,000 or more; probably between $11,000,000 and $15,000,000.
These losses mean
a reduction to date of $52,000,000.
There must be added to that the total cost
of the administration of the Department to
date, which is $19,000,000. Therefore, in the
administration of this Department, the total
loss on the investment Canada has made is
$71,000.000.
When you take into consideration the fa.ct
that we have an equity of onýly $78,000,000,
and that in the past ten years it has cost
$71,000,000 to take care of that investment,
you will sec that there is not very much left.
There is, however, still owing to the Department at this date, by soldier settlers, $38,867,000. This amount would be reduced by the
passage of this BiH to the extent of $11,666,000; se, if the Bill passes, Canada will have
an equity of $27,000,000 in the original investment, made ten years ago, of $108.000,000.
But in the meantimo Canada has lost enormously in interest and in costs of administratien. The enactment of this mcasuro dots
not mean that those who are behind in their
payments, particularly those in classes 3 and
4, will pay the amounts overdue. Undoubtedly
a large number of farms now held by the
soldiers will revert to the Board. The present
annual cost of administration of this Department is somothing over $700.000 a yoar, and
there are still sixteen years in which this
expenditure will bo made, resulting in an
additional administration cost of $11,000,000.
While this Bill has been favourably reported
uipon by the committet, I want to say that I
am absolutely opposed to it, on the ground
that it is not in the interest of justice nor of
equity. The Bill would not do justice to the
returned men as a whole, because, after all,
only a very small percentage of them are
interested in the matter; and of those who are
now on farms 7,400 have kept their payments
up to date, or practically so. These men
and their holdings would be first-class risks
for any mortgage or loan company in Canada.
There are approximately 3,000 men coming
within what is called group 3 who have paid a
considerable portion of their dues and are in
reasonably good condition. Whether they will
be able to carry on satisfactorily will depend
entirely on crop and stock conditions. Some
of them carry on fruit farming, others have
stock farms, while others are operating mixed
farms. It is reasonable to believe that a large
proportion of these 3,000 men will make good.
There are 1,600 men in class 4, who are considered by the Department te be rather hopelen. Mr. BLACK.

less cases. I do net believe this Bill would
make the slightest difference to those men in
class 4, because they are se deeply in the hole.
They have demonstrated their inability to
operate successfully the farms on which they
are placed, and the obvious inference is that
they will abandon the farms, which will be
handed baclc to the Farm Settlement Board.
I said before the committee, and I desire to
repeat. that it would be better for the country
to turn those farms over completely to the men
who are now on them, to abolish the Farm
Settlement Board, and to transfer the rest of
the Board's work to the Department of the
Interior or seme other administrative branch
of the Government. If this were done we
should at least be rid of a large proportion of
this annual expenditure of $700,000. I am quite
aware that to take this action would net be
altogether fair to everyone concerned, but it
would at least relieve the Government of a
large annual expenditure for the carrying on
of what we might almost call a needless work.
I have already said that the Bill is neither
just nor generous. It is not generous, because
a large number of these men, 7,400 of them,
are doing well and are only slightly behind in
their payments. If this Bill were passed, these
men would get a reduction of 30 per cent on
only the comparatively small balances they
owe, whereas the 1,600 men in class 4 would
get a reduction of 30 per cent on almost their
total liabilitv. In other words, the Bill would
bonus the men who have not been able to
make a success, and penalize those who have
been successful.
The mon on these farms are not pensioners,
but returned soldiers. In the past, by the
remission of interest and the revaluation of
their lands, we have virtually bonused them
to the extent of approximately 835,000,000.
It is quite true that they were entitled to a
part of that benefit, because their farms, stock
and equipment were, as a rule, bought at
peak prices, but it was considered that the
remissions that were made in 1922, and particularly those made in 1927, brought about
the necessary adjustment and reduced the
valuation of the farms to the prices prevailing. The sum of $10,288,000 was involved in
that; so there still remains about $20,000,000
given as a bonus to these men. Now the Bill
proposes to bonus them to the extent of a
further $11,000,000. We have a large number
of returned men in Canada. Why should we
give special favours to those who elected
to go on the land? Why should we give
them $20,000,000 plus $11,000,000, a total
of $31,000,000, unless we are prepared to give
all other returned soldiers a cash bonus? If
we pass this legislation we are going to have

MAY 29, 1930
demands year by year for increases in certain
payments, and I prophesy that before many
years longer we shall be asked for a cash
bonus for every returned man in the country.
1 arn a returned man and arn in full sympathy with those who served overseas, but I
amrn ot in favour of injustice being rneted out
either to returned men or to the people of
Canada, whether before or after an election.
I do not believe tha!t the Parliarnent of Canada would be doing its duty to the people of
the country if we passed this Bill, which would
resuit in an additional bonus of $11,000,000
to a smnall proportion of our returned men. I
believe it is bad legisiation, and even thougli
no honourable member agrees with me, I shahl
vote against the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honourable Chairman of tbe Committee on Banking
and Commerce (Han. Mr. Black) desîre to
divide the House on the motion to adopt
the report or on the motion for third reading?
I do not know at what stage my honourable friend intends to register his vote against
tbe Bill. If the report of tbe Comrnittee is to
be adopted now, I shall not say anything further, but if the report is to be cha9lleng-ed
I shall have a few remarks to make.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Judging from the action
of the cornmittee and the silence that has9
greeted my remlarks in this Chamber, it is
clear tbat tl•err are very few memihers who
would desire to vote as I intend ta, although
the majority of members, I feel1, are really
of the same opinion as mysei1f. It would be
useless to ýdivide the House if honourable
members are alrnost unanirnously in favour
of the Bill.
Honourable
R. DANDURAND:
Hon.
members, I take it for gra.nted that if we
aidopt the report of the committee we shahl
vote for the third reading of the Bill; sa
an*y honourable member who lias remarks to
make might make themn now.
This Bil.l results from the work of a committee whie-h made a unanirnous report to
the other Chamber. The Government had
promised tbat it woul be governed. by the
conclusions of that cansmittee-I suppose it
implied the unanimous conclusions-and that
it wou'ld embody them in a Bill. The Governmtent lias done that, and I understand
the measure has heen unanimousîy approved
in the other House. Now the Senate is asked
ta give its sanction.
1 confess that I could nat follow the work
of tbe comimittee of the other House in dealing with particular questions in respect ta
advances ta soldiers who went an the land.

377

It is truc that Parliament lias done much ta
relieve the burdens of those soldiers who
took over the land when the prices were
higli. I have not the figures before me, but
I believe that reva.luations were made in
corne 7,000 or 8,000 cases. It n'ow appears
that the 12,000 soldiers who are debtors ta
the Settlernent Board and t.he Dominion
treasury may be divided into four grades.
The first and second groups comprise those
who have ýdone welh, and who, although they
perbaps have not paid ail their dues, are in
good stan-ding. Týhose in the third class are
harely holding their own. The Chairman of
the Board told us that it was hoped some of
themn would make good, thougli a certain
number would feul. The fourth class comprises
mien wbo have given little ground for hope
that they will be able ta maintain themselves
on the land. The question which apiparently
was in the mind of ane. honourable member
wbo attended the meeting of the committee
thîs m.arning was why 30 per cent shou.ld ho
deducted from the indehtedness of al1 soldier
settilers-those who bave miade goad on the
land and those who have not. We were told
that it would be a very difficuit matter ta
draw distinctions hetween variaus classes;
that to do sa would necessitate a detailed
and oost.ly inquiry, and that it lias been feit
that -aithougli ail the settlers are noýt asking
for the 30 per cent deduction as provided for
by the Bill, a -large proportion of theîn-I
would say some 50 per cent-would have their
morale strengthened and wouýld face the
future with greater hope if the relief contemp.lated in the Bill were given.
Undoubtedly many of the accounts in the

and the farmns of the men in these classes will
bce returned ta the Settiernent Board. In other
words, the Treasury Board will incur many
lasses in cannection with the t-hird and fourth
will cost to grant a 30 pet

cent rernis-sion ta the settlers of the first and
second classes, I arn unable ta say. I confess
that we are facing a, very difficuit prablemn.
If we remit $11,000,000 bY this Bill, ithe
country will be a creditor ta the extent of
527,000,000. To colleet this large sum wauld
be a costhy process. The country entered upan
a perilous adventure when it initiated the
soldier setthement schemne. If the Gaverament of any country embarks upon any such
plan, whereby maney is advanced dire-cthy
ta its own citizens, its experience is generally
ahong the hine that ours bas heen. I arn not
very hopeful that we shaîl lie able ta salvage
the whole $27,000,000. It is a question whether
Parliament shouhd not apply itself ta the

MAY 29, 1930
Honourable menbers will recall the difficult
situation the Government were placed in at
that particular time in their efforts to do
something for the men who were coming back
and were seeking to be fitted again into civil
life. The fact that the Government at that
time were able to find suitable employment
for 30,000 of those men and place them, at
least temporarily, was of great benefit to the
country at large. They had been at the front
for a number of years, living under peculiar
circumstances and in the midst of turmoil
and stress and the tragedy of war. When they
came back many of them, no doubt, pictured
to themselves the quiet countryside and
thought that it would be an ideal change te
go on the farm. A large number went on
the land who were never suited for agricultural work, and under the circumstances it
is not to be wondered at that many of them
failed.
It has been pointed out that in the first
instance too much was paid for the land and
that too high prices were paid for stock and
implements. There had been one or two
boom years, and prices were in excess of real
values.
There is one point that I think bas perhaps
been lost sight of-the economic value of
those men who went on the land. No doubt,
placing them there cost a great deal of money,
but it must not be forgotten that the produce
of those farms added many millions of dollars
of new wealth to the country.
This proposition cannot be treated as a
purely business affair. It is a psychological
problem. As the Minister who came in contact with many of the transactions of the
Soldier Settlement Board I may say that I
never knew of a case of a soldier being dispossessed that was not foIlowed immediately
by a flood of letters from the district protesting against the idea that lie and his family
should be moved frem the land. If a mortgage com.pany or an ordinary farmer had been
concerned, nothing would have been heard
about it, but as it was the Government, the
people wanted these men to be treated in the
most liberal manner.
The honourable the leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has mentioned the
condition of the agricultural industry at the
present time. I am a farmer and know
exactly what conditions are. I think that without being egotistical I may say that up to a
few years ago I might have been called a
very successful farmer. I have been in politics to some extent during the last few years.
I am not ashamed to tell this House that
during the past year or two the balance from
my farm--and it is a large one-has been on

379

the wrong side of the ledger. I have often
remarked to the Chairman of the Soldier
Settlement Board: "I do not see how those
fellows are going to pay for their farms and
carry on under present conditions."
While I quite agree with some of the
remarks made by the honourable senator who
has objected to this Bill (Hon. Mr. Black),
I think the committee that had this matter
under consideration in all its details took
what might be called a rough-and-ready way
of solving the problem. It is a problem that
is not easily solved. If agriculture were flourishing and any man who chose could make a
success of farming, the problem would not be
so difficult, but many of these men have to
be nursed along and treated according to
their circumstances.
I do not intend to vote against the Bill;

I know it has received very careful consideration at the hands of the committee that had
it under advisement; but I cannot say that I
am entirely satisfied with it. I do not think
it is altogether just, or that the action proposed can under any circumstances be
defended on the grounds of pure justice. I
think a better way would have been to consider each individual case on its merits. That,
of course, would necessitate a reliable tribunal
to take everything into consideration. The
men who are doing their best should receive
every encouragement; those who are careless
and indifferent should not receive the same
treatment.
A good deal has been said about the cost
of the administration of the Soldier Settlement Board. Of course the cost of that administration has decreased very much since
its inception. At one time it was perhaps
double what it is to-day. The staff, I know,
was more than double. I do not think it
would be possible to do away with the Board
or to> get along without an administrative
board of some kind. It is not necessary that
a separate department should be established.
The Board has been created by an Act of
Parliament .that can be changed at any time,
and this work might be carried on by a large
committee working under another department.
At the present time, in a sort of way, it is
under the Department of Immigration. It
would be quite possible, in connection with
some other department, to have an executive
board looking after the soldier settlement
scheme and the 3,000-family scheme. It would
net be necessary to have such a large staff
as we have at present. During the three years
that I was in office it was my constant endeavour to reduce the Board as far as practicable, but hon1ourable gentlemen who are
familiar with governmental departments will

380

know how difficult it is to reduce staffs. Unto discharge employees, many of whom have
less that is done by Act of Parliament it is given ten years or more of service. I think
well nigh impossible. It would be possible,
they can be absorbed in other departments
however, to reduce that staff to one-half of
of the Government. Of course, as honourable
its present size, and it could still render good
members know, most of the Soldier Settleservice under a responsible Minister. I place ment Board employees were engaged on a
stress upon that point. The Board as a
temporary basis; they do not come under the

for ahl the legisiation that gees through this
ffouse. Will any great harmn be done if the
Bill is allowed te stand over tili next session?
'Let us take ne action until we have given
the question careful censideration.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable senaters,
this Bill and other seldier legislatien which
has recently passed through this House are
evidence ef the fact that we have net finished
paying for the war yet. It strikes me that
we are very much in the position of ene whe
has grasped a red hot poker and finds it
inconvenient te hang on, but impossible te
let go. The facts produced before the committee, of which I was a member, showed
that the assets of the Soldier Settiement
seheme have been reduced te, practically
$27,000,000. The cost of administering the
Department, which alse handles the British
immigration scheme, is over 3700,000 annually.
A simple calculation will show that before
very long the cost of administration will have
exceeded the value of the assets that remain.
The henourable chairman of the committee
<Hon. Mr. Black) has suggested that it might
be advisable te grant a release te ail the
soldier settlers and wash our hands of the
whole thing. I question whether that would
be a goed policy, because it would enable
ahl other soldiers who served te complain that
they had net received equal treatment from
the Government. But, on the other hand,
is it net a fact that we have te some extent
already given special consideration te the
seldier settlers? As 1 understand it, we have
already wiped eut a capital indebtedness of
some $20,000,000. This Bill proposes te give
a further credit of 30 per cent of each settler's
indebtedness; in other words, te give further
consideration te soldier settiers as compared
with other soldiers.
It was stated this ýmorning that if we were
a board of -directoirs of a financial corporation,
faced with a statement -of the kind that was
presented te us, the logical course wouJ.d ha
te wipe eut the remnaining indebtedness altogether, or te sell the assets te a mortgage
company and let thema make the collections.
1 do net think that we coul.d consider the
policy of turning the assets over te a mortgage eompany or te money leuders who would
press the soldiers for payment. That would
net be £air, and the people of the country
would net tolerate it. We are fa.ced now
-with the alternative of adopting the report
of the cornmittee and passing the Bill or, as
the honourable gentleman froa _King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) bas suggested, holding the Bill
over until next session. If we adopt the Bill
we write off 30 per cent of the indebtedness.

m

In my opinion, we migbt as wedl consider it
already written off; so we might as weJl pas
the Bill.
The oom.mittee spent about an hour and a
half in consideration of the Bill. Fromn the
discussion that has taken place in this Chamber, following the presentation of the commi ttee's report, it is clear that we could
profitably eqpend a much longer period in
examining into this whole question; and if
we did spend more time on. it we miglit be
able to arrive at some better solution than the
present measure. Aocording to the statement
made by my hon-ourable friened fromn Brandon
(Hon. Mr. Forke) this Board bas beau run as
the tail end of the Department of Immigration, which DeipartÂment has been utterly unmindful of the volume of the transactions
carried on by the Board and the large amount
of money at stake.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not thinc that is
exactly what I said. Parliament created the
8oldier Settlement Board and endowed it
with power to function without consulting
even. the Minister of the Department. Wbat
1 intended to point out was that the Minister
was responaible to Parliament for the transactions of the Board, whi.ch is not reqired
to ýconsult him.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The transactions of the
Soldier Settiement Board are large enough te
warrant the llrst-hand attention of some
ýresponsible department. I think our best
,course is to pass the Bill, and if we are in
,earnest in our desire to improve the existing
situation, next session we eau appoint a special
,com.mittee of conapetent business men-we
-have plcnty of them amnong -honourable members-to take up this matter with a view to
assisting the Governmeut in bringing order
ýout of chaos. I do not think we should
refuse to pass the Bill It may not be a
financial burden on the Governrnent, because
ýnext session, when we shahl have -plenty of
ýtime, we- may be able te arrive aýt a satisfactory
solution of the whoie problem.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:- Honourable senators, I
tbink it is plain that there is a widespread
opinion among honourable members that this
is poor legisiation. I should like te suggest te
the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that the Government
should consider the advisability of doing away
with the Soldier Settlement Board. The Board
looks after about 12,100 soldier settiers and
a number of English settlers-fewer than 3,000,
1 tbinkHon. Mr. FOIIKE: Practically 3,000.

382

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Somewhat more than
2,900, 1 think. The administrative costs of
the Board for 1930 are estimated at $700,000.
1 think that if the Board were abolisbed and
the supervision of the English settiers were
turned over to the Department, at least threeqùarters of the work, that the Board is now
doing would be eliminated.
1 understand
there is no officiai responsibility assumed for
the purchase of equipment and stock by the
English settiers, for instance; so the work
of looking after these immigrant settiers would
be very smali, compared with the total
activities of the present Board. The Board's
emiployees, whether temporary or permanent,
couid probably be absorbed into other departmonts, so that ne hardship wouid be worked
on any of the returned men employed. The
annual cost of the Board's operations bas run
up as high as $1,500,000. The sum estimated
for 1930 is, I thiîîk, less than bas been expended by the Board in any other year. So
it is apparent that a hinge saving could be
effccted if the Board wcre aholished. I
guarantee that if the work of looking after
the Eniglish settiers were assigned to the
Departmnent of the Interior, or some other
administrative branch, the ceat of looking
after those settiers should not be more than
8100,000 a year.
I understood the leader on this side of the
lieuse (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
expressed
objection te wiping eut the indcbtcdness of
the soldier settiers, on the grciund that it
would be an injustice. As far as the 12,000
soldier settlcrs are conecrnied, it wvould be
doing them the grcatest justice possible,
a1lthough other soîliers, who had nlot gone on
th(, land, would not bc gix en any corresponding favour. The soldier settiers would no
longrr be subjected te caîls from officiai collecters on dates wvhen the intercst feul due.
If a soldier sold a cow, bie would nlot have the
moey taken aïway froim him as a contribution
1owards the balance owing to the Govcrnment.
HP would bP gix en comrpIcte contrai ever bis
lands andi would be in a better position than
ever before te mnake good.
I (lisagrec withi the statement that bas been
inade here this afternoen that the wiping off
of 30 per cent of the indebtedness of every
solier settier xvould net result in anv ioss of
iioncv to the Governmient, because tbe mioney
îs gene anywav.
That is an erreneous statement. It is net gene in the cases of the 7,'400
inen wbe have kept up their paynients. In
their cases the asscts are as good as gold.
I want te make that point clear. We must
be fair in our statemient of facts. This Bill
îvould resuit in the wiping off of $11,000,000,
IIcn. 'AIr. FORKElh.

and of this sum probably $2,000,000, at tbe
very outside, would be a less in any event.
Tbere would still be $9,000,000 of assets which.
wouid net be destroyed if this Bill were nlot
passed.
I do net like this Bill at ail. I think it is
very unjust to the people of the country, and
espeeially unfair te tbe returned men ini
generai, wbo wvill flot henefit by it. 1 arn
satisfied tbat the returned men wiil se regard
it. I hope tbat during the coming recess tbe
Government xvill take into consideration the
advisabiiity of wiping tbe siate dlean by turning over te tbe soidier settiers ail their lands
and equipment.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: May 1 ask for some
information? We bave had figures as te valuations sbowing that about $37,000,000 is still
lef t. Is there anytbing te show bow mucb is
oxving from this family settlement scheme and
from tbe civilians wbo bougbt lands?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Those figures are net
included in this statement at ail. These figures
are applicable only te the soldiers placed on
the ]and.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: There must bc a
large amouint owin.- from these other people.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There are a few million
dollars. I de net tbink, however, tîxat wvould
aiffect the situation at ail. Fewer than 3,000
setlers are comieg in under this other scbc me.
The amount is net very large.
Hon. '-Ir. ROBINSON: Would it bc 825,000,000?
Hon. Mr. BLACI(: Pcrhaps the honolirable

objeetionable. I am. opposed to the repeal of

that section in toto.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose there
is no objection to taking the second reading.
No one will be bound by the principle of the
Bill. It is practically an omnibus Bill, covering a multitude of subjeots.
It is underHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
stood that by the second reading no one is
committed te the prineciple of the Bill.
H-on. Mr. BELCOURT: In the Bill as introduced in the Commons, sections 3, 4, 5, 6
and 7 covered matters deait with in a Bill
with regard to firearms which was introduced
in this House by me several times, and which
was passed, unanimously, I think, on three

or possibly four occasions. 1 regret very
much that this Bill was noit taken into consideration et an earlier "at by the other
House. That regret is occasioned. fot by
the fact that I was the authvr of the Bill that
passed this Chamber, but largely because,
notwithstanding the necessity for team. play
between the two Houses in marbters of this
kind, the Commons hiave flot given the consideration thaît I think they should have
given to a measure approved so often by the
Senate. It was tmquestionably one of very
great importance
I repeat what 1 have said many times, that
unlees Parliament deals with the revolver in
ibis country the time will corne when it will
no longer be able to deal with it. Across the
line, in the republic to the south of us, the
revolver is master. It is admitted generally
that the situation there is hopeless. If Parlhamtent does flot take some action to control
the situation in Canada, we shall find before
many years have elapsed that we shall no
longer be able te cope with it. I protest
against the negligence or dilatoriness in another quarter in dealing with a measure
passed by this House on four different occasions.
Hon. Mr. DAMD'URAND:
Minister of Justice said-

I think the

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes; the Minister
of Justice said this
:
Clauses 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 would enaet a Bill
-which bas passed the Senate on three
oecasions concerning firearms and licensing of
weapons. That Bill was submitted one year
to a eormnittee of the Hotise, passed the crnmittee, but w-as not proceeded with by the
wiiole House. I admit thart this involves a
rather important and considerable change, and
some members have represented to me that at
this late stage of the session it migbit be better
to leave the miatter over for another year, when
I expert we shall ail be here again in our
respective capacities. Therefore I would ask
that sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 be dropped.
Then, on motion of Hon. Mr. Cardin, those
five sections wvere dropped. Hence they are
not; in the Bill before us.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl was
read the second time.
OONSIDEREIY IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Oommittee on the Bill.

SENATE
that we passed the other day we gave to customs and excise officers the power, in the
exercise of their duty, to examine witnesses

provision in the same regard.

Hon. SMEATON WHITE:

I would move

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I second the
motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have moved
a similar amendment on two or three occasions. My motions did not meet with success.
I do not intend to re.peat what I said at those
times. AH I desire is to state that clause 98
was enacted in 1919, when what seemed to be
a dangerous campaign was carried on in a
certain part of the West. Section 98 is exceptional legislation, and is quite harsh in some
of its provisions.
It has been considered
that Canada can well afford to return now to
the general law and wi'pe out exceptional
legislation carried through hastily, in a period
of excitement and fear. This provision has
not been utilized, and it is quite apparent
that the respect for law on the part of our
people is such as to justify Canada in returning to the old common law of England. The
matters referred to are covered by our statutes
and by the common law.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
may I ask?

By

what statutes,

Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: By our Criminal
Code, under the clauses concerning sedition.
Some years ago a committee of the British
Parliament attemp.ted to define sedition. but
came to the conclusion that the interpretation
of the term by the courts from decade to
decade was involved in a multitude of cases
and would be difficult to define. The term
is so broad and so elastie that it gives the
authorities and the courts power to deal with
any overt act that threatens the peace of the
country and the sovereignty of the Crown.
lu order to make sure that the definition of
treason and sedition should te consistent
with democratic institutions and should not
prevent the frecdom of speech in criticism of
government, it was deerned proper to make an
exception modifying to a certain degrce the
connon law of England on the subject.
That exception was wiped out when the
amendments of 1919 came into force. If ve
rctore the law as it stood before 1919, by
Hon.

Mr.

BELCOURT

repealing clause 98, it will be proposed that
we re-enact the former section 133 as section
133A. It reads:
No one shall be deemed to have a seditious
intention only because he intends in good
faith,(a) to show that His Majesty has been
misled or mistaken in his measures; or,
(b) to point out errors or defects in the
government or constitution of the United
Kingdom, or of any part of it, or of Canada
or any province thereof, or in either House of
Parliament of the United Kingdom or of
Canada, or in any legislature, or in the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty's
subjects to attempt to procure, by lawful means,
the alteration of any matter in the state; or,
(c) to point out, in order to their renoval,
matters which are producing or have a tendency
to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will
between different classes of His Majesty's
subjects.
As the courts had such great power to curb
sedition and treason, it was provided in this
way that there should be no limitation of
legitimate freedom of speech in the criticism
of a government. In normal times we should
respect British traditions by re-enacting this
section, which prier to 1919 was deemed to
be sound law. I have previously discussed this
subject on a much wider scale. I am suggesting now that we return to the status quo
ante. This country was able to cope with
sedition before 1919, and if we re-enact the
law that was found sufficient at tha-t time
Canada will continue to maintain peace and
order within its borders. As the law now
stands it is regarded by many people as a
threat against their freedom of speech, and
I believe that the time is opportune for the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do net intend
to go into this matter in great detail, but I
have discussed the subject several times beforeHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend will allow me-I do net know
whether it is a proper thing to state-I
should like to say that this Bill comes to us
after much discussion in the other House,
which finally was unanimously in faveur of
the repeal of section 98.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
It is equally
truc that it has been unanimously resolved
in this House tha.t section 98 should not be
repealed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Did my honourable friend say it was unanimously resolved?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
If I said
"unanimously" I did so in error and I withdraw that word. The proposal to repeal
section 98 bas often been rejected in this

MAY 29, 1930
House after the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has advocated the repeal in his usual skilful and
forceful manner.
I expected another member to be here to
speak in opposition to this proposal, but in
his absence I shall make a few remnarks. I
shall not give a lengthy repetition of arguments that are familiar to most honourable
members.
The honourable leader of the Government
has stated that no one has suffered in consequence of section 98 being on the Sta-tute
Book, because there has been no prosecution under it. If no one has been injured by
the section, why should it be repealed? The
section is like a danger sign to those who
otherwise might seek to commit offences
which it prohibits. It is perfectly true that
the cause of the enactment of the section was
the Winnipeg strike, but that in itself is
no reason why we should repeal the section
now. If honourable members will permit,
I will read section 98:
98. (1) Any association, organization, society
or corporation, whose professed purpose or
one of whose purposes is to bring about any
governmental, industrial or economic change
within Canada by use of force, violence or
physical injury to person or property, or by
threats of such injury, or which teaches,
advocates, advises or defends the use of force,
violence, terrorism, or physical injury to person or property, or threats of such injury, in
order to accomplish such change, or for any
other purpose, or which shall by any means
prosecute or pursue such purpose or professed
purpose, or shall so teach, advocate, advise or
defend, shall be an unlawful association.
I know there is no honourable member of
this House who would defend any such association as that.
(2) Any property, real or personal, belonging or suspected to belong to an unlawful association, or held or suspected to be held by any
person for or on behalf thereof may, without
warrantThat is the only unusual feature-"without
warrant."
seized or taken possession of by any
-be
person thereunto authorized by the Commissioner of the Royal Ganadian Mounted Police,
.and may thereupon be forfeited to His Majesty.
My only comment upon that is that I
think we can trust the Commissioner of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police not to take
unnecessary action in this connection.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: With Teference to subsection 1 of that section, what is the meaning of the words "by any means," in the
latter part of the clause?
They mean
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
any of the acts contemplated and specifically
set ,out in the section.

385

Hon. Mr. FORKE: Who are judges as to
that?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Any ordinary
judge, as will be seen when other subsections
of the section are read.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: That is pretty wide.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I grant that,
but in my opinion it was intended to be
No innocent man will be affected.
wide.
There has not been a prosecution under this
clause since it was enacted in 1919; so there
can be no complaint of harsh administration.
(3) Any person who acts or professes ta act
as an officer of any such unlawful association,
and who shall sell, speak, write or publish anything as the representative or professed representative of any such unlawful -association, or
become and continue to be a member thereof,

or about his person or elsewhere, any badge,
insignia, emblem, banner, motto, pennant, card,
button or other device, whatloever, indicating
or intended to show or suggest that he is a
member of or in anywise -associated with any
such uniawful association, or who shall contribute anything as dues or otherwise, ta it or
to any one for it, or who shall solicit subscriptions or contrlibutions for it, shall be guilty
of an offence and liable to .imprisonment for
not more than twenty years.
(4) In any prosecution under this section,
if it be proved that the person charged has
(a) attended meetings of an unlawful association; or
(b) spoken publicly in advoacy of an unlawful association; or
(c) distributed literature of an unlawful
association by circulation through the Post
Office mails of Canada, or otherwise,
it shall be presunied, in the absence of proof
to the contrary,The accused gets his opportunity in court
to prove his innocence.
-that lie is a member of such unlawful association.
(5) Any owner, lessee, agent or superintendent oi any building, room, premises or
place, who knowingly permits therein any meeting oi an unlawful association or any subsidiary
association or branch or committee thereof, or
any assemblage of persons who teach, advocate,
advise or defend the use, without authority of
the law, of force, violence or physical injury
to person or property, or threats of such injury,
shall be guilty of an offence under this section
and shall be liable to a fine of not more than
five thousand dollars or to imprisonment for
not more than five years, or to both fine and
imprisonment.
(6) If any judge of any superior or county
court, police or stipendiary magistrate, or any
justice of the peace, is satisfied by information
on oath that there is reasonable ground for
suspecting that any contravention of this section has been or is about to be committed, lie
may issue a search warrant under his hand,
authorizing any peace officer, police officer, or
constable with such assistance as he may
require, to enter at any time any premises or
place mentioned in the warrant, and to search

may be carried away and may be forfeited to

That is to be done only on the order of a
judge of any superior or county court, police
or stipendiary magistrate, or any justice of

(7) Where, by this section, it is provided
that any property may be forfeiited to His
Majesty, the forfeiture may be adjudged or
declared by any judge of any superior or county
court, or by any police or stipendiary magistrate, or by any justice of the peace, in a
summary manner, and by the procedure provided by Part XV of this Act,That refers to summary procedure, I think.

It goes without saying that no honourable
member would defend any offence contemplated under that subsection.

to circulate or distribute any book, newspaper,
perieolical, pamphlet, picture, paper, circular,

That speaks for itself.

I submit that section 98 causes injury to no
one. It was enacted at a time of stress. There
still are certain portions of Canada where the
strong arm of the law is necessary to prevent
offences contemplated in this section. I am
informed that in out-of-the-way places there
are people who are constantly, if net openly,
advocating a change of government by force.
I repeat that the section is a danger signal to
anyone who might be tempted to commit any
of the offences enumerated in the various
subsections, with a view to bringing about
by force a change of government, or an industrial or economic change. On five or six
previous occasions this House has decided
that section 98 should net be repealed. It
bas been felt that the section served a useful
purpose in certain communities, particularly
lu places where there are foreigners who are
not accustomed to our democratic form of
government, and who come from countries
where constitutional changes are brought about
by means of revolution.
Hon.
JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I am personally unconcerned whether
this particular section is adopted or net, but
I should net be doing justice to the position
I hold, I should be disregarding the experiences that have been mine in years gone by,
if I did net express my views on this matter.
I think I may say I have the distinction-if
distinction it be-of having looked in the eyes
of a greater number of men in the class
against which section 98 is aimed than has
any other honourable member-or any dozen
honourable members. I have met men of that
elass in various parts of Canada and the
United States. In my judgment this section
and the discussions on it in Parliament have
donc more than anything else in Canada to
dignify and hold up to the approbation of bis
fellows any individual who belonged to the
class against which the section is aimed. There
are certain people-I have met thousands of
them-who admire the fellow who dares to
defy this or any other regulation, to take the
law into his own hands-in brief, to snap his
fingers at the law. That is exactly what has
been going on under section 98. In the highways and the byways, and in the back parts
of the towns and cities of Canada, there have

MAY 29, 1930
been individuals without the manly courage to
come out openly and promulgate their ideas.
They have been getting together and popping off and blowing off in defiance, maybe,
of the provisions of section 98, but doing no
harm. They would not be the heroes that
many of them have become were it not that
section 98 is on the Statute Book of Canada;
and it has been admitted by the honourable
gentleman who has just taken his seat that
no prosecutions have taken place under that
section.
I happened to spend a considerable time in
Winnipeg in the strenuous days of 1919, and
I think that possibly I know as much about
what occurred there as any other man in
Canada. I remember going to Winnipeg with
the Minister of Labour, in his car, and upon
arrival there at 10 o'clock in the evening, going in to a meeting of several hundred men,
many of whom I had known for years as outstanding Canadians, loyal and British to the
core. During that meeting, at which I stayed
until about 4 o'clock in the morning, when I
was asked to retire, I saw many of those men
going about with tears streaming down their
faces, and acting like insane persons, simply
because they were all heated up and excited
about a lot of rubbish that amounted to nothing. Those men came to their senses, as 99
per cent of such men do if you let them pop
off and keep up their foolish talk until they
find out just how foolish it is. A farmer walking through a barnyard does not dodge with
fear when the gander with his wings outspread and his bill open runs at him.
For more than thirty years I have been
coming into contact with the irrational and
foolish arguments of people who want to do
this, that, and the other thing, which have
never been done before and will never be
done in the future-things that are going to
revolutionize the world. It is my experience
that the only proper and safe way to treat
them and their felilows is to let them go as
far as they like. If I am any judge of suc
matters-and I imagine that I am-it would
be entirely impossible to show that an association was formed for the purposes mentioned
in section 98. I know that there are some
people without the courage to back up in
any way their aims and desires. Such people
may have in the back of their heads some
of the things that are contemplated in the
section. The only way to deal with them is
to smoke them out and let them explode their
ideas in the open, if they do so with reasonable decency. That will show them and their
fellows how foolish they are in their views.
2425--25

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: How about
Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: It would not be
proper for me to say exactly what I think
about Winnipeg. It would have been better to
go right up to the hornet's nest, so to speak.
If that had been done more-if those men
had been looked in the eye, there might have
been less trouble. The incident in Winnipeg
took place, as we all know, when throughout
the length and breadth of Canada, in every
walk of life, the people were seething with
uncertainty and excitement. Under the circumstances was it not only natural that
thousands of poor unfortunates who were facing the uncertainty of the future should act
in the way they did, and can we not excuse
them? I think we were fortunate indeed that
in 1919 we had not more dissension and popping off; and I believe that, either with or
without this particular section, we shall never
have a repetition of the conditions that then
prevailed. Since that time some effective
educational campaigns have been carried on
by those who, I think, understand the class
of individual aimed at in this section. So
again I say that I am not at all concerned
whether this body does as it has done on
former occasions or not; but my earnest advice to this House would be to adopt the
proposal before it, and by cancelling section
98 of the Criminal Code to cease giving dignity to irrational hot-air artists who have
been. making capital for themselves and some
of their foolish theories during the past few
years.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

If we were considering a proposal to place
this legislation upon the Statue Book at the
present time, I should be less inclined than
I am to take the position I intend to take
this afternoon. But this legislation has been
on the Statute Book from 1919 to the present
time. It has occupied a place and exercised
an influence-as all laws are supposed to do
-and has been a warning that certain things
must not be undertaken, and that if they are
attempted, certain penalties will follow. Such
is the essence of alil our laws and regulations.
The conventions of society impose restrictions
by their moral or social effect, and gradually
become laws having behind them executive
force and a body of public opinion, which has
been formed in what were previously conventions.
If attention had not been called to this
danger signal that has been hung up, I shouid
not have so much objection to its being attacked and overthrown; but it strikes me that

388

SENATE

if Parliament takes it down, a very large number of people, who may not be as wise and as
courageous as my honourable friend who has
just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Murdock), may
infer that there no longer exists a feeling that
certain actions are disreputable and are
contrary to the interests of the community,
and they may be tempted to do the very
thing that this section warns against. That
is my chief objection to the repeal of this
provision at the present time, particularly as
since 1919 we have not been making any very
marked progress towards the millennium in
which law and order will bc universally
respected.
There are external influences at work in
this country. Have those influences become
weaker since 1919? Communistic Russia still
exists, with its seemingly all-powerful Government, behind which lie influences that have
dominated their policies, internal and external, and have been growing stronger and
Those influences have not been
stronger.
diminished or weakened in our own country.
We know that in England and in Canada
certain incidents have occurred which have
made it necessary for the Government in
each case to adopt strict measures to counternet the influence of Soviet Russia. It is well
t
for us ·o pause and consider whether it
would be wise for us to take down this warning and thereby very probably-I think,
almost inevitably-render more dangerous to
us those public policies of Soviet Russia which
it is sought to propagate in our own country.
I do not think that the conventions or
legalized policies of society in the interests of
law and order have been materially strengthened in this country during the past ten
years. There is a disrespect for law and
order. There is a tendency to throw off all
the conventions of society and even to revolt
against laws and regulations. This is not
a matter of congratiulation either here or in
the United States. Would it be well for us
at this particular time to repeal this sectionto pull down this danger signal, if you have
a mind to call it so-and by implication rather
give encouragement to the forces of disorder
and of disrespect for law and the conventions
of society? Such is the consideration that
impeils me at the present time to vote against
the deletion of section 98. I do not think the
proposed action would be conducive to the
best interests of the country, social or other,
at the present time. A matter that gives us
concern is the outeropping of dishonesty in
our business and official life. It is true that
the majority of men are honest, as they have
been in decades past, but of late there has
been an astonishing revelation of lack of
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER.

honesty in the ordinary business affairs of
life, and we are led to wonder whether or not
we are progressing along the lines of social
and national welfare.
I do not intend to labour this question. It
is alil very well for my honourable friend who
preceded me (Hon. Mr. Murdock) to argue,
as he seemed to do, that such impulses and
actions as are referred to in this section are
ta be met by sound reasoning and an exposition of the fallacy of the opinions that are
held. If such an argument were brought to
its loginal conclusion we might be asked ta
do away with all our laws and let these people
" pop out," as my honourable friend says.
The trouble is that at the same time they
might pop out many good things and many
citizens as well.
I feel that the action I took on previous
occasions I must take at the present time,
and I shall vote for the retention of this
clause.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I should like to point
out to the right honourable junior member
for Ottawa that the disrespect for law that
lie mentions is not particularly rela-ted to the
elass of people dealt witih in section 98. I
admit that there is a good deal of disrespect
for law. Perhaps the reason for that is that
we have too many laws, and that as a result
people look rather lightly upon some of the
enactments passed by our legislative assemblies.
I have not so much fault to find with the
punishment of crimes or offences against the
State as I have with the method by which it
is sought to discover those crimes and offences.
For instance, in subsection 4 of section 98 we
have this provision:
In any prosecution under this section, if it
be provefd that the person charged has
(a) attended meetings of an unlawful association; or
(b) spoken publicly in advocacy of an unlawful association; or
(c)

distributed

literature

of

an

unlawful

association by circulation through the Post
Office mails of Canada, or otherwise,
it shall be presumed, in the absence of proof
to the contrary, that lie is a member of such
unlawful association.
Since when, under British justice, has a
man had to prove himself innocent? Is it not
the duty of the State to prove him guilty?
A man, through inadvertence, might happen
to get into some unlawful assembly, and lie
would have to prove his innocence.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE:

Why not?

Hon. Mr. FORKE: It is not British law.
He has to prove that he is innocent.

389

MAY 29, 1930

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Ail that hie
lias to prove is that lie is flot a member of
that unlawful association. That is an entirely
different thing.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: It is pretty mucli the
sarne thing. He is presumed to, he a~ member of it until hie proves thst lie is flot
guilty of an offence.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: That is ordinary
law.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do flot think so,
but if lawyers say so, I shall have to give
in. I have always thouglit a man was innocent
until lie was proven guilty.
Under subsection 6 a Justice of the Peace
can issue a warrant authorizing entry into
any mnan's lihrary and the seizure of ail his
papers, and they can be taken away. Is that
necessary? This subsection places too much
power in the hands of officiais who enforce
the iaw. As I said before, I would flot objeet
to punishment for the offences enumerated,
aithougli I do flot -think we need to worry
about them; but I arn opposed to giving
s0 rnuch power to officiais who have to administer the law.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 0f what use are officiais
unless thay have power?
lion. Mr. FORKE: A little while agoif I may be permîtted to make a personal
reference-I was hiable to deportation without,
trial, hacause it happened that I had come
from Great Britain fifty years before. I made
some inquiry as to my legal position, and the
oniy answer 1 could g:et axas: "Oh, well, don't
get excited; you will never be deported."
But it seems to me that is no argument in
favour of retaining such a law. Why shouid
ave empower any officiai to put a citizen to
a great deal of inconvenience in order to
prove himself not guilty of any of the crimes
that arc here enumnerated? I agree with my

Question!

As 1 listened
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to the reading of the clauses by my honourahle friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) it seemed
to nme that many of them were of such a wide
range and so loose in phraseology as to cause
apprehiension to the labouring classes and
other citizens who have no special prestige
or authority in their communities. It is ail]
very well for some honourable member to say
that there is no harma done by the section.
Those who take that attitude know that
they have such a standing in the communîty
that they are in no danger of having to defend themiselves from the provisions of the
section. But labour organizations throughout
the land know that police magistrates and
constables are placed in a position where they
may abuse their proper powers. It is feared
that police officers may on some occasions
rnake too widc a uise of their power to appear
at meetings anil arrest those in attendance,
on the ground that the assembly is unlawful.
It is extremply difficuit to determine what
is an association, or rnernbcrship in an association, such as is referred to in the section.
\Vhat responsibility attaches to a citizen who
bas to attend a meeting wherc someone delivers a speech that is declared to violate the
terins of this section? Organized labour in
this country is sound and sane and it feels
that this law implies a lack of confidence in
it. Labour associations have protested againat
the enactment and asked for its repeal. The
people of Canada respect the law. No doubt
certain classes may have radical or socialîstie
opinions, but 1 believe that our people, taken
as a whoîe, are desirouis of obeying the laws.
Ln some of the countries of Europe the parliaments are made up of members whose views
range from reactionary conservatismn to radicalism and communisrn. When I arn talking to
citizens of these counitries 1. tell themn of the harmony and happiness that we have in Canada,
where ave have no class consciousness nor even

whether we have not attained the millennium.
When it is considered that from the Atlantic
to the Pacifie we have a iaw-abiding people,
wbo are desirous of living and letting live, it
seerns that this section does imply an unjustifiable mistrust of soe classes of our population.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: May I ask the hionourable gentleman a question? To what ex-

390

SENATE

tent does he think the conditions we have
in Canada are due to section 98, which it is
proposed to delete?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think that
only a few agitators in Canada are in danger
of coming within this section. Our labouring
classes have shown themselves to be as well
able to maintain peace and order as are any
other classes, and they resent this section as
an imputation against their own class.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: This clause is
not directed against the labour element of the
country. The honourable gentleman bas been
talking as though labour should be protected
by the abolition of the section, but it is not
directed against labour at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Labour regards it
as an affront.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: But they have
no right to regard it in that way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I have already said, no honourable member feels that
he is in danger of coming within the provisions of this section. It is only the less influential people, those who are lower down
on the social ladder, who fear oppression from
a law that is so loose in its phraseology that
it may permit of abuses by the police and
other officials. I have heard elsewhere the
same sentiment that has just been expressed
by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Murdock), that labour considers it is worthy of
more confidence than is implied by this section. I do not think that any harm would
come from the deletion of section 98. We
should still have the English common law,
which has for many decades protected the
people and the institutions of Great Britain
and this country.
Hon. Mr. WILLOIGIGHBY: I should like to
add that the honourable senator for Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), an ex-Minister of
Labour, whose opinions are highly respected
in this .House, participatîd in the debate on
the proposed deletion of this section last year.
He wa. heartily in favour of retaining section
98. He is a higi official in labour circles and
surely is in as good a position as any honourable Inember to state tie views of labour
on this question.

On section 6-broker reducing stock by selling for bis own account:
Hon. J. J. DONINELLY: Honourable
senators, the remarks which I am about to
make do not apply particularly to section 6.
The Bill as distributed to-day is somewhat
less stringent than the one which I received a
few days ago. Evidently the other House has
made some amendments. Before we take any
action with a view to making the present
Criminal Code more stringent, it is well for
us to remember that the administration of
different sections of the Code is not at all
times in the hands of men who have had the
legal training necessary to qualify them to
fulfil their duty properly. I regret that in
the Province of Ontario laymen are sometimes appointed as police magistrates. I have
been informed that such is not the case in
the provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan,
and that while it may be legal to make such
appointments in the other provinces it is not
*
ot ten done. A Government commission may authorize a layman to sit as a
police magistrate and may give him the
iower-i will not say the right, for there is a
difference between power and right-to take
away the liberty of a fellow man, but a Government commission does not in my' opinion
possess the iiraculous power required to
transfori a laymuan into a judge capable of
puttimng the proper construction on a statute
and weighing the evidence. I ani aware that
the appointment of police muagistrates is within the jurisdiction of the provinces, but in my
opinion this Pailianient has the power-and,
I beliese. the riglit and the diuty-to enaet
siich legislation is will insure that the differcnt sections of this Code, and particularly
those affecting tho iberty cf the subject, shall

and was at one time Crown Attorney for the
County of Canleton, and have had occasion
to witness what has been described by my
honourable friend. In the Province of Quebec no one is called upon to administer justice
in either civil or criminal courts unless he is
a member of the bar. The criminal work is

carried on there by stipendiary magistrates,
police magistrates, recorders, an.d porhaps
some others; but in no case is anyone appointed who has not been trained in the law.
In Ontario, I believe, there are very few
police magistratos with any legal training at
ail. It would seema to be almost esseatial

volving very serious penalties--twenty years
in the penitentiary, and so on-fail wi'thin the
jurisdiction of men wbo have had no legal
oxpenience wbatover. Any lawyer, partionlarly a criminal lawyer, knows how difficult
it is to draw the lino of domarcation botweon
law and fact. It requiros an experiencod,
intelligent man with long years of legal
training to do that.
Does the honourable
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
gentleman say that there are no intelligent
men who are not members of the bar?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no. 1 did not
say that. Legal training is what I am emphasizing. A man may have had no legal
training, but be of the highost intellect. With
n legal training ho does not make a good
judgo. In view of what is occurring every
day all over the Province of Ontario, it is
a matter of surprise to me that the Parliament of Canada, in dealing with the Criminal
Code, bas not insisted that those who are
to administer criminal justice should have a
proper legal training.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I agree with the
remarks of the honourable gentleman from
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) and the honourable the senior member fromn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Bclcourt). Honourable members. wb.o are
not lawyers would be astonished to find what
very extensive powers are vcsted in police
magistrates. I think a police magistrate should
be a trained man-not that I want to croate
a preserve for the lawyers; that is not the idea
at aIl-for the man who bas had the advantage of a legal training has the ability to weigh
evidence and is much botter qualified by experience than a layman.

391

The man with legal training has something
else behind him which is very desirabie indeed.
He is a member of a learned profession. He
is very desirous, if he is fit for the position at
ail, of enjoying and retaining the good opinion of that profession. If he is dishonourable
in bis conduct or bas violated the professional
code or the amenities, as I might cail them,
of the profession-he need not be a criminal
-he is liable to be brought up bef ore his peers
and reprimanded, or he may even be disrobed.
Such a man is subi ect to a certain public control. A similar argument would apply to, the
medical profession. We will assume that the
great mai ority of mcn who go on the bench
are men of integrity, but if they are laymen,
there is no such restraint over their actions as
there would be if they were members of the
legal profession.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The lawyer is
under oath.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Absolutely. The
professional code must ho lived up to. That
is a very considerable safeguard. It is a sonious thing for a lawyer to lose his gown. He
could not be a police magistrate. I had no
idea that, as the honourable member for
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) bas pointed out,
it is not a sine qua non that a magistrate
should be a member of the bar.

of the words "or race, other than a horse-race,"
is in the old Act.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: What measures
will be taken to prevent the entry into Canada of British and United States papers which
print this information?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This clause
would prevent the circulation in Canada of
newspapers from the United States which
violate this prohibition.
Hon. Mr. WHITE:

British papers, too?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
British papers
coming into this country ten days after their
issue in Great Britain could hardly come under
the clause. Whatever appeared would concern races that had already taken place a
number of days beforo the appearance of the
papers in Canada.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: No. They sometimes
give odds on races, as well as the weights
carried by the horses, and other information,
as long as two or three months before the
race. The amended clause savs:
Whether sucli race bas or bas not taken
place.
There is no limitation to the tine at all.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It would apply to all newspapers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not consulted the Minister of Justice, who bas charge
of this Bill, but if my honourable friend fels
thbat thcre should be an extension in favour
of British papers coming across the Atlantic,
I w ould suggest to the Minister of Justice
that he acecept such an amendment.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: If an exception is to
be made in favour of the British newspapers,
why not in favour of the newspapers printed
in Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The reason, it
strikes me, is that Canadian papers can conform and must conform to Canadian laws,
while British papers need not. If we stop the
reception and circulation of British papers
because they happen to have information
concerning horse-races in Europe, I confess
that we should have a situation for which I
Hfn. Mr. DANDURAND.

should not like to take the responsibility.
In a discussion of the Bill with the Minister
of Justice at noon, I was informed that he
did not believe there was any danger of the
London Times or other London newspapers
coming under the Act. But my honourable
friend says that tips or selections sometimes
appear weeks before the event. I am not
versed in this matter.
Hon. Mr. FORKE:
When they are ten
days old they are stale.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Perhaps my honourable friend would -tell me what is meant by
"pari-mutuel payments."
Does that mean
that after a race takes place there is to be
no report of the winnings or the odds prevailing at the time of the race?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
That is what it
says.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I asked the
Minister of Justice as to the rights of a
newspaper to announce winners after a race.
His opinion was that it could do that without indicating the odds on the horses.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: All those pari-mutuels
are licensed by the provincial governments,
who get certain receipts from them. It seems
extraordinary that this Parliarment ,should
attempt to pass laws concerning pari-mutuels,
which have been legalized by the provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I must confess
that I was never able to understand why an
exception should be made in the law with
regard to the betting on horse-races. The
only explanation I have ever heard was that
it was donc to encourage the breeding and
improvoment of horses. The Parliamont of
Canada is opposed to games of chance; we
have often reaffirmed that principle. I was
the chief mover in the abolition of lotteries
some twenty-five years ago. Ar that time the
Criminal Code prohibited games of chance,
but there was an exception made in favour of
the Royal Art Society of England. I do not
remember whether the exception was not extended te favour art associations generally,
but, in any event, under the protection of
this exception so-called art associations were
being formed all over the country. I saw
them operating for years in Montreal. One
became a member of such institutions by buying a ticket. The association would display
a number of pictures, chiefly chromos, priced
from perhaps $10 to $500. A member would
hold a certain number, and if this turned up
on a revolving wheel he would be entitled to
some picture. He then had the option of
taking the picture or leaving it on the
premises and accepting payment instead. The

papers, I understand.

Some

special

news-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman says "crank." We all are sometimes disposed to describe thus anyone with
whom we differ, or who has advanced ideas
on any question. There is a history behind
this proposed amendment. We have had the
section before us a couple of times in the last
six or seven years. In 1923 there was a demand raised in the other House for the abolition of the pari-mutuels. Mr. Good, a member of Parliament, souglit more stringent regulations than are provided in the Code, and
the other House rejected his proposals by a
small majority. The reason he was not successful was that the Minister of Justice at the
time, the late Sir Lomer Gouin, stated that he
was not disposed to recommend Mr. Good's
Bill, because of representations that had been
made to him from various sources. I do not
know whether the present amendment was introduced by the late Sir Lomer Gouin before
his withdrawal from the Department, or
whether his successor, Hon. Mr. Lapointe, is
responsible for it. However, the amendment
now before us was passed by the other House.
I do not know what criticism, if any, was made
of it there, nor whother it was carried unanimously. I believe that we are simply legislating along the same lines that we have followed in the past, in an attempt to curb the
betting tendency in the land.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Mr. Chairman, I think
this clause is one that might very well be
eliminated from the Bill. This is a type of
puritanical enactmnent that only adds to the
"thou shalt not" class of legislation, of which
we already have sufficient on the Statute Book.
If the result of the passage of this clause were
to be, as my honourable friend suggests, a
curtailment of betting, there msight possibly
be two opinions on the subject. But to my
mind it does not curtail it. The clause legitimatizes the publishing of odds and all the
other classes of information. If you go to the
Wooibine you wvili find 25,000 people who
have aecess to al the information, tips, odds
on the borses and so on; lut the minute you
step outside the gate fibat information is proscribed, and the only source fron which the
people can get it is the newspapers. This
section deals in a general way not only with
Canadian race tracks, but with racing in the
Old Country, in the United States-anywhere.
The English newspaper which gives the weight
and the betting odd> and so forth, as some of
them do months before an important race,

would corne under this clause. Any man who
tHton. MIr. DANDURAND.

was in possession of a newspaper-the London
Times or any other-containing information of
that kind, and who exhibited it to a friend,
would be liable to a heavy fine or imprisonment. The same thing would be true of a
man who had the New York Times or some
such American newspaper containing information about races in that country. It strikes
me that the clause not only provides against
the advertising and the giving of information,
and so on, with regard with races to be held,
but also applies to information about races
that have been held. To my mind that is a
ridiculous provision to put into the Criminal
Code. I would therefore move that it be
struck out.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have been waiting patiently for some time in the hope that
someone would indicate just what this provision is aimed at. As soon as I saw the
language of it, I thought I knew. I remember
that I originally suggested a measure of this
kind to Sir Lomer Gouin when he was Minister of Justice. What for? Not to deal with
lorse-races. Not at all! Just look at the
language, if you please.
Betting or wagering upon any fight, game,
sport or race.
I have been expecting that some honourable
gentleman here would know all about what
this was aimed at, and would tell the story.
As a matter of fact, an organization that ias

of section 98 of the Criminal Code, which in
your wisdom you declined to repeal a few
minutes ago, has, it is said, for many years
heen making ahundreds of thousands of dollars

agree that no one sbould be allowed ta operate a motor vebicle, that is, actually 'to drive
a machine, while he is intoxicated.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not this
caver the case of negligent parking, for instance? If someone is tbe worse for liquor
and parka bis car in the middle of the street,
for example, that would lie a case contemplated
in these words, I should tbink.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: They would
caver such a case, but I think the language
is too wide.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is Lt not necessary
that that kind et case should be covered?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Suppose I drive down
ta a little village and spend same time there,
leaving my car in a garage. The garage man
lias the care or contrai of my car whule it is
standing in the garage, and if lie becomes intoxicated during that time lie would be
hiable, under this subsectian. Just look at
the wording:
Everyone wbe, wbile intoxicated or under the
influence of any narcotie. . . bas the care or
contrai et a motar vebicle or automobile,
whether it is la motion or nat, .shall be guilty
et an offence.
In other wards, if for any reason an automobile
is being cared for or controlled liy a persan
wba La intoxicated, regardlesa of wbetber lie
gets inta the car or not, lie wauld be lhable
under this section.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Do you mean the
awner et the car or 'the owner of the garage
would be hialle?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Tbe person wbo lias
thc care or central of the automobile. As I
read it, lie is hiable under this Bill, thaugli
he neyer gets inta the car and neyer drives
it.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You mean that lie
miglit be intoxicated and in bis own lied
upstairs?
lion. Mr. CALDER: If the car is under bis
care and contrai as described by this section.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If hie is intoxicated,
how are you to tell that lie will flot get inta
the car and set it in motion?

396

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CALDER: If any person who is
intoxicated gets into a car and sets it in
motion, you.can tax hima and punish him.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
If it were>
iimitcd to the owner it would ho ail rigbt,
perhaps.

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: There is another
point. I have known of cases of men who had
hsen spending the evening with friends and had
somethingý to drink. One man told me this
himself: as hie felt the effeet eoming on, hie
siippod quietly to the side of the road and
parked thero until he was sober enough to go
home. He would be subjeet to fine and imprisonmient.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite agree with theviews expressed by the leader of tbe Government. My trouble is that the section is not
properiy drafted and doos flot express wbat is
intended. It is not restricted to an automobile on the higbway, or one that is heing
(Iriven by the owner. A person may ho liable
to imprisonmient hecause ho bas the rare or
rontrol of the car, thougb ho bas no intention
of running it.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I confess that I
cannot sec the point. I may be somewhat
dixil. I will read the clause and try to analyze
it. It says:
Everyone who, while intexicated or under the
influence of any narcotic, drives any motor
veliicle or automlobileThere is no objection to that?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

No.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
-or lias the care or control of a inotor veliice
or aotoînobile, whecther it is in motion or flot,
shall be gîiilty of an offence. andi shahl be hiable.
At the first reading I understood tliat this
clausae rox cred( -n 'v porson who drives a motor
vehicle wbile jntoxicated or under the influence
of narcol ire, or w'ho while intoxicated is found
in rontrol of a motor vohicle or automobile,
whethcr the automobile be in motion or not.
That is quite logical. The \ chicle under bis
rontrol lias stopped. but it may start xithin
a minute, or it may b on the wrong side of

raulse damage to others in the handling of

lIe miay scet it in motion at any time. Ho
commiits an offe(nre becausc hoe has control of

bas heem phraed so as to hold a man who

doing no harîn. 1 didn't intcnd to move."

Hon. i\Ir. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. W ILLOUGHBY: But how about

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Surely. That is wbat it
me ans.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I suppose the word'
"intoxicated" means intoxicatcd by the use of
liquor alono. This section says, "intoxirated
or under the influence of any narcotie." Would
it includo hcing under the influence of liquor?
I tbink the phrase "uinder the influence of
hiquor" was used in another copv of this Bill,
and I tbink it is a bctter expression. W bon a
man is intoxicato(i ho is in a inore advainced
stage than xvhen ho is under the influence of

Hon. Mr. BELCOLT RT: My honourable
friend xvill remember that the xvord "intoxication" bias a legal mcaning.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Wbat is it?
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: I do not know
wbether I can give it. It is always a question
of fact, and can and must ho determined by
the magistrate xvho iiears the case. You cannot
say that a miani is intoxicated hecause lie lias
liad xvo drinks, or five drinks.

MAY 29, 1930
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But he is under the
influence of liquor.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: One man may take
ive drinks and show no sign at all of having
done so; another man who bas taken two
drinks may be intoxicated. It is a question of
fact which must be determined by the court.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I used the expression,
'under the influence." Those five drinks are
going to influence him.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But it must be an
influence that does not permit him to use his
intelligence and that renders him incapable
of doing the sensible thing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The explanatory
note seems to indicate that an improvement
has been made by striking out the words
"under the influence of intoxicating liquor"
and replacing them by "intoxicated." About
the time the Bill was presented by the Minister
of Justice, I saw somewhere-in the newspapers,
I think-the statement that it had been found
very difficult to determine when a person is
under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but
much easier to determine when he is
intoxicated.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That may be so if
there is a legal interpretation of the word
"intoxication," as stated by the honourable
.senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
I have never seen such a legal definition or
interpretation, so far as I remember. As a
inatter of fact, when these cases come before
the court the interpretation rests with the
presiding judge or magistrate. I do not agree
with the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that the change
is an improvement.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think my point
could be met, if it is thought desirable to
meet it, by the insertion after the word
'automobile" in the fourth line, of the words
4
'on a public highway or in any public place,"
or something to that effect. I want to pro4

tect the person who has no intention of using

the automobile. If a man in a drunken condition is found in an automobile on the highway, he should be punished.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the intention.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is no doubt
about it.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:* Would it not be
better to leave out the words "on a highway
ýor in a public place"? An accident may occur
in a private place, between the garage and
.the gate.

391

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Is not the evil that
you are trying to overcome the driving of a
car by a man while he is in an intoxicated
condition?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. That is only part
of it.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: My honourable
friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Taylor) points
out that a gentleman who has been spending
an evening out may find, when the time
arrives for him to go home, that he is not
in a condition to drive, and may go home in
a friend's car, leaving his own on the street.
He exercises a great deal of discretion, but
the car is within his control. I suggest that
the words "or has the care or control of a
motor vehicle or automobile, whether it is
in motion or not" be stricken out of the
section.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it is the
intention to go somewhat further than my
honourable friend suggests. The person in
control may be just as dangerous when the car
is not in motion as if he were driving. If he
is sitting in a car with the lights out, even
though away from the wheel, he may be the
cause of an accident.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: If the car is not in
motion and is struck, it is the fault of the
person who strikes it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A man may have
put out his lights.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: How would it
be to have the section interpreted by the
Department of Justice? I do not desire to
block the passage of the Bill, but I think it
could be clarified and improved by redrafting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the honourable gentleman thinks it is of sufficient importance, that could be done. It might
jeopardize the Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We all have the
same object in view, namely, to punish the
fellow who drives when he is intoxicated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will realize that there is not very
much danger of anyone being prosecuted because he happens to leave his car in a garage
the owner of which may be intoxicated. The
idea of the draftsman has been to reach the
driver of the car, whether the car is in motion
or not.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But it reaches
somebody else, in a garage or in a home, who
has the care or control.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There may be
a reason for putting the word "care" beside

398

the word ".control".

A car may be in the
street and the owner rnay have put it temporaTily in charge of someone else. Thwt
other person, if intoxicated, would corne
within this subsection. I doubt that theword
"Ccare" could le deleted without weakoning
the clause.
If my honHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

through in its pre-sent forrn, I arn perfectly
agreeable, but 1 thjnk it could ho worded

(Hon. Mr. Murdock) is a new member in this

I think I am safe in saying that we have discussed this matter in at least five other sessions. It has been debated ad infinitum. If

the senior member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.

the notice now. My honourable friend implies
that because the subject-matter of my amendment has been discussed on several previous
occasions in this House it should not be reconsidered. Nothing has been more olearly
proved in British history than that a thing is
never settled until it is settled right.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, according to the Minutes of the 13th of
May, the following rules, among others, were
suspended until the end of this session: Rules
23 (f), 24 (a), (b), (d) and (e). Rule 24 (b)
prescribes the notice necessary for the motion
for the third reading of a Bill. That rule was
suspended, and therefore the question whether the third reading should be given now is
in the hands of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I regret that a
number of honourable members are not present. It would be quite in order to proceed
now to consider the amendment of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Murdock), inasmuch as the rule requiring notice of motion
for third reading has been suspended. Of
course, any amendment moved in Committee
of the Whole can be moved again when the
motion for third reading is made. But I accede
to the suggestion of my honourable friend on
the other side who has pointed out that some
members interested in the Bill are not in the
Flouse at present. I will w-ithdraw my motion
for third reading until to-morrow.
SOCKEYE SALMON CONVENTION BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 344, an Act respecting a certain Convention, signed the 26th day of May, 1930,
between His Majesty in respect of Canada
and the United States of America, for the
preservation and extension of the Sockeye
Salmon Fisheries in the Fraser River System.
-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, I desire to
give the following explanation. The object
of the convention is the sockeye salmon fisheries in what is commondy called the Fraser
River system, and certain portions of the
high seas near the entrance to the Strait of
Juan de Fuca. The aim of the two Governments in concluding this treaty is to protect,
preserve and extend these fisheries, which are
of common interest to the Dominion of Canada and the United States.
It is hoped that the effect of this trea:ty will
be to achieve that aim, with results from which
the two countries will derive great advantages
in practically equal shares.
The Fraser River is potentially the greatest
sockeye salmon producing area in North
Anierica. In that river and its tributaries
the sockeye saion goes up every year to
spawn. The young fish before reaehing maturity goes down to the Gulf of Georgia and
then to the ocean. When it has attained full
growth it comes back to the Gudf of Georgia
and to the river. It enters through the passage
at the north end of Vancouver island but also
and mainly through the Juan de Fuca Strait,
on each side of the boundary line which
divides that strait, and it remains on a long
stretch of sea in United States waters before
it reaches the boundary line at Point Roberts.
It may consequently be said that if the
Fraser River as a spawning area is the asset
of Canada, more particularly of the fishermen
of British Columbia, the United States waters
below Point Roberts as a catching ground
are a strategical point for the American fishermen, more particularly of the State of Washington, who have been able to turn it to their
great advantage. This situation, which need
not be explained more filly, gives the reason
why the whole Fraser River system, which
comprises nut only the river itself but also
the Gulf of Georgia on each side of the
boundary line, and Juan de Fnca Strait on
both sides also, forms the most important area
covered by the treaty. In fact, it should be
mentioned here that in the past, perhaps
nostly as a result of this situation, the United
States fishermen had been in a position to
obtain each year larger catches than those of
our Canadian fishermen.
The principal aspect of the question to bear
in mind is that as regards the object of the
convention the two countries have a common
interest in the Fraser River system thus
described they have there, so to speak, a
common property in the sockeye salmon
fisheries; thy are mutuatly interested in the

MAY 29, 1930
conservation of this joint asset; they are both
affected in the saine way by ai depletion of
this sharcd .patrimony.
As to its value, it may be sufficient te saY
for example that some years ago 2,000,000
cases of sockeye salmon were paeked in the
whole system.
For varions reasons, this asset bas been
greatly diminished, -more particularly in recent
years. The problem, however, oonstituted, by
the depletion of sockeye salmon has been
before the two Governments for more than
twenty years, and this consideration brings
us to, the question relating to the task which
the two countries wish to fulfil under the
treaty. The extent to which this reSource bas
been diminished may 'be indicated by the
fact that the 2,000,000 cases of sockeye salmon packed in one ycar in the pa.st have
dwindled to about 150,000 -cases per annum
at the present time. The importance of reviving the resource is shown by the calculation
that bas been made, according to which a
compi-ete restoration would .bring to the fishermen of the two counitries catches esti-mated at
more than $3M,000,000 a year.
Behind these facts lies the whole idea of
the treaty. In this light, the treaty speaks for
itself.
It may be recalled that Canada and the
United States had prevîously tried to remedy
the situation by an international instrument

ail waters adjacent to the International

Boundary Line ivas intended to embrace this
fishery.

In accordance with that treaty regu-

lations had been prepared, and Canada had
taken the necessary action to make them
effective, but the United States Senate did
flot approve them. The hope of Canada that
the United States sright eventually give approval to the proposed regulations persisted
for several years. In 1914 it wvas realized that
our suggestion in this regard would not be
found acceptable, and we resumed our freedum

We have every reasonable ground to believe
that the present treaty wilI be definitel[Y
accepted, as £rom our information it is supported by the majority of those interested
on the United States side, as well as by the
Canadian industry.
Briefiy sumnîed up,. the main provisions of
the treaty are:
1. The creation of an international Comnmission, which will be called the International
Pacifie Salmon Fisheries Commission, to
regulate the enterprise;
2. The authority given to the Commission
to limit or prohibit taking soekeye oalmnon
as may be determined in accordance with the
conditions of each year;
3. The regulating of fishing by the Commission so that an equal proportion of the
fish allowed to be caught each season will be
taken by the fishermen of each country;
4. The enforcement by the Governmnent of
each country of the restriction or prohibition
of soekeye fishing imposed by the Commission in the waters covered by the convention.
With this explanation, I beg to move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Who are the two
commissioners on behalf of Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not recollect having seen anything of their appointment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is provision for the appointrnent of commissioners
for the purpose of negotiating the treaty?
Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: T-hey are not
named?

Hon. Mr. DANDURANU:

The convention

was signed.

Hon. J. D. TAYLOR:

Honourable mem-

bers, the question raised by the honourable
the leader on this side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) really goes to the very crux of
the proposaI before the two Governments. I
think that perhaps the estimate of a $35,000,000
catch resulting from this treaty, just now read
by the leader of the House, is rather exag-

gerated; but there is, no douht, a very sub-

stantial gain to be made in the fisheries of the
Fraser River.
As ýto the personnel of the Commission, in
mny opinion the naines of the persons to be
appointed commissioners on behaîf of Canada

are a matter of the very first importance,
and I take this opportunity of appealing to
the Government to sce to it when the Commission is appointed that we get more adequate representation on it than we have had
on the Halibut Commission, which has stag-

IiEVISED EDITION

402

SENATE

nated for the whole terma of its existence
because Canada has had no real working representation on that Commission.
The recent history of this convention is
another illustration of the futility and weakness of the administration of fishery affairs on
the part of the Government of Canada-a
matter to which I referred in the Halibut
Treaty discussion here a few days ago. Last
year, although this matter had been before the
two Governments, as we have just now been
informed, for 'twenty or twenty-five years,
this Government approached Washington with
a treaty s0 clumsily drawn, so amateur in ail
its provisions, that after a few weeks' consideration it was withdrawn both at Washington and Ottawa because of its manifest imperfections and the impossibility of carrying eut the conditions suggested, and also
because of the inadequacy of the convention,
which showed a lack of appreciation on the
part of those who negotiated, particularly
for Canada, as te the needs of the situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Why net apply
this judg-ment whicha my honourable friend
prenounces on the qualifications of the Canadian delegates to the American delegates as
well, inasmucli as the convention was the child
of both?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: There is a very simple
answer te that question. In the convention of
last year the advantage on ex ery article was
plainly on the side of the American delegates,
who, in drawing up the convention, imposed
their will upon the Canadians in every respect.
It was because the American delegates had
imposed their will in this way that objection
was taken to it last year by persons in British
Columbia interested in the convention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But it was net
accepted by the American au'thorities cither.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: 'Ne, but that was for
another and vcry different reasen. The reason
why it wvas net accptcd by the American
authorities appeals tu Canada alsu, but the
Geo ernnment who ne-otiated it should have
realized that before they pressed upon this
Parliament the creation of a, bargain with the
United States wbiclh was te last for sixteen
years without any revisien of any Icind, and
under which it xvas proposed te appoint commissioners for the xvhole of that terrat without
any possibility of their removal, ne matter
what their actions might be.
I mention this, net because I want te involve
this Chamber in discussions that have taken
place elsewhere, but because I arn aware that
in another place it has huen represented that
this treaty m'as withdrawn from the Parliament
H ni. MIr. TAYL[OR.

of Canada la§t year because of objections
raised for poli tical1 purpeses. I have only te
state the nature of some of the objections to
make it plain te the Huse that polities had
ne part whatever in the matter, and this
becomes evident new when this Gevernment,
without any political urging whatever, comes
back te Parliament with a treaty that in every
section is entirely different from the treaty
proposed last year. For instance, the treaty of
last year took ne cognizance of the fact that
the fishery operations of both countries have
been menaceýd during the past two or three
seasons by semething net hitherto in existence,
namely, the bootlegging operations of fish
pirates who have gene eut from Puget Sound
and intercepted the salmon on the high seas
before cither the State of Washington or the
Dominion of Canada could get the fish under
their centrol inside the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
That has been recognized in the treaty of
this year by the jurisdictien of the Commission
being extended westward inte the Pacifie Ocean
between paraÂlels 48 and 49 degrees north
latitude-a mest important provision, without
which the treaty would have been futile in
attempting te proteet fish that would have
been destroyed on the high seas by the
intensive seining eperations of those bootleggers, but as te which, appareintly, the
Gevernment and Department were oblivieus.
Hon. Mr. FCORKE: Theobejection raised in
the other House last year ivas that, the Government had bowcd te the decrees of the United
States Gevernment.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I amn net discussing the
debate that took place in the other flouse last
year, although I ceuld discuss it with very
great satisfaction te myseif.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Thcrc would perhaps be ne recrimination if we confined ourselves te the present convention. 1 have net
before mc the conv ention of last year and
cannot follow my honourable fricnd in that
regard.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: It is typical of the
unfortunate position of the fishery administration in Canada that there is ne responsible
meîuber of the Goverument conversant wvith
the fishery situation; that these negotiations
have been left te subordinates of cernparatively humble degree, who have shown
very littie acquaintance with anything but the
minute details of their office duties, and ne
appreciation at alI of the larger interests upen
which these treaties should be founded. I
say this with ne disrespect for the honourable
gentleman. 1 realize that it is absolutely im-

MAY 29, 1930
possible for him. to, have even a modicum of
the information that I have on this subject
from a perusal of the documents.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may be on an
equal footing when we meet the experts of
the Department in the committee.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I hope we shall both
be there to meet them. Such a meeting wil
be very interesting indeed, and I arn sure that
if we get a Senate committee on the fishery
intereats on the Pacific coast it will be very
profitable.
1 arn moved to say this by the accusation
that polities prornpted the withdrawal of the
trcaty last year, and that this important industry bas consequently been prejudioed by
the loss of a season. As 1 say, politics did
not enter into the matter at al, as shown by
the fact that the new Government of British
Columbia, a Conservative Government, were
arnongst the warmest advocates of the treaty.
The only excuse we can give for them is that
they were a very new Government and that
flot a single member of the Government had
ever been brought into contact with fishery
problems until they tackled this matter after
a month or two in office and sent ail sorts of
telegrams urging the adoption of last year's
treaty. So complete bas been the conversion
of that Government that they are now equally
earnest in urging that we adopt the new and
better treaty. We can ail realize that a Government new to office, as they were, would be
very likeiy to fali into such a trap.
The most important thing in this treaty, as
I see it, is the suggestion that in the future
the sockeye fishery of the Fraser River area
is to be equally divided between the two Governments. Under present conditions-which
are considerably different on each side of the
line-it is impossible to carry out that suggestion. Fromn practical experience 1 know very
well that the gentlemen who drew up the
treaty did not insert this group of words without discussing and considering what construction might eventually be put upon them. As
they read at present in the treaty they are
meaningless. No draftsman who wished to
make bis meaning clear would approve of
these words. They are used to conceal, rather
than to reveal, the intentions of those who
negotiated the treaty. The words are in
Article VII, the most important part of the
whole treaty, wbich reads:
Inasmnuch as the purpose of this Convention
jesto esta.hlih for the High Contraeting Parties,
by their joint effort and expendse, a fishery that
is now laargely non-existent, it is agreed by the
High Contracting Parties that they should share
equally in the fishery. The Commission shall,
2425-26-à

403

conaequently, regulate the fishery with a view
to a]lowing, as nearly as may be practicable,
an equal portion of the fish that may be caught
each ypar to be taken by the fishermien of each
High Contracting Party.
I will not burden bonourable members by
reading the corresponding article in hast year's
treaty. This article is much hess indefinite
than the one of the prevîous year, and indicates clearly what should be the ambition of
the Government. The reason that ambition
cannot be realized-and I arn serious in stating that under present conditions the ambition
is impossible of realization-is that on the
United States side the sockeye salmon are
taken almost solely by means of traps set in
the neighbourhood of Point Roberts, at the
entrance to the Fraser River. The Americans
have a few seiners at work too, and we have
a few in the gulf, though not in the river. The
seiners, however, are comparativehy unimportant. A trap will take as many as 100,000 fish
in one day, under favourable circumstances; it
is a very efficient means of catching fish. On
the Canadian side, however, the Government
bave always prohibîted the use of traps, with
a view to protecting the interests of the net
fishermen of British Columbia. On the Fraser
River the net fishing is done by 2,000 white
men and an equal number of Japanese; so the
livelihood of 4,000 men is dependent for protection against ruin upon the continuance of
the present policy of the prohibition of traps
on the Canadian side.
In my opinion-and it is not one that is
held by me alone--uness the Canadian
metbod of catching fish is brought into line
with the American method, that is, to have
traps at the mouth of the Fraser River, the intention of Article VII of the treaty wilh be
absolutely impossible of accomplishment. I
arn not opposing the treaty; I arn heartily in
favour of it, even though it bas this defect,
because I think that on the whole it is a good
thing for Canadian interests as well as for the
Americans. The difficulty eoncerning Article
VII was clearly hrought out before the comnmittee of the other Huse that went into the
subject last year with the departmental officiaIs. The proceedings of that committee were
reported verbatim and have been published.
They show that the chief officiai of the Canadian Department of Fisheries was asked how
it was proposed to give effect to the intention
of Article VII. He frankly stated that he had
no idea how that couhd be brought about, and
hie sympathized with the commissioners who
are to be appointed. because of the difficuhty
ot carrying out the purpose of Article VII.

1 have referred ta the improvements that
have been made in this convention as it bas
been revised since lest year. The chief
improvement, of course, wes the extension of
the euthority of the propased Commission ta
eneble it ta deel with bootlegging on the high
seas. Another commendable change wae the
dropping of the clause providing for the
appointment of the commissioners for sixteen
years, the life terre of the convention, but
providing noaeuthority for their removal.
This year's treaty contains this clause, as part
of Article Il:
The Commîssioners eppointed by each af the
High Contracting Parties shall hold office during
the pleesure of the High Contracting Party by
which they were appointed.
We Ïhave e very good ide, oif tihe clas of
the camimissioners who are to be appainited
by the United States. While these matters
hafve been in process of neoatiation a nu ier
of Amerîaan gentlemnanfiave vâsited the scene
of these fisheries, andin -the course of general
conversation tihere has been an. indication of
wha are }ikely te be appointed. I ocan say
that tÀhe men whose names -have been se
indicated to us aTe somae cd tihe meister inindiS
of the A.merioan (publie service. Therefore aur
Qoverament should meke sure tihat t1he
Canadien commissioners shahl not be mere
placeinen, or figureheade, who have te trust
ta subardinates for advice. We need men
who wil1 be able ta meet the kee'nest miuds
of the, Americean publie service.
The honaureble leader of tihe Govern=ens
(Hon. Mr. Dendurand) steted that the value
of the peck af sahimon mnight eesily be brought
up te $35,000,000 annually. That is probabhT
a high estimate, but the business has immense
passiWiities. That estimate goes te shaow that
et leest as much oonsideretion should be given
ta the appiaintment of these coimmissioners as
we have given ta appointments incannectien
with the adjustrnent of soldier pension difficulties. We have provided salaries for the
Pensions Commissioners which we think will
coêmmand the services cf real)y first-class mren,
whoc, aifter aIl, will be required te do> work
that will be Iargély a matter cd detsil and will
invafre questiions nat neerly se important as
those relating ta the fisheries. It will be
nothing less than a tragedy if the experiences
in connection with the Hallibut Commiion
are repeated with respect ta the Sockeye Commission. The amime (d Mr. O'Mafley, the head
of the American Fisheries Service, was men-

That is the type of mien the Aînerican GoveTnment are likely to appoint to represent them.
under the Sockeye Salmon Treety for the
next sixteen years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There will be
three comniissioners on each side.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes. Each Government pay their own commissioners. The Governments will be jointly responsible for the
cost of operation, but, of course, they will
be given an opportunity to approve of the
expenditure.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: When will the
Commission begin its work?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: When the commissioners are eppointed. We have first-class men
available in Canada for eppointment as commissioners, but we cennot find thema emong
men whose experience has been confined to
offices. This will be a very real job. The
very suggestion of $35,000,000 a year shows
thet.
I shal nlot go into detail, but 1 should like
to ceIl attention to another difference between
the two drafts of the convention. For some
mysterious reason it was provided in last
year's draft that in anything affecting the
American înterests there must be the votes
of two of the three Americen commissioners
in order to carry it; but in any matter affecting only Canadian interests it was provided
thet a proposai might be carried by a majority
of the Commission, even though there should
be oniy one Canadian commissioner voting
for it. That foolishness has been struck out
this yeer, and the new draltiprovides that:
No action teken by the Commission under the
authority of thie Convention shall be effective
unless it is affirmatively voted for by et leest
two of the Commissioners of each Contrecting
Par ty.
So our commissioners are protected by that.
We are protected in the sense of dignity, et
leest, if not ini actuel power, by another
change from the provision of lest year. It
wes then provided thet the American Chief
Commissioner of Fisheries should be appointed by this treaty as one of the three
American cammissianers. That provision, of
course, mnade him the ranking member of the
Commission, and gave him the authority ta
exercise ail the powers that a president of any
commission of that kind would exercise,
throughout its whole life. Sa ail these aperatians in Canada were ta be directed by an
Americen gentleman of the highest abiiity,
who, of course, would not be teking directions
fromn any persan. The protest of the British

406

SENATE

Columbians brought about a change, and ail
the commissioners are now on an equal footing, and ail ta be appointed after the treaty
cornes into effcct.
That is ail I think I should say at this time
about the matter-making it clear that the
postponcrncnt of last year was due flot ta
politics, but ta the inherent defects of the
treaty, as confessed in the changes voluntarily
made this year bv bath Governments. Al
parties in British Columbia are sinccrely desiraus of the restaratian of this fishery, and
we hope that there will be some ncw faces on
the Commission. We want ta be delivered
fromn the officialdomn that has been in charge
of these fisheries for the past fifty years.
Many of us realize that these long experienced officiais have very incomplete knowiedgc
of the fishery problems. They give as the
reason for the present depfletion of the fishery,
an unfortunate occurrence at Heil's Gate
fifteen years ago, when the contractars of the
Canadian Northern Railway dumped a lot of
rock inta the Fraser River. This bas been
put forward fram that time ta the present as
the reasan for the failure of the fishery. And
while those gentlemen have heen searching for
some rcmedy that they might apply, Providence bas furnished the fincst run of sackcye
that we have had on the Fraser River in fifteen
years. We do not know why the salmon
stoppcd caming after 1913, and we do nat
know why they have naw commenccd ta corne
in greater numbers. The officiaIs do flot know
w'hy that is. fhey are flot the persans ta find
out, because they are wedded ta the idea that
the mishap at Hell's Gate was responsible for
ail the difficulty. That helief is not held hy
everyane in British Columbia, and it is shattered by the experience of iast year, when, as
I say, wc had the biggcst mun that we have
had in fifteen years.
If we get a new deal-new commissianers
with new ideas. with na fixed convictions, and
prepared ta invcstigatc-we are mnuch mare
likeiy ta be successful than if we have same of
the persans who have been administering the
fisheries--no matter how faithfuliy-for some
years past, and who would carry on with the
ideas of thase years and trust ta Providence
that they might have mare success in the
future than they have had in the past. We
hope that will not he the spirit in which the
Commission will be constituted.
We know
what the American commissianers are iikely
ta do. We have scen what the Americans
have donc in Alaska, where they have really
restored the fisheries, which were depleted ta
a inuch greater extent than the sockeye
fisheries of British Columbia.
The Alaska
Von. Mr. TAYLOR.

fisheries have been restorcd chicfly through the
firma handiing of the situation by Commissioner O'Maliey of the United States. If we
have cammissianers of the same standing,
and if they are given some freedomn by the
Government and receive the samne support that
Commissioner O'Malley bas aiways received
from the United States Gavernment, we may
canfidently look for just as conspicuaus success in the Fraser River as bas been achieved
in Alaska.
Han. R. F. GREEN: Hanourable members,
it is not my purpose ta take more than a few
minutes of your time. 1 do not intend ta
enter inta a discussion of the demerits of iast
year's convention or the merits of the present
anc. I just wish to say that the fact is that
the run of the sockeye saimon in the Fraser
River bas heen depieted ta such an extent
that it bas become almost non-existent. The
causes, as bas heen said hy my honourahle
colicague (Hon. Mr. Taylor), are not quite
agrced upon. The probahility is that they
have heen variaus, and that among others is
that of ovcr-fishing.
The sockcye saimon, as a youngster, goes out
ta sea, and four ycars later it returns, presumahly hy the same route. In s0 doing it cames
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and first
strikes American waters. The Americans, with
their traps, have the first chance at the flsh;
and, as we do not permit traps, aur fishermen
cannot gath-er fish at the mauth of the Fraser
River in as great numbers as if there were
traps there. Undcr existing circumstances the
salmon did flot get into the spawning beds
in the head waters of the Fraser River, and the
henefit of anything that we did ta raise mare
fish and hring hack the catch wcnt ta aur
ncighbours ta the south. Therefore, for ycars
past, the Govcrnment of British Columbia,
heing unahie ta deal with the matter, have
been striving ta impress upon the Federal
Governme-nt the importance of making some
convention with the' American people, so that
this valuahle industry might rcturn ta samething like its past condition.
If we get the right commissioners under
this convention,. it will lbc possible fur thern
ta sec that it3 terms are carried out and that
the Can-adian people secure their share of the
fish; but unicss the matter is strictly regulated
the Americans, because the fish strike their
waters finit, wilI secure the .bulk of the
fish. 1 believe that this convention is a stcp
in the right direction; I believe that we are
gaing ta, have cammissioners who will look
after the int.erests of Canada, and I believe
it wiil nat be long before we 'begin ta enjoy

MAY 29, 1930
the fruits of the work of the Commission
and see the sockeye come back again in
great numbers to the Fraser River.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the Bill

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If any bonourable member of the Senate is desirous that
this Bill should go to committee in order that
some inquiry may be made into any of the
clauses, it will, of course, be my duty to move
accordingly.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I understand

CONSIDERED IN COMMIT1EE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beland in the Chair.
Sections 2 to 9, inclusive, were agreed to.

408

SENATE

On section 10-registration of manufacturing
or packing plants:
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honourable members, in the section of the country from which
I come we have perhaps half a dozen parties
who are extensively engaged in the production
of maple sugar. In addition, it is a common
practice for a great many farmers to produce
syrup and sugar in a small way for their own
uses. They do not make a business of this,
and their products are not for sale. Section
10 provides:
(a) Al manufacturing or packing plants shall
be registered by the Minister.
That means that anyone who produces maple
sugar or syrup, even in a small way, will be
obliged to register with the Minister.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If they produce for
their own uses?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
ception, sir, as I read it.

There is no ex-

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should think
that the registration would be necessary only
in cases where the product is intended for
sale.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
It says, "All
manufacturing or packing plants shall be
registered by the Minister."

On section 16-regulations:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The matter to
which my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) has referred may be dealt with, perhaps, under this section. It says the Minister
may make regulations prescribing certain
things.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have received from the Minister of Justice a proposed
amendment to be inserted as subsection 2 of
section 16. It reads:
All regulations made under this Act shall
fifteen days after the date of their publication
in the Canada Gazette have the qame force and
effect as if they had been included herein.
Before we pass to the consideration of that
amendment, I would direct the attention of
my aonourable friend (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
to paragraph (1), which provides that the
Minister may make regulations prescribing:Any means deemed by him to be necessary for
the carrying out of the provisions of this Act.
I should think that any regulations my
honourable friend desires may be made under
that clause.
The amendment was agreed to, and section
16, as amended, was agreed to.
Sections 17 to 20, inclusive, the preamble
and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That would not
apply to products for domestic use.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: That exception is
n'ot made. And paragraph (b) of the same
section says:
Any manufacturing or packing plant shipping
maple products from one province to another or
exporting such produets nust have a licence to
be issued by the Minister to permit of such
interprovincial or export business being carried
on.
It is a common practice for sorne farmers to
ship small amounts of maple sugar and s.yrup
to the Prairie Provinces. This Bill would
require them to have a licence, and I think
that would be too much red tape.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I shall draw
the attention of the Minister to the remarks
of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I have no objection to the regulations provided here, where
they are imposed upon those who are engaged
in the business of producing sugar and syrup
on a large scale.
Section 10 was agreed to.
Sections 11 to 15, inclusive, were agreed
to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

it becomes necessary, we shall have to delay
the House by such a discussion. 1 give notice
to that, effect to my honourable friend
opposite.
Before the Senate met this rnorning 1 had

were out of order. I have since looked up the

Hon.
what?

Mr. DANDURAND:

In regard

to

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In regard to al
matters. This information will be found at
page 1.59 of the Minutes of Proceedings. However, by virtue of the notice given by the
honourable gentleman, a motion is now in
order.
I amn going to say only a word or two in
answer to the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Murdock). 'Section 98 is not aimed at
labour bodies. We are ahl as sympathetie towards labour as the honourable gentleman or
any right-minded man in this country. This
provision is aimed at malcontents who want to
overthrow government, and they are noV al-ways of the habouring class. They are dreamers and idealists who want to bring about an
ideal state, flot by constitutional means, but
by way of revolution. Other people may be
desirous of accomplishing the same end, but
they want to do it by quiet, peaceful methods,
allowed .by the Iaws of this country and of the
other British Dominions. Some people in certain walks of life-I ar n ot referring to any
honourable gentleman opposite-are willing to
band together with people in a lower stratum
of life or political activity in order to accomplish their desires. 1 do not think there are
any such in this Parliament or in any legislative body in Canada.
The bonourable gentleman bas referred to
his connection with labour, and I have no
-doubt that it was a thoroughly honourable
one and helpful to himself and to the country;
but I think he is apt to be carried away by
the noisy, blatanýt element among those whom
he rapresents. In Canada we have the freest
system of government in the world, and everybody in the country, through the ordinary processes of law wbich obtain in this country, has
an opportunity to express bis views and to
make bis influence felt. As I said a moment
ago, this measure aimed, net at labour at ail,
but at people of an entirehy different chass. In
the Old Land the most revolutionary people,
or at least tbeir leaders, do not belong to the
labouring chass.
Sometimes the working
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

classes, because of a lack of education or of a
broad outlook, do not see tbings as a wbole,
and may be led away by certain movements;
but I venture to say that if you were to go to
Winnipeg you would find that the mai ority
of the labour men are interested mainly in
their work and their pay, and to them legislation of tbis kind is in no way objectionable.
Doubtless you can find in thiscountry, among
certain classes, immigrants wbo bave noit been
tboroughly aas.imil-ated. They have been accustomed to attempting to secure by force
wbat we secure by metbods of order and liberty. That is the class that is aimed at. 0f
course bere and tbere among tbe labouring
classes you wilh find professional agitation and
blatant leadersbip, neitber of wbich is beneficial te the cause of labour or the labouring
man himself.
I would suggest that if it be necessary-and
I trust it is not-we should deaI very
exhaustiively w&itj this seýction this moming.
I have given mny honourable friendtbe leader
of the Goveramant an intimation that if it
is necessary we shaHl talk out the proposed
amendrnent at this hate stage. This is not

was nothing heterodox in the action of nxy
honourable friend who is now moving the
amendment ýHûn. Mr. Murdock). After the
Committee of the Whole lias discussed a Bill,
adopted it without division, and reported it,
it i's quite logical and fair to bring a question
up again in order to, have the House register
its -opinion. I believe that it is quite propeT
to take a vote of the jury that lias just pronounced its verdict. Yesterday, when we came
out of Committee., one member ciesired to
record his vote. I do flot thinik his amendment should have been regarded as a sur-prise
motion, inasmudli as the constitution of the
jury seemed to, be, and should have been,
the samne as it was an hour before. Apparently
some members of the House who were interested in the Bill thouglit that the matter
had been settled. overlooking the fact that
the vote might be officially registered when
the Bill -came baïck to the Bouse.
My honourable friend appeals to us strongly
to maintain what lias been the policy of the
Senate on four or five previous occasions, and
says, "We may be obliged to discuss the
matter until the last minute." I know what
that means. 1 suggest to him that instead of
taking that course we should divide on the
amendment. I may say that it is my intention
to ask that a vote be regîstered on the section
to prohibit the publication of information on
horse-race betting. I shahl ask a colleague to
niove, after we have voted on the present
amendmcnt, that the section covering that
other point be reinstated. My honourable
fricnd (Hon. Mr. Willoughjby) will have plenty
of time to, put his mild threat into effect, because, even if the two amendments are carried, we shail stili have to dispose of the
motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 do not desire
to prolong the discussion. If my honourable

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is rather difficult to

important amendment, but I am quite in the

better informed before a vote is taken.
The amendHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment that is now proposed has for its object
the replacement in the Bill of a section rejected in Committee of the Whole yesterday.
The purpose of the section was to curb betting
on horse-races by forbidding the publication
of information concerning the winners of races,
and so on. If the section were adopted, it
would tend to restriet the betting to the enclosures where the races take place. It would
minimize the vicious effects of betting and restrain the indulgence of our people in games
of chance.

The motion for the third reading of the Bill
was agreed te, and the Bill was read the third
time, and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, there is now nothing left on our
Order Paper, and we are awaiting the pleasure
of the House of Commons. I was under the
impression that some legislation would reach
us by this time, but I am informed that certain measures which were on the Order Paper
in the other House have been dropped. So I
sha;ll simp-ly move that the House suspend its
sitting till half-past three.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What progress is being made in the other
House?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There seems te
be an understanding that prorogation will take
place this evening. Possibly I shall be able
to give more precise information when we
meet at half-past three.
At 1 o'clock the Senate took recess.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
leader of the Government has asked that we
take the vote without calling in the members
again. I have noticed that the doors have

your pleasure that the members should be

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Call in the members.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members of the Senate, I am happy to be able
to inform you that our labours are almost at
an end. I expect no further legislation
except the Supply Bill, which always reaches
us in the closing hours of the session. It is
probable tiha;t prorogation wil take place this
evening; but I doubt that it will be before 9
o'clock. I would suggest that we adjourn during pleasure, resolving to be near-by at halfpast seven or a quarter to eight in order to
admit the Supply Bill if it should come knocking at our door.

If any honourable member of the Senate
desires more than an hour for the discussion of
the Supply Bill-I am addressing particulatly
the leader facing me-I should be glad to hear
from him now.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is somewhat
difficult to say how long anyone may speak. I
find it diflicult to say how long I shall speak
myself. I do not wish to restrict anyone, but
as the Supply Bill is something over which
we have no control, I do not think we are
likely to require more than an hour. That
should be sufficient for members on this side
of the House at all events.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3
FIRST READING
Bill 347, an Act for granting to His Majesty
certain sums of money for the 'public service
of the financial year ending the 3tt March,
1931.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
read'ng of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I have in
my hands a copy of the Bill, which has just
been given the first reading, for granting to
His Majesty certain sums of money for the
publie service of the financial year ending the
31st of March, 193,1. The total sum requested,
based on the main estimates, is $213,127,180.71.
Section 3 of the Bill reads:
3. From and out of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund there may be paid and applied a sum not
exceeding in the whole twenty-one million one
hundred and one thousand nine hundred and
forty-four dollars and seventy-five cents towards
lefraying the several charges and expenses of
the public service. from the first day of April,
one thousand nine hundred and thirty, to the

thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine
hundred and thirty-one, not otherwise provided
for, and set forth in Schedule B to this Act.
There is the following declaratory statement in section 4:
4. And whereas there remained, on the thirtyfirst day of March, one thousand nine hundred
and thirty, unborrowed and negotiable of the
loans authorized by Parliament for the construction of public works and for general purposes,
the following sum:For public works and general purposes, $182,717,595.20.
And whereas it is necessary to make provision
for retiring maturing loans raised for war or
demobilization purposes and other naturing
loans and obligations of Canada;
Therefore it is declared and enacted, that the
Governor in Council may authorize the raising
of the sum above mentioned as required for the
purpose of retiring maturing loans raised for
war or demobilization purposes and other maturing loans and obligations of Canada, and for
public works and general purposes aforesaid,
respectively, under the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, and the sum so
raised shall form part of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund, out of which like sume shall be
applicable to the several purposes aforesaid,
under the Acts and provisions thereunto relating respectively.
I have not examined in detail the items that
make up the sums mentioned. They cover the
whole of the activities of the Government of
Canada, and have been closely scrutinized by
the members of the poppular Ohamber. On the
members of that Chamber lies the principal
responsibility for the levying and expenditure
of the amounts necessary to carry on the affairs
of the country. I believe they have done their
work in a very careful manner. No complaints
of any extravagance have come to my attention, and I think the expenditures offer no reasonable ground for criticism by this House. I
should like to quote the statement, which I
noticed in the press, of a high authority whose
duty it is to maintain special surveillance over
the actions of the Government: that an examination of the supplementary estimates indicates the exercise of great care and restraint in
their preparation, especially in view of the fact
that they have been braught down on the eve
of an elaction.

·

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
senators, as the honourable leader of the Government has intimated, we in this House have
not the right to initiate aýppropriations or expenditures. Our power is limited to the
approval or rejection of Bills for these purposes that come to us from the other Chamber.
Therefore our discussion on appropriation
Bills usually occupies but a little time. As of
course we would not exercise our power of

SENATE
rejection except under very unusual oircumstances, it is perhaps incumbent upon me
to be brief in my remarks.
I saw the Bill for the first time a few
moments ago, when it was laid on my desk,
but I had previously examined some of the
figures that aire ineluded in it. Last year
the total of the main and supplementary estimates was, I think, about $404,000,000. This
year the main estimates total $399,000,000;
and in addition there are two lists of supplementary estimates, one of more than $11,500,000 and another of approximately $9,500,000, making an aggregate nf about $420,000,000. So we have a considerable increase as
compared with last year.
We in Canada are faced with rising expenditure and falling revenue, a situation which we
all regret. There bas been a drop in our
national revenue of nearly $6,000,000 in one
month. The reduction of one per cent in the
business tax resulted in a decrease in receipts
for one month of about $1,500,000. I am not
complaining that the business tax was reduced; I think it never should have been
imposed. It is estimated that we shall suffer
a loss in revenue ni about $10,000,000 a year,
perhaps more, on account of the prohibition
of clearances of liquor to the United States,
in accordance with the Liquor Expert Bill
whieh we passed at this session. I am afraid
that we have net reached the end of increasing expenditures accompanied by a decline
in our trade. I am net attempting to say
that tc Government of the day is wholly responsibe for the business dopression throughout the country. That is to a large extent,
but not entirely, due to world conditions.
One's optimisn certainly would net be justifid if one wcre to forecast for the present
year abounding revenues and increasing trade.
For some time past we have been experiencing unemployment on such a large scale as
was never knon before in my lifetime.
The honourable gent.leman's remarks implied

that

the stuppleuentnry

estimates are

net sufficiently large to indicaite they were
prepared with an eye to an impend'ing election. He is a well known financier, aceustomed to dealing with large sums. To some
honourable nemabers who, like myself, are
possesscd of but moderate means, seme of
the items in the supplementary estimates are
so large as te be cloarly indicative of the
approach of an election.

It is extraHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ordinary that the Minister nf Finance overlooked even that amount for Saskatchewan
when preparing his main estimates.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The Miniister
of Finance will have lots of things to account
for when he goes baek o Saskathewan. I
had the honour of being a member of the
Legislature of Saskatehewan when the present
Minister of Finance first entered that House.
Early in his politicul career he was an ardent
adivocate of fre trade. In common with his
oolteague, the present Minister of Railways,
he has in days gone by made tube welkin ring
with the cry for free trade. I am glad to
know that the point of view of the Minister
of Finanice has broadened in keeping with
bis subsequent experiences in wider fields. He
has found that there are other things than
free tade to talik about. In former days he
was excclled as an advocate of extrene free
trade only by the present Minister nf Railwa.ys, who, when he was the leader of the
Progressives, was accustomed to scourge with
scorpions everyone who favoured protection.
I do not speak unkind'ly of these honourable
gentlemen; I simply wishb to show the change
that has occurred in their attitudes with regard to the tariff. It is pleasant to find the
Minister of Finance bringing in a protective
tariff.
I have always believed in adequate protection for the growing industries of · his
t
country; but I realize, as I have stated before
in this House, that a policy of protection
is perhaps less advantageous to thbose parts of

MAY 30, 1930
standing controveroy have been successfully
adjuoted. In several oither directions legislation of far-reaching significance has been
enacted.
It is a source of particular satisfaction that
the publie accounts of the fiscal year recently
ended again diaclose a large surplus and that
it has again been possible to effect further
material reductions in taxation, as well as a
further reduction in the national debt.
Especi.ally gra.tifying is the f act that, in continuance of the policy of endeavouring to
remove aIl substanitial difficulties in the relations between the Dominion and the Provinces,
a settlement of the long-standing controversies
respecting the Natural Re6soures of the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta
has been effected. 'The several agreements have
received your approval, as wtell as the approval
of the Provincial Legislatures. Approval haa
also been given to the agreement reached with
the Province of British Columbia concerning
the restoration to the province of the lands
comprising what is known as the railway belt
and Peace River blojck.
The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Maritime Claims have been further
implemented by the legielation which bias been
enaoted with respect to the coal and iron and
steel industries.
Extensive and compréhensive revisions have
been made in tlie Custome Tariff with a view
to bringing certain schedules more into lime
with modern business requirements, and exigting
economic conditions. Material and broad extensions have been made in the Britishi Preferential
Tariff schedules, as well as ather adjustments
which it isr believed will serve to promote a
larger measure of reciprocal trade between the
compmnent parts of the British Empire and
with other countries.
The interest which lias been evinced during
the session in ahl matters affecting ex-service
men demonstrates once more thet Canada stands
in the forefriont in continued appreciation of
hier soldier-cltizens and their dependents. The
legislation. providing «Ilowaances for veterans
who may be unemployable as a result of nonpensionable disahulitieg, the amended procedure
and methodai of administration under the
Pensions Act, the extension of time to
applicants under the Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act, and the more liberal treatment;
accorded soldier settlers, will bring a mucli
sughlt for relief to numerous individuals and
homes.
The Fair Wages and Eight Hour Day Act
givea statutory effect to the fair wages policy
whicli, for some years past, lias been observed
on construction work under public contract.
It provide aloo for the observance on such
work of an eight hour day. The beneflts of
this legislation, both as to wiages and hours,
have been extended, under Government policy,
to workmnen employed on construction work by
the Government itseif. The princip.le of the
eiglit hour working dtay lias also been made
applicable by the Goverment to employees in
the public service.
To aid in -the solution of the problemn of
seasonal. unemploymient, provision lias been
macde for holding at an early date a conference of Dominion and Provincial governments,
of representatives of municipalities, of transportation companies, and of industrial and
labour associations, to consider methods of
cooperation in furthering continnous emýploy-

421

nment throughout Canada during the winter
mon'ths.
A Federai-Provincial Coeiference for the purpose of furthering cooperaition between the
Dominion Government and the goerments of
the several Provinces of Canada en matters
perîtaining to immigration hu also been
arranged.
The consolidation of the Canada Grain Act
in accordance with the recommendations of the
Standing Com.mittee of the House of Commons
on Agriculture, the provision made for increase-d storage facilities for grain., as well as
the inquiry into the promotion of the live
stock induotry of Canada for which provision
has also been miade, should prove of substantial
benefit to the agricultural induatry.
To eSure the development of the fisheries
resources of the Domindon and of the industries based thereon, provision has been made
for the appointment of a Minister of the Crown
to preside over a separate Departmnent. of
Fisheries.
Conventions with the United States for the
protection and extension of the sockeye salinon.
fisheries and for the preservation of the halibut
fisheries of the Paciflc Coast have received
approvial.
Forward steps in -the field of international
relations have been taken by the s isture of
the Treaty for Reduction of Naval Afrnijent,
by the exitension of arbitration through theacceptance of the Optional Clause, and by the
revision of the Statute of the Permanent Court
of International Justice, ail of which measures
have received your approval.
Ameudments to the Dominion Elections Act
have been made which should furither ensure
fairneas and the avoidance of partizanship in
the adiministration of our electoral systeni.
Among other enaatmente of the session have
been important amendanents to the Oompanies
Act, the Expert Act, and the Criminal Code.
Members of the Hlouse of Communs:
I t'hiank yon for the supplies granted for the
carrying on of the public service» of the
Dominion.
Ioncurable Members of the Senaite:
Members of the House of Commons:
in the opinin of My Ministers, it is desirable that he judgmen't of the people upon the
questions which now engage public attention
should be obitbained during the course of the
present year. In order to permit of Canada
being represented at the Imperial Conference
and the Imperial Economic Conference, which
open their proceedings in London, on September
30, and to afford to Ministers of the Crown
as ample an opportunity as may be posible
to prepare for the important work of these
Coniferences, iit has been deemed advieable that
the present Parliament should be dissolved
without delay, and the day of polling fixed for
the earlieet date poible aifter dissolution. I
have, acorodingly, th anmoumce my intention of
causing Parliament to be disoolved imniediately
f ollowin g prorogation.
In takin leave of you at -this time and
under these circunistances, 1 diesire to express
the unqualifled. pleasure which I have derived
from my association with you throughout thie
four sessions of this the Sixteenth Parliament
of Canada. I pray that upon your labours the
blessing of Divine Providence may be abundantly beotowed.
